• Appeals process to continue until 10th, final lists of candidates to be published on April 18
• Official says institutions have tied commission’s hands by granting stays in contempt proceedings
ISLAMABAD: A day after the Supreme Court overruled the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and ordered it to hold elections to the Punjab Assembly on May 14, the commission announc­­ed the schedule for the polls.
Although it complied with the court’s order, the ECP expressed concerns over the ‘transgression’ into its constitutional domain and claimed that it had been made a “punching bag” by state institutions.
The revised schedule was issued in a notification, a copy of which is available with Dawn, citing the apex court’s order.
The commission stated that candidates had already filed their nomination papers and their scrutiny was completed before the ECP delayed the polls till October 8 in March. As per the revised schedule, the process will start from appeals against acceptance or rejection of nomination papers which can be filed by April 10, while the appellate tribunal will decide the appeals by April 17.
Revised lists of candidates for each constituency will be published on April 18, while candidates can withdraw their nominations by April 19.
Election symbols to the contesting candidates will be allotted on April 20, while polling for 297 general seats of the provincial assembly will be held on May 14.
‘Punching bag’
The ECP announced the schedule after holding a meeting, chaired by Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja, on Wednesday. In its verdict, the court had not only ordered the ECP to hold elections, but also issued a schedule and directed the commission to submit a compliance report by April 11.
 
 

However, even the explicit directives of the apex court have so far failed to clear the cloud of uncertainty looming over the polls. Since yesterday, the ruling coalition has minced no words in expressing its disapproval of the apex court’s verdict and refused to abide by it. There is still no clarity on whether the requisite funds and security personnel for holding the elections would be provided to the ECP or not.
Reacting to the apex court’s decision, a senior official of the ECP said the commission’s constitutional mandate to hold free, fair and transparent elections was under attack and the writ of the commission had been weakened, the official added.
While talking to Dawn, the official regretted that the commission had been made “a punching bag” by different institutions.
“Conspiracies have been hatched and the ECP, along with its head have been publicly ridiculed,” he remarked.
He added that the Elections Act, 2017 has empowered the commission to try those involved in contempt of the ECP. But the subsequent action of institutions diluted the commission’s authority.
A malignant campaign was launched against the commission and its head who, the official claimed, also received written threats.
The official added that show-cause notices were issued over contemptuous remarks and the use of intemperate language against the ECP. “But instead of recognising the constitutional position of the ECP, the courts granted stays against the notices.”
“We were told to continue with the proceedings, but restrained from passing a final order,” he said.
The arrest warrants of those accused of contempt were suspended, weakening the constitutional position of the ECP, the official told Dawn.
He said those who allegedly committed the contempt did not appear before the bench as they were “certain of the support from certain quarters”.
“A constitutional institution was being made helpless under a preconceived plan, putting a question mark on the holding of fair and transparent elections”, he remarked.
Referring to the Daska by-poll in February 2021, the official added that 20 presiding officers disappeared under a plan to manipulate the poll results.
He added that the ECP took a historic decision to uphold the transparency of elections and make bureaucracy answerable to the commission.
He recalled that two separate inquiries found that senior police and district administration officials knew “what was going on but still allowed the scheme to unfold”.
One of the inquiries found that election officials and government functionaries acted as “puppets” during the saga.
The official said action was initiated against the culprits, but instead of supporting the commission, other institutions suspended the order and granted stays.

1,"Coalition rejects SC order, vows to put up resistance on all forums",Considers filing reference against three SC judges who announced polls verdict.,"• Looks to secure NA endorsement against top court’s decision
• Considers filing reference against three SC judges who announced polls verdict
ISLAMABAD: Categorically rejecting a recent decision of a three-member bench of the Supreme Court in the Punjab elections delay case, the ruling coalition on Wednesday devised a counter-move to resist the verdict on all forums, including the parliament, where a resolution is likely to be tabled on Thursday (today) to endorse the government’s stance.
The coalition partners have also considered filing a reference against the three judges of the apex court — Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial, Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Munib Akhtar — who were part of the bench that on Tuesday fixed May 14 as the date for polls in Punjab after setting aside an Election Commission order.
The decisions were made in an important meeting presided over by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and attended by the heads of ruling parties.
The virtual meeting, which thoroughly reviewed the decision of the apex court, was attended by PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif from London, former president Asif Ali Zardari, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman.
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar and other members of the federal cabinet also attended.
“Members of the National Assembly had debated the issue in the ongoing session and a resolution had already been passed, while another resolution would be tabled in the house” on Thursday, the prime minister said in his opening remarks.
“The purpose behind holding the meeting of coalition parties is to mull over the situation and evolve a solid response,” he added.
Describing the decision of the three-member Supreme Court bench as “a mockery of the Constitution and laws” of the country, the premier said it could not be implemented.
The three-member bench had rejected the appeal to form a full court and similarly, political parties’ pleas were also rejected, he added.
In its decision on Tuesday, the three-judge bench headed by CJP Bandial not only bound the ECP to hold elections in Punjab on May 14 but directed the government to arrange the required funds of Rs21 billion and ensure foolproof security for the polls.
The prime minister elaborated that last week, they held a detailed meeting, followed by two cabinet meetings and parliamentary meetings over the evolving situation.
Meanwhile, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah on Wednesday told Shahzaib Khanzada of Geo News the meeting endorsed that the verdict of the three-member bench was a decision of minority judges as four judges of the Supreme Court had already given their judgement against taking suo motu notice in the case.
“The verdict of four judges is the real decision,” he added.
“Today’s meeting decided that the government’s stance (regarding the non-implementation of three judges’ decision) will be presented before the National Assembly on Thursday and seek the endorsement of the parliament,” Mr Sanaullah said.
He said the government’s legal team gave a detailed briefing to the coalition partners and termed the decision of the three-member bench “controversial, incomplete and non-implementable”.
The meeting, he said, decided that the government would never bear any “insult” and “disrespect of the parliament”.
Asked if the government would file a reference against three judges in the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC), the interior minister said that the option was considered in the meeting but a final decision might be taken in upcoming meetings.
To a question that the government’s rejection of the apex court’s decision by passing a resolution in the National Assembly might set a wrong precedent, the minister said that not all decisions of the Supreme Court could be challenged in the parliament and the one the government was opposing was in fact a verdict of minority and not by majority judges.
“It is a unique case in which a nine-member bench was formed first and was later reduced to seven, five, four and at last three judges,” he added.
Asked that the Supreme Court could remove the entire federal cabinet, including the prime minister, for contempt of court, Mr Sanaullah said: “If this will be the case, the court will have to remove the entire parliament because we are going to endorse our stance from the parliament.”

2,‘Militant commander’ among eight killed in S. Waziristan,PESHAWAR: A key militant commander and his seven associates were killed during an intelligence-based operation (IBO)...,"PESHAWAR: A key militant commander and his seven associates were killed during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) carried out by security forces in the Shinwarsak area of South Waziristan tribal district, on Wednesday.
A sepoy of Pakistan Army embraced martyrdom while four others, including two officers, sustained injuries during the exchange of fire with militants, confirmed the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
Local officials said that the eight gunned down were involved in militant activities against security forces and killing of innocent citizens.
Security forces conducted the IBO in the Shinwarsak general area during which an intense exchange of fire took place, said the ISPR statement.
“The security forces effectively engaged the militants’ location and eight militants, including a militant commander Jan Mohammad alias Chargh, were killed,” it said, adding that weapons and ammunition were recovered from the killed terrorists.
“However, during intense exchange of fire, 31-year-old Sepoy Hamid Rasool, a resident of district Rawalpindi, having fought gallantly, embrac­­ed martyrdom while another four personnel, including two officers, got injured.”
Security forces of Pakistan are determined to eliminate the menace of terrorism and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers further strengthen our resolve, the statement read.
Last month, five militants were killed by security forces in IBOs carried out in North and South Waziristan districts.
“On March 10, IBOs were conducted by security forces in North and South Waziristan districts. During conduct of the operations, five terrorists were killed after intense fire exchange,” the ISPR statement read, adding that weapons, ammunition and a “large quantity of equipment” were also recovered from them.

3,PTI to de-seat ministers if they reject SC ruling,"PTI would file a reference in the ECP for disqualification of ministers if they did not disown the cabinet’s statement, says Fawad.","ISLAMABAD: A day after the federal cabinet denounced the court order that directed for elections on May 14, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) asked the ministers — who attended the meeting — to distance themselves from the cabinet declaration unless they wanted disqualification proceedings under Article 63-A.
During a media talk in Lahore, PTI spokesperson Fawad Chaudhry said refuting the verdict of the top court was akin to treason and added the PTI would file a reference in the Election Commission under Article 63-A for disqualification of ministers if they did not disown the cabinet’s statement.
Mr Chaudhry said the Insaf Lawyers Forum (ILF) has sought a list of cabinet members who attended the meeting to proceed against them under Article 63-A.
He said a request will be made to de-seat the ministers, as they had allegedly violated articles 2A and 68 and other “fundamental articles” of the Constitution.
The former information minister also said the PTI would make efforts to get the membership of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz cancelled since a “convicted person [Nawaz] was running the party from abroad”.
 
 

“It is against the Constitution of Pakistan and the Election Act. Additionally, Nawaz Sharif is trying to conspire against the Supreme Court’s judges,” he alleged.
Mr Chaudhry said the ECP and the government were bound by the timelines — such as date for polling – given in the Supreme Court verdict.
Commenting on the joint investigation team formed to probe violence at Zaman Park, the PTI leader alleged that interim Chief Minister Mohsin Naqvi, IG Usman Anwar and CCPO Bilal Siddique Kamyana were prime suspects in the murder of Zille Shah. “It will be unfair to present ourselves before them for investigation,” he said, adding that this JIT was not approved by the cabinet. “The case is sub judice now and the JIT cannot work till the decision of the court,” he added.
Addressing the cases against Imran Khan and PTI leadership, he said that the political rivals of the PTI could “stoop to any limit” to victimise the major opposition party.
PTI offers dialogue
A separate statement issued by the PTI spokesperson, however, offered an olive branch to the government and said that instead of locking horns with the top court, the government should talk to the PTI to pave way for general elections.
Mr Chaudhry said the ECP’s decision of notifying the Punjab polls date and the caretaker government’s assurance for the implementation of the court decision were “steps in the right direction”.
The PTI leader urged the ruling parties to refrain from confrontation with the apex court in the wake of the polls ruling. Fawad Chaudhry said that economic problems necessitated the need to de-escalate the political temperature while calling for polls in the country to put an end to the uncertain situation prevalent in the country.

4,FIA fails to prove Imran’s link with prohibited funding,IHC dismisses plea seeking revocation of PTI chief’s pre-arrest bail.,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has observed that the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) could not provide evidence to connect former prime minister Imran Khan with the prohibited funding his party is said to have received.
In a detailed judgement issued on Wednesday, the division bench comprising Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani and Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri held that the FIA could not produce “sufficient evidence” in support of its request seeking the cancellation of Mr Khan’s bail.
Earlier, pre-arrest bail was granted to Mr Khan by a trial court in the prohibited funding case.
The FIA counsel argued that during inquiry it had transpired that Arif Masood Naqvi, owner of M/s Wootton Cricket Limited (WCL), UAE (registered in Cayman Islands), had transferred ill-gotten money to the tune of $2.12 million to a UBL account.

IHC dismisses plea seeking revocation of PTI chief’s pre-arrest bail

He said Mr Naqvi, the founder-owner of Abraaj Group, UAE, was imposed with a penalty by the Dubai Financial Services Authority for carrying out unauthorised activities in the Dubai International Financial Centre and misusing the investors’ money. Mr Naqvi is also facing trial in UK and USA for defrauding investors, but PTI submitted an affidavit of Mr Naqvi to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) stating that all the amounts collected in the WCL’s accounts were transferred to the party’s account in Pakistan.
The counsel argued that the affidavit was found to be false and forged while signatories and beneficiaries of the UBL account are Mr Khan and nine others. However, when the amount was transacted to the PTI’s account, 12 STRs (suspicious transaction reports) had to be reported by the UBL to the authorities concerned, but they had not performed their duties.
He alleged that UBL had not only facilitated these suspicious/illegal transactions but also allowed the ‘internet merchant acquiring agreement’ changing the account’s title to “Naya Pakistan” of the above referred PEP (politically exposed person’s) UBL account.
The FIA’s lawyer claimed that trial court had granted the pre-arrest bail to Mr Khan without due deliberations.
The court observed that the FIR only reflects two eventualities — one, Mr Naqvi has given an affidavit to the ECP regarding the foreign currency transferred into the PTI’s account but the said affidavit has been proved to be false/forged as two more transactions were made from WCL to two different accounts in Pakistan in May 2013. The court noted that this has nothing to do with Mr Khan’s case as the FIA can investigate that the amount transacted by Mr Naqvi is ill-gotten money and his affidavit was false but both these aspects were not probed till date.
“The second element, which was highlighted in the entire record, is the allegation against bank’s officials who have allegedly not reported regarding 12 CTRs/STRs to the concerned authorities despite receiving of huge amount in US$ in the PTI’s account which reflects that matter should fall within the mandate of State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) being master regulator under SBP Act, 1956”, stated the court order.
The FIA failed to demonstrate “any of the regulation of the SBP where signatories of account in any scheduled bank are liable to prosecution,” it noted.
As regards the allegation of changing PTI’s account with ‘Naya Pakistan’, the court ruled that it was not an offence at all.
The bench has perused the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947 and noted that prosecution “has failed to demonstrate the requirements of Section 19 of FERA, 1947 [complied with] prior to the registration of FIR, where only authorised person on behalf of Federal Government or the State Bank supported by a statement on oath can represent that any contravention of provision of this Act has been committed”.
The bench expressed surprise over the conduct of SBP officials, who have not yet inquired regarding the bank transactions being the master regulator, nor declared any of the banking transaction as illegal, neither IO has ever recorded the statement of any of the official of SBP through which it could be demonstrated that any bank rules, regulations or circulars have been violated.
With regards to the contention of prosecution that Mr Khan has not yet joined the inquiry, the court noted that this could not be the reason for bail cancellation.
The bench subsequently dismissed the petition.

5,"Probes into fundamental rights issues are within its purview, SC holds","If dissatisfied, court says it will form judicial commission for Arshad Sharif case","ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court has held that it has the power in its constitutional jurisdiction to monitor investigations into matters affecting the fundamental rights of the public at large.
“We are further strengthened in this view by our own jurisprudence which affirms that the court has the power in its constitutional jurisdiction to monitor, as opposed to supervising, investigations into matters affecting the fundamental rights of the public at large,” observed a four-page Supreme Court order after the March 17 hearing. Headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial, the court had taken up suo motu hearing in the killing of journalist Arshad Sharif who was shot dead in Kenya last year.
The Supreme Court made these remarks by relying on the 2010 Bank of Punjab versus Haris Steel Industries (Pvt) judgement. The observation came when senior counsel Shahzad Aziz Siddiqui, representing the mother of the slain journalist, had pleaded that since the Special Joint Investigation Team (SJIT) has been formed to investigate the murder, the court’s supervision of the investigation, though bona fide, was impermissible.
To fortify his contention, the counsel had relied on the 1971 Shahnaz Begum versus Judges of the High Court of Sindh and Balochistan in which it was held that the high court has no power under section 561-A of the CrPC to interfere with police investigations into criminal offences. But if an investigation is launched mala fide or is clearly beyond the jurisdiction of the investigating agencies concerned then it may be possible for the action of the investigating agencies to be corrected by a proper proceeding.

If dissatisfied, court says it will form judicial commission for Arshad Sharif case

The March 17 order said the Supreme Court has perused the judgement cited and was of the view that the case cited was not applicable to the present matter since it was delivered on a completely different factual matrix.
‘Question of public importance’
The apex court said it was not disputed by any party before the court that the present suo motu raises important questions of public importance and has a direct nexus with the fundamental rights of the journalist community and the people.
Indeed the Dec 5, 2022 office note, which became the basis of the process for the present suo motu notice recalled how after the murder of Arshad Sharif on Oct 23, 2022, more than 5,000 letters from journalists and the general public seeking the court’s scrutiny of the matter were received, the order said.
Nevertheless, the court exercised restraint and took notice on Dec 6, 2022, after it had become evident that scant progress had been made regarding the investigation into the murder. The sole purpose was to secure an independent and transparent investigation into the murder of Arshad Sharif, an objective to which it is committed, the order explained.
The court appreciates that the present matter is a sensitive one which spans multiple foreign jurisdictions. Consequently, expecting prompt results as might have been possible if the investigation was confined within the territorial limits of Pakistan may not be realistic, the ruling added.
However the court is also concerned that progress in the investigation has stalled in the past few months, the order said, adding three weeks were earlier given to the government and the investigation team to demonstrate their earnestness in advancing the investigation.
Failure to satisfy the court that all efforts were being expended to accelerate the investigation may compel the Supreme Court to consider constituting a judicial commission for investigating the murder of Arshad Sharif, the order said.
It added that on his part, Additional Attorney General Chaudhry Aamir Rehman was directed to identify the correct process for forwarding Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA) requests to the government of Kenya under the Kenyan Mutual Legal Assistance Act 2011 and to inform the court once a response was received from the Kenyan authorities on the amended MLA request of Feb 22, 2023.

6,"Analysis: Why flour is now dearer than human life, dignity","Thousands of people, especially women, have been braving kilometres-long queues for hours just to receive a 10kg bag of flour."," 

Mill owner claims those not registered with BISP tend to cause mischief in bid to make off with free flour bags they aren’t otherwise eligible for.—White Star

PUNJAB’S free flour scheme has not only been humiliating for the unfortunate; it has, perhaps for the first time, exposed the true scale of the poverty endemic in the province.
Thousands of people, especially women, have been braving kilometres-long queues for hours just to receive a 10kg bag of flour, which was available for Rs1,156 before Ramazan.
The police and the district administration have tried their hand at controlling the crowds, but the sheer number of people and their willingness to risk everything for free flour is not something the state has been able to hold off.
“Violence at the distribution points will not go away,” explains Majid Abdullah, a miller from Lahore.
“The [free flour distribution] plan will last a month, whereas poverty is permanent. Everyone wants to benefit as much as they can while the programme lasts. Those registered with the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) know they will ultimately get flour, albeit with some delay. Those who are not registered know they have to seize chances by creating mischief. They come with a plan: create mayhem and run away with bags in the confusion that follows.”
Tariq Suleman, a sociologist, makes a different point. “Thousands of people converge daily, stand in queues for hours at the cost of their dignity and social respect; face the prospect of violence, which can even cost them their lives; and still they take that chance on a daily basis. What does it tell us? It shows us that, right now, a bag of free flour overrides all other considerations for hundreds of thousands in each city of the province. This is alarming, both politically and socially. It must not go unnoticed.”
“We all knew that poverty exists and persists, but the sheer scale of misery which has surfaced with this flour distribution scheme is alarming,” says Farooq Tariq, a leader of the Pakistan Workers Party.
“Punjab says it has distributed close to three million bags so far, but the queues are getting longer by the day. Where are these people coming from? People like us have been warning about destitution, but the sheer scale is enormous and can set our entire society on fire if ignored,” he warns.
“The weaknesses in the execution show that the scheme was put together without thinking it through,” a former bureaucrat, who wishes not to be named, points out.
“Now, the governments — both the federal (the originator of the idea) and the provincial (a reluctant follower) — cannot back out even if they want to. They have no option but to press on — hoping they will be proven right in the end. The government could have simply sent money directly to the BISP-registered poor and saved itself huge political, administrative and human costs,” he suggests.
Comparing the flour distribution scheme to the Ehsaas Ration Programme, Dr Sania Nishter, who championed social safety nets under the previous PTI administration, explains: “It took months of meticulous work to design, pilot and scale up the end-to-end digital Ehsaas Rashan Riayat. The programme was designed as a ‘system’ to also be purposed for the Ramzan package every year and could have been scaled up province-wide almost instantly. However, the [PDM] government decided to shut it down and hastily put together the unsustainable free atta scheme, which is far from being well-designed.”
“Ehsaas Rashan was designed to prioritise customers’ dignity and provide choices, with them being able to visit retail stores in their neighbourhoods throughout the month. They could choose any merchant that was most convenient for them; they could purchase any quantity given their monthly subsidy limit. As a result, there are no known instances of mobs, chaos, violence, or deaths in the disbursement of the Ehsaas Rashan.”
Counting other attributes, Dr Sania says only beneficiaries who had passed through a rigorous verification pipeline, including Nadra checks, PITB wealth filter checks and PMD mobile phone and CNIC match checks, could receive the Ehsaas Rashan subsidy. “Given the haste and the lack of fraud controls built into the programme design, the atta scheme is susceptible to fraud, especially in view of an already collusive atta supply chain.”
Meanwhile, the poor, the elderly, the weak and women are being forced to take dangerous risks. Consistent media reports suggest that the jostling starts as soon as the first hopefuls show up at distribution centres early morning. The jostling soon devolves into brawls as people press their way to trucks, and bags start to be tossed willy-nilly to the sea of outstretched hands.
“I am completely at a loss as I try to understand what the PML-N government tried to achieve through the scheme,” states a former official of the Planning Division. “There has been so much bad press. The PML-N, which is now in its fourth stint in government, should have known better,” he says, shaking his head.
