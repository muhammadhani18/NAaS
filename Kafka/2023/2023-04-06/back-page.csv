0,Footprints: Something fishy,"""It can be beneficial from a commercial point of view for traders, but not fishermen,” laments Mallah, a fisherman.","THE Manchhar Lake is sparkling and calm as fishermen venture deep into the its waters, in anticipation of a decent catch. Several motor boats are anchored near a poorly-maintained harbour. The lake, luckily, has received plenty of freshwater last year, though at the cost of disaster across Sindh in the shape of catastrophic floods triggered by heavy rainfall in Balochistan and upper Sindh.
This harbour, situated at Bund Manchhar or RD-62 of embankment, is one of the multiple points set up at and around the lake to transport the catch of the day to the market. Fishermen here are passing boxes to colleagues, to be loaded in vehicles that start lining the bund during the course of the day.
A worker has just finished putting ice on fish in a large icebox. This is spoilt fish, he says when I ask him about it, destined to end up as poultry feed in Karachi.
Good times, bad times
 
 

Generally, fishermen have been euphoric since last year as the lake received more water flows in 2022’s floods than in 2010. However, Maula Bux Mallah, a fisherman by profession, sits in a pensive mood at his small grocery shop located near the harbour.
“They [his fellow fishermen] are catching young fish of all species, thus killing them even before they grow in size and weight. It can be beneficial from a commercial point of view for traders, but not fishermen,” he tells me. According to him, larger fish spawn had entered the lake last year through floodwaters coming from Balochistan and torrents from the lake’s catchment area.
“Fish need time to survive and gain health to be used for food. It is a disservice to the lake if we catch the small fish. But who cares,” he rues.
Showing his discontent, he presses the point: “We have fish species aplenty since September 2022. Fish spawn should not be culled in the name of the day’s catch,” he says, lamenting that the practice will translate into economic losses for the fishermen.
He is not wrong; over the past four decades, fish production has dropped considerably. “As per fisheries rules, catching small-size fish is an offence,” observes Mustafa Mirani, a representative of the Pakistan Fisherfolk Forum.
According to Mallah, fishermen mix soil intentionally with fish to give it an unclean look to make it seem unfit for the dinner table. “All these species will have a 7kg-8kg weight easily if allowed to survive, but mohanas [fishermen] are selling them for a price as low as Rs25-Rs30 per kilo under the very nose of fisheries officials.”
The lake’s ecology, too, has been affected by toxic effluent from the Main Nara Valley Drain (MNVD) or Right Bank Outfall Drain-I, over the past two decades. MNVD empties effluent in the lake throughout the year.
For centuries, families of mohanas have been spending their lives on the lake in floating wooden boathouses, which dot the waters. But the destruction of Manchhar’s ecosystem has led to a drastic decline in fish production and many families have now migrated to other areas with wetlands and freshwater bodies.
Selling short
Lake conservation activist Maula Bux has been leading the Manchhar Bachao Tehreek for a long time.
A kilo of morkahi fish can be sold for Rs250 and thelli for Rs200 to Rs300 per kilo. Price-wise, it is a similar story with the raau or jarka species. “Fish spawn is now sold for Rs20 per kilo and five to six pieces make a kilogram,” he claims.
Hyder Mallah, another fisherman, concurred with Bux that undersized species are being caught nonstop. For instance, he said a maund is sold for Rs1,200, which can easily go for Rs100,000 if the fish are allowed to survive for a year, making them healthy, nutritious and delicious.
“Some say fishermen are in the debt of traders and they are selling the catch for cheaper rates,” he says.
“Since nobody questions them, they catch fish with impunity. They [fishermen] are obviously influential,” he asserted, implying that the lake falls in the Sindh chief minister’s constituency, and thus the fisheries department tends to look the other way while this activity goes unchecked.
From the department’s viewpoint, it is mostly wild fish — locally known as talabiya — that is being caught by fishermen for poultry feed trade.
“Thanks to a larger wild fish catch, which is used in poultry as value addition, consumers can avail inexpensive chicken meat, otherwise meat will have been sold for Rs2,000 per kilo as soybean that is used in poultry feed is not imported nowadays,” argues Sindh Fisheries DG Dr Mir Allahdad Talpur.
“Manchhar is not a freshwater lake anymore as effluent discharge has changed its chemistry. We don’t opt for stocking [throwing fish seed] in the lake due to untreated effluent disposal”, he said.
Bux, however, insists that he has urged fisheries officers, including Dr Talpur to take cognisance of the issue. What becomes of the fish, only time will tell.

1,Over 350 held in Israeli raid on Al-Aqsa,"12 Palestinians injured as police beat people inside mosque; US, Arab League and China express alarm","

Jerusalem: Repressive Israeli police violently drag a Palestinian woman from the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, on Wednesday. Over 350 people were arrested and a dozen injured after Tel Aviv sent forces into the compound to clear worshippers from one of Islam’s holiest sites, during the month of Ramazan.—Reuters

 
GAZA: Repressive Israeli police raided the Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem before dawn on Wednesday and arrested over 350 people as Tel Aviv claimed it was acting against Palestinians who had barricaded themselves inside, leading to violence against worshippers and triggering an exchange of crossborder fire.
The incident comes during the holy month of Ramazan and on the eve of the Jewish Passover, stoking fears of further violence at the mosque compound.
Palestinian militants fired at least nine rockets from Gaza into Israel, prompting air strikes from Israel which hit what it claimed were weapon production sites for Hamas, which controls the blockaded coastal enclave.
Hamas did not claim responsibility for the rocket attacks, but said they were a response to the raid on Al-Aqsa.

12 Palestinians injured as police beat people inside mosque; US, Arab League and China express alarm

Ground-shaking explosions from the airstrikes rocked Gaza and witnesses said Israeli tanks also shelled Hamas positions.
“We are not interested in an escalation but we are ready for any scenario,” Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said.
The Al-Aqsa compound in Jerusalem’s Old City is Islam’s third holiest site and tens of thousands come to pray there during Ramazan. It is also Judaism’s most sacred site, revered as Temple Mount, a vestige of the two biblical Jewish temples.
The Palestinian Red Crescent said 12 Palestinians had sustained injuries during the raid, including from rubber-tipped bullets and beatings, in clashes with police. It said Israeli forces had prevented its medics from reaching the area.
“In the yard to the eastern part of the compound, the police fired tear gas and stun grenades,” said Fahmi Abbas, a worshipper who was at the mosque when the raid occurred. “Then they stormed in and started beating everyone.”
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the situation had been caused by “extremists” who barricaded themselves inside the mosque with weapons, stones and fireworks.
Videos circulating on social media, which could not be independently verified, showed fireworks going off and police beating people inside one of the mosque buildings. Police video showed police entering the building while fire crackers exploded in the darkness.
“I was sitting on a chair reciting (the Holy Quran),” an elderly woman told Reuters outside the mosque, struggling to catch her breath. “They hurled stun grenades, one of them hit my chest,” she said, crying.
Israeli police said officers entered the compound after what it called masked agitators locked themselves inside the mosque and after attempts to remove them by dialogue failed.
More than 350 people inside were arrested and removed from the compound, police said.
“Throughout the presence of police forces in the compound, stones were thrown and multiple firecrackers were set off inside the mosque by many law-breaking individuals and rioters,” the police statement said, adding that two officers were wounded.
Thousands of worshippers had been spending the night in the mosque compound amid fears of possible clashes with Jewish visitors to the site for Passover. “Leaders on all sides must act responsibly and refrain from steps that could escalate tensions,” said the UN Special Coord­inator for the Middle East Peace Process, Tor Wennesland.
The United States said it was alarmed by the violence.
The Arab League condemned Israel’s “extremist approach” and said it would hold an emergency meeting on Wednesday.
The United Arab Emirates (UAE) and China asked the 15-member United Nations Security Council to discuss the situation behind closed-doors on Thursday, said diplomats.
The UAE’s foreign ministry also said “worshippers should not barricade themselves inside the mosque and places of worship with weapons and explosives”.
Jordan and Egypt, both involved in recent U.S.-backed efforts to de-escalate Israel-Palestinian tensions, issued separate statements condemning the incident. Saudi Arabia, with which Israel hopes to normalise ties, said Israel’s “storming” of Al-Aqsa undermined peace efforts.

2,Five held in India over macabre ‘human sacrifice’,NEW DELHI: Five people were arrested on suspicion of beheading a woman four years ago as a human sacrifice at one of...,"NEW DELHI: Five people were arrested on suspicion of beheading a woman four years ago as a human sacrifice at one of India’s fabled temples to Goddess Durga in Assam, police said on Tuesday.
Guwahati Police Comm­issioner Diganta Bora said the beheaded body of a woman was found covered with a blanket on the staircase of the Joy Durga Mandir in the precincts of the Kamakhya Temple on June 19, 2019, hours after she was killed.
A suo motu case was registered at Jalukbari police station and investigation was launched but was delayed due to lack of clues.
India’s National Crime Records Bureau lodged 103 cases of human sacrifice in the country bet­ween 2014 and 2021. Ritual killings are usually conducted to appease deities usually in regions where belief in witchcraft and occult is widespread.
Shanti Shaw, 64, was killed and decapitated with a machete after visiting the temple in Guwahati. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu revivalist Bharatiya Janata Party rules the remote northeastern region. A robust campaign against blind faith and superstition in southern India has been viciously opposed by groups loyal to Hindutva, and vocal campaigners have been killed.
Reports said police made no progress in the case until Ms Shaw’s body was finally identified in January, sparking a renewed investigation that tracked down several culprits.
“The five planned the killing of the woman,” the commissioner said. “A total of 12 people took part.”
Mr Bora said the alleged ringleader, Pradeep Pathak, 52, had orchestrated the killing as part of a religious rite to mark the anniversary of his brother’s death.
“The accused apparently believed that the sacrifice would appease the soul of the deceased,” he added.
Pathak and four others were picked up between March 25 and April 1, with police still hunting for their seven accomplices.
Last year, two men were arrested for allegedly killing a six-year-old boy in New Delhi. The culprits reportedly told police they murdered the child as an offering to the Hindu god Shiva to get rich.

3,"Gas cannot be supplied round the clock, says minister","“Our gas resources are depleting by 10pc every year. We have only 1,600mmcfd of gas left for the entire country,"" says minister.","KARACHI: Minister of State for Petroleum Mus­adik Malik on Wednesday disclosed that natural gas cannot be supplied round the clock due to its depleting reserves in most parts of the country.
During a meeting with members of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry and later in a media talk, he said efforts were being made to ensure that gas supply remains unin­te­rrup­ted during sehri and iftar.
While rejecting reports that gas is being diverted to Punjab from Sindh despite its shortage in the south-eastern province, Mr Malik said he had been tasked to resolve the problem both in the domestic and industrial sectors.
He claimed that gas shortage had emerged due to its supply to the domestic sector of Balochistan.
“Our gas resources are depleting by 10 per cent every year. We have only 1,600mmcfd of gas left for the entire country while the demand is on the rise,” he added.
The government, he said, would ensure that poor households are provided gas on priority. However, he added, there would be a ban on new connections.
He recalled that Sindh had surplus gas until a few years ago, but currently it is facing a deficit due to a soaring demand.
Mr Malik pointed out that as compared with other provinces only Khy­ber Pakhtunkhwa had surplus gas at the moment.
As regards gas loadshedding in the industrial sector, he said the crisis could be tackled by coming up with an expensive blend of natural gas and RLNG.
Mr Malik said he would again meet the industrial sector’s stakeholders on Thursday (today) to discuss a strategy to address the issue of gas shortage.
He hinted at signing an agreement with Russia for purc­­hase of crude this mon­th so that consumers could get cheaper fuel.
He was of the view that power tariff should be brought down to Rs15-20 per unit from the existing Rs42 to encourage people to meet their heating needs through electricity.
The businessmen expr­essed concerns over suspension of gas supply and said it is striking a crippling blow to the local production as well as exports.
They said industries cannot perform well due to gas and electricity shortages and high interest rates. They urged the minister to devise an effective strategy for overcoming gas shortage otherwise industries would close down, rendering thousands of people jobless.
The state minister also held a meeting with Paki­stan Petroleum Dea­lers Asso­cia­tion Chairman Abdul Sami Khan and discussed with him issues like deal­ers’ commission, down­­­w­ard trend in the sale of domestic oil products due to smuggled Iran­ian oil, Shell Pakistan’s franchise fees, structure/processing of sasta petrol scheme, etc.

4,When in Beijing — Macron warns against shunning China,"“China’s interest isn’t to have a lasting war,” Macron says.","

BEIJING: French Pres­ident Emmanuel Macron said Europe must resist reducing trade and diplomatic ties with China as he began a state visit on Wednesday, seeking to refute any sense there was an “inescapable spiral” of tension between Beijing and the West.
Macron said maintaining dialogue with China was key given its close relations with Russia, which is waging a war in Ukraine. Asked about Western concerns Beijing might be considering sending arms to Moscow, Macron said any nation that did so would be complicit in a breach of international law.
“China’s interest isn’t to have a lasting war,” Macron said.
On his first trip to China since 2019, Macron spoke to U.S. President Joe Biden before the visit about eng­aging Chinese President Xi Jinping to hasten the end of the Ukraine war, though Washington is sceptical toward Beijing’s peace plan.
“We hear increasingly loud voices expressing a strong concern about the future of relations between the West and China that in some form lead to the conclusion that there is an inescapable spiral of mounting tensions,” Macron told reporters at the French Embassy in Beijing.
There is also an impression that de-coupling from the Chinese economy is already underway and that the only remaining question is over pace and intensity, he added.
“I do not believe, in any case I do not want to believe, in this scenario.” Macron arrived ahead of Ursula von der Leyen, who will join the French leader on her first visit to China since becoming European Comm­ission president more than three years ago.
Last week she said the EU must “de-risk” ties with Beijing, including limiting Chinese access to sensitive technology and reducing reliance on China for key inputs.
Europe’s relations with China have soured in recent years first due to a stalled investment pact in 2021 and then Beijing’s refusal to condemn Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.
De-risking did not mean severing trade ties with China, Macron later told reporters.
There is no contradiction in reducing Europe’s dependence on China in strategic sectors such as telecoms and increasing business links in other areas, Macron added.

5,Possibility of Trump’s trial plunges 2024 race into uncharted territory,"Former president remains the strongest Republican candidate since his ratings have, paradoxically, improved as his troubles with","WASHINGTON: Voters in the United States woke on Wednesday to a uniquely volatile 2024 presidential election landscape, where Donald Trump, the leading Repub­lican candidate, now faces trial and the incumbent, Joe Biden, has not even confirmed he’s running.
Trump pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to 34 felony charges linked to alleged attempts to silence damaging personal information during his triumphant 2016 race for the White House.
The man who went from 1980s playboy real estate magnate, to TV reality show star in the 2000s, then right-wing populist president, made history as the first serving or former commander in chief to face a criminal trial.
But while he had to go through the humiliating process of arrest in a New York courtroom, polls show Trump remains by far the strongest Republican candidate. In fact, his numbers have only improved as his legal scandals grow, making it hard for his closest rival, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, to gain traction.

Former president remains the strongest Republican candidate since his ratings have, paradoxically, improved as his troubles with the law have grown

Far from cowed, Trump is doubling down on extreme rhetoric, painting himself in a speech after his release as victim of a “Trump-hating judge” and “massive election interference”.
On Wednesday, he called on his Truth Social app for Republicans in Congress to “defund the DOJ and FBI” in response to what he claimed is the “abuse of power” by the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Trump’s attorney Todd Blanche said his client was “upset”. But “I’ll tell you what: he’s motivated and it’s not going to stop him and it’s not going to slow him down”.
Troubles pile up
For all the bravado, 76-year-old Trump is in serious trouble.
During his decades in the public eye, he has shown astonishing ability to escape legal peril, whether during his many business disputes or even as president when Repub­licans acquitted him in an unprecedented two impeachment trials.
But Trump is now in the hands of the New York state court system, where Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg is mounting an aggressive prosecution.
He also risks the wrath of Juan Merchan, the judge who is overseeing his case in New York and cautioned against “comments that have potential to incite violence, create civil unrest or jeopardise the state or well-being of any individuals”.
Even if some analysts have questioned the strength of the New York case, Trump’s real problems may lie elsewhere.
Reports indicate that a high-level probe into his hoarding of top secret White House documents at his private Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida is gathering pace. Another criminal probe is underway in Georgia over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, which he lost to Biden but refused to concede.
Next year, the legal calendars will likely collide with the political calendar, sparking new levels of unpredictability.
The Manhattan court is set to reconvene on Dec 4, with a trial expected sometime early next year.
Trump would in theory be campaigning hard for Republican presidential nomination — with the first contests scheduled for Feb 5 and 13 in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Biden sits back
At the White House, Biden appears content to sit back and watch the fall of a man he has branded a “toxic presence”. Asked if Biden, like millions across the US, was watching live coverage of Trump’s court appearance, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre insisted he was busy working.
He might “catch part of the news when he has a moment”, she said, but “this is not something that’s a focus for him”.
President Biden and his party got another piece of good news on Tuesday night with victory for the Democratic candidate in an especially fierce battle for a vacant Wisconsin supreme court seat. This creates a liberal majority on the court, which will play a key role refereeing electoral disputes next year in one of the tightest swing states in the country.
But Biden is also injecting uncertainty in the run-up to next year’s elections.
His age is a constant source of concern, even to allies. Now 80, he would be 86 by the time he left office after a second term.
And he has yet to confirm he is running, despite strongly hinting on several occasions that he will. After repeated delays to the expected announcement, Axios has reported that it may now only land in July or even later.
