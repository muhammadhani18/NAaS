0,"Census task ‘90pc complete’ in Punjab, Sindh, KP, says PBS","Progress abysmally low in Balochistan, where 40pc work needs to be completed within five days.","KARACHI: With the deadline for the country’s first digital census approaching on April 10, the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) said on Wednesday that more than 90 per cent of work had been completed in Punjab, Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
However, according to official data released on Wednesday, Islamabad and Balochistan trail significantly behind, with 72pc and 62pc work completed so far, respectively,
The brief and sketchy details shared by the PBS also referred to the contribution of 121,000 field enumerators, who have made the exercise possible within the stipulated period, which was revised only on Tuesday, when the bureau extended the last date of field operations from April 4 to 10.
However, the PBS statement didn’t explain the reason behind the below-par performance in Islamabad and Balochistan and how it planned to complete the remaining work in five days.

Progress abysmally low in Balochistan, where 40pc work needs to be completed within five days

“The digital census is a huge success and a moment of pride for the nation,” the PBS said, adding that so far, 40 million households had been counted and geotagged and 92pc of the census work had been successfully completed, including 95pc in KP, 95pc in Punjab, 92pc Sindh, and 62pc in Balochistan.
“The smooth workflow and technology innovations, data of almost 10m people is daily synched without any issues or technical glitches,” it said. “This is a huge win for Pakistan.”
PBS officials didn’t respond to calls for further clarity on the breakdown of provincial data provided by the federal agency. The statement, however, lauded the role of provincial governments in ensuring the coverage of areas under respective administrations.
“The provincial governments are playing a major role in ensuring 100pc coverage while ensuring the quality and credibility of the whole census process,” it said. “The real-time data progress monitoring dashboards, provided by PBS down to provincial and district governments, allows for a completely transparent process and continuous oversight of field operations. The dashboard also helps provincial governments in identifying any abnormalities, any areas missed and any other emerging anomalies on a daily basis.”
It also shared the methodology based on “universal inclusion,” which ensures the area of every individual who’s counted depending on their livelihood.
“The current methodology ensures universal inclusion, which means that each and every individual living in the location for six months or planning to live there for another six months, and will be using resources around that location, regardless of their nationality, geography, ethnicity, identity, affiliations, politics, caste or creed, will be counted,” the PBS said.
The PBS has also supported the provincial and district governments by setting up a helpline 080057574 and SMS gateway 9727 where people can call for queries or report anyone or any area missed.
“Recently, on the directions of the prime minister of Pakistan, the 495 census support centres are now also working as points of referral for all missed areas,” it added.

1,"Chinese envoy credits CPEC for social, economic development",LAHORE: Chinese Co­­n­­sul General in Lahore Zhao Shiren has hailed the China-Pakistan Eco­n­omic Corridor...,"LAHORE: Chinese Co­­n­­sul General in Lahore Zhao Shiren has hailed the China-Pakistan Eco­n­omic Corridor (CPEC) as a tra­n­sformative infrastructure project that paved the way for socio-economic development in the country.
He was speaking at the concluding ceremony of an essay competition held in connection with the completion of 10 years of CPEC on Wednesday. The competition, titled ‘CPEC — 10 years and its grassroots impacts’ was held in collaboration with the Chi­nese Consulate in Lah­ore and the Institute of Inter­national Relations and Media Research (IIRMR).
Mr Shiren said projects launched under the CPEC have made positive strides and key areas such as Gwadar Port, energy, transportation and industrial cooperation have progressed and delivered tangible benefits for people.
The beauty of CPEC lies not only in specific projects but in the fact that it brou­g­­ht closer the people of China and Pakistan thr­ough cultural exchange and mutual learning, he added.
“Through high-quality development of the CPEC, China is working with Pakistan to build a community having a shared future in the new era of development,” he added.
He said the essay competition and similar programmes play a decisive role in setting the CPEC narrative right.
In the ceremony, prizes were distributed among Tehniyat Mobeenul Haq, Rabia Zahoor, Faiza Naz, Haris Masood and Kam­ran who secured the top five positions in the competition. IIRMR Chair­man Muhammad Mehdi and President Yasir Habib Khan said CPEC would continue to progress as its essence was to put people on the path of development.

2,Supporters will take to streets if SC ruling blocked: Imran,"""The nation should wait for my call to ensure that the incumbent rulers could not run away from holding elections,"" says PTI chief.","LAHORE: PTI Chairman Imran Khan said on Wednesday that people would take to the streets if the ruling alliance attempted to block the implementation of the court ruling that directed polls in Punjab on May 14.
The former prime minister was speaking during a televised address to mark Yaum-i-Tashakkur (gratitude day) celebrations following the top court’s judgement that directed for general elections in Punjab.
The speech was broadcasted from his Zaman Park residence through a satellite link on mega screens installed at 75 locations across the country, including in 13 cities of Punjab.
However, the main gathering of the event was held at the Liberty roundabout in Lahore where PTI supporters gathered despite the rain. They were holding party flags while some of them were wearing PTI-themed headbands and scarves.
 


Addressing his supporters, the former prime minister said, “The nation should wait for my call to ensure that the incumbent rulers could not run away from holding elections; otherwise, neither the history nor the future generations will pardon this generation for not waging jihad against the forces undermining the rule of law.”
He said “the Sicilian mafia” was now standing against the decision of the Supreme Court, which had earlier decided in their favour and overturned PTI’s decision to dissolve the National Assembly after opening courts at midnight.
The former premier said ‘absconder’ Nawaz Sharif and Asif Ali Zardari were sitting in London and Dubai, respectively, and taking decisions about the fate of Pakistan. He said the incumbent rulers were also trying to divide the Supreme Court while also working to create a rift between the PTI and the establishment which “might repeat events of 1971”.
Asking what kind of economic and security stability can be ensured by October for holding elections, Mr Khan said that only elections would be the way out to take Pakistan out of the blind alley where it was fast heading. “I will complete interviews and selection of candidates in 10 days,” he said and added that the nation would not let the incumbent rulers run away from elections.
In an interview with Al Jazeera before the speech, the PTI chairman alleged the ruling PDM could violate the Constitution to prevent national elections due later this year. “They are just scared of the elections and are even willing to violate the Constitution,” Mr Khan claimed.
“By not accepting the SC’s verdict, the government would violate the Constitution”. In such a situation, he said, the SC could slap contempt of court on them.
Mr Khan disclosed he had held two meetings with former army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa and wanted to work out how to hold elections. “What I didn’t realise was that he wanted an election provided he gets an extension in his tenure,” he said and added since then he had no conversation with the establishment.
Answering a question about his plans on restructuring the civil-military relationship if elected back to power, the PTI chairman said Pakistan needed to change. “The current civil and military imbalance has to change if we want Pakistan to get out of this mess,” he asserted.
“You cannot have a system where the prime minister has the responsibility but he does not have the authority to implement his policies because that authority is shared with the military,” the PTI chief observed.

3,Rules to harmonise GST on services approved,Harmonising GST on services is a condition of the IMF to unlock funding to Pakistan stalled since December.,"ISLAMABAD: In a significant development, the National Tax Council (NTC) on Wednesday approved the much-awaited Place of Provision of Service Rules (PPSRs), a step towards harmonising general sales tax on services across the country and ultimately easing the doing of businesses.
Harmonising GST on services is a condition of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to unlock funding to Pakistan stalled since December despite implementing several tough policy decisions, in­­cluding additional tax measures.
After approval of the respective provincial cabinets, the PPSRs will come into effect from May 1. The Sindh Revenue Board (SRB) suggested implementing the rules from July 1, while the other three provincial revenue authorities wanted the implementation from mid-April.
The government is in a hurry to get loans from multilateral lenders to shore up its falling foreign exchange reserves and the early implementation of the World Bank project could give some breaking space to Pakistan.
As a result, the early implementation of the rules will pave the way for the release of a $1 billion programme loan under the Resilient Institutions for Sustai­n­able Economy (RISE) programme of the World Bank. The programme loan is vital for Pakistan keeping in view the country’s balance-of-payments issue and a considerable delay in getting a $1.1bn tranche from the IMF.
The service rules are also a step forward towards facilitating ease of doing business.
An official announcement of the finance ministry said the NTC approved the recommendations of its executive committee regarding draft PPSRs. The approval will help achieve the prior actions for the World Bank-funded programme.
The meeting approved the exclusion of electric power transmission from the list of Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) goods and it will now be treated as a service. It was decided that it would be implemented from July 1 following the amendment to the Sales Tax Act through the Finan­­ce Bill in the upcoming budget.
The SRB has already proposed ru­­les for the provision of services re­­lating to electric power transm­i­­ssi­­o­­n. Other provincial revenue au­­­t­ho­rities will also adopt similar rules.
All provinces will have their own set of rules subject to the condition that there should be no material differences in these rules, as that is the aim of the entire harmonisation exercise.
As per agreement among provinces and the FBR, the advertising service and advertisement agents will be charged sales tax as per an agreed plan. GST on TV and radio ads will be based on the location of the beaming stations.
In the case of still media, GST will apply to the location of hoarding sites, while in the case of advertising agents, the tax will be collected based on the location of the agent’s office or branch.
In the case of different insurance services — life and health insurance, insurance of immovable property, insurance agent, re-insurance agent, re-insurance imported and re-insurance local — the GST on services will be based on the location of the office or branches of the insurance company providing services.
The provinces agreed that GST would apply based on the location of the franchise. They also agreed on a formula that half of GST will go to the province of origin on tra­nsportation of goods other than pe­troleum services provided by co­mpanies while the remaining half will go to the destination province.
In the case of non-companies, the GST will be based on the location of the booking office on transportation of goods other than petroleum services.
Half of the GST will be on the origin of transportation of goods through pipeline or conduit and transmission through the electrical grid, while 50pc tax will be ap­­plied to the destination province.

4,Maryam asks CJP to get judges’ nod before executing polls order,"Chief justice not ready to share his powers with fellow judges, regrets Bilawal.","ISLAMABAD/LARKANA: PML-N chief organiser Maryam Nawaz Sharif urged the chief justice of Pakistan to get the nod of his fellow judges for the execution of the Supreme Court’s decision in the Punjab Assembly polls delay case.
Meanwhile, in Gambat, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari accused judges of ignoring past injustices and regretted that the CJP was not unwilling to share his powers with fellow judges.
Ms Sharif’s remarks came a day after the apex court quashed the Election Commission’s order of delaying polls to October and set May 14 as the election date in Punjab.
Addressing the lawyers’ convention in the Judicial Complex of Rawalpindi org­anised by the PML-N Lawyers’ For­um, Ms Sharif termed the decision of a three-member bench of the apex court comprising CJP Umar Ata Bandial, Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Muneeb Akhtar “a minority decision”, saying that four judges had already dismissed this case.

Chief justice not ready to share his powers with fellow judges, regrets Bilawal

She alleged that the recent Supreme Court order was part of a sequence of decisions taken against PML-N by former chief justices Saqib Nisar and Asif Saeed Khosa in collaboration with former spymaster Faiz Hameed.
She accused Mr Hameed, who retired last year as a lieutenant general, of blackmailing judges to get “tailor-made” decisions.
Ms Nawaz pointed out that the CJP took suo motu notice on the note of a two-member bench comprising Justice Ahsan and Justice Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi on polls in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab assemblies.
Mr Sharif said that one judge was a “monitoring judge” in cases against her and father Nawaz Sharif, and was also connected with a controversial lease to high-rise apartments “One Constitution Avenue” developed by the real estate developer BNP (Pvt) Ltd.
The judge was among the legal team of the said builder and was also part of the apex court bench that restored the lease of the multibillion-rupee plot.
The PML-N leader also urged the Supreme Judicial Council to take notice of Justice Naqvi’s purported audio leak.
Meanwhile, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Wednesday also accused judges of not dispensing justice while ruling the country in collaboration with dictators.
Speaking at the inauguration ceremony of the country’s first lung transplant unit in the Gambat city of Khairpur district, he said the CJP was not ready to share his powers with fellow judges.
In contrast, he said, former president Asif Ali Zardari was the country’s most powerful civilian president, but “he gave all his powers to the parliament”.
The foreign minister lamented that judges gave lectures to the entire country about who was corrupt and who was the Sicilian mafia, but the same courts sentenced PPP founder Zulfikar Ali Bhutto to death and no judge was ready to do justice in this regard until today.
He alleged that when the present CJP was the chief justice of the Lahore High Court, he had ordered the construction of Kalabagh Dam, ignoring the rights of small provinces.

5,Minister terms ‘imperial’ SC a menace to democracy,"NA continues bashing judiciary, PTI in one-sided proceedings; speaker allows debate during points of order.","ISLAMABAD: Hitting out hard at the judiciary, a key government minister on Wednesday termed the “imperial Supreme Court (SC) a menace to democracy” and a “usurper” of the rights of all state institutions, as lawmakers in the National Assembly continued their one-sided assault on judges and the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) in the wake of the controversial verdict of a three-judge SC bench to hold elections in Punjab on May 14.
“The law is a sword, shield and a menace. And it’s to my deepest regret to state before this house that the imperial SC is a menace to democracy [in this country],” said Federal Minister for Power Khurram Dastgir Khan while using the famous quote of US philosopher and jurist Ronald Dworkin in his speech, as Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf allowed lawmakers to have a full-fledged debate on the April 4 court’s verdict on points of order, which consumed more than four hours.
Besides Mr Khan, almost all the speakers, including other federal ministers, in their speeches accused the judiciary of facilitating PTI Chairman Imran Khan and said the SC verdict would divide the nation and the country.
In their speeches, the members took names of former chief justices, including Iftikhar Chaudhry and Saqib Nisar, accusing them of usurping the rights of all the institutions through the alleged misuse of suo motu powers given in the Constitution and questioned the reluctance of Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial in constituting a full court bench.

NA continues bashing judiciary, PTI in one-sided proceedings; speaker allows debate during points of order

Mr Khan alleged that “by consistently showing a tilt towards one person, the court has turned into another political institution and thus undermining its own legitimacy”. He said after facing dictatorship and terrorism, they were now confronting an “imperial Supreme Court”.
Criticising the judiciary for legitimising past military rules, the minister said there had been a “nexus between the generals and the judges” which had imposed “the doctrine of necessity” on the nation.
He said they either had to struggle against the generals and when there was no military rule, they had to face the judges. The country, he said, needed “doctrine of democracy and not doctrine of necessity”.
“The imperial SC has usurped the rights of legislation, executive, constitutional institutions, lower courts and even their fellow judges,” said the minister while accusing the CJP of encroaching the domain of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) by announcing the election date.
He said Clause 69 of the Elections Act, 2017, called for holding of elections in the country on a single day besides empowered the ECP to delay the elections, if a situation arose beyond its control.
Health Minister Qadir Patel in his hard-hitting speech suggested that the candidates should be asked to submit their nomination papers in the SC, instead of the ECP.
Opposition Leader and a PTI dissident Raja Riaz as usual in his unimpressive speech mostly targeted Imran Khan and used some derogatory remarks against him which were expunged by the speaker.
Lashing out at the judiciary, Mr Riaz regretted that instead of listening to the voices of the parliament and lawyers’ organisation, the court preferred to side with a “drug addict”. The opposition leader used street language and cursed the judges.
The opposition leader was directed by the speaker to select appropriate and parliamentary words in the speech. Later, he received flak from his own colleague and another PTI dissident Riaz Mazari, who advised the opposition leader not to talk like those sitting in hotels.
Religious Affairs Minister Mufti Abdul Shakoor also hit out at the SC and suggested that the SC should now be called a “PTI’s wing.”
“Is he the CJP or the PTI’s vice-chairman?” asked the minister while making another suggestion that it would be appropriate to place the ECP under the SC.
“When they [judges] are giving schedule and dates [for polls] then what is the need for having the ECP. Better merge the ECP with SC and make the CJP its head,” he said mockingly. And then he suggested giving powers of the president, the prime minister, the speaker and the Senate chairman also to the CJP as there was no need for other institutions when the SC was not caring even for the resolution that had been passed by the parliament seeking formation of a full court.
Federal Minister for Information Technology Aminul Haque of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) alleged that efforts were being made to create a constitutional crisis in the country which was already facing political and economic mess.
Mr Haque expressed his surprise that the SC’s verdict talked only about the polls in Punjab whereas it seemed that the court had no concern over the elections within 90 days in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. He said it was evident that the ladla (blue-eyed) was being facilitated.
He said the upcoming general elections in the country would be held after the completion of the digital census and delimitation of constituencies.
Lone member of the Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) sitting on the opposition benches despite being a part of the ruling Muttehida Majlis-i-Amal (MMA) Maulana Abdul Akbar Chitrali on this occasion supported the stance taken by the ruling coalition and called for the constitution of a full court on the matter, stating that Islam also called for decisions through consultations.
He also stated that his party believed that elections of the National Assembly and all the provincial assemblies should be held simultaneously.
Naz Baloch of the PPP said that “the worst form of injustice is pretended justice”.
Another federal minister Hashim Notezai took the SC to task over al­­leged misuse of suo motu powers and questioned as to why the court didn’t take any notice of over 5,000 missing persons in Balochistan province.

6,Resorts to be built along coast of Balochistan,"Seven resorts will be constructed under the public-private partnership on the coastal belt of Balochistan to promote tourism, BCDA decides.","QUETTA: The Balochistan Coastal Development Authority (BCDA) will construct seven resorts under the public-private partnership on the coastal belt of Balochistan to promote tourism in the area.
The decision was taken at the BCDA governing body meeting presided over by Chief Minister Mir Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo on Wednesday.
The meeting discussed various issues relating to fishermen and tourism and took some decisions about the use of the long coastal belt of the province.
The fisheries department secretary, Kazim Hussain Jatoi, briefed the meeting about the coastal authority and issues faced by the fisheries department and the fishermen.
The meeting decided to make permanent 28 employees of the department who had been recruited between 2012 and 2017 on contract basis.
The meeting decided to take action against officers and employees who had been inducted in the authority against rules and regulations.
Speaking at the meeting, the chief minister highlighted the issue of illegal recruitment of employees in the Balochistan Coastal Development Authority and said the government did not want to snatch jobs from the people as it believed in providing jobs to the people of Balochistan, but those officials who had been involved in such recruitments would face the music.

He said the university teachers should be focused on ensuring the bright future of the entire province, instead of limiting it to the four walls of the university.
It was a matter of honour to become a teacher in society and therefore, it was the duty of teachers to use their abilities for creating a healthy society, the governor added.
