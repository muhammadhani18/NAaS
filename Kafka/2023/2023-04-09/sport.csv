The Ramadan Cup, a Class VII Division II handicap race to be contested over 1,100 metres, contains eight runners. Of them bay horse Sardar Gee with four straight wins will be atte­mpting to achieve a rare feat of extending his streak to five victories while bay filly Western Lady and bay colt Big Beat will be his main challengers.
This will be the seventh race of the day.
The Malik Ghulam Nabi Memorial cup, a Class VII Division I handicap race to be contested over 1,100 met­res, has nine runners. Thre­e-year-old bay colt Sir, who was beaten in his last outing, will be going all out to avenge the defeat. Sir could face a strong challenge from colts Shaman and Mutagil on his way to victory.
The opener, a Class VII lower division handicap event to be contested over 900 metres, has the largest field of 15 runners. The handicapper has tried to make this race competitive in handicap to give an equal chance to majority of the runners.
The second, third, fourth and fifth races have two to four horses on chance.
Meanwhile, the Lahore Race Club (LRC) has notified for the information of all concerned that the 1,88-metre Pakistan Oaks Cup race will be held next month. The LRC management has directed owners/trainers to observe punctuality during Ramazan-ul-Mubarak. In all 69, horses will take part in seven events, with the first race set to start at 12:00pm.

With back-to-back wins under his belt, he is among nine contenders who will vie for honours in the cup race under scale order VI and VII being run over four furlongs. 
This is the third race of a four-race card drawn for the day.
Bay horse Epsom and gelding Supreme Leader are on chance to secure second and third place, respectively.
However, mare Sweet Golden, stable mate of Golden Chance, may pull off an upset.
The fourth and concluding race appears to be a two-horse affair between bay horses Cracks Man and Golden Step. It is also the day’s feature event under scale order III, IV and V and will go over four-and-a-half furlongs.
Both the horses finished off the frame in their previous outing last week. The race has a field of five acceptors.
At the outset, 10 horses will make their presence felt in the opening race under scale order VIII being contested over four furlongs.
On present form, bay horse Canadian King looks distinct to make it two on the trot by getting the better of opponents.
Mare Baby Champion and gelding Faisal Choice look smart for securing the next two places on board respectively.
If backed by connection, bay horse Money Shower who is stable mate of Canadian King, can bring an element of surprise.
Another 10 horses will face the starter in the second race under scale order VII and VIII being run over four furlongs.
Chestnut horse Meharban who finished second in his last outing, is expected to make amends by overcoming other challengers.
He is likely to be chased by mares Basanti and Little Darling, respectively.
Gelding Champions Stride who has come from Lahore and will make his debut at the course, may upset the applecart.
The first race starts at 12:00pm.

2,Napoli back on winning track ahead of Milan showdown,LECCE: Napoli took another step closer to ending their 33-year wait to win the Serie A title after they came away...,"LECCE: Napoli took another step closer to ending their 33-year wait to win the Serie A title after they came away from Lecce with a 2-1 win on Friday thanks to a bizarre own goal from Lecce defender Antonino Gallo, while AC Milan were held to a goalless draw by Empoli.
Luciano Spalletti’s side extended their lead at the top of the table to 19 points over second-placed Lazio.
Napoli, whose shock 4-0 loss to AC Milan on Sunday was only their third league defeat of the season, are within touching distance of winning the Serie A title for the first time since 1990 with nine games left to play.
Napoli opened the scoring in the 18th minute when an unmarked Giovanni Di Lorenzo headed home Kim Min-jae’s cross. Lecce equalised seven minutes into the second half after Federico Di Francesco pounced on a rebound inside the box and sent the ball into the bottom corner.
Lecce’s momentum disappeared in the 64th minute when Gallo chested the ball back to keeper Wladimiro Falcone, who saw it slip between his gloves and into the net.
Napoli were without Serie A top scorer Victor Osimhen, who is still recovering from a thigh strain, and Spalletti admitted the team were hampered by the Nigerian’s absence.
“It does become difficult without him, because he has this way of running into space, this physicality, he can draw everyone to him and therefore create the space for his team-mates.”
Nigeria forward Osimhen might be back for Wednesday’s first leg of the all-Italian Champions League quarter-final with third-placed Milan.
“Osimhen wants to play every game, but there are situations that need to be evaluated carefully. He really did run the risk of hurting himself badly and being ruled out for the rest of the season, so the medics were right to make him take some time out.”
The match concluded another miserable week for Lecce, who have now suffered six straight defeats in Serie A and are 16th, eight points above the relegation zone. 
Meanwhile, Milan flopped at the San Siro as Stefano Pioli’s much-changed side failed to break down defensive Empoli. 
The hosts thought they had claimed the points in the final moments  when substitute Olivier Giroud netted but his strike was rightly ruled  out for handball after he celebrated. 
That was the second time supporters were ruing VAR officials after Milan were also denied a penalty on the hour after Tyronne Ebuehi had initially been penalised for handball. 
Empoli held out for a draw which meant Milan failed to fully capitalise on another bad evening for Romelu Lukaku in rivals Inter Milan’s 1-1 draw at Salernitana. 
Antonio Candreva’s miscued cross in the final minute moved  Salernitana 10 points above the relegation zone and left Inter at risk  of being knocked out of the Champions League positions. 
Wasteful Inter would have been out of sight before old boy  Candreva’s fortuitous strike had they made the most of their  opportunities after Robin Gosens netted their first goal from open play  in a month in the sixth minute, with Lukaku the worst culprit in  Salerno. 
Lukaku headed a simple opportunity straight at Guillermo Ochoa in the first half.  And he somehow managed to scoop a diving header onto the bar from  inside the six-yard box in the 65th minute before the superb Ochoa  brilliantly kept out Stefan De Vrij on the rebound. 
Fourth-placed Inter are just one point ahead of Roma, who are at Torino on Sunday, while sixth-placed Atalanta can also move above Inter on goal difference if they beat Bologna.

3,Navy withdraws arrest warrant of hockey player,"Sufyan is now attending the training camp, having left the Navy to join the Maripur Gas team.","LAHORE: Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) Secretary Haider Hussain has announced that the issue between the PHF and Pakistan Navy regarding Sufyan Khan, one of the potential players for the Junior Asia Cup training camp, has been resolved.
This comes after the Navy withdrew their arrest warrant for Sufyan.
Haider, a former international player, told reporters on Saturday that the PHF had held detailed discussions with Director Sports Mohammad Kamran of Pakistan Navy regarding the matter.
“The Navy authorities have assured us that all cases against Sufyan will be withdrawn, and they have also pledged their cooperation with the PHF, as in the past,” Haider said.
The PHF secretary expressed his gratitude to the naval chief for taking interest in resolving the matter, and assured the Navy that all issues would be resolved one by one.
“What has happened has happened, and now our focus is on preparing the national junior team for the Asian event,” he said.
“Sufyan is a national asset and we cannot ignore him in the camp,” Haider added.
On Monday, some Navy officials came to the DHA Hockey Stadium in Lahore, where the national junior training camp has been in operation for the past month, to arrest Sufyan. The officials claimed that Sufyan had left the Navy without following the department’s procedure.
According to a complaint filed by the coaches of the camp to the PHF, the coaches had informed the Navy officials that Sufyan was not present on the rest day.
However, the officials misbehaved with the coaches and lined up the potential players.
After receiving the complaints, the PHF secretary brought the matter to the attention of the naval chief, who promptly resolved the matter.
Sufyan is now attending the training camp, having left the Navy to join the Maripur Gas team.

The Saad Baig-led squad will tour Bangladesh from April 30 to May 17 to play a four-dayer, five one-day matches and one T20 game against Bangladesh.
According to head coach Sabeeh Azhar, the Bang­ladesh tour will help the players fine tune their skills at the international level and get ready to represent Pakistan at next year’s World Cup.
“Bangladesh are in good form as they won a triangular tournament in the UAE featuring Afgh­anistan and Sri Lanka,” Sabeeh said.
“Bangladesh on their last tour to Pakistan also defeated them. Therefore, the boys have to fight well to come back with victory.”
On the first day of the camp, Sabeeh said, the players interacted with each other besides holding a three-hour net practice session.
On Monday and Tuesday, a 50-over-match featuring the camp players will be held.
“Due to the holy month of Ramazan, one innings of the 50-overs game will be held on Monday and the second on Tuesday.”

5,Celta frustrate  nine-man Sevilla with late comeback,SEVILLE: Celta Vigo produced a stunning late comeback to draw 2-2 at Manchester United’s Europa League opponents...,"SEVILLE: Celta Vigo produced a stunning late comeback to draw 2-2 at Manchester United’s Europa League opponents Sevilla in La Liga on Friday.
The draw prevented Sevilla from climbing away from the danger zone.
The hosts, who had Pape Gueye sent off after only 19 minutes, led through Youssef En-Nesyri and Marcos Acuna’s strikes as the clock ticked down.
However Miguel Rodriguez pulled one back for Celta in after 89 minutes and Gonzalo Paciencia levelled in the third minute of stoppage time.
Acuna was sent off for dissent late on, leaving Jose Luis Mendilibar’s struggling side with nine men.
Sevilla, who face United in the first leg of the Europa League quarter-finals on Thursday, had looked certain to secure their second victory from two matches under Mendilibar. Provisionally 13th, Sevilla sit five points above the relegation zone, having played a game more than the teams beneath them.
The hosts’ task became harder against a Celta Vigo side in good form when midfielder Gueye was sent off for two yellow cards after just 19 minutes.
Despite their numerical disadvantage, Sevilla battled well at the Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan and took the lead when En-Nesyri headed home well from Suso’s corner shortly before half-time.
Acuna smashed home the second with nine minutes remaining after winning the ball in the centre circle, driving forward and unleashing a rocket from distance which fizzed into the bottom corner. 
The record six-time Europa League winners seemed to have some wind in their sails, ahead of their trip to Old Trafford. However Rodriguez swept home from the edge of the box to set up a frantic finale, and Paciencia leapt brilliantly to nod home Hugo Mallo’s cross for Celta, ninth.

Mikael showcased his talent in the singles and doubles categories, emerging as the champion in both.
In the singles finals, Mikael faced South Korean top-seed Siyun Kim, who had beaten him just last week in a closely contested final. 
Mikael started the match strongly and quickly took a commanding lead, winning the first set 6-3. 
However, Kim fought back to secure the second set 6-1. 
The deciding set saw Mikael dominate with his aggressive game, outclassing Kim and winning it 6-0.In the doubles finals, Mikael teamed up with his previous opponent, Kim, to take on the pair of Turkmenistan’s Imran Ahundov and Khamidjon Mansurov of Uzbekistan. 
The final didn’t start well for the pair of  Mikael and Kim  as their opponent got the better of them, winning the first set 6-7. 
But they bounced back to clinch the second set 6-4, taking the match to a super tie-break. Mikael and Kim played an exceptional tie-break and emerged victorious with a score of 10-4, securing the championship.

Lens are second on 63 points, three ahead of third-placed Olympique Marseille, who travel to Lorient on Sunday. Strasbourg remain in 16th on 26 points.
Wing back Przemyslaw Frankowsk opened the scoring for Lens in the 10th minute, calmly slotting his effort into the bottom corner past Strasbourg keeper Matz Sels following Adrien Thomasson’s cutback.
The goal was initially ruled out for offside, but after an anxious wait for a VAR check, a huge roar erupted at the Stade Bollaert-Delelis when it was given.
Lens kept up the pressure as they looked to put the game to bed, but a string of saves from Sels ensured the hosts were not out of sight by halftime.
Argentine defender Facundo Medina then made it 2-0 in the 64th minute, connecting sweetly with a volley when the ball dropped to him on the edge of the area.
The side from Alsace pulled a goal back with five minutes to go with a  curling Kevin Gameiro effort catching Brice Samba napping in the Lens  goal.
The visitors chased the equaliser but instead finished a man down after Habib Diallo was sent off in injury time.
Lens held on to win their 13th out of 15 home league games, more than any team in the top five European leagues.

8,Seifert blasts New Zealand to T20 series win over Sri Lanka,QUEENSTOWN: Tim Seifert was the match-winner for the second straight game as New Zealand clinched the Twenty20...,"QUEENSTOWN: Tim Seifert was the match-winner for the second straight game as New Zealand clinched the Twenty20 International series against Sri Lanka with a tense four-wicket victory here at the John Davies Oval on Saturday.
Seifert blasted a career-high 88 off 48 balls to fire the Black Caps to 183-6 from 19.5 overs after the tourists had posted 182-6 in the third and final game.
The opener struck 10 fours and three sixes in an innings that bore many of the hallmarks of his unbeaten 79 when New Zealand levelled the series at Dunedin on Wednesday.
Captain Tom Latham provided the only meaningful support with 31 off 23 and New Zealand’s middle order nearly conspired to lose the game after Seifert departed with four overs remaining.
Needing to score at little more than a run-a-ball at that stage, the Black Caps stuttered.
Needing 10 runs to win off the final over bowled by Lahiru Kumara (3-38), Mark Chapman struck a six off the first ball before he was the first of three New Zealand wickets to fall.
With two still needed off the last two deliveries, Rachin Ravindra held his nerve to find a gap in the outfield and secure the 2-1 series win.
Latham conceded the run chase should not have become so tight at the death. “They put us under pressure so it was good to see the way the guys responded to that,” Latham said. “The way Timmy Seifert went out there and played was really important but obviously it wasn’t ideal going down to the last couple of balls.
“I’d say we always had it under control though.”
It completes a disappointing tour for Sri Lanka, who lost the Test and ODI series by the same 2-0 scoreline but were more competitive in the shortest format.
Captain Dasun Shanaka said his team adjusted gradually to New Zealand conditions and suggested Sri Lankan cricket officials should take careful note.
“I think it’s about preparation. We should make sure when we come here again, we should come at least two weeks, three weeks before we play,” Shanaka said.
“Once we got into the T20 series we started looking a different team.”
Sri Lanka gave themselves a shot at victory after Kusal Mendis struck a rapid 73 off 48 balls, taking full advantage after being dropped by Daryl Mitchell at slip when on 10.
The opener went on to hit six fours and five sixes in his 12th half-century, falling just short of his career-high score of 79. Having been asked to bat, Mendis was the dominant figure in an opening stand of 76 with Pathum Nissanka (25 off 25), before putting on a further 46 with Kusal Perera (33 off 21).
Wickets fell rapidly over the closing overs, preventing the tourists from going close to 200.
Seifert has not been included in New Zealand’s squad for the white ball tour of Pakistan beginning on Friday as he is expecting the arrival of his first child.

9,Pair of own goals see Pakistan fall to Hong Kong,Pakistan will look to grab a consolation win in their final group game when they face hosts Tajikistan on Tuesday.,"HISOR (Tajikistan): Two own goals late in the second half saw the Pakistan women’s football team fall to a 2-0 defeat to Hong Kong here on Saturday, their second successive loss in the first round of qualifiers for next year’s Paris Olympics.
It was a better performance overall from the side than the one in the Group ‘E’ opener against the Phili­ppines, where they were thrashed 4-0, but the defeat at the Hisor Central Stad­i­um nevertheless end­ed Pakistan’s hopes of reaching the next round with only the group winners advancing to the next round.
Goalkeeper Nisha Ash­raf, who replaced Rumaysa Khan, put in a superb performance only to concede in the 73rd minute when she caught a long-range shot by Hong Kong skipper Chan Wing Sze but fell into her goal.
Pakistan then conceded in the final minute of the game with defender Sara Khan attempting to clear away a shot but only succeeding in turning the ball into her own net.
Adeel Rizki’s side will look to grab a consolation win in their final group game when they face hosts Tajikistan on Tuesday.

The appointment of Aleem, the three-time ICC Umpire of the Year, to the International Panel means he will remain eligible to officiate at international matches, including Paki­stan’s home international fixtures as well as the upcoming ICC major events such as the ICC Men’s World Cup 2023, ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024 and the ICC Champions Trophy 2025.
It may be mentioned here that 54-year-old Aleem last month stepped down from the Elite Panel, and it was expected that the PCB will recommend a new name from its ten-member international panel of umpires.

11,"Chelsea crash on Lampard return; United, Newcastle boost top-four bids","LONDON: Frank Lampard failed to spark Chelsea as his first game back in charge ended in a 1-0 defeat at Wolves, ...","LONDON: Frank Lampard failed to spark Chelsea as his first game back in charge ended in a 1-0 defeat at Wolves, while Manch­ester United and Newc­astle consolidated their hold on places in the Premier League’s top four on Saturday.
Lampard made a surprise return to Stamford Bridge on Thursday when he was appointed until the end of the season following Graham Potter’s sacking last Sunday after just seven months in charge.
But the ex-Chelsea midfielder, could not provide an immediate lift for the Blues. Chelsea remain 11th after a fourth consecutive game without a win.
The presence of Lampard, did little to inspire his players and Matheus Nunes won it for Wolves in the 32nd minute with a superb half-volley into the far corner from the edge of the area.
Lampard will now turn his attention to Wednesday’s Champions League quarter-final first leg at holders Real Madrid.
Meanwhile, at Old Trafford, Manchester United beat Everton 2-0 to stay fourth and leave the fourth-bottom visitors above the relegation zone on goal difference.
Goals from Scott McTominay and Anthony Martial edged United ever closer to a return to the Champions League next season.
Despite the win, United boss Erik ten Hag took aim at his side’s congested fixture schedule after Marcus Rashford limped off nine minutes from time.
Ten Hag was not happy at the timing of the match as United were in action for the third time in less than six days after losing at Newcastle last weekend and beating Brentford on Wednesday.
Third-placed Newcastle are above United on goal difference after a 2-1 success at Brentford made it five consecutive wins for the Magpies.
Ivan Toney’s weak 29th-minute penalty was saved by Nick Pope, the Brentford forward’s first miss from the spot since 2018.
Toney made amends when VAR ruled Alexander Isak’s challenge on Rico Henry was worthy of a 45th-minute penalty and this time the England striker made no mistake with his spot-kick.
But Newcastle equalised thro­ugh David Raya’s 54th-minute own goal as Joelinton’s chip went in off the Brentford goalkeeper.
And Isak put Newcastle in front after 61 minutes with a blistering finish from the edge of the area.
Tottenham Hotspur are three points behind Newcastle 
after beating Brighton 2-1 in north London.
Son Heung-min has endured a below-par season but the South Korea forward put Tottenham ahead with a superb long-range curler into the top corner after 10 minutes.
It took Son’s Premier League tally to 100 goals, making him the first Asian player to reach that landmark.
Lewis Dunk headed Brighton’s equaliser from Solly March’s corner in the 34th minute.
Cristian Stellini, still in charge of Tottenham after Antonio Conte’s recent departure, and Brighton boss Roberto De Zerbi were both sent off after a touchline spat in the second half.
But Harry Kane, Tottenham’s record goalscorer, lashed home the winner in the 79th minute.
Aston Villa climbed to sixth place as their Unai Emery-inspired revival gathered pace with a 2-0 home win against third-bottom Nottingham Forest.
Bertrand Traore gave Villa the lead in the 48th minute and Ollie Watkins got the second in the final moments to leave Forest without a win in nine games as the pressure mounts on boss Steve Cooper.
Elsewhere, West Ham boosted their survival bid as Harrison Reed’s 23rd-minute own goal sealed a 1-0 win at Fulham.
Bournemouth rose out of the relegation zone thanks to a 1-0 win at second-bottom Leicester, who were booed off after Philip Billing punished James Maddison’s sloppy back-pass in the 40th minute.

12,Working to improve my bowling: Ihsanullah,"“My length ball lifts sharply and [now] I am working to make it more effective. Similarly, I am trying to further improve my yorkers,” 20-year-old pacer says.","LAHORE: Upcoming Pakistan pacer Ihsanullah on Saturday said he was working to improve his bowling during the ongoing national training camp set up here at the Gaddafi Stadium for the forthcoming home series against New Zealand.
The series comprising five ODIs and as many T20 Internationals starts on April 14 with the first T20I match at the Gaddafi Stadium.
“My length ball lifts sharply and [now] I am working to make it more effective. Similarly, I am trying to further improve my yorkers,” Ihsanullah, who bowled the fastest delivery of HBL Pakistan Super League earlier this year while representing Multan Sultans, told reporters at the camp.
“[Bowling coach] Umar Gul is helping me improve my bowling at this camp.”
The 20-year-old Ihsanullah from Khyber Agency caught attraction during the PSL 8 when he bowled a magnificent spell in just his second match, against Quetta Gladiators, taking five wickets for just 12 runs in four overs.
The right-armer finished the league as the second-best bowler with a haul of 22 wickets from 12 matches at an excellent average of 15.77.
To a question, the fast bowler said though he had not set any target for the forthcoming series against New Zealand, taking main wickets would be his primary aim.
“Playing alongside world-class bowlers like Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris Rauf is an honour for me. I will use this opportunity to hone my skills,” Ihsanullah said while regarding former Pakistan speedster Shoaib Akhtar as a model for him to follow.
Terming the touring New Zealand team a strong squad, Ihsanullah said Pakistan would try their best to win the series.

13,Shaheens tour ‘a step away’ from Pakistan selection: Cheema,PCB is looking to arrange tours for the Pakistan Shaheens side to cut down quality gap between country’s domestic level and international level.," 

PAKISTAN Shaheens head coach Aizaz Cheema talks to media at the Hanif Mohammad High Performance Centre on Saturday.—courtesy PCB

KARACHI: Some of the country’s best players in the domestic circuit, who have struggled to find a place in the national team either due to rigorous competition for places or mere lack of favour for them, will have a chance to prove themselves in Pakistan Shaheens’ upcoming tour to Zimbabwe, the side’s head coach Aizaz Cheema has said.
Seven out of the 15 players selected for the tour – which runs from May 3-27 and includes a four-day and six one-day matches — have played for Pakistan but couldn’t cement their place in the national side, including the likes of Imran Butt, Hussain Talat and Aamir Jamal.
The remaining players are those who have shown immense promise in the domestic circuit but there is doubt about their ability to adjust readily at the international stage.
Calling the Shaheens’ opportunity “a step away” from the national side, Aizaz believed the Zimbabwe tour would have important answers in store.
“The players who have been selected for the tour have earned it through their performances in the past,” he told reporters at the National Stadium here on Saturday.
“[The Pakistan Shaheens tour] is a great opportunity for them to put in great performances and increase their chances to make it to the national side, which is just one step away for these players.”
Aizaz, who is famous for his final over that won Pakistan the 2012 Asia Cup final against Bangladesh, retired from the sport as a player back in 2019 before reinventing himself as a coach a year later.
The former right-arm pacer has worked players across the domestic circuit over the past three years and believed he knew how to get the best of them now that he has been appointed as the Pakistan Shaheens head coach.
“I’ve assessed all these players over the past two to three years being involved with the PCB as a coach at the domestic level,” he said.
“My conversations with them have been mostly about how the call up is a reward for their consistent performances during the period and that it’s a great opportunity for them to earn in a place in the Pakistan squad.”
The new Pakistan Cricket Board regime under its Management Committee’s interim chairman Najam Sethi has shown intent towards providing domestic performers enough opportunities to help them knock at the doors of the national side.
They treated Pakistan’s recent three-match T20 International series against Afghanistan as an opportunity to test a host of new names, though Pakistan lost the series 2-1.
However, the PCB is looking to arrange tours for the Pakistan Shaheens side to cut down the quality gap between the country’s domestic level and the international level.

14,Rahm narrows Koepka’s lead at Masters,"AUGUSTA: After a rainy night in Georgia, Spain’s Jon Rahm returned to a wet and windy Augusta National and ...","AUGUSTA: After a rainy night in Georgia, Spain’s Jon Rahm returned to a wet and windy Augusta National and narrowed overnight leader Brooks Koepka’s advantage to two strokes.
Rahm, one of the 39 players who had to complete their delayed second rounds on Saturday, had been within a shot of Koepka before bogeying the final hole.
Five-times Masters winner Tiger Woods managed to battle through the wet and windy conditions to make the cut at three-over par 147 after shooting a one-over 73, but Rory McIlroy was among the big names to miss out on the final two rounds.
The second round completed and the cut made, the third round got under way at 11:30 a.m. with threesomes off split tees in a bid to complete the round before sunset.
Spaniard Rahm had an eventful session back on course, making birdies on the par-3 12th and par-5 15th before, in driving rain, he bogeyed by three-putting the par-3 16th.
The world number three quickly made amends on the par-4 17th, where he rolled in a six-foot putt from the fringe for birdie.
Three-putting the final hole, however, left Rahm on 10-under 134 overall after shooting rounds of 65 and 69 as he targets a second major win to follow his 2021 triumph at the US Open.
“But I would have taken even par in the last four holes either way, and going through this afternoon, hopefully we play and I go with a lot of confidence,” Rahm said.
Conditions could be challenging on the rain-soaked course.
“We don’t know what kind of conditions we’re going to have. The weather’s supposed to get worse,” said Rahm.
“The greens have somehow maintained somewhat firm... but we don’t know what’s going to happen. Just a couple of greens that already had some water on them, and we’ll see but obviously if I play a little bit longer, might not be able to be as aggressive in some spots.” Friday’s play had been cut short after stormy weather descended on Augusta National, with three of the course’s trademark tall pine trees blowing over.
Organisers said that no spectators had been injured by the falling trees and while there was wind and the rain continued to fall on Saturday, there was no sign of thunder or lightning, which would halt play.
Temperatures have dropped sharply in the area, falling from 87 degrees F (30.5 C) in the bright sunshine of the opening round to 50 (10) on Saturday.
Four-time major winner Koepka, who plays on the breakaway LIV Golf series, is the man to catch after an outstanding opening two rounds.
At 118th in the world, Koepka would be the lowest-ranked player to win the Masters since the rankings system was introduced in 1986.
The current holder of that distinction is Angel Cabrera of Argentina, who was ranked 69th when he won the green jacket in 2009.
Woods, looking glum as he limped through the rain trying to avoid missing the cut for the first time as a professional, needed some help to get over the cut line.
The 15-time major winner looked to have blown his chance when he made bogey on each of the last two holes to fall back to three-over.
But his friend Justin Thomas, last year’s PGA Championship winner, then bogeyed the final two holes himself to move the cut line to three-over, saving Woods and ensuring he made the cut for a 23rd consecutive effort, matching the Masters record also shared by Gary Player and Fred Couples.
McIlroy shot a five over-par 77 with seven bogeys on Friday, leaving him 17 strokes behind pace-setter Koepka and condemned to his second missed Masters cut in three years.
Sandy Lyle, the first British player to win the Masters in 1988, had been forced to leave the course on Friday whilst on the 18th green in his last Masters.
The Scotsman returned to putt out his round in 83 after his opening round 81 and received an emotional farewell from spectators who had flocked to the green.
