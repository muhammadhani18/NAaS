The fire broke out on the third floor of Arkay Square (Extension) due to a short circuit. It spread to the 10th floor through ducts causing breathing problems for employees; however, around 100 people, including women, were evacuated from the building.
According to City SSP Arif Aziz, one person, identified as Ali Asghar, 46, died and Rati Lal, 28, Arsalan, 23, and Asif Masih, 23, fell unconscious. The dead and the passed out persons were taken to the Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi.
Police Surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed said that the body of Asghar was almost completely burnt. His relatives took away his body without allowing doctors to fulfil medico-legal formalities.
“Initial reports suggest the fire was caused by a short circuit,” said the City SSP in a statement.
Chief Fire Officer of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation Ishtiaq Ahmed told journalists that several persons, including three unconscious persons, and 10 women were rescued.
He said that the fire was put out after hectic efforts of two hours. He added that due to severity of the situation, fire engines were called in from across the metropolis.

The fire that broke at 10:35am spread through different offices. However, he added that the fire was put out and cooling work had been completed by 3:30pm.
When this reporter visited the scene at around 3pm, Shahrah-i-Liaquat was opened for traffic, parts of Arkay Square walls had been blackened while one police mobile and one fire engine were standing there.
Several office-bearers of the building union were sitting at the entrance of the building.
When approached by Dawn, one of the union representatives, who wished not to be named, said that Arkay Square (Ext.) was a big building with 228 offices up to the 10th floor. At present, a total of 196 offices were occupied mostly by shipping and clearing agents while the rest were closed or unoccupied.

3,Court rejects another acquittal plea of Dr Asim in Rs17bn graft case,KARACHI: An accountability court on Saturday dismissed an application  of Pakistan Peoples Party leader and former...,"KARACHI: An accountability court on Saturday dismissed an application  of Pakistan Peoples Party leader and former petroleum minister Dr Asim  Hussain seeking acquittal in a multi-billion-rupee corruption case.
Dr  Asim, a close aide to former president Asif Ali Zardari, has been  facing a Rs17 billion corruption reference filed by the National  Accountability Bureau in 2015.
In August 2015, the former  petroleum minister was arrested during a raid at the Sindh Higher  Education Commission office in the Clifton area.
He was also  accused of concealing assets, illegal allotments, land grabbing, misuse  of authority, fraud and giving illegal contracts during his tenure as  federal petroleum minister in the Sui Southern Gas Pipelines Limited  (SSGPL).
Although Dr Asim has repeatedly denied any wrongdoings, the judge observed that the applicant failed to make out a  case for his acquittal under Section 265-K  (power of Court to acquit accused at any stage) of the Criminal  Procedure Code since the trial was at an important state of recording  testimonies of the accused persons, including the applicant himself.
The court fixed April 17 as the next date of hearing and summoned prosecution witnesses to record their statement.
Earlier  in March, the accountability court had dismissed the acquittal  application of Dr Asim in another case allegedly pertaining to Rs460bn corruption.
He  has been facing trial in a case pertaining to misusing his authority as  the federal petroleum minister to get plots allotted fraudulently and  also encroaching upon state land for expansion of his Dr Ziauddin  Hospital/Trust, money laundering, illegal gains, kickbacks, commission  through fertiliser cartel for illegal curtailment of gas for  exploitative price hike, etc.

4,Business as usual at Karachi zoo despite mounting concerns over Noor Jehan’s survival,"Ailing elephant is being shouted at and maltreated by zoo keepers; zoo admin refuses to bear cost of her medicines, forcing vets’ team to provide financial assistance.","• Ailing elephant is being shouted at and maltreated by zoo keepers, Dawn visit reveals
• Govt didn’t spend money on her treatment as Four Paws bore major expenses
KARACHI: The Karachi Zoo is back to its laid-back style of operation a day after the departure of Four Paws’ team, creating heightened concerns over the survival and well-being of ailing elephant Noor Jehan among animal activists, it emerged on Saturday.
The 17-year-old elephant currently experiencing initial signs of improvement has recently been described by foreign experts as “an intensive care patient” after they diagnosed her with a large hematoma in her abdomen, causing edema in the reproductive organs and blocking the passage of urine and stool.
On Saturday, a visit to the facility, which is being operated by the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation, showed that the ailing elephant was unable to timely receive her daily doses of medicines, her feed comprising tree branches, and was being shouted at and maltreated by the keepers.
Whereas Madhubala, the other female elephant, was kept in a barren enclosure, exposing her directly to sweltering weather against the advice of the experts, who had recommended that she should be provided protection from direct sunlight on hot summer days.
Sharing her reservations, Pakistan Animal Welfare Society (Paws) co-founder Mahera Omar, who has been fighting for zoo elephants’ welfare for several years now, said Noor Jehan needed intensive care and experts’ recommendations in this respect should be taken very seriously.
“Experts’ advice is mandatory to be followed, otherwise she will die. She should timely get her medicines along with multivitamins, be fed with the right diet, treated with hydrotherapy and encouraged in a friendly manner to walk as much as possible,” Ms Omar said, adding that the vets had asked the staff not to chain the animals and allow them to walk freely.
Sources said that the zoo lacked sufficient supplies of water to offer daily sessions of hydrotherapy to the ailing elephant that would help reduce the severity of her illness.
“The vets had asked us to feed a mixture to the elephant containing boiled rice and the medicines. But, the zoo doesn’t have any gas connection and we will be boiling rice by burning wood and plastic,” a staff member shared with Dawn on the condition of anonymity.
The sources also shared that the nine members of the international animal welfare group had arranged their travel, equipment and accommodation expenses on their own.
The zoo administration also refused to bear the cost of Noor Jehan’s medicines, forcing the vets’ team to provide financial assistance in this regard as well.
‘Noor Jehan may not walk properly’
Mathias Otto, who possesses over 30-year experience in elephant care, spent his last day at the zoo before leaving for his home country on Sunday, offering tips to zoo keepers on how to look after Noor Jehan.
“What’s important for her right now is her movement. Both animals should be given lots of tree branches that are good for their teeth as well,” he said, adding that the zoo was noisy and too hot, creating stress for the elephants.
He pointed out that at times he found it tough to deal with keepers who ignored his advice and do what they liked. “She might not be able to walk properly. But, one should hope for the best.”
When contacted, Karachi Administrator Dr Saif-ur-Rehman stated that the department would address all concerns pertaining to Noor Jehan’s welfare.
“Citizens must not get disappointed. It was the government that arranged the crane and other facilities required for diagnosis and we would do the same in the coming days,” he said.

6,"Flaws in enumeration do not bode well for census results, says minister",• Calls for extending deadline as many areas have been left uncounted • Not a single reservation of Sindh has been,"• Calls for extending deadline as many areas have been left uncounted
• Not a single reservation of Sindh has been addressed, claims Ghani                                              
KARACHI: With only a day left in the completion of the digital census across the country, the controversy surrounding the national exercise is yet to over as a key member of the Sindh government on Saturday claimed that “not a single reservation” of the provincial administration was addressed by the Centre and warned that any outcome of the exercise under these circumstances would further deepen the crisis that had emerged after the 2017 national census.
Speaking at the Meet the Press programme of the Karachi Press Club, senior PPP leader and Sindh Labour and Human Resources Minister Saeed Ghani demanded another extension in the deadline and referred to number of areas in Karachi alone where citizens had not been yet approached by the census staff and many households still remained uncounted. 
“Till today, not a single point that we have raised has been addressed [for census by the federal government],” he said. “I demand that government extend the deadline of this census because it is not possible to complete the work by April 10. I fear that the way this census is being carried out, it’s not going to fix the flaws of 2017 census. It will further deepen the crisis and create more challenges.” 
He cited a parallel exercise carried out by the Sindh government just to countercheck the fairness and effectiveness of the digital census which led to surprising results. 
“We conducted our own research in some areas,” he said. “It’s quite surprising that even today no census staff has visited those places. There’s been no household and population count in those areas. And this I am talking about a few where we have reached. There would be many more.” 
The Karachi division president of the ruling party then referred to several ‘anomalies’ in the design of digital census, which he said “doesn’t make sense”. 
Slams secrecy of data 
“There should be a difference between privacy and secrecy,” he said. “Keeping privacy of people’s data and their families is one thing, but keeping it secret even from them isn’t justifiable. Being guardian of a family, I should know that members of my family have been fairly counted. But there’s no mechanism for me to check it out. This puts a question mark over the whole design of the census.”
The minister was not happy over the federal government’s approach to keep the provincial administration away from the process while using all its resources and manpower. He called for effective and coordinated role of district administrations for effective results. 
“It sounds so funny that you have taken district administration on board for the census, but you don’t share details or give them access which would ultimately benefit all of us,” he said. 
“For instance, the assistant commissioner is responsible for carrying out household and population count in his or her sub-division but he or she is not given access to data to check the details of the total count. He or she is also not authorised to check whether population under his or her administration has been counted or not,” he said, adding: “You aren’t sharing data of his family with the guardian and you are not giving access to data to a civil servant of that particular area who’s leading the whole exercise. What this secrecy is all about?” 
Local government elections 
Regarding January 15 local government elections, he said that being the single largest party, it was the PPP which deserved to bring its candidate as the Karachi mayor. 
He was also hopeful about the prospects of the party for the upcoming April 18 by-elections in 11 union committees (UCs) where polls weren’t held due to deaths of the candidates. 
“The Pakistan Peoples Party has sincerely served the people of Karachi without any discrimination,” he claimed. “The party has been able to win over the Karachiites by serving them in the best possible manner. We have emerged as the most popular political party in Karachi after the latest local government elections. The mayor of Karachi would belong to the Pakistan Peoples Party.” 
Saeed Sarbazi and Shoaib Ahmed, the president and secretary of the KPC, also spoke.

7,Trailer and songs of Daadal launched,The film will be released countrywide on Eid,"

Actors Mohsin Abbas Haider, Sonya Hussain and Rizwan Ali Jaffri.—Dawn

 
KARACHI: After a hiatus of a few months, the trailer launch for, and three songs of, an upcoming film Daadal attracted on Friday evening at Cinepax Cinema a big number of journalists that cover cultural events. While the writer and director of the movie Abu Aleeha could not make it to the function for reasons that weren’t provided to the media, the cast — Sonya Hussain, Mohsin Abbas Haider and Rizwan Ali Jaffri — along with the producer of the project, Neha Laaj, turned up. 
The two male lead actors — Mohsin Abbas Haider and Rizwan Ali Jaffri — were the first ones to arrive for the red carpet razzmatazz. The red carpet space was a bit smaller than what one is used to seeing, perhaps which is why the actors’ stay there was brief. Sonya Hussain arrived later.
After a bit of the familiar showbizy hullabaloo, the attendees went into one of cinema halls located in the facility. Proceedings began with the trailer for the film. It was followed by three songs. The first one, sung by the rapper Eva B, was filmed on the female protagonist; the second, the male version of that track, on Rizwan Jaffri; and the third, a different song focused on Mohsin Abbas.
The question-answer session did not last for long either. Replying to a query, Ms Hussain, who’s playing a boxer from Lyari in the movie, said she usually does roles that do not require her to be decked up. It was an amazing experience for her to work in that neighbourhood. “I got to realise by being there that Karachi’s real artists come from Lyari. Footballers, boxers etc… The reason for making the film was that we don’t look at Lyari the way it should be looked at.” 

The film will be released countrywide on Eid

Mr Haider told the media that during the shooting of the project the cast spent a good deal of time in Lyari and interacted with its residents. “They are a very welcoming, loving people. We got to learn that never believe in stories that you hear.”
Mr Jaffri said he started his career as a model. It’s a field where the focus is on aesthetics. “[But] in this film, I’ve tried to look as maila (rough and tough) as possible. It was a great experience.” 
Neha Laaj delivered the vote of thanks. Ghalib Kamal moderated the launch.
According to a press release, Daadal is a crime mystery revolving around a well-known female boxer from Lyari who becomes a contract killer in order to avenge her sister’s honor.

8,Two ‘contract killers’ held in Gulistan-i-Jauhar,"KARACHI: Police on Saturday claimed to have arrested two suspected killers, who got supari, an arrangement under...","KARACHI: Police on Saturday claimed to have arrested two suspected killers, who got supari, an arrangement under which an assassin is paid a particular amount of money to kill someone, from abroad to target a prominent doctor to spread fear and chaos in the city.
Gulshan SP Zafar Changla told a press conference at his office that the Gulistan-i-Jauhar police and an intelligence agency carried out a joint raid near Kamran Chowrangi and apprehended two suspects — Mursaleen alias Firdous and Sagheer Ali alias Bhai.
He said that the held suspects disclosed to investigators their plan to target a prominent doctor next week in the city for which they had got Rs900,000 supari from their handlers in Dubai. A local facilitator had already paid them Rs50,000. 
They were asked to make a video of assassination and then to disappear from the city, the SP said, adding that the arrests were made on a tip-off.
Without disclosing the name of the doctor, the police officer said that it appeared that the plan to target another doctor after the recent murder of Dr Birbal was aimed at spreading chaos and fear in the metropolis.
About the killing of educationist Syed Khalid Raza, who was targeted outside his Gulistan-i-Jauhar home on Feb 21, he said that police made some progress in the case. He added that Mufti Abdul Qayum was gunned down in Gulistan-i-Jauhar on March 26 and the police had arrested two suspects who disclosed to have targeted the cleric after taking money.

“Census is our red line and this red line is being crossed,” senior MQM-P leader Khawja Izharul Hasan said, maintaining that he personally believed that his party should take its own path if the demands were not accepted.
However, he said that the party’s coordination committee would take a decision on quitting the PDM-led coalition government after the census.
Khawaja Izhar said that the MQM-P would not be responsible if the judiciary ran the country or martial law was imposed in the wake of the ongoing political crisis.
He said that former prime minister Imran Khan had not fulfilled any of his promises. 
The deputy convener of the coordination committee was addressing the participants of an Iftar dinner organised for the public at Osama Family Park in Mehmoodabad Town.
Members of the coordination committee, party MPAs, Administrator DMC-East Syed Shakeel Ahmed Town also attended the Iftar dinner. 
He said that the purpose for which the MQM-P was split was destroyed as the party benefited from the party’s split was today standing against the state itself.
The MQM-P leader said that the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, which was party’s ally in the previous government, kept allying with every party through which MQM-P could be defeated in Karachi.
“The alliance by PTI was malicious,” he said, adding that as an ally, every time a delegation of new people would come and give false assurances.
Khawaja Izhar said that he had no hope from Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz and Pakistan Peoples Party. “There was a hope from Imran Khan, but were given only false promises,” he added.
He said that the MQM-P was the party of poor middle class and added that the party had boycotted the local government elections because they thought that no ‘wadera’ could represent the poor class.
He said that as always, the party would send representatives to the elected houses from the grassroots level.
Separately, MQM-P Convener Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui said that Karachi would never accept fake and contrived census.
Addressing the participants of an Iftar dinner at Burns Road, he said that country’s problems would be solved without giving rights to the heirs of Pakistan. “It is country’s duty and our right to be counted correctly in the census,” he added.
Dr Siddiqui said that Karachi gave over 70 per cent revenue and added that the country would prosper if the city’s problems were solved.
He said that the MQM-P believed that all nationalities had responsibility of protecting the ideology of Pakistan. 
“When you put the oppressed against the wall, their voice will be raised,” he added.

10,"Woman accuses Hyderabad CIA officials, SHO of killing kidnapped brother in front of family",She tells court Rs10m had already been paid as ransom; says Siyal was investigating alleged involvement of police in drug mafia and mainpuri sale.,"HYDERABAD: The Hyderabad district and sessions court has sought DIG’s report and comments of other officers on a woman’s application for the registration of an FIR against SSPs and CIA in-charges of Hyderabad and Khairpur Mir districts, as well as the Phulelli SHO, alleging that her brother had been killed in a “staged” encounter.
Additional District Judge-VII Naveed Ahmed Soomro on Thursday issued notices to the respondents directing them to appear in court on April 11.
Ms Reshma is the sister of a young man, Farhan Ali Siyal, who was killed by the Phulelli police in what they claimed to be an encounter on March 28.
Her application was transferred by a sessions judge to the ADJ-VII.

She tells court Rs10m had already been paid as ransom

Represented by Advocate Raja Jawad, the applicant has cited Hyderabad SSP Amjad Shaikh and Khairpur SSP Mirs Rohil Khoso; SHO Ayaz Bughio of the Phulelli police station, CIA in-charges Muneer Abbasi (Hyderabad) and Hanif Khoso (Khairpur Mirs), along with nine other policemen as respondents.
She stated that Farhan Siyal had got a mass communication degree from Sindh University. Being interested in investigative journalism, he started collecting data of drug mafia and manufacturers and sellers of mainpuri and gutka, and alleged involvement of police in such activities, she added.
He had been working in Phulelli, Paretabad, where police purportedly received Rs30 million for allowing illegal sale of mainpuri and gutka, she said.
Ms Reshma stated in her application that at about 2am in the night between March 11 and 12, Farhan received a call and the caller asked him to come to Nasim Nagar Chowk as he wanted to share some information regarding ‘police dealing’.
Farhan, along with his brother Sajjan Siyal, went there, asked Sajjan to wait at some distance from where the meeting was to be held.
She stated that Sajjan saw two double cabin vehicles arriving there and seven to eight persons riding it but could not recognise them. Later, one of them was identified as Hanif Khoso, the CIA in-charge of Khairpur Mirs district. They took away Farhan while Sajjan helplessly looked on, she stated.
On March 13, she further stated, Sajjan received a call from an unidentified person who demanded Rs10m on behalf of police officials and issued threat of dire consequences if the demand was not met. On March 15, Sajjan received another call and an image of the FIR bearing No. 47/23 registered against an unknown suspect, and the caller threatened that if Rs10m demand was not met, then Farhan would be named in such blind FIRs.
The complainant said that fearing for the life of Farhan, her family started arranging Rs10m. Finally, the money was transferred online through Deedar Ahmed Siyal after Sajjan received a call to seek transfer of money in account No. 007901455203 of HBL’s Ghalla Mandi road branch, Ghotki, in the name of “A Karim Enterprise”. After the money transfer, they demanded another Rs2m for the delay and expenses for keeping Farhan, she said.
She said Sajjan talked to policemen, asking them to let the family meet Farhan. On March 28, one person called her and Sajjan, asking them to come near the Hatri police station. Ms Reshma stated that she and her family members were taken to the spot blindfolded in a mobile van and the applicant saw Hanif Khoso, Ramzan Meer Ali, Ayaz Bughio, Muneer Abbasi (who all were armed) and other armed policemen there. She said she also saw Farhan Ali sitting there blindfolded.
She said the family members witnessed marks of injuries, in the light of a torch, on his face, forehead and nose. When Muneer demanded Rs2m, he was told that the money would be paid, but they should release Farhan first.
She quoted CIA in-charge Hanif Khoso as saying that since they (the family) had deceived police, they would have to pay for it and then “he [Hanif] fired on Farhan, causing two bullet injuries to Farhan’s chest,” she claimed. She alleged that Ayaz Bughio also fired on Farhan’s belly and Muneer Abbasi on the left side of his chest. The police threatened them (the family) to remain silent because the SSPs of Khairpur and Hyderabad were in contact with them (the accused) and if they disclosed the incident to anyone, they would also be murdered.
She alleged that Hanif Khoso and others in connivance with the Hyderabad SSP and SHO Ayaz Bughio claimed Farhan’s killing in an encounter and registered a false FIR (No. 38/23) at the Phulelli police station. She claimed that the medico legal officer concerned issued a fake certificate and did not show injuries of Farhan to “favour” the respondents.
She prayed the court to order formation of a JIT (joint investigation team) and ensure a fair investigation into the whole episode.

12,Operation launched in Kandhkot in wake  of Prof Sawand’s murder,HYDERABAD/SUKKUR: Kandhkot police claimed on Saturday to have launched a crackdown against outlaws operating in the...,"HYDERABAD/SUKKUR: Kandhkot police claimed on Saturday to have launched a crackdown against outlaws operating in the district’s riverine area following murder of assistant professor Ajmal Sawand of the Institute of Business Administration (IBA) Sukkur a day before in a targeted attack allegedly by Sundrani tribesmen, who were rivals of the tribe he belonged to.
Police officials said they had razed several houses of Sundrani tribesmen, which were functioning as their hideouts. Sundranis and Sawands living in the riverine area of Kandhkot district have been at loggerheads with each other over ‘honour’ and the subsequent dispute has led to several deaths on both sides over the past few months.
Kandhkot-Kashmore SSP Irfan Samo confirmed the operation was moving ahead at full throttle in different parts of the riverine area in the district and police would not give up till the culprits involved in Prof Sawand’s murder surrendered. “We have taken actions in the village of Sardar Khan Sundrani, who was a relative of Sindh Assembly member Abid Sundrani,” said the SSP.
Police had destroyed outlaws’ houses in the Ghor Ghat area as the criminals had already fled after the professor’s murder, he claimed.
Prof Sawand sustained shots by 11 bullets as per medical reports cited by the SSP. Sawands had been in war with Sabzoi tribe in upper Sindh for several years and had settled in Sukkur a long time ago. Prof Sawand did not seek security from police when he travelled to his riverine village. “His brother asked him to accompany him but he didn’t agree to it and took it lightly. He was an educated man and never believed in tribal sensitivities,” said Samo.
“Sawand reached Kandhkot without intimating anyone and then left for his riverine village without informing police early on Thursday morning and subsequently he was ambushed by a dozen or so gunmen in the area of A-Section police station, Kandhkot,” he said. The SSP said the complainant Mohammad Ashraf Sawand, brother of Prof Sawand had nominated 12 men in the FIR who he believed were involved in the murder but they had fled their homes.
The suspects, who were mostly relatives of the alleged attackers included Aijaz Ali, Rano Sundrani, Bakhtyar Ali, Wahid Bux, Saifal, Ghulam Mustafa, Zahid, Mohammad Ali, Farman, Maindro Sundrani and Rahib.
He said that Sawand-Sundrani dispute started in the wake of an incident of honour killing in which a Sawand man killed some Sundrani tribesmen followed by killings of two Sawand tribesmen and then tit-for-tat murders of three Sudnrani tribesmen by Sawands.
The officer hoped the culprits would be arrested soon as raids were being conducted in the villages of Wahid Bux, Sardar Khan, Bahram Khan and Bakht Sundrani.
Govt doesn’t want to end tribal system: Palijo
Qaumi Awami Tehreek president Ayaz Latif Palijo has said that hundreds of people are losing their lives in tribal clashes in upper Sindh’s Sukkur and Larkana divisions, which have been in the tight clasp of feudal lords but Sindh government does not want seriously to end this lawlessness as it is itself patronising the tribal system.
Palijo said in a statement issued here on Saturday that rising incidents of kidnapping for ransom had destroyed peace in Jacobabad, Ghotki and Kandhkot districts. This instability would provide an opportunity to anti-Pakistan forces to try to take its advantage, he said.
He said that Sindh’s ruler had only given it bloodbath, dacoits, corruption, tribal system, suicides, floods, price hike, lawlessness and narcotics. Bloody tribal feuds had become an identity of PPP government and since there was no rule of law hooliganism and lawlessness ruled the roost, he said.
He said that different tribes routinely carried out attacks on each other over petty issues causing deaths of dozens of people on all sides. Educational system in tribal land had suffered the most and the cure for the menace rested in education, enlightenment and accountability, he said.
IBA University holds reference
The Sukkur IBA University held on Saturday a condolence reference for its slain Assistant Professor Dr Ajmal Sawand, who was brutally murdered in Kandhkot.
The university’s vice chancellor, faculty and students demanded expeditious justice for Dr Sawand.
VC Prof Dr Asif Ahmed Shaikh said that all faculty members were deeply shocked and grieved by the brutal murder and would pursue the case at all forums of justice. “We are in contact with police and bereaved family and sincerely hope the culprits will be arrested soon,” he added.
Dr Sawand’s colleague Ghulam Nabi, who was working with him on SRSO projects at the university, recalled that Dr Sawand was a visionary person who always worked for the betterment of society by enabling youth in businesses and empowering women.
He said that Dr Sawand taught over 1000 poor student freelance courses and enabled them to earn online as freelancers. Dr Sawand faced many obstacles in his journey but he kept moving towards his goals, inspiring those around him, he said.
