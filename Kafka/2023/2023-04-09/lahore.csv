District Police Officer Rizwan Umar Gondal told the media on Saturday that the two minor sons of Dr Hassan Mehmood, the former medical superintendent of Khanpur Tehsil Headquarters Hospital, who were kidnapped while going to school in a car driven by their driver, by unidentified armed men, had been recovered by police.   
According to the DPO, the boys -- Shayaan (11) and Subhan (6) -- were traced and recovered with the coordination of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA),  
Bahawalpur, Crime Scene Unit, Crime Investigation Agency (CIA) and the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) units.
Without sharing detail of the kidnappers with the media, the DPO said the boys had been reunited with their family.
Police sources, however, say that the four suspects involved in the kidnapping had also been arrested. 
Meanwhile, the police also claimed to have recovered a 16-year-old kidnapped boy from the kacha area dacoits.  
The boy, Nasir, was kidnapped a few days ago allegedly by the dacoits of Kacha area when he was working in wheat fields near Basti Jhuk of Kacha Rojhan in Bhong police limits.
As per police sources, the children’s recovery was made by  special police team constituted by Regional Police Officer Rai Babar Saeed after the issue was raised in the on-going  session of the National Assembly by MNA Fayyaz Ahmed.
The four arrested suspects were taken to Rahim Yar Khan  by a police party for interrogation, the sources added.

1,LDA proposes amended design for Akbar Chowk,LAHORE: The design of the Rs3.1 billion Akbar Chowk Flyover and Underpass Project is set to be amended to save trees...,"LAHORE: The design of the Rs3.1 billion Akbar Chowk Flyover and Underpass Project is set to be amended to save trees and create signal-free intersections on Maulana Shaukat Ali Road from Jinnah Hospital to Pindi Stop.  
The Lahore Development Authority (LDA) is preparing a revised PC-I of the project, according to a senior LDA official. 
The work on the project will begin by next week as the court has allowed the LDA to do so after it received a report from the University of Engineering and Technology regarding the project’s environmental impact assessment.
“As per the previous design, the LDA was to construct an underpass at Akbar Chowk (while heading towards Model Town Link Road) and a flyover at the same intersection towards the Jinnah Hospital intersection and Allama Iqbal’s Karim Block intersection crossing Canal Road,” said the official.
“Since the design involved the cutting and transplanting of 59 trees, and the Lahore High Court as well as the environmental experts were too concerned on this issue, the LDA, decided to change the design.” 
The official said as per the original plan, the proposed flyover takes a slight curve to the right, passes over a maiden line for a while, then goes straight, and finally falls on its original side. This will cause trees to fall. The amended design takes the flyover straight instead of taking a curve at the intersection. 
As per the amended plan, there would be no underpass at the intersection (while heading towards Model Town Link Mor via Akbar Chowk), as this side would also have a flyover like the other side of the road.
“The revised design would now cost Rs4.9 billion, under which the Jinnah Hospital intersection would be made signal free for the traffic coming from Canal Road and Barkat Market. The motorists coming from Barkat Market to Thokar or Johar Town via Canal Road will take a left from the intersection, use a protected U-turn to take a right, and reach their destinations,” the official said, adding that other intersections, such as Model Town Link Mor, and Pindi Stop, would also have a signal free drive on Maulana Shaukat Ali Road.
The project cost would be shared, as Rs2 billion would be provided by the Punjab government and Rs2.9 billion by the LDA. The official said a plan to connect Maulana Shaukat Ali Road with the motorway (Babu Sabu) from Karim Block (Iqbal Town) intersection via Kharak Stop (Multan Road) has yet to be approved by the government as Rs11 billion is required for the project that involves an underpass or flyover at Karim Block intersection, another underpass at Kharak, protected U-turns, and remodeling interventions at certain locations. 
“If this is approved, the entire road from Babu Sabu to Kot Lakhpat, Qainch Stop, Ferozepur Road via Sabzazar, Kharak, Karim Block, Jinnah, Akbar Chowk. Model Town Link Mor, and Pindi Stop would be signal-free,” the official maintained.
SMBR: Senior Member Board of Revenue Nabeel Javaid on Friday directed the officers of various departments to treat visitors with good manners. Similarly, tax collection targets should be achieved on time. “All ongoing development schemes should be regularly monitored by the officers to ensure their timely completion, and the officers should immediately redress the complaints received on the citizens’ portal and complete the digital gardawari (land cultivation record) on time,” he said at a meeting here. 
“The remaining “mouza jaat” should also be computerized as soon as possible,” he added.

3,"Caretakers’ transfer, posting powers: PTI challenges ECP notification in LHC",The plea says postings being mechanically approved by ECP without checking them on touchstone of provisions of section 230 of Election Act 2017.,"LAHORE: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has filed a petition before the Lahore High Court challenging a notification of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) giving “blanket” powers to the caretaker government of Punjab to make transfers and postings of the officers in the province.
The petition filed through PTI senior vice president Fawad Chaudhry states that large-scale transfers/postings by the caretaker government are being mechanically approved by the ECP, without checking them on the touchstone of the provisions of section 230 of the Election Act 2017.
In several cases, it alleges, the transfer orders have been issued by the caretaker government, without even bothering to obtain prior approval from the ECP. The illegal exercise is going on, despite the fact that in several cases, the high court has suspended such unwarranted transfer orders, it adds.
It argues that the petitioner was taken aback, when through media reports, it was revealed that the ECP granted an unprecedented blanket permission to the caretaker government for the transfer and posting of the officers, in total oblivion to the provisions of the Election Act.
The petition pleads that seeking prior approval of the ECP by the caretaker government for each transfer and posting is mandatory under section 230(1)(f) of the Elections Act 2017, which provision cannot be dispensed with under the law.
It contends that without stopping the frequent transfers and removing the controversial officers from the pivotal executive posts in the province, the conduct of fair, free and transparent elections would not be possible.
The petition asks the court to set aside the impugned notification of the ECP issued on March 10 whereby it granted blanket permission to the caretaker government to transfer, post and appoint officers in the province without seeking prior approval from the commission.
It further urges the court that the ECP be restrained from mechanically granting approval to the unwarranted large-scale requests of transfers and postings submitted by the caretaker government unless each case of transfer is examined by the ECP under the criteria laid down in section 230 of the Elections Act, 2017.

4,"Ashiana case: Notices to NAB on acquittal pleas of Shehbaz, Cheema",Accountability court seeks NAB replies by April 28.,"LAHORE: An accountability court on Saturday issued notices to the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) on applications of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and former director general of the Lahore Development Authority Ahad Khan Cheema seeking their acquittal in Ashiana-i-Iqbal Housing Scheme.
The acquittal applications filed through Advocate Amjad Pervez said all the approvers and the witnesses of the NAB had resiled from their earlier statements and there was no possibility of their conviction in the reference.
The applicants asked the court to allow the applications and acquit them of the charges.
Duty Judge Rao Abdul Jabbar issued notices to the NAB for submission of the replies by April 28.
At the last hearing, five prosecution witnesses rejected the allegations of corruption or illegality in the housing scheme project.
The witnesses include deputy commissioner Layyah Khalid Pervez, design specialist Hussain Ahmad, research analyst of LDA Shahid Kamran and Mahmood Ahmad Sulheri.
Previously, former chief engineer of the LDA Israr Saeed, who was an approver of the NAB, also resiled from his earlier statement.
“My previous statement was under duress,” Saeed had said responding to the questions of defence counsel during his cross-examination.
He claimed that then NAB Lahore director general Shahzad Saleem, director Muhammad Rafi and case officer Aftab Ahmad had threatened him to record a false statement against Shehbaz Sharif.
 
 

In its reference, the NAB alleged that PM Shehbaz and other accused persons caused a huge loss to the national exchequer by awarding the contract of the housing scheme to a company without bidding.
Former principal secretary to prime minister Fawad Hassan Fawad, Kamran Kiyani, a brother of former army chief Ashfaq Parvez Kiani, and Nadeem Zia, one of the owners of Paragon City, are also accused in the reference.
PM Shehbaz was arrested on Oct 5, 2018, in Ashiana-i-Iqbal Housing Scheme reference when he appeared before the NAB in Punjab Saaf Pani Company’s case.
The NAB had arrested Cheema on Feb 21, 2018, on charges of misusing his authority with criminal intent and awarding Rs14 billion contracts of Ashiana scheme.
It alleged that Cheema received illegal gratification in the form of 32 kanals of land from the owners of Paragon City Developers in reward for the contract of the housing scheme awarded to its proxy firm namely Bismillah Engineering. Cheema was released on bail after almost two years in jail.

6,UHS approves new policy for MBBS 1st year exam,LAHORE: The University of Health Sciences (UHS) Academic Council and Board of Studies in Medicine approved a new...,"LAHORE: The University of Health Sciences (UHS) Academic Council and Board of Studies in Medicine approved a new assessment policy for the first-year MBBS in a joint meeting held here on Saturday. 
The policy has been framed in accordance with the new modular and integrated medical curriculum introduced by the university in its affiliated medical colleges this year.  
The meeting, presided over by UHA Vice-Chancellor Prof Ahsan Waheed Rathore, was attended by the principals and senior faculty of the affiliated institutions. UHS Registrar Prof Nadia Naseem and Controller of Examinations Prof Saqib Mahmood were also present.  
According to the new assessment policy, the first professional MBBS exam will comprise four papers having a total of 1,000 marks -- three papers based on the contents of the three blocks of the curriculum taught throughout the year, while the fourth of Islamiat and Pakistan Studies.  
Both the theory paper and practical exam will carry 150 marks each. Each multiple-choice question will carry one mark, while the short essay question will carry five marks.  
As per the new policy, major subjects in the MBBS first year include Anatomy, Physiology, and Biochemistry, with their clinical application, while the minor ones include Behavioral Sciences, Community Medicine, Public Health, Pathology, Pharmacology, and Clinical Foundation. Professionalism, ethics, information technology, research, leadership, and Holy Quran will also be taught in the first year. 
Under the policy, the concerned medical college will send the internal assessment of each student to the university based on the results of the block examinations and class attendance. The pass marks in university professional exams will be 50 percent. In the block examination, the student will be required to secure a minimum of 50pc marks. However, if the marks are less than 50pc in the block exam, the student will have to make up the shortfall in the next block exam.  
Under the new curriculum and examination policy, there will be no more send-up exams in medical colleges. 
Each practical exam will consist of 12 Objective Structured Practical Examination (OSPE) and three Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) stations. There will be three stations for the structured viva, each carrying 10 marks. The duration of the practical exam will be two and a half hours. For distinction, a candidate will have to secure a minimum of 85pc marks in aggregate, provided that he scores 80pc marks in the written examination.  
Addressing the meeting participants, UHS VC said the university would soon issue a model paper for the guidance of students and faculty.  
He said that internal and external examiners will be required to submit their marks separately to the university in the practicals to bring more transparency to the examinations.  
Dr Rathore further said the examination system was being revamped and from now on no faculty member would be appointed as an examiner unless he or she completed mandatory training workshops organised by the university. He added that a new, robust examination monitoring system was also put in place to check any irregularities.  
UHS Medical Education Director Dr Khalid Rahim briefed the participants on the new examination policy.  
The Academic Council nominated two professors -- Prof Dr Muhammad Shahzad and Prof Zahid Bashir -- as the members of the Finance and Planning Committee.  
The council also approved a panel consisting of four professors for the Affiliation Committee. The panel includes Prof Dr Allah Rakha, Prof Asif Qureshi, Prof Sameer Anwar and Prof Mulazim Hussain Bukhari.

7,harking back: The ‘fort’ and the ‘katcha kot’ … which came first?,"Last week we dwelt on defining the origins of Lahore, on what is classified as the perimeters of ‘ancient’ ...","Last week we dwelt on defining the origins of Lahore, on what is classified as the perimeters of ‘ancient’ Lahore and what is the ‘old walled city’ as it stands today. In this the role of the fort was discussed.
In this piece, our interest lies in what came first, the fort or the ancient city, as it developed. For this let us take a look at how the forts and the ancient cities of Mohen-jo Daro, as of Taxila and also of Harappa, emerged and evolved. We also have the examples of Multan and Peshawar, both equally important ancient cities. For that matter the Indus Valley Civilisation has the most ancient cities, and forts, than any other land.
Let us begin with the example of Mohen-jo Daro in Sindh. Using the analysis of the famous Stuart Piggott in ‘Ancient Cities of India’ (OUP), he clearly uses archaeological research to point out that from the city emerged the fort (he uses the word ‘citadel’), and using carbon-dating showed that once the city had grown beyond a certain extent, the fort came forth.
This makes sense because unless a city has a minimum number of persons, it cannot cater to the needs of the soldiers in a fort. Mohen-jo Daro seems to have been a city with covered drains and ample grain storage space.
Let us have a look at Harappa. Piggott says that of all the ancient cities of the Indian sub-continent this was the most ‘organised’. It had a lot of toilets and separate rooms for different workers. Added to this it had a university, as well as a number of schools. In the later stages it had burnt-brick structures. Its grain storages were larger than Mohen-jo Daro. With time, as the city grew in size, Harappa Fort emerged.
Now let us move on to Taxila. The city of ancient Taxila, located at Sirkap and known as ‘katcha kot’ came first. As it grew in size and its famous Buddhist University of Taxila emerged and gained fame all over the world, the Taxila Fort emerged on Bhir Mound, which also had large halls. No matter which structure one examines, we see all of them located on mounds, which is a clear manifestation of the ‘flood threat’ that invariably prevailed.
Let us take a brief look at the ancient city of Multan. As the ancient walled city emerged, also initially called ‘katcha kot’, we see the building of a magnificent brick fort. Initially, this was mud-brick constructed. Then the city grew further and was walled. This also seems to be the pattern of the growth of Charsadda and Bahawalpur. All along the Indus Valley rivers cities emerged, and once they crossed a certain size forts for their defence emerged.
Now back to Lahore. We know that the ancient walled city was a mud-brick walled enclosure initially named ‘katcha kot’. This seems to be the name of almost every mud-bricked walled habitation in the Indus Valley. The point we are trying to determine is whether the fort is older than the initial mud-bricked enclosure.
The only scientific evidence we have are two carbon-dated findings of fragments of pottery found in the Lahore Fort, and in Mohallah Maullian inside Lohari Gate. The first was a joint British-Pakistani archaeological effort in 1959 by the British Archaeological Expedition and the Pakistan Archaeological Department, who dug a 50-feet deep pit which was 180 feet by 60 feet wide. As they went deeper they found built habitation.
Along the way they discovered a number of pottery samples. They were carbon-dated at over 4,500 years old. To date this is the oldest sample of Lahore’s habitation discovered. The trouble is that this remains the one and only planned archaeological project ever undertaken in Lahore.
The second discovery was purely accidental, as a business person was digging at a site in Mohallah Maullian after knocking down a ‘protected property’, which has become the norm in the new dispensation. At about 30 feet the builders discovered a lot of ancient pottery and fragments. These were, luckily, reported by a student passing by, who was wise enough to hand them over to a Punjab University professor, who passed them on to a Cambridge professor. These fragments were carbon-dated at 3,250 years.
Besides these two findings, one official and the other unofficial, no deliberate research or accidental finding have taken place. But more on this later. The two common factors in the location of these findings is that they were located on mounds. Also that two other factors have to be kept in mind. One that the land surface rises by approximately 12 feet every 250 years. The chance discovery of this scientific fact emerged when the Shahi Hammam work was being carried out by the Aga Khan Trust inside Delhi Gate. They found the real foundations as being 12 feet below the present outer land surface.
The rising of mounds has a lot to do with the fact that the river Ravi meanders every 200 years. For example, we know that in the days of Maharajah Ranjit Singh the Ravi flowed around the fort and the walled city. Today it has moved westwards to its present position. The remains of the old Ravi, or Buddha Ravi, as it is locally called, can be seen just west of the old Minto Park, renamed Iqbal Park. It was once called Company Parade Ground and was part of Badami Bagh. The meandered portion does not flow, but does allow for dust settling. This helps mounds to develop.
If people in ancient times built their huts and mud-houses on a safe mound, then it makes sense for fragments to be found on what was once a mound. The Lahore Fort fragments are understandable. The Mohallah Maullian ones also make sense, for this was once, location-wise, the very first portion of the ‘ancient city’.
The norm is for the ‘katcha kot’ to precede the fort. But then just two findings do not make for a scientifically verifiable ‘fact’. There are other mounds, in fact higher ones, like the ‘paniwala talab’ location in Chunna Mandi that deserves archaeological treatment and discovery. There are another three major mound sites that need archaeological missions to explore them.
It is not a positive sign that our Punjab University archaeology department seems unable to see this opportunity to research. There are such researchers all over the world who have approached the ‘authorities’ to let them explore Lahore. All that follows such requests is silence. But then this is the dispensation of the land, built on communal beliefs, that presently seems to be imploding. The blind cannot see or understand this.

8,"Baisakhi festival: Over 2,500 pilgrims expected from India","Nearly 2,000 Sikh pilgrims expected from other countries while over 5,000 from within the country, says an ETPB spokesperson.","LAHORE: As Pakistan has issued visas to nearly 3,000 Indians intending to attend the Baisakhi festival-2023, the Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB) expects the arrival of over 2,500 Sikh pilgrims from India on Sunday (today).
The authorities also expect the arrival of nearly 2,000 Sikh pilgrims from other countries, including the UK and Canada, besides over 5,000 others from within the country, especially from Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, according to an ETPB spokesperson.
 
 

“The 10-day Baisakhi festival will begin on Sunday (today) at Nankana Saheb. The main ceremony of the festival will be held on April 14 at Gurdwara Panja Saheb,” the spokesman told Dawn on Saturday.
Sharing details, the official said, the government of Pakistan (Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi) had issued visas to 2,960 pilgrims, including some from the Hindu community. But, most of the time, the number of pilgrims arriving in Pakistan is less than the number of visas issued.
“So, we are expecting arrival of over 2,500 pilgrims — mostly Sikhs — from India on Sunday (today) via Wagah border (Lahore). Nearly 2,000 are expected from other countries while over 5,000 are likely to participate from within the country,” he explained.
According to the schedule, the pilgrims will enter Pakistan via Wagah-Attari land route on foot and leave for Nankana Saheb by road. On April 10, they will proceed to Gurdwaera Sacha Sauda (Farooqabad) and return to Nankana by road the same day.
On April 11, they along with other pilgrims, will visit other local gurdwaras in Nankana Saheb. On April 12, they will leave for Gurdwara Panja Saheb (Hasanabdal) by road.
On April 13, the pilgrims will stay at Panja Saheb and on April 14, they will attend the main ceremony titled “Bhog Akhand Paath Sahib and Nagar Kirtan” to celebrate 324th Khalsa Janam Din at Gurdwara Panja Sahib.
The same day, they will depart for Lahore to visit Gurdwara Dera Saheb. The pilgrims, on April 15, will stay at Dera Saheb.
On April 16, they will leave for Aimanabad to visit Gurdwara Rorro Saheb. The same day they will also visit Gurdwara Darbar Saheb in Kartarpur, Narowal, where they will have a night stay also.
On April 17, the pilgrims will again depart for Lahore to visit Gurdwara Dera Saheb and after staying here for a night, they will return to India via Wagah on April 18.

9,Toshakhana case Lhc to resume hearing on Imran’s plea on Wednesday,LAHORE:  A Lahore High Court five-member larger bench will resume on 12th hearing of a petition by PTI Chairman ...,"LAHORE:  A Lahore High Court five-member larger bench will resume on 12th hearing of a petition by PTI Chairman Imran Khan against the  proceedings of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to debar him  from heading his party following disqualification in the Toshakhana  reference.
On Jan 30, the bench had adjourned its hearing to wait  for a decision by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on an application for  withdrawal of a similar petition by Khan.
Headed by Justice Shahid  Bilal Hassan, the bench comprises Justice Shams Mahmood Mirza, Justice  Shahid Karim, Justice Shehram Sarwar Chaudhry and Justice Jawad Hassan.
A  single bench had restrained the ECP from taking any adverse action  against Khan in its proceedings to debar him from heading the party  following his disqualification from NA-95, Mianwali-I, constituency for  allegedly filing incorrect statements of assets.
The ECP had started the proceedings against Khan after disqualifying him from his Mianwali seat in the Toshakhana reference.
Khan  through his counsel challenged the assumption of jurisdiction by the  ECP through the issuance of the impugned order and the notice. He sought  the interpretation of Articles 218(3) and 219, read with Articles 4 and  5 of the Constitution and Sections 8(c) and 9 of the Election Act in  the light of Article 62(f) of the Constitution.
He submitted that a  pivotal point involved in this case was whether the ECP could pass any  declaration, which was not mentioned under Article 218(3) Constitution.
He pointed out that a reference against Khan was submitted before the NA speaker, who sent it to the ECP to decide the matter.
He  argued that the ECP could not issue the impugned notice to him since it  never made a declaration against him under the article 62(1)(f) of the  Constitution.
He asked the court to declare the ECP notice and proceedings illegal and unconstitutional.
He  also urged the court to hold that the findings of the ECP against the  petitioner of making false statements about his assets and liabilities  and subsequent disqualification were unlawful and without lawful  authority.

When their car was passing through another village, two unidentified men signalled them but the driver did not stop on some suspicion after which the armed robbers opened fire, leaving Ali Hassan, Zain and Jabran injured whereas the driver continued to drive the car until some safe distance.
The injured were shifted to Dinga Civil Hospital and later doctors referred them to Aziz Bhatti Shaheed Teaching Hospital (ABSTH) as Ali Hassan succumbed to his injuries and the condition of Zain was critical.
Police had initially registered a case under sections 324 and 34 of Pakistan Penal Code against the unidentified suspects and later inserted the section 302 in the FIR.

17,Case against 30 for attacking customs teams at illegal oil depot,"LAHORE: Multan police on Saturday registered a case against 30 unidentified people for attacking, injuring and...","LAHORE: Multan police on Saturday registered a case against 30 unidentified people for attacking, injuring and obstructing Customs teams from discharging public functions during a raid at an oil smuggling depot in Sher Shah area.
Muzaffarabad police registered the case under charges of rioting, armed with deadly weapon, unlawful assembly, mischief causing damage, criminal intimidation, assault to deter public servant from discharge of duty and obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions on the complaint of Customs Inspector Arshad Nadeem.
According to the FIR available with Dawn, Nadeem told the police the department received information that smuggled oil was being transported at an oil depot owned by Hanif Mand located in Mauza Sher Shah.  
He stated that soon three customs teams reached the spot. Hanif Mand, his brother, son, nephew including Aslam Mand, Puppu Shaikh, Asad Mand, Allah Ditta and Pappi Khakhaar along with 30 other unidentified persons were present there.
He said an oil tanker filled with 40,000 litres oil was parked in the depot and when the customs staff asked the people present at the site to provide documents of the oil tanker, they instead of showing the documents called other people and not only stopped the customs staff from performing their official duty but also tortured them.
He said constable Abid was attacked with wooden clubs and bricks while the remaining staff was also tortured. He said the suspects smashed three official vehicles and took the tanker outside the depot forcibly.  
Sources in customs told Dawn that when the teams conducted a raid more than two dozen tankers were unloading the smuggled oil in nearby depots but the officials let them leave the vicinity and within half an hour they were outside the depots.
They said more than 200,000 litres smuggled oil was stored in three vehicles parked within the depot of Hanif Mand and its underground storage but the customs officials mentioned only 40,000 litres in the case which was stored in one of the tankers.
They said the smuggled Iranian oil is being stored in the vicinity of Sher Shah despite a team of customs being deployed at Chenab Toll Plaza.
They said storages have been constructed in the Sher Shah area for smuggled oil while the owners of these depots are paying ‘monthly’ to staff of the relevant departments including customs, police, customs intelligence and civil defence.  
They said the storages have been constructed in thickly-populated areas, putting the entire population at risk.  
Customs Headquarter Assistant Collector Habibur Rehman told this reporter that 18 members of three teams conducted the raid on the indication of a local journalist.
He said around 30 to 50 people, including women and children, had attacked the teams who were raiding the oil depot facility of the smugglers.
He said one of their officials was injured after people hit them with bricks while others were manhandled and windscreens of their vehicles were broken.
He said a vehicle carrying 40,000 litres of oil was also snatched from their custody and a case was registered against the attackers.
