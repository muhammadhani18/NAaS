1,PTI activist held  in Balakot on treason charge,"MANSEHRA: The Balakot police on Saturday arrested an office-bearer of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, who is also a youth...","MANSEHRA: The Balakot police on Saturday arrested an office-bearer of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, who is also a youth councillor in the Hassa village council, for treason.
A team led by SHO Tariq Khan arrested Najam Ali from Hassa area and shifted him to the police station.
“We have arrested the PTI activist for posting anti-state and anti-army content on his social media accounts,” SHO Khan said.
He said the accused was arrested under sections 120-B, 123-A/501 of Pakistan Penal Code and presented him before the local court. He said the judge sent him on 14-day judicial remand.
The SHO said the accused also used to instigate people against the army’s top brass.
“We got details of the social media accounts of the accused, verified them through relevant departments before arresting him,” Mr Khan said.
Meanwhile, the residents on Saturday demanded of the Mansehra tehsil municipal administration to remove encroachments along the Karakoram Highway in the bazaars to ensure smooth traffic flow and movement of shoppers.
“The people, particularly women and children, cannot freely move for shopping as shopkeepers and vendors have occupied footpaths and roadsides in the bazaars,” Ajmal Khan, a local resident, said.
He said footpaths on the Abbottabad, Shinkiari, Kashmir and Lari Adda roads were occupied by vendors.
He accused the Mansehra TMA of giving a free hand to shopkeepers and vendors to occupy roads and footpaths, creating hurdles in smooth flow of traffic.
Another local, Mubarak Shah said the TMA failed to launch an anti-encroachment drive despite announcements made many times in the past.
The people of Shinkiari and its suburbs also complained about traffic mess on the KKH due to encroachments.
Zahid Khan, a local, said the Baffa-Pakhal TMA and National Highway Authority had served notices on owners of buildings and shops, whose properties came in the right-of-way of the road, but they didn’t pay heed to the notices. 
He demanded of the authorities to launch an anti-encroachment drive immediately.

2,Sanitation workers observe strike against non-payment of salary on Easter Eve,Say they don’t have money to mark religious festival,"PESHAWAR: With Christians celebrating Easter today (Sunday), sanitation workers of the public sector Water and Sanitation Services Peshawar have complained about a delay in salary payment and said the lack of money amid record inflation has dampened their enthusiasm for the religious festival.
“It is Easter Eve — something of chand raat [the night before the Muslim festival of Eidul Fitr] — but I am home without any money to buy my children clothes and shoes for tomorrow,” WSSP sanitation worker Aurangzaib Masih told Dawn.
Mr Masih’s voice cracked up as he tried to keep his composure.
He said his children didn’t know or care about why their father hadn’t been paid, and just wanted to celebrate Easter like others.

Say they don’t have money to mark religious festival

Chairman of the All Municipal Worker Union WSSP Riaz Khan said the government-owned utility had 4,500 employees, including sanitation workers, tubewell operators, Class-IV employees, and ministerial staff members.
He said around 1,600 of those employees belonged to the Christian community who would celebrate Easter festival on Sunday.
“The company hasn’t paid salary to those employees ahead of their religious festival, which is an act of injustice,” he said.
Mr Khan said the delay in payment of salary to WSSP workers was beyond his understanding.
He said the WSSP’s sanitation workers observed a complete strike on Saturday to press for the immediate release of their salary to enjoy the festival.
The union chairman, however, said tubewell operators showed up at work to supply water to residents in the Muslim month of fasting.
He claimed that the WSSP’s top bosses spent most of the funds on themselves but didn’t ensure payment of salary to the employees on time.
Mr Khan said those workers were paid in the middle of every month.
A sanitation worker said he and his colleagues cleaned up toilets and performed other cleanliness duties but the company didn’t pay them salary ahead of Easter to deprive them and their families of celebrations
“Easter will be colorless as we can celebrate it with empty pockets. We cannot face our children, who are demanding Eidi [money given away to children on festivals),” he said.
The worker blamed his and family’s misery on the WSSP’s top management.
He said that the delay in salary payments, which had been happening for the last few months, had forced workers into paying electricity bills after the due date with a fine.
A tubewell operator told Dawn that in the presence of unprecedented inflation, the nonpayment of salary had doubled his financial problems like other workers of the company.
He said members of the sanitation staff boycotted duty, so garbage wasn’t collected from the provincial capital causing it to pile up on the streets and dumpsites to become an eyesore.
“As salary payments face delays on a regular basis, we have to borrow money from relatives to buy essential items,” he said.
WSSP chief executive officer Hasan Nisar was not available despite repeated attempts.
However, a senior company official blamed financial problems for the issue.
He told Dawn that the provincial government used to provide a “grant” to the WSSP on a quarterly basis but that hadn’t been happening for the last six months.
“The WSSP moved the official file for the release of salary funds on March 3 but the sluggish ways of the local government and finance departments to process it has delayed payments,” he said.

3,Officials promise removal of hurdles to Pak-Afghan trade,"Representatives of NLC, FC, police and other security departments make several suggestions to remove obstacles to Pak-Afghan trade.","PESHAWAR: Authorities have assured Pakistani and Afghan traders of measures to remove hurdles to trade between the two countries.
Newly-appointed chief collector (customs) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Fayyaz Anwar chaired a meeting at the Torkham border on Saturday to discuss issues related to Pak-Afghan trade.
The participants, including Pakistani and Afghan traders and relevant officials, held a “thorough discussion on the performance of relevant public sector institutions along with the problems of Pak-Afghan businessmen,” according to a news release.
The traders highlighted their issues and proposed ways to resolve them.

Traders complain of slow goods clearance at border points

The participants included collector customs (operations) in Peshawar Mohammad Ashfaq, additional collector customs at Torkham Mohammad Rizwan, additional collector customs in Peshawar Rizwan Mehmood, deputy collector (operations) at Torkham Asma Javed, assistant collectors at Torkham Imad Mohib, superintendent Siddique Akbar, PAJCCI coordinator and director Ziaul Haq Sarhadi, KCCI president Syed Jawad Hussain Kazmi, and members of the Torkham Customs Agents Association.
The representatives of NLC, FC, police and other security departments, who were also in attendance, made several suggestions to remove obstacles to Pak-Afghan trade.
Customs officials from Torkham briefed Mr Anwar about their visit to the newly-constructed NLC terminal.
Ziaul Haq Sarhadi, who is also the president of Frontier Customs Agents Association (FCAA) and former senior vice-president of the Sarhad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI), called for steps to ensure smooth Pak-Afghan trade as well as transit trade.
He said traders had no issues with the customs department at Torkham, Ghulam Khan and Kharlachi border points.
Mr Sarhadi, however, said officials of border management and other institutions took a lot of time for goods checking causing difficulties for traders.
He said while containers of Afghan transit trade were cleared in 10-12 days at Karachi Port, the demurrage charges were imposed on them due to the slow process of their clearance.
The FCCA president also complained that official orders for cross-stuffing hadn’t been implemented causing the levying of heavy charges on containers.
He suggested that goods of Afghan transit trade should be moved from Karachi to Torkham by the Pakistan Railways along with a bonded carrier service.
Mr Sarhadi urged authorities to allow the filing of goods documents at Azakhel dry port for trouble-free functioning of the customs clearing agents in the province.
Chief Collector (customs) Fayaz Anwar told traders that all possible measures would be taken to facilitate cross-border trade.
He said the customs department knew the problems facing the business community and would strive to resolve them on a priority basis.

4,Policy board to set time limits for MTIs capacity building,Panel chief says issues of medical teaching institutions to be discussed in next meeting,"PESHAWAR: The policy board for medical teaching institutions in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has decided to call an overdue meeting following the Peshawar High Court’s decision to suspend its dissolution by the caretaker provincial government.
The five-member panel will meet shortly to finalise new guidelines and time limits for all MTIs of the province for building capacity as well as improving coordination with the health department for better patient care, according to officials.
On March 28, the health department issued a notification declaring that the chairman and members of the MTI policy board have ceased to hold their respective offices with immediate effect.
The move came in line with the March 16 decision of the caretaker cabinet to remove all board members, who, officials said, were appointed in Jan 2022 on a voluntary basis to guide MTIs in the province on how to work efficiently.

Panel chief says issues of medical teaching institutions to be discussed in next meeting

The Medical Teaching Institutions Reforms Act, 2015, granted autonomy to the province’s 10 public sector hospitals as well as medical and dental colleges affiliated with them to work for better patient care without any political interference, officials told Dawn.
They, however, said authorities later realised that MTIs pursued different policies for having a separate board of governors.
When contacted, chairman of the MTI policy board Prof Nausherwan Barki said the panel was finalising agenda for the upcoming meeting after its restoration by the high court through a stay order.
He said the board would examine the issues of MTIs and take important decisions for the better functioning of those institutions to the benefit of their visitors.
Prof Barki said the policy board, which comprised professional people, met every six weeks.
“Our meeting is long overdue, so I am in constant contact with [board] members to decide about its schedule and agenda,” he said.
Prof Barki, architect of the MTIRA 2015 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, said the members of the policy board has been appointed by search and nomination council for a period of three years and their tenures would end in January 2025.
“We [board members] are professional people and will continue to work voluntarily along with BoG members to develop MTIs and improve their patient care as allowed by the law,” he said.
Another member of the policy board told Dawn requesting anonymity that the government’s “plans to dissolve MTI BoG” would be challenged in the court of law.
However, officials in the health department insisted that no such move was in the works following the suspension of the MTI policy board’s dissolution by the high court.
They insisted that under the law, BoGs could abolish and re-designate MTI posts as and when required and could spend the “one-line budget” it received from the government to meet its needs.
The officials said the policy board was just a policy-making body unlike BoGs, which had “operational powers.”
They claimed that the policy board’s members challenged the notification of their removal as they thought that the move would bring their professional competencies into notoriety though no perks and privileges were attached to their positions.
The officials said the board members considered their unceremonious exit to be very disrespectful.
Legal experts insisted that the MTIRA could be abolished only by a majority vote of the provincial assembly, so there appeared to be no immediate threat to the MTIs.

They demanded a crackdown on flour dealers over the irregularity.
The demonstration was staged in the Civil Colony of Khar amid sloganeering against the food department, flour mills and dealers.
The protesters claimed that the government’s free flour scheme was meant for deserving families but flour bags didn’t reach all such people.
They added that more than 2,000 bags had gone “missing” from distribution centres in the district during the last two days.

Karakoram Highway blocked in Shangla

The protesters blamed the irregularity on the district food controller and his subordinates, dealers of free wheat, and flour mills and alleged that political and trader leaders were also involved in the anomaly.
They said the recent fraud by the dealers with the support of management of local flour mills and officials of the district food department has deprived several hundreds of needy and poor people of their right to free wheat flour.
The protesters urged the district administration, especially deputy commissioner, to ensure provision of free flour to all deserving families in the district.
Meanwhile, the residents of Dandai and adjoining village councils in Shangla district on Saturday blocked the Karakoram Highway and staged a protest against “unjust” distribution of free flour under a government scheme.
The call for protest was given by village council members.
After blocking the Karakoram Highway, the protesters shouted slogans against the local administration and police.
Led by village council members Maulana Yousaf, Ziaullah Swati, Bashirzada, Shakilur Rehman and Mohammad Yehya, the protesters said the administration had designated five flour distribution points for a single union council, Maira, but there was not a single such point for the Dandai union council.
Maulana Yousaf complained that scuffles at flour distribution centres had become a routine as the people, including elderly people and women, were made to queue up for long hours in the current month of fasting.
Bashirzada said the government should close down the flour distribution programme before announcing a flour subsidy for the deserving families to their relief.
The mob blocked the highway for around three hours suspending traffic on the KKH to the trouble of people travelling between Islamabad and Gilgit-Baltistan.
Later, officials of the local administration held talks with protesters and promised the opening of more flour points in the adjoining areas of Dandai.
The mob dispersed peacefully thereafter.
