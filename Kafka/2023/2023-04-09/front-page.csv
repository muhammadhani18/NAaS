• PM Shehbaz says Alvi being more loyal to Imran than his ‘august office’
ISLAMABAD: Upping the ante in a standoff with the government over the question of elections, President Arif Alvi on Saturday returned a piece of legislation that aimed to regulate the suo motu powers of the chief justice, saying that the proposed law “travels beyond the competence of parliament” and can be assailed as “colourable legislation”.
The bill, titled Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Bill 2023, sought to curtail the powers of the CJP and also gives the right to appeal in all suo motu cases with retrospective effect. It sailed through the Senate on March 30, without being sent to the relevant standing committee, a day after being passed by the National Assembly.
In a note, shared on Twitter as well, the president said that he thought it fit and proper to return the bill in accordance with the Constitution, with the request for reconsideration in order to meet the scrutiny about its validity, in case of a legal challenge.
The president said Article 191 empowers the Supreme Court “to make rules regulating the practice and procedure of the court”. Under such enabling provisions of the Constitution, the Supreme Court Rules 1980 have been made and in force duly validated and adopted by the Constitution itself, he said, adding that these time-tested rules were being followed since 1980 and any “tinkering with the same may tantamount to interference with the internal working of the court, its autonomy, and independence”.
‘Trichotomy of power’
“Our Constitution is founded on the concept of trichotomy of power — three pillars of the state whose domain of power, authority, and functions are defined and delineated by the Constitution itself,” Mr Alvi pointed out. He said parliament has also been given the power under Article 67 that states “subject to the Constitution, a house may make rules for regulating its procedure and the conduct of its business….” He said Article 67 and 191 were akin to each other and recognise the autonomy and independence of each other respectively – barring interference of one into the other’s domain.
According to the president, the Supreme Court was an independent institution as visualized by the founding fathers that in Pakistan “independence of judiciary shall be fully secured”. With such an objective in view, Article 191 was incorporated and the Supreme Court was kept out of the law-making authority of parliament, he added.
He said the competence of parliament to make laws stems from the Constitution itself. “Article 70 relates to ‘introduction and passing of Bills’ with respect to any matter in the Federal Legislative List – enumerated in the Fourth Schedule of the Constitution. Followed and further affirmed are the provisions of Article 142(a) that parliament can make laws ‘with respect to any matter in the Federal Legislative List.”
He said Entry 55 of Part I of the Fourth Schedule while empowering parliament to make laws in respect of “jurisdiction and powers of all courts except the Supreme Court” especially excluded the Supreme Court. “Thus, the bill prima-facie travels beyond the competence of the Parliament and can be assailed as a colourable legislation,” he added.
He said the focus of the bill relates to the original jurisdiction of the top court, providing for the mode and manner for invoking it and providing appeal. “The idea may be laudable but can such a purpose be achieved without amending the provisions of relevant articles of the Constitution,” he questioned.
After the president returned the bill, the government is expected to table it in a joint session of parliament which will approve it after some possible changes. One of the amendments proposed a condition that at least a five-member bench would hear the constitutional cases, an informed source told Dawn. The bill, after its passage, would be sent to the president, and the president “shall give his assent within 10 days, failing which such assent shall be deemed to have been given”, according to Article 75.
‘Partisan president’
Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz Sharif took on President Alvi for returning the bill and accused him of belittling the office of the president. “President Alvi returning the Supreme Court Bill duly passed by parliament is most unfortunate,” he said, adding, “Through his conduct, he has belittled the august office by acting as a worker of the PTI, one who is beholden to Imran Niazi more than the Constitution & demands of his office,” the premier tweeted.
In a strong exception to the president’s move to return the proposed legislation, Climate Change Minister and PPP Senator Sherry Rehman said President Alvi has proved that “he is not the country’s president but the PTI’s secretary general even now”.
Mr Alvi has looked at “parliament’s every decision with the perspective of the PTI”, Ms Rehman said, underscoring that the president had already stated his stance on the matter in an interview before even receiving the said bill.
“The president is saying that this bill is outside the parliament’s authority? He kept running the President’s House like an ordinance factory for three and a half years — how can he be aware of the parliament’s powers?” she said.
Minister of State for Law Shahadat Awan told Dawn that President Alvi overlooked Article 175 (2) while forming his opinion. He said a right to appeal in suo motu cases had been provided under Section 5 of the bill in the interest of justice.
PDM spokesman Hafiz Hamdullah termed President Arif Alvi a “certified violator” of the Constitution and termed his move of not signing the bill passed by both houses an attack on the parliament.
PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry on the other hand asked the government to think and introduce a change in its politics instead of trying to amend laws upon a “few people’s wishes”. “The government should not make legislation subordinate to a few people’s wishes. After attempts to amend the Supreme Court rules, decreasing the president’s powers by amending the Elections Act (2017) is foolish legislation.”

1,Fawad applauds PPP for keeping option of talks open,Asks the establishment and government to sit together to iron out issues over elections.,"LAHORE: After differences of opinion surfaced between two of the main parties in the ruling coalition over the issue of holding talks with the main opposition party, PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry praised the PPP for passing a resolution stating that it did not want to become party to the campaign to malign judges and asserting that political parties did not block negotiations.
 
 

“The PTI is also for the holding of dialogues and wants that the establishment, government, and opposition should sit together, discuss and give space — while acknowledging the right of election,” Mr Chaudhry said while speaking at a news conference here on Saturday, where he applauded what he called the “political acumen” demonstrated by Asif Ali Zardari’s party.
 






He also said discussions among stakeholders should only be held on the subject of differences on elections and finalising the rules of the game.
Trashing discussion surrounding the number of judges on a bench, the PTI leader said the people of Pakistan are only concerned about elections to two provincial assemblies.

Asks establishment, government to sit together to iron out issues over elections

He said Justice Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Athar Minallah were judges of impeccable integrity and added that the latter had only given his technical view on the judgment. “The Supreme Court judgments are not based on technicalities but substantial justice,” he added.
Stating that Pakistan’s politics had been torn down through a planned conspiracy, he said it could be streamlined only through fresh elections. “How can a political party be so coward, to say that it does not want to go to elections — and rule through nominations,” he wondered.
Referring to President Dr Arif Alvi’s decision to return to parliament a bill aimed at clipping the powers of the chief justice of Pakistan and giving the right to appeal in all suo motu cases with retrospective effect, the PTI senior vice-president said the judiciary, parliament and the executive had separate functions to perform.
 
 

Referring to the National Sec­u­rity Committee’s official statem­ent, the PTI leader regretted that the “security situation has been explained in a way that the country is on the mercy of the terrorists. Terrorists are now dictating the nuclear power when it can hold elections,” he regretted and added this nuclear state also had no funds to hold elections in line with the Constitutional provisions.
Following the NSC statement on security and financial position, the PTI leader asked if wasn’t it time for the prime minister to resign. He said the present ‘imported regime’ had brought Pakistan to this financial and security bankruptcy.
Referring to the cabinet and National Assembly resolutions that rejected the Supreme Court decision, Mr Chaudhry stated the Cabinet Division had retracted that any such item to reject SC ruling was on cabinet agenda and added that the National Assembly resolution was also signed by 42 members, including 28 women from reserved seats, out of the 371-member house. “No PML-N stalwart, including PM Shehbaz Sharif, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, Rana Tanvir, Javed Latif and Khawaja Asif signed the NA resolution knowing that they would be tried and disqualified,” Mr Chaudhry asserted.
“The PTI has asked the 42 NA resolution signatories to tender apology in 12 hours or the party will move a reference against them and get them disqualified,” he said.
Mr Chaudhry also lambasted the PDM and its caretaker government in Punjab for instituting 144 cases against PTI chief Imran Khan, including 15 terrorism cases in a day. He said both federal and Punjab governments had tried their utmost to get Imran Khan disqualified and miserably failed and warned that they would face the same fate in future too.
Lambasting caretaker chief minister Mohsin Naqvi, he said, “Small people have been given the throne through nominations”. Chiding Mr Naqvi for blocking traffic on The Mall during his movement, he also alleged all property dealers had “purchased” caretaker ministries in Punjab.
Meanwhile, Punjab information minister Amir Mir reacted and warned PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry to refrain from using bizarre language against CM Naqvi otherwise his past would be exposed.

2,Cabinet set to decide fate of Punjab polls in weekend meeting,Release of funds for elections and president's decision to return Supreme Court Bill to come under discussion during meeting.,"LAHORE: An ‘emerge­ncy’ meeting of the federal cabinet has been called on the weekly holiday (today) to decide whether funds should be released to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for holding the polls in Punjab on May 14, or show open defiance to the orders of the Supreme Court.
Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb told Dawn that the meeting would be held in Lahore with Prime Minister Sheh­baz Sharif in the chair.
“This is an important meeting on the current issues. However, its agenda has not been circulated as yet,” she said but added that “significant decisions” might be taken in the huddle.
Most cabinet members would participate in the deliberations through video link.
The PPP has separated itself from the Sharifs’ demand that Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Ban­dial should step down. But, according to sources, the party may review its stance at the last minute on whether to support its senior coalition partner’s dec­i­sion to reject the apex court’s order on Punjab polls.
A PML-N insider told Dawn that the release of funds for Punjab elections, Presi­dent Dr Arif Alvi’s decision to return the Supreme Court Bill, and Justice Athar Minallah’s judicial note in the elections case — which PML-N sees grossly in favour of its stance — would come under discussion during the meeting.
He said the Sharifs were in complete mood to defy the CJP-led three-member bench’s decision to hold elections in the province on May 14 and there was no secret in it.
“Be it Nawaz Sharif, Shehbaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz…all in one voice have rejected the three-bench verdict and the parliament is also standing behind the PML-N’s stance,” he said and added that the party was also unanimous on this point. He said that in Sunday’s meeting, the premier and cabinet would declare that there were no funds for the May 14 elections.
“And let’s see what action the SC takes on Monday…we don’t care,” he said and added that PML-N was desperately looking for a narrative and this defiance would help it build one with which it can go into polls.
“Further legislation by parliament to clip the apex court’s powers may also be discussed in the meeting,” he said.
Federal Finance Minister Ishaq Dar earlier in the day also did not give any hint that the government would be releasing funds to the ECP for the Punjab polls.
“The Supreme Court’s order for the federal government is to give Rs21 billion for elections in Punjab by April 10. Of course, the finance ministry and the cabinet have an important responsibility in this regard, and I am a part of it,” he said but did not indicate the amount his ministry would release by April 10.
Maryam Nawaz has already declared that the party was ready for disqualification. “The SC had disqualified Nawaz Sharif and if it decides to issue a contempt notice to PM Shehbaz we don’t care as we have rejected the three-member bench decision on Punjab polls which in fact was 4/3,” she had said.

3,Dar links cancellation of US trip to political turmoil,"Assures nation IMF deal is on track, says govt has already done what was required to conclude the ninth review.","ISLAMABAD: Finance Minister Ishaq Dar on Sat­urday said he had cance­lled his trip to Washington for the spring meetings of the International Monet­ary Fund and World Bank on the prime minister’s orders, due to the political turmoil in Pakistan.
However, he assured the nation that the IMF deal was on track and the government had already done all that was required from it to conclude the ninth review of the loan programme.
“These are routine rituals. However, a constitutional crisis has been created in Pakistan,” Mr Dar said in a televised address.
He said the crisis had been compounded by the April 4 Supreme Court order striking down the government’s plans to delay elections to Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa assemblies.
Rejected reports linking the cancelled trip to a holdup in Pakistan’s IMF bailout programme, he said that a “constitutional crisis” was created by the Supreme Court, which has demanded that the government provide Rs21 billion to the Election Commission by April 10 to conduct the polls.
“Of course, the finance ministry and the cabinet have an important responsibility in this regard, and I am a part of it,” he said. “Due to these circumstances and on the prime minister’s directives, I have dropped my plan to visit Washington [physically].”
However, Mr Dar said he would attend important bilateral and multilateral meetings virtually and a Pakistani delegation would be present in the United States.
Apparently, Mr Dar was not comfortable with the election schedule. “I can speak at length over the details of the entire process,” he said without elaborating.
Elections had been postponed in the country in the past, he said, citing the assassination of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, floods and earthquakes. He wondered why the same couldn’t be done this time, keeping in view the current economic situation of the country.
The Supreme Court’s order has created a standoff as the coalition government has already passed a resolution in the National Assembly to not obey the apex court’s orders to conduct polls in Punjab on May 14. A similar rejection was earlier issued after a cabinet meeting headed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
The federal cabinet is again meeting on Sunday (today) to review the situation, especially the release of funds to the ECP as directed by the Supreme Court.
Responding to speculations on social media that the IMF had told Mr Dar not to attend the meetings, he said: “The IMF can’t tell me not to attend. Pakistan is a member of the World Bank and the IMF. It is not a beggar,” he said.
He reminded that the IMF only suspended Pakistan’s loan programme after the nuclear tests while talks were held despite global sanctions.
On sovereign payments, Mr Dar said that the country did not even delay it for a minute. Pakistan had paid $11bn in the last few months, he said, adding that there was no chance of default over sovereign payments.
IMF talks
Mr Dar said the government, on its part, had completed all requirements of the IMF’s programme review for the release of a $1.1bn tranche.
“We are now only awaiting the confirmation of a $1bn commitment from one friendly country,” he said. After that, all their requirements to conclude the staff-level agreement with the IMF would be complete, he said. “We have completed all prior actions required for the staff-level agreement,” he added.
Mr Dar said another country had already confirmed it would provide $2bn. While he did not name the two countries, Minister of State for Finance Dr Aisha Ghaus Pasha on Thursday said Saudi Arabia had conveyed to the IMF its commitment to provide financing to Pakistan.
It has been widely reported that $2bn has been committed by Saudi Arabia, while confirmation of $1bn was awaited by the United Arab Emirates.
Mr Dar said once the $1bn was confirmed, a staff-level agreement would be reached. He denied that there were any other pending issues.
Pakistan is in danger of defaulting on its debt, with an IMF bailout programme stalled since November, while a bruising political battle is raging between the government and former prime minister Imran Khan.
The country’s foreign exchange reserves have already dipped to around $4.2bn, which can barely cover one month of controlled imports.
The government has been trying to secure a tranche of $1.1bn of the IMF programme since February.
The finance minister acknowledged that there was a new development with the IMF deal over the past few weeks due to the “cross-subsidy” on fuel prices. He said several rounds of communication were held with the Fund on this issue. “We gave them a satisfying answer because that subsidy is not a part of the budget,” he said.

4,Justice Isa snubs larger bench order on suo motu cases,"Second senior-most SC judge says six-member bench verdict overruling his order ""without constitutional validity"".","ISLAMABAD: The chasm in the Supreme Court continued to grow on Saturday, as a judicial note penned by senior puisne judge Qazi Faez Isa, said that a six-member bench that overruled his order regarding a freeze on suo motu proceedings did not “constitute a constitutional court nor possessed with any jurisdiction”.
On April 4, the six-judge bench affirmed the registrar’s circular dated March 31 to disregard Justice Isa’s direction for putting a halt on cases under Article 184(3) of the Constitution. The order of the larger bench followed a circular by the SC registrar and validated the contents of the circular. In light of the circular issued by the registrar on March 31, Justice Isa had asked the Cabinet Division to recall his services. Subsequently, the services of the registrar were recalled.
In addition to the six-judge bench order, a three-member bench headed by the chief justice, while hearing a case regarding the polls delay under Article 184(3), observed the hearing was wholly unaffected by Justice Isa’s directions. In a nine-page judicial note, which was initially uploaded but later removed from the court’s official website, Justice Isa observed that since the gathering in a court of six distinguished judges was not permissible under the Constitution or under any law, the Supreme Court’s order of March 29 — Justice Isa’s order — could not have been set aside by the registrar’s note.
“Decisions emanating from a courtroom overcast with the shadow of autocracy cannot displace the Constitution,” Justice Isa observed and also pointed out procedural irregularities in constituting the bench. It said a roster was issued for the same day — a procedure only followed when there was an extraordinary emergency, but in the present case there was none.

Second senior-most SC judge says six-member bench verdict overruling his order ‘without constitutional validity’

The case roster was also issued the same day and the matter was also listed that too after court time; besides no prior notice of the listing of the matter was issued whereas no notice was issued to the attorney general of Pakistan as per Order XXVIIA of the Code of Civil Procedure.
The six-member bench’s order records that the AGP was on court’s notice and the counsel of PMDC was also in attendance without prior notice, which meant he was verbally or telephonically sent for, contrary to usual practice, the judge added.
‘Constitutional deviations’
The federal court’s decision enabled future dictators to overthrow civilian governments, Justice Isa observed. Regretfully more than once, the CJP and judges of the Supreme Court facilitated dictators and the country with the largest Muslim population broke apart because constitutional deviations were justified, Justice Isa regretted.
The six-judge order designates the CJP as the ‘Master of Rolls’ — a term not found in the Constitution, in any law, or even in the Supreme Court Rules 1980, Justice Isa said in his note. The SC judge added that the April 4 order relied on an earlier note authored by Justice Munib Akhtar which stated that it “clearly and categorically lays down the rule that suo motu jurisdiction of the Supreme Court can only and solely be invoked by the CJP”.
Justice Isa observed that the majority order also appears to be in violation of the well-settled rule of law which is axiomatic that the CJP was the master of the roster.
“With respect, Justice Munib Akhtar’s earlier note was not a legal precedent. In any event, the said reasoning is without a constitutional or legal foundation,” he observed, adding that the stated rule of law was not enacted pursuant to law nor can it by its own be categorised as rule of law, particularly when it contravenes the Constitution, which does not grant the CJP such powers.
The April 4 reasoning is otherwise flawed too, Justice Isa said, adding ironically, in a matter in which the so-called larger bench had wrongly assumed jurisdiction, the April 4 note had no constitutional or legal validity to hold that March 29 order (Justice Isa order) was without and beyond jurisdiction.
