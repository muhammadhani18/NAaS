0,Rare crossover of holidays leads to call for peace,"UN Sec-Gen says it is an occasion for people believing in God ""in different ways [...] to join their voices in a common prayer for peace"".","WASHINGTON: This weekend the world’s three major religions are celebrating a rare crossover of holidays — Ramazan, Easter, and Passover — which only happens once in 30 years.
UN Secretary-General António Guterres availed this opportunity to urge people of faith across the globe to join their voices in a common prayer for peace.
“This is (an occasion) to come together and for those that believe in God (in) different ways, with different expressions, to join their voices in a common prayer for peace,” he said in his message.
 






US Secretary of State Antony Blinken appealed to the people of all faiths to “use this time to remind ourselves of the common values of peace, harmony, and empathy — values that we all hold dear”.
Ramazan is a month-long observation focused on fasting, prayer, charity, and reflection. It marks the revelation of the Holy Quran.
Christians worldwide are celebrating a holy week, which includes Palm Sunday, Holy Thursday, Good Friday, Holy Saturday, and Easter Sunday.
Passover, which began on Wednesday is also a week-long celebration, marking the Jewish people’s escape from slavery in Egypt.
Earlier this week, a synagogue — B’nai Tzedek, which is a conservative congregation — held an interfaith Iftar for Muslims.
When the time to break the fast came, a Muslim prayer leader, Imam Talib Shareef, was invited to do azan inside the synagogue as Jewish, Muslim, and Christian children distributed water, dates, and figs.
The evening (maghrib) prayers were also said inside the synagogue, followed by dinner.
Rabbi Stuart Weinblatt, the founder of the synagogue, in his welcoming address, said that he was inspired by the Muslim tradition of painting Quranic verses to put Hebrew letters on the building’s entrance.
The congregation’s name — B’nai Tzedek — also underlines the link between the Hebrew language, as Tzedek in Arabic is Sidq or righteousness.
White House Liaison for the Muslim American Community Moshtayen Ahmad urged people of faiths to come together so that “your voices are reflected” in the policy-making process.
The organisers also read a message from Governor Wes Moore of Maryland, recognising Ramazan as a holy month in his state. More than 35,000 Muslims from 60 different nations live in Maryland.
 






Representatives of various Christian sects also addressed the gathering, emphasising the need to promote peace and harmony and reject messages of hate, like Islamophobia and antisemitism.
Kersie Shroff, a representative of the Parsi community who grew up in Karachi, recalled that he enjoyed not only iftar but also having sehri with his neighbours in Pakistan.
Leaders of the Bahai and Sikh communities also spoke, emphasising the need for religious harmony across the globe. Anila Ali, who organised the iftar with Rabbi Weinblatt, spoke about the links between the three Abrahamic faiths — Islam, Christianity, and Judaism.
Some US television channels also did special programs on this occasion. In one of these programmes  — “Morning in America” — Rabbi Denise Eger and Father Francis Hoffman discussed how the faithful can remain positive in a world that tries to take away their humanity.

1,North Korea tests another ‘underwater nuclear attack drone’,"N. Korean media says ""test perfectly proved the reliability of the underwater strategic weapon system and its fatal attack ability"".","SEOUL: North Korea claimed on Saturday it had tested another underwater nuclear attack drone, in its latest response to South Korean and United States military drills, though analysts have questioned whether Pyongyang has such a weapon.
In recent weeks, North Korea has tested what state media have described as an underwater nuclear-capable drone, and also carried out the launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile.
“A national defence science research institute in the DPRK carried out a test of underwater strategic weapon system from April 4 to 7,” the official Korean Central News Agency said.
“The underwater nuclear attack drone ‘Haeil-2’… cruised 1,000 km of simulated underwater distance … for 71 hours and 6 minutes.”
KCNA added that “the test warhead accurately detonated underwater. The test perfectly proved the reliability of the underwater strategic weapon system and its fatal attack ability”.
North Korea has claimed to have conducted three tests of underwater drones in less than three weeks so far.
On March 23, it claimed to have conducted the first test of the Haeil, which means tsunami in Korean, able to unleash a “radioactive tsunami” as it blamed US-South Korea exercises for a deteriorating regional security situation. Five days later it said it had carried out a second test.
In response, South Korean Defence Minister Lee Jong-sup told MPs Seoul was  “capable of monitoring and detecting such drones infiltrating underwater”.
Satellite imagery has also indicated a high level of activity at North Korea’s main nuclear complex after leader Kim Jong Un ordered that the production of weapons-grade nuclear material be ramped up.

2,China launches three days of military drills in Taiwan Strait,"BEIJING: China launched military drills around Taiwan on Saturday, in what it called a  “stern warning” to the...","BEIJING: China launched military drills around Taiwan on Saturday, in what it called a  “stern warning” to the self-ruled island’s government following a meeting between its president and the US House speaker.
Dubbed  “United Sharp Sword”, the three-day operation — which state media said includes rehearsing an encirclement of Taiwan — will run until Monday, the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) Eastern Theatre Command said in a statement.
Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen immediately denounced the drills, pledging to work with  “the US and other like-minded countries” in the face of  “continued authoritarian expansionism”.
China’s war games would send planes, ships and personnel into  “the maritime areas and air space of the Taiwan Strait, off the northern and southern coasts of the island, and to the island’s east”, said Shi Yin, a PLA spokesman.
A report from state broadcaster CCTV said:  “The task force will simultaneously organise patrols and advances around Taiwan island, shaping an all-round encirclement and deterrence posture.” The report went on to detail the type of weaponry China was putting through its paces, including  “long-range rocket artillery, naval destroyers, missile boats, air force fighters, bombers, jammers and refuellers”.
Taiwan’s defence ministry released a video showing soldiers loading anti-aircraft missile launchers, fighter jets taking off, and other military preparedness exercises.
The footage included surveillance of China’s Shandong aircraft carrier, which sailed through waters south of Taiwan earlier this week.
The 75-second clip, which included English subtitles, ended with a caption saying:  “We seek neither escalation nor conflict, but we remain steadfast, rational, and serious to react and defend our territory and sovereignty.”
Exercises on Monday will include live-fire drills off the coast of China’s Fujian province, which faces Tai­wan, the local maritime authority said.
The manoeuvres come after a meeting between Tsai and US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in California. China views democratic, self-ruled Taiwan as part of its territory and has vowed to seize it one day, by force if necessary.
“These operations serve as a stern warning against the collusion between separatist forces seeking ‘Taiwan independence’ and external forces and against their provocative activities,” the PLA’s Shi said.
“The operations are necessary for safeguarding China’s national sovereignty and territorial integrity.” Taiwan’s defence ministry said eight Chinese warships and 42 fighter jets were detected around the island on Saturday.
The ministry expressed  “solemn condemnation of such irrational actions”, adding the detections included 29 jets that crossed into Taiwan’s southwestern air defence identification zone (ADIZ), the highest number in a single day this year.
China was using Tsai’s US visit as an  “excuse to conduct military exercises, which has seriously undermined peace, stability and security in the region”, the Taiwanese ministry said.
The drills also follow the departure from Beijing of French President Emmanuel Macron and EU chief Ursula von der Leyen, who were in China to urge Xi Jinping to help bring an end to the war in Ukraine.
China deployed warships, missiles and fighter jets around Taiwan last August in its largest show of force in years, following a trip to the island by McCarthy’s predecessor, Nancy Pelosi. McCarthy, who is second in line to the US presidency, had originally planned to go to Taiwan himself.

3,20 migrants missing after boat sinks off Tunisia,TUNIS: At least 20 African migrants were missing on Saturday after their boat sank off Tunisia as they tried to ...,"TUNIS: At least 20 African migrants were missing on Saturday after their boat sank off Tunisia as they tried to cross the Mediterranean to Italy, a judicial official said, amidst a sharp rise in migrant boats from the North African country.
The coast guard rescued 17 others off the southern city of Sfax from the same boat, two of whom are in critical condition, Sfax court judge Faouzi Masmousdi said.
In recent weeks, dozens have gone missing and died in repeated drowning accidents off the Tunisian coast. Tunisia has taken over from Libya as a main departure point for people fleeing poverty and conflict in Africa and the Middle East in the hope of a better life in Europe.
The National Guard said that more than 14,000 migrants, mostly from sub-Saharan Africa, were intercepted or rescued in the first three months of the year while trying to cross into Europe, five times more than figures recorded in the same period last year.
Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said that Europe risks seeing a huge wave of migrants arriving on its shores from North Africa if financial stability in Tunisia is not safeguarded. Meloni called on the IMF and other countries to help Tunisia quickly to avoid its collapse.

4,Conflicting US rulings leave fate of abortion pill in doubt,WASHINGTON: Conflicting rulings by two federal judges have left the future of abortion pills in the United States...,"WASHINGTON: Conflicting rulings by two federal judges have left the future of abortion pills in the United States deeply uncertain, likely placing the divisive issue squarely in the lap of the Supreme Court.
A ruling Friday by federal judge Matthew Kacsmaryk in Texas banned the widely used drug mifepristone (RU 486) nationwide, boosting conservatives’ efforts to further restrict abortion rights after the Supreme Court last year allowed states to prohibit them.
The unprecedented rejection of a drug approved in 2000 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) — and found safe by scientific consensus — sparked outrage on the political left.
Kacsmaryk, in his ruling, adopted language used by abortion opponents, referring to abortion providers as  “abortionists” and saying the drug was used to  “kill the unborn human.” His ruling brought an immediate vow from the Biden administration and the drug’s maker to appeal the matter in federal court.
Attorney General Merrick Garland said the Justice Depart­ment would ask the appeals court to stay the ban by Kacsmaryk, an ultraconservative Donald Trump appointee, until the case is finally resolved.
If the Texas ruling holds, it would complicate matters not just in the states now banning or sharply limiting abortions, but also in those where the procedure remains legal.
Widely used
Mifepristone has been used as part of a two-drug regimen by 5.6 million women since 2000. But adding to the uncertainty and increasing the odds the matter ends up before the Supreme Court was a contradictory ruling from a Washington state judge that came just hours after Kacsmaryk’s.
District Judge Thomas Rice, a Barack Obama appointee, ruled in a separate case — brought by several states where abortion is legal — that mifepristone is  “safe and legal” and that the FDA must preserve access to it in more than a dozen states.
For now the drug remains legal, Alexis McGill Johnson, the head of Planned Parenthood, one of the largest pro-abortion groups in the country, said.
Several abortion clinics also said that they would continue using mifepristone until ordered not to by the FDA, US media reported.
Kacsmaryk paused the effect of his ruling for a week, allowing time for the administration and drugmaker Danco Laboratories to file before the US Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in Louisiana, which hears cases from Texas. The Justice Department is still reviewing Rice’s ruling, Garland said in a statement.
‘Remains safe’ 
Given the sharply conflicting court rulings, the Justice Department might opt to take the case directly to the Supreme Court and not wait for the Fifth Circuit to act.
The high court could decide to take up the case on an emergency basis, which would require making room in an already crowded agenda at the end of the current term.
In that case, the court — with six conservative justices outnumbering the three liberals — could hear the case within days, or weeks, but sometime before the current session ends on June 30.
Chief Justice John Roberts, a conservative, is deeply protective of the image of the institution, and he might be expected to vote with the three liberals in favor of mifepristone. The additional vote of one other conservative could provide a majority for the drug.
The court’s ruling last June to overturn the longstanding Roe v. Wade decision protecting abortion rights shifted considerable attention to medication abortions.

5,Ukrainians mourn dozens killed at rail hub one year ago,KRAMATORSK: Ukrainians in the eastern city of Kramatorsk on Saturday laid flowers at a small memorial at the central...,"KRAMATORSK: Ukrainians in the eastern city of Kramatorsk on Saturday laid flowers at a small memorial at the central train station one year after Russian missiles hit the transport hub, killing dozens.
The strikes on April 8 last year killed 61 people and injured more than 160 in one of the single deadliest attacks of the war, which targeted civilians fleeing Russia’s advance.
“What is there to say? My close friend and her daughter and their dog died.
What more can be said?” 67-year-old Tetiana Syshchenko said, tearing up. She said she herself narrowly avoided being killed in the blast. A slow trickle of residents approached a small plaque topped with flowers and children’s toys at the station. They crossed themselves, standing or kneeling silently or crying.
Some 4,000 civilians had gathered last April to board evacuation trains when the station was struck by a Tochka-U missile, which experts said was armed with cluster munitions.
One missile fragment was inscribed by Russian forces with the words:  “For our children”. Arriving at the station minutes after the strike, journalists saw at least 30 bodies in bags.
The blood-soaked pavement was strewn with abandoned suitcases, children’s possessions and food. The Kremlin has denied responsibility and said Russian forces do not target civilians, describing the incident as a  “provocation”.
Sergiy Kupochka, a 57-year-old municipal worker, recounted to AFP at the station that his colleagues were distributing food and water to evacuees at the time of the attack. “One of our employees died here,” he said, adding that even one year on,  “I’m in pain”.

6,Iraq calls on Turkiye to apologise for airport attack,"Iraqi presidency says Turkiye has no legal justification to continue “intimidating civilians under the pretext that forces hostile to it"" exist in Iraq.","ERBIL: The Iraqi government called on Turkiye on Saturday to apologise for what it said was an attack on Sulaymaniyah airport in northern Iraq, saying Ankara must cease hostilities on Iraqi soil.
The Iraqi presidency said in a statement that Turkiye had no legal justification to continue “intimidating civilians under the pretext that forces hostile to it are present on Iraqi soil”.
“In this regard, we call on the Turkish government to take responsibility and present an official apology,” it said.
Lawk Ghafuri, head of foreign media affairs for the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG), said a drone attack hit the vicinity of Sulaymaniyah airport on Friday but it caused no damage nor delays or suspension of flights.
A Turkish defence ministry official said no Turkish Armed Forces operation took place in that region on Friday.
The US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said in a statement on Saturday that its chief, Mazloum Abdi, was at the airport at the time of the alleged attack but “no harm was done”.
Abdi condemned the attack on Saturday but did not mention that he was targeted.
An informed source close to the leadership of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), the party that controls the Sulaimaniya area, and two Kurdish security officials also confirmed that Abdi and three US military personnel were near the airport.
The three sources said no one was injured or killed in the incident.
A US official confirmed there was a strike on a convoy in the area and US military personnel were in it, but there were no casualties.
While Turkiye views the Kurdish-led forces in Syria as terrorists and a national security threat, the United States considers the SDF an ally that has helped drive the militant Islamic State group from vast areas of Syria.
Turkiye has conducted several military operations including air strikes over the decades in northern Iraq and northern Syria against the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, IS and the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK).
Claims of an attack came days after Turkiye closed its airspace to aircraft travelling to and from Sulaymaniyah due to what it said was intensified activity there by PKK militants.
The outlawed PKK, which has led an insurgency against the Turkish state since 1984, is considered a terrorist organisation by Turkiye, the United States and the European Union.

7,Florida governor vows to void Disney agreement,Florida Governor Ron DeSantis says the legislature would void changes Disney made shortly before it lost control of the board.,"Florida Governor Ron DeSantis ramped up his fight against Walt Disney Co, seeking to void an agreement that Disney passed to limit the power of a board appointed by DeSantis to oversee its Florida theme park property.
On Thursday, in remarks made at Hillsdale College in Michigan, DeSantis said the legislature would void changes Disney made shortly before it lost control of the board.
“They are not superior to the people of Florida. And so come hell or high water, we’re going to make sure that policy of Florida carries the day,” the Florida governor said.
“We’re going to look at things like taxes on hotels, we’re going to look at things like tolls on the roads, we’re going to look at things like developing some of the property that the district owns,” added DeSantis, widely considered a 2024 presidential candidate.
Disney did not immediately respond to a request for comment on DeSantis’ remarks. However, earlier in the week, Chief Executive Bob Iger fired back at DeSantis, saying his apparent retaliation against Disney for taking a position on legislation was “anti-business”.
Disney opposed Florida’s Parental Rights in Education Act — referred to by opponents as the “Don’t Say Gay” bill — that restricts classroom discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity.
Florida lawmakers passed a bill in February giving DeSantis effective control over a board that oversees municipal services and development in a special district that encom­passes Walt Disney World resort.

8,"Israel starts calling up police, army reservists after deadly attacks",Violence has surged since Israeli police thrashed worshippers inside Al Aqsa mosque,"JERUSALEM: Israel began calling up police and army reservists on Saturday after separate attacks claimed the lives of three people, including an Italian tourist, in Tel Aviv and the occupied West Bank.
Despite appeals for restraint, violence has surged since Israeli police went after Palestinian worsh­ippers inside Jerus­alem’s flashpoint Al Aqsa mosque on Wednesday, with Israel bombarding both Gaza and Lebanon in response to rocket fire by Palestinian fighters. 
The Italian was killed and seven other tourists wounded when a man  identified as being of Arab origin, ploughed a car into pedestrians on the Tel Aviv seafront on Friday evening and flipped over before being shot dead, police and emergency services said. 
Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni named the dead man as Alessandro Parini, 36. Police identified the driver as a 45-year-old from the Arab town of Kfar Kassem in central Israel. “The terrorist was neutralised,” a spokesman said. 

Violence has surged since Israeli police thrashed worshippers inside Al Aqsa mosque

Following the Tel Aviv attack, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu instructed the police to “mobilise all reserve border police units” and directed the army to “mobilise additional forces”, his office said. 
Police said four reserve battalions of border police would be deployed in city centres from Sunday, in addition to units already deployed in the Jerusalem region and in the central city of Lod, which has a mixed population of Jews and Arabs. 
Cross-border strikes 
The attacks came after Israel launched air strikes and an artillery bombardment before dawn in response to rocket fire from the Gaza Strip and Lebanon.
It was the heaviest rocket fire from Lebanon since Israel fought a 34-day war with Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah in 2006 and the first time Israel has confirmed an attack on Lebanese territory since April 2022. 
Israel “struck targets, including terror infrastructures, belonging to the Hamas terrorist organisation in southern Lebanon”, the army said. 
The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, which patrols the area along the border, urged restraint, noting: “Both sides have said they do not want a war.” 
On Friday evening, the army said it had shot down a drone that had entered Israel’s airspace from Lebanon.

9,S. African fugitive arrested after shocking prison break,JOHANNESBURG: A South African fugitive who faked his own death in a prison break that embarrassed authorities has...,"JOHANNESBURG: A South African fugitive who faked his own death in a prison break that embarrassed authorities has been apprehended in Tanzania, the government said on Saturday.
Thabo Bester, a convicted rapist, escaped from a privately-run prison in Bloemfontein in May last year — but South African police only found out last month.
On Saturday, Justice Minister Ronald Lamola said Bester was arrested by Tanzanian authorities on Friday night along with a woman he is reportedly romantically involved with and another person.
“(We) can confirm that escapee Mr Thabo Bester with his accomplice Dr Nandipha Maguduma(na) along with a Mozambican national have been arrested in Tanzania late last night,” Lamola told a press briefing.
Bester was believed to have died after setting himself on fire behind bars, but in late March police said DNA tests revealed the charred remains found in his cell belonged to someone else.
Dubbed the  “Facebook rapist”, Bester allegedly lured victims on the social media platform before raping and robbing them. He killed at least one victim. In 2012 he was sentenced to life in prison for rape, robbery and murder.

10,Canada repatriates 14 citizens from Syria camps,This is the 4th repatriation operation conducted by Canadian govt of its nationals held in camps in Kurdish-administered northeastern Syria.,"MONTREAL: Canada repatriated four women and 10 children linked to the militant Islamic State group from camps for displaced people in northeastern Syria this week, police said on Friday.
This is the fourth repatriation operation conducted by the Canadian government of its nationals held in camps in Kurdish-administered northeastern Syria.
Three of the women were arrested at the airport before appearing in court on a “terrorism peace bond application”, a type of restraining order, police said in a statement.
One of them, an unidentified 38-year-old woman, was transported to Alberta in western Canada and released on bail pending a hearing on the conditions of her status.
“This is not a criminal charge,” her lawyer, Lawrence Greenspon, said, adding that the prosecutor will want to “ensure that the person follows the conditions for a period of up to one year.”
The other two, Ammara Amjad and Dure Ahmed, “will remain in custody until their next hearing, which is scheduled for Tuesday,” police added.
“Everything was good” regarding the fourth woman, said Greenspon, who is representing all four repatriated women. She faces neither criminal charges nor a request for a peace bond on terrorism.
“The 10 children are repatriated and are with their families here in Canada,” the lawyer added.
Canada’s Foreign Affairs Department said it was concerned for the “health and well-being” of the Canadian children following the “deteriorating conditions in the camps” where they were confined until recently.
Last October, Canada repatriated two women and two children held in Syria and, in 2020, Ottawa allowed the return of an orphaned five-year-old girl, after her uncle filed a lawsuit against the government.
Since the end of the “caliphate” established by the so-called IS group in Syria and Iraq, many countries have been reticent to accept the repatriation of the wives and children of jihadists.
