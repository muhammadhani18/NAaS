0,Govt-SC wrangling also divides legal fraternity,"Members up in arms after SCBA president, secretary throw weight behind CJP; KP bar calls on Justice Bandial to quit.","KARACHI: Battle lines seem to have been drawn among the legal fraternity over the ongoing constitutional crisis after two leading lawyers’ bodies took diametrically opposite positions on Saturday, with some throwing their weight behind Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial, and others seeking his scalp.
In a statement, Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) President Abid S. Zuberi and Secretary Muqtedir Akhtar Shabbir announced that the body stands with rule of law, supremacy of Constitution and dignity of the Supreme Court, headed by the CJP. 
However, the statement was soon contradicted by a missive claiming to be from a majority of SCBA executive committee members, who regretted that the two office-bearers were acting like spokespersons of a political party rather than working towards constitutional supremacy.
Separately, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Bar Council Vice Chairman Zarbadshah Khan, in a statement issued from Peshawar, expressed reservations over the way the CJP had conducted proceedings in the suo motu case about holding polls in Punjab, and asked him to resign. 

Members up in arms after SCBA president, secretary throw weight behind CJP; KP bar calls on Justice Bandial to quit

On their part, the two SCBA office-bearers took serious exception to the “blatantly illegal” resolution passed by the National Assembly on April 6, against the Supreme Court’s decision in the elections case as being violative of the Constitution and independence of the judiciary.
Their statement said that it was truly unfortunate to observe that the National Assembly, which is bound to act in accordance of the Constitution, has disregarded Article 68 which prohibits any discussion in parliament with respect to the conduct of any judge of superior courts in discharge of his duties. 
Moreover, Mr Zuberi and Mr Shabbir strongly condemned the reference filed against the CJP before the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) as blatantly illegal and yet another attempt to subvert the Constitution.
“Whereas, members of parliament have made disparaging and extremely disrespectful comments against members of the judiciary which is not only violative of the Constitution but a direct challenge to the integrity of the judiciary,” they said.  
Members of the executive and parliament are bound to act in accordance with the orders of the Supreme Court which is final; and cannot be set aside or circumvented by way of an NA resolution. 
Reservations
But hours after the two men issued their communique, a separate statement attributed to ten members of the SCBA executive committee, including vice-presidents from KP and Balochistan and members from other parts of the country, took issue with the “non-representative statement” issued by their president and secretary “without taking into confidence the majority of executive”.
“They have not only tried to deepen the difference among Supreme Court judges but also tried to attack on (sic) the supremacy of parliament,” the statement deplored.
The statement demanded that the CJP “immediately call full court meeting to patch all differences” and “constitute a fill court bench to rectify all dissenting decisions”.
Separately, calling upon the CJP to resign, the KP Bar Council urged the federal government to file a reference against Justice Bandial for “violating” judicial code of conduct in the elections case.
Mr Zarbadshah announced holding a lawyers’ representative meeting for independence of judiciary on April 12, adding that office bearers of bar associations from across the province would be invited to the meeting. 
He pointed out that Justice Athar Minallah’s “judgement” had clearly proved that the suo motu matter had been rejected by the court with a majority of four to three, but the CJP had allegedly given a misstatement and thus violated the code of conduct. 
He recalled that they had filed a reference against Justice Mazahar Ali Naqvi in the SJC, but instead of taking action on it the CJP had been making him [Justice Naqvi] part of important benches of his choice.

1,Ali Amin Gandapur handed over to Islamabad police from D.I. Khan,PTI leader summoned on Tuesday for indictment in 2013 suicide attack case.,"DERA ISMAIL KHAN: The Islamabad police on Saturday shifted PTI leader Ali Amin Khan Gandapur from the central jail in Dera Ismail Khan to the federal capital.
Earlier, a court of judicial magistrate-I in Dera Ismail Khan ordered the handing over of Mr Gandapur to Islamabad police. He will be produced in a court when he reaches the capital.
Mr Gandapur, a former federal minister, was arrested from outside the Peshawar High Court’s D.I. Khan bench on Thursday and sent to the central jail on a six-day judicial remand.
The Islamabad and Punjab police from Bhakkar reached Dera Ismail Khan in the morning on Saturday and sought the PTI leader’s custody from the judicial magistrate.

PTI leader summoned on Tuesday for indictment in 2013 suicide attack case

Several party workers blocked the road for traffic by burning tyres near the town hall in protest against Mr Gandapur’s arrest and transfer to Islamabad.
The local police arrested five PTI workers for violating an emergency law known as Section 144, which prohibits gatherings.
Former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser, former Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Pervez Khattak and PTI Senator Azam Swati also reached Dera Ismail Khan to express solidarity with Mr Gandapur.
They met his brothers — former provincial minister Faisal Amin Gandapur and city mayor of D.I. Khan tehsil Umar Amin Gandapur — and assured them of full legal support on behalf of the party leadership.
Talking to the media, Mr Qaiser said fake cases were being registered against the PTI, which he said was only pressing for free and fair elections.
Indictment on April 11
Meanwhile, an anti-terrorism court in Dera Ismail Khan has set Ali Amin Gandapur’s indictment for April 11 (Tuesday) in a 10-year-old suicide attack case in which former KP law minister Sardar Israrullah Khan Gandapur was killed.
Mr Ali’s brother, Umar Amin, is currently on bail in the same case, which was registered at the Kulachi Police Station on the complaint of a close associate of the victim.
The attack that killed Mr Israrullah happened on the first day of Eidul Azha in 2013 at the Gandapur Cottage in Kulachi.
Ali Amin Gandapur’s lawyer, Ghulam Muhammad Sapal, told Dawn that the D.I. Khan anti-terrorism court had already issued a summons requiring Mr Ali to appear on April 11 and the central jail authorities had been informed about it in writing.
However, Islamabad and Punjab police still took him with them even though the law did not allow it, he said.
Mr Sapal said that if the case of an accused was under trial in the same district, he could not be transferred to another district. “Our government is making a joke of the law,” he said.

3,Wapda wants safety protocols beefed up after GB dam mishap,"“We express grief over the loss of precious lives in this tragedy,” Wapda Chairman Sajjad Ghani said.","LAHORE: A day after three workers were killed and several injured in an explosion during rock blasting at the Diamer-Bhasha Dam construction site, the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) has directed all project contractors and consultants to revisit safety guidelines and put in place effective safety mechanism to avoid a repeat of such incidents.
“We express grief over the loss of precious lives in this tragedy,” Wapda Chairman Sajjad Ghani said on Saturday during his visit to the project site.
“Keeping this in view, the contractors and the consultants are required to review the current safety guidelines and ensure effective safety mechanisms to avoid such incidents in future,” he said.
The police said after the incident that labourers were preparing explosives for blasting when it accidentally exploded due to a short circuit at the site.
Mr Ghani, a retired lieutenant general, had a detailed round of the incident site and interacted with the workers during the visit. The chief executive of the Diamer-Bhasha Company, and other company officials and representatives of the contractors and the consultants were also present, according to a Wapda spokesperson.
The dam’s management informed the chairman about the causes of the accident and details about rescue and relief operations.
Mr Ghani also gave cheques to compensate workers who sustained minor injuries in Friday’s accident.
He had already announced a compensation of Rs500,000 each for the families of the deceased, Rs500,000 each for the workers severely injured, and Rs200,000 each for the workers with minor injuries.
This compensation is in addition to the one which the victims of the incident would receive from the contractor as per rules.
The Diamer-Bhasha Dam is being constructed on the Indus river, 40 kilometres downstream of Chilas town. Construction work is simultaneously underway on more than a dozen sites.
Later, the Wapda chairman also visited the under-construction Dasu Hydropower Project and reviewed construction work on a starter dam, cut-of-wall and an underground powerhouse.
He was briefed that the second diversion tunnel is scheduled for completion in mid-April and cut-of-wall in mid-May. Besides, the river diversion system is also expected to be completed by mid-May to pass through the Indus river around the year.
He urged the project authorities to complete construction work as per the schedule. The 2,160-megawatt Phase I of the Dasu Hydropower Project is likely to start power generation in 2026.

4,Sanaullah favours polls in October due to financial constraints,PML-N leaders seek ‘level playing field’ for all parties before elections.,"ISLAMABAD: Interior Minist­­er Rana Sanaullah on Saturday said keeping in view the financial position of the country, holding of general elections in October would be a good option for the government. 
Talking to a private news channel, he said the judiciary should constitute a full court to hear petitions of political parties regarding the elections. He said political parties have made a request to the Supreme Court for constituting a larger bench to listen to the genuine complaints of public representatives regarding elections in Punjab. 
The minister said the government is engaged in compiling the digital census, and security personnel have also been deployed for security of the staff collecting the census data. He said the government will provide security and financial resources to the Election Commission of Pakistan to hold transparent elections in October.

PML-N leaders seek ‘level playing field’ for all parties before elections

Level playing field
Federal minister and senior PML-N leader Mian Javed Latif said his party would accept the general elections only if its leadership was given level playing field in the political process. 
Speaking at a press conference in Lahore, he said no political party wanted to avoid elections, but level playing field should be given to all before holding general elections this year, adding that the PML-N leadership had always accepted court decisions and never indulged in politics of agitation. 
He said Nawaz Sharif had faced disqualification and judicial trials despite being innocent, but it was time to ensure justice to him, who had served the country as the prime minister thrice and contributed to development and progress of the country. 
Mr Latif said no suo moto was taken on the PTI chief’s “cipher conspiracy”, attack on national institutions, instigating the institutions to violate the Constitution and law, the RTS [results transmission system] malfunctioning to support Imran Khan, and the PTI government’s performance, which destroyed the economy. He said justice parameters should be the same for all, as no one should be dear to justice and above the law. 
The minister said foreign elements wanted to pressurise the national institutions just to benefit from chaos and political instability, caused by Imran Khan in the country. He said the PTI chief had become a puppet of foreign elements, as he always intended to destabilise the national institutions and created hurdles in the way to development and progress of the country. 
Separately, PM’s special assistant Attaullah Tarar said elections should be held across the country simultaneously as the PTI had nothing to do with the country and it was bent upon spreading chaos and anarchy in society. He said the PML-N was never afraid of going into elections; however, it wanted that level playing field should be ensured for all parties. 
In reply to a question at a press conference in Lahore, the SAPM said all political parties in the ruling alliance were united and decisions were being taken with consultation.

5,Difa-i-Pakistan Council resurfaces to warn of ‘conspiracies’,"Forum blames politicians for prevalent woes, claims nation ‘being sacrificed’ for personal political gain.","ISLAMABAD: The Difa-i-Pakistan Council (DPC), an umbrella coalition of primarily jihadi groups which had been dormant for several years, huddled at a local hotel with a one-point agenda — deliberations on how to pre-empt ‘conspiracies’ allegedly hatched by politicians to hurt the ‘national interest’.
The DPC was established in 2011 in reaction to the killings of Pakistani soldiers by the US forces at the Pak-Afghan border. It, however, remained inactive after the murder of its founder Maulana Samiul Haq in 2018.
During the “emergency meeting”, without naming any particular political party, the outfit talked about a “conspiracy by politicians to bring chaos and anarchy” in the country allegedly at the behest of the global powers.
Saturday’s meeting was not attended by senior leaders of Jamaatud Dawa and the Jamaat-i-Islami.

Forum blames politicians for prevalent woes, claims nation ‘being sacrificed’ for personal political gain

Addressing the meeting, DPC Chairman Maulana Hamidul Haq Haqqani said that the “global forces were conspiring to weaken Pakistan”.
“Pakistan is a nuclear power so the enemy is spreading propaganda against us…they know that this nation cannot be defeated through the use of force,” said the son of late DPC chief Samiul Haq.
The DPC chairman claimed that the “enemy forces wanted to carry out suicide attacks at mosques and Imambargahs” to create discord in the country. Without naming India or any other country, Mr Haqqani claimed that “enemies hiding in Afghanistan” wanted to launch attacks into Pakistan from Afghan soil.
‘No tolerance for chaos’
The speeches made by the delegates were heavily critical of politicians and particularly criticised the PTI as well its leader Imran Khan, albeit without naming them. The state-run PTV also aired the meeting, including the speech of banned outfit Ahle Sunnat Wal Jamaat head Ahmed Ludhianvi.
Mr Ludhianvi said political matters should be decided in parliament instead of the streets. “We will not tolerate any chaos….” In an allusion to remarks made by former US envoy Zalmi Khalilzad purportedly in favour of former premier Imran Khan, Mr Ludhianvi said that “foreign agents were interfering” in the internal affairs of Pakistan. “Time has come to take care of it immediately,” he said without elaborating.
The speakers said that the defence of a country and its economy go hand in hand. They said that the economy has been in a state of constant decline for the past few years, but despite all the negative economic indicators, the country was still stable.
Most of the speakers blamed the political class for the prevalent ills and said that politicians were allegedly “busy in achieving their political benefits” at the expense of poor economic situation, injustice, and terrorism. They also blamed the politicians for compromising the integrity of the country.
The declaration of the meeting said that political and economic instability was weakening the foundations of Pakistan and endangering its integrity. It slammed the policymakers, saying that for a billion dollars, the IMF was “insulting” the entire nation.
“The enemies of the country were enjoying Pakistan’s weak economic condition but few actors in the country are playing in their hands,” the DPC said, adding, “Today, the state and the entire nation were being sacrificed for personal politics in the country, which is not acceptable to this forum.”
The DPC leaders said that “politics of vengeance will destroy the entire system… hurling unrealistic and fake criticism was neither part of Islamic teachings nor allowed in the eastern culture and traditions”. The DPC further claimed that facts were distorted through organised propaganda campaigns on social media.
Maulana Fazlur Rehman Khalil, founder of Harkat-ul-Mujahideen (HuM) and current leader of Ansarul Umma said, “Our motherland is fighting for survival, freedom and independence, national pride, and defence of important national interests.” “Our freedom, sovereignty and integrity are at stake,” he claimed.

6,PML-N dismisses fake notice claiming to expel KP leaders,"The episode comes amid widening differences between Sardar Mehtab Abbasi and Amir Muqam, the party’s provincial leader.","PESHAWAR: The PML-N’s central and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa leadership dismissed reports on Saturday that the party’s provincial chapter had expelled some senior leaders, including former chief minister Sardar Mehtab Ahmed Khan Abbasi and former governor Iqbal Zafar Jhagra.
The party’s reaction came after a show-cause notice circulating on social media claimed that the KP chapter had removed five PML-N leaders — Mr Abbasi, Mr Jhagra, Arbab Khizar Hayat, Fareed Khan and Esal Khan — from party positions.
The purported notice said these leaders were expelled for “violating the party discipline, disobeying party’s decisions, conspiring to divide the party into two factions in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, giving statements against the party leadership in the print and electronic media and making insulting speeches”.
“This [notice] is fake,” the PML-N’s president in KP, Amir Muqam, told Dawn. “We contradict it. We don’t know who has issued this notice.”
Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Marriyum Aurangzeb also shared the notification on her Twitter handle and captioned it “fake” in all capital letters.
 






The party’s information secretary in KP, Ikhtiar Wali Khan, also rejected the notice in a post on social media, describing it as “photoshopped”. He alleged that someone had used a “fake notice to gain cheap popularity”, adding that the party condemned it.
The episode came amid widening differences between Sardar Mehtab Abbasi and Mr Muqam, the party’s provincial leader.
Some time ago, Mr Abbasi held a press conference in his native town of Abbottabad and accused Mr Muqam of undermining and weakening the party.
This was soon followed by two back-to-back meetings at Mr Jhagra’s residence in Peshawar, where a nazriati (ideological) faction was launched to demand the removal of the provincial president.
Mr Abbasi attended the first meeting, and it was announced that the group would soon convene a meeting of the party’s general council to oust Mr Muqam from office.
