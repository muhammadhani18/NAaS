0,FBR detects illegal import of smartphones worth $7.19m,FBR official says 52 Goods Declarations worth $8.5m related to imports of mobile phones cleared between Dec and Feb.,"ISLAMABAD: Mobile phones worth $7.19 million have been imported illegally without opening the letters of credit (LCs) or utilising the banking channel, disclosed a report of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) on Saturday.
A senior official of FBR said despite an unannounced ban on the import of mobile phones and their accessories by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), 52 Goods Declarations (GDs) worth $8.65m related to the import of mobile phones had been cleared between December 2022 and February, adding that these mobile phones have been imported in Completely Build Up (CBU) condition.
The FBR highlighted that only $1.46m was paid legally out of Pakistan through the banking channel. Whereas $7.19m flowed out of Pakistan illegally, however, the tax collecting body has not mentioned the mode of payments made to the suppliers in Dubai for the import of mobile phones.
Responding to a query about how could the FBR determine the amount repatriated illegally to the UAE, the official said the figures had been matched from the GDs and the quantity of IMEI number registration applications, which was also awarded by the FBR.
The GD is a custom online declaration form containing complete details of the quantity, unit price, payment terms of “goods” imported or exported from Pakistan.
“The matching of data shows that payment for mobile sets worth $7.19mn has not been made. Ther­efore, some illegal mode was adopted for these sets,” the official added.
Similarly, sources in the Pakistan Telecom Authority (PTA) confirmed to Dawn that manufacturers imported more than 190,000 mobile phones in CBU condition under a facility allowed to them.
In wake of the restrictions set by the banking sector on imports, mobile phones were still being imported by some companies under their manufacturing licence, the source said.
All imported phones have to get their IMEI numbers registered in Pakistan through the PTA which has received the Certification of Compliance (COC) from the commercial mobile phone dealers for the registration of IMEI numbers in bulk quantity. The import of mobile phones unusually surged in recent weeks with all the 30 manufacturing units in the country have been closed, as the government has banned the import of luxury items.
Responding to a question, a senior official from the IT ministry said the companies are allowed to import some mobile phones but the misuse of the facility would damage the investment climate in the country.

1,Demand for riyal surges amid rush for Umrah,"“There is no shortage of foreign currencies in the open market while Saudi riyal is easily available,"" says Malik Bostan.","KARACHI: Contrary to a general perception of a severe shortage of foreign exchange, Pakistanis in unprecedented numbers are leaving for Saudi Arabia to perform Umrah despite a massive surge in its cost. 
Since Pakistan has been facing a serious shortage of foreign exchange, it was expected that Pakistanis may not go in large numbers this year even when the Umrah cost has also increased by 60 to 80 per cent compared to the last year mainly due to the massive devaluation of local currency. 
In FY23, the rupee lost about 54 per cent against the US dollar.
However, foreign exchange companies are easily meeting the high demand for Saudi rials and other currencies, barring US dollars, as everyone wants to perform the religious ritual during the holy month. 
Each year about one million Pakistanis perform Umrah and about 100,000 used to perform Umrah in Ramazan alone.
“There is no shortage of foreign currencies in the open market while Saudi riyal is easily available as much as a customer needs,” said Malik Bostan, Chairman Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan.
He said no tickets are available for Saudi Arabia for Ramazan as all flights are booked. “I did not think that fewer people are travelling for Umrah this year compared to previous years,” he said, adding that he could hardly get a ticket.
In another development, he said the inflow of foreign currencies has increased substantially as overseas Pakistanis in large numbers are visiting their motherland to spend Ramazan and celebrate the Eidul Fitr with their families.  
He said the exchange companies were using these currencies to buy US dollars from Dubai. “We estimate that on an average $8 to $10 million foreign currencies are being sold in Dubai to bring back US dollars,” said Bostan. 
Earlier, the exchange companies were used to sell their foreign currencies in Dubai to bring back equal amounts of dollars but an artificial rate cap imposed by the PMLN-led coalition government created a wide gap between interbank and open markets, which resulted in the emergence of the black or grey market. Other foreign currencies follow the same dollar path for their value in PKR.
The illegal market was offering much higher prices of foreign currencies which caused a 12pc decline in remittances during FY23. 
However, the uncapping of the exchange rate brought the dollar rate to a level offered by the illegal market. This massive rupee devaluation encouraged overseas Pakistanis to sell their holdings in the local market and remit their earnings through legal channels. 
The inflows in the banking market also increased as the exporters started selling their proceeds with the record high price of dollars which hit a new peak of Rs287. In recent weeks, the dollar kept hovering around Rs280-285 which was enough to attract export proceeds.
Some currency experts fear another round of rupee devaluation, particularly after Finance Minister Ishaq Dar cancelled his visit to Washington to attend spring meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund starting from April 10. 
Mr Dar once again changed his tone and said Pakistan is a member of the IMF and not a beggar.

2,Russian rouble suffers worst week this year,Traders said the Russian currency has come under pressure recently from a cocktail of problems.,"MOSCOW: The Russian rouble suffered its worst week against the dollar this year, tumbling on a lack of foreign currency in Moscow and on the sale of Western businesses in Russia, despite gaining slightly on Friday afternoon as traders locked in profits.
The rouble skidded more than 2 per cent against the U.S. dollar on Friday to an intraday low of 83.50, its weakest since April last year, and fell more than 2pc against the euro to an intraday low of 91.32 against.
Later in the day it recovered and was up 0.2pc against the dollar at 81.21 on trade of about $1.5 billion – the highest volumes in at least two weeks – as trading desks locked in their profits ahead of the weekend.
Overall the rouble was down more than 5pc against the dollar on the week.
Earlier, the rouble had nosedived to 113 per dollar after President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, but the central bank and finance ministry helped stabilise the currency, and it strengthened to 50 per dollar in July.
The West then imposed a price cap on Russian oil — the lifeblood of the Russian economy — late last year, after which the rouble has again weakened from about 60 per dollar to more than 80 this week.
Traders said the Russian currency has come under pressure recently from a cocktail of problems including the sale of Western assets to domestic investors, which stoked demand for dollars, while lower oil prices in March cut the country’s export revenue.
The reported transfer of $1.21bn to Shell for its stake in the Far East Sakhalin-2 gas project was cited by traders as a major factor on Friday, as the daily trade in the rouble-dollar pair is now usually only about $1bn, down from more than $3bn a day before the war.

3,Why graduates face higher unemployment in Pakistan,The “misalignment” between the demand and supply of graduates has contributed to the higher unemployment rate.," 


KARACHI: It may sound counter-intuitive, but research shows the likelihood of unemployment in Pakistan grows in proportion to the level of education.
A poorly developed labour market that’s unable to accommodate a rapidly growing number of educated workers has led to a high graduate unemployment rate.
A recent research paper written by Henna Ahsan and Muhammad Jehangir Khan of the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE), which uses employment data from 2001-02 to 2020-21, shows that the gap between the rate of overall unemployment (6.3 per cent) and that of graduates (16.1pc) is almost 10-percentage-point wide.
There’re both supply- and demand-side reasons for such a substantial difference between the two rates of unemployment, according to the PIDE economists.
After staying relatively flat for decades, the number of universities grew manifold in a short span as the University Grant Commission was replaced with the Higher Education Commission in 2002. As a result, enrolment in universities grew at twice the rate of enrolment growth at other levels of education.
The “misalignment” between the demand and supply of graduates has contributed to the higher unemployment rate among recent graduates. A large number of individuals end up completing their tertiary education in subjects for which little demand exists, the paper noted.
Over 31pc of the educated youth is unemployed while women constitute 51pc of the total unemployed population in Pakistan. Data shows that enrolment in natural sciences in Pakistan is outpacing demand in the labour market.
“The gap between supply and demand is wider for graduates in natural sciences compared to social sciences and management sciences. Therefore, to address graduate unemployment, there is a need to look at the unemployment issue by fi­eld of study,” it noted.
The Labour Force Survey (LFS) does not provide data for segregated graduate disciplines and limits information to major categories like engineering, medicine, computer and agriculture. The analysis conducted by the PIDE economists shows the unemployment rate for graduates increased from 14.9pc in 2018-19 to 16.1pc in 2020-21.
Decomposing the unemployment rate into sub-disciplines produced an even gloomier picture: the unemployment rate for engineers doubled in just two years, from 11pc to 23.5pc.
Similarly, the unemployment rate for computer science graduates rose from 14.2pc to 22.6pc in the two-year period. The steep rise was from 11.4pc to 29.4pc for the graduates of agricultural sciences.
Graduates in medical sciences faced the lowest unemployment rate when compared to their peers in other disciplines. However, the unemployment rate within the medical discipline increased from 6.4pc to 10.8pc in just two years.
The unemployment rate among female graduates was about 3.8 times higher than that of their male counterparts. More than one-third of women graduates were unemployed in 2020-21.
The unemployment rate was close to 30pc for the graduates aged between 21 and 29, the highest among all age groups.
The average unemployment rate in urban areas (7.35pc) is higher than that in rural areas (5.85pc), according to the LFS 2020-21. Conversely, the graduate unemployment rate in the rural areas (22pc) is nearly twice that in the urban areas (12pc), the research paper showed.
The graduate unemployment rate is high in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab, which shows an excess supply of graduates amid the inability of these labour markets to absorb new graduates.
Engineering graduates face higher unemployment in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. Agriculture graduates face a high unemployment rate in Sindh and Punjab even though these provinces are rich in agriculture.
Low-skilled graduates, poor quality of education contributes to the unemployment rate in Pakistan, the research paper said.
“For better analysis and policy, we need to add more disciplines/fi­elds of study, especially social and natural sciences, in the LFS. This will help policymakers accurately analyse the supply and demand gap of these graduates in the labour market,” it added.

4,Stocks edge higher in tumultuous week,Analyst says the noise on the political front fed the negative momentum.,"KARACHI: The stock market commenced the outgoing week on a negative note as participants expected an interest rate hike by the central bank.
Arif Habib Ltd said the noise on the political front fed the negative momentum. However, shares witnessed a rally after the Monetary Policy Committee of the central bank announced a lower-than-expected jump in the interest rate.
Meanwhile, commitment of funds worth $2 billion from Saudi Arabia gave a boost to the bullish sentiment as bridging the external financing gap remains one of the conditions for completing the ninth review of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme.
The trade deficit plummeted by 60 per cent year-on-year to $1.46bn in March, lowest since February 2015. However, the momentum proved short-lived after Finance Minister Ishaq Dar cancelled his trip to the United States to meet the World Bank and IMF teams.
The rupee depreciated against the dollar by 0.22pc on a weekly basis to close at 284.42.
As a result, the stock market closed at 40,050 points, up 49 points or 0.12pc from a week ago.
Sector-wise, positive contributions came from oil and gas exploration (149 points), technology and communication (90 points), power generation and distribution (45 points), fertiliser (41 points) and cement (32 points).
Sectors that contributed negatively were auto assembling (22 points), tobacco (17 points) and commercial banking (14 points).
Scrip-wise, positive contributors were Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (71 points), Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd (69 points), Systems Ltd (51 points), the Hub Power Company Ltd (43 points) and TRG Pakistan Ltd (40 points).
Negative contributions came from Bank AL Habib (36 points), Millat Tractors Ltd (19 points), Pakistan Tobacco Company Ltd (17 points), Javedan Corporation Ltd (eight points) and Ghani Glass Ltd (eight points).
Foreign buying continued in the outgoing week and clocked in at $4.7 million versus a net sale of $0.15m a week ago. Major buying was witnessed in exploration and production ($3m) and banks ($0.8m). On the local front, selling was reported by insurance ($4.8m) and companies ($2.8m).
According to AKD Securities Ltd, the stock market is expected to remain jittery until some clarity emerges on the IMF front. Investors’ confidence may also be restored if the level of political tension comes down, it added.
“Until then, we advise investors to take a cautious approach… we continue to advocate the stocks with dollar-denominated revenue streams — technology and exploration and production sectors — to hedge against the currency risks.”

5,‘Bank takeover prevented Swiss economy collapse’,GENEVA: Swiss Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter said Switzerland’s economy would probably have collapsed had...,"GENEVA: Swiss Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter said Switzerland’s economy would probably have collapsed had Credit Suisse gone bankrupt.
In an interview, Keller-Sutter told Le Temps newspaper that the government had acted in the country’s best interests in swiftly arranging the takeover of Switzerland’s second-biggest bank by its larger domestic rival UBS.
Amid fears of a global banking crisis last month, investor confidence in Credit Suisse collapsed on March 15, with the government then orchestrating a takeover during the weekend before the markets reopened on March 20.
Some 109 billion Swiss francs ($120 billion) have been put on the table between government guarantees and the liquidity made available by the Swiss central bank.
“Given the circumstances, we acted as best we could to minimise the burden for the state and the taxpayers,” Keller-Sutter said.
“Without determined intervention by the authorities, the alternative would have been a bankruptcy of Credit Suisse on Monday morning, accompanied by a probable collapse of the Swiss economy.” Like UBS, Credit Suisse was among the 30 banks worldwide deemed of global importance to the international banking system and therefore too big to fail.
But it suffered a string of scandals in recent years, and after three US regional banks collapsed in March, it was left looking like the weakest link in the chain.

6,‘WB could lend $50bn more over decade with reform’,"“We seek additional reforms during the rest of this year,” Yellen said.","WASHINGTON: The World Bank’s ongoing reform could result in a $50 billion lending boost over the next decade, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told AFP ahead of stakeholders’ meetings next week where key changes are expected to be announced.
Central bankers, finance ministers and participants from more than 180 member countries are expected to gather in the US capital for the International Monetary Fund and World Bank’s spring meetings in the coming week.
A key topic of discussion will be the World Bank’s evolution, amid a push for lenders to revamp and meet global challenges like climate change. The United States is the largest shareholder of the World Bank Group.
“I expect there to be an update of the bank’s mission to add building resilience against climate change, pandemics, and conflict and fragility to the core goals,” Yellen said in the interview with AFP Thursday.
She added that there needs to be a recognition that these challenges aren’t separate or conflicting but rather, inextricably linked.
“Second, there will be an announcement that the bank is stretching its financial capacity to meet these objectives, and adopting changes or endorsing changes that could result in an additional $50 billion in extra lending capacity over the next decade,” Yellen said.
The move would be a significant resource boost marking a 20 per cent rise in the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development’s (IBRD) sustainable lending level. The IBRD is the World Bank’s middle-income lending arm.
Seeking added reforms 
Yellen also said there would be an announcement on updating the bank’s operational model to  “orient it towards the goals that we’re setting.” Among other things, this includes creating more incentives for the mobilization of both domestic and private capital.
“We seek additional reforms during the rest of this year,” Yellen said.
In March, the World Bank submitted an evolution plan to be discussed with its development committee on April 12, during the spring meetings.
Noting that World Bank President David Malpass has laid a  “solid foundation” for the ongoing work, Yellen added that she expects US candidate Ajay Banga to be elected to the helm of the organization and continue the revamp.
Banga was the sole nominee for the position after Malpass announced this year that he would step down early.
‘Hopeful sign’ 
Also on policymakers’ agendas next week are support for war-torn Ukraine and debt restructuring.
“We have seen some movement by China on participating in debt restructuring for Sri Lanka, which is a hopeful sign,” Yellen said.
As global growth slows, the World Bank previously warned that the outlook is especially tough for the poorest economies — which face sluggish growth driven by heavy debt burdens and weak investment.
Yellen had earlier said that China should move more quickly on some debt restructurings.
Discussions on this front will continue next week as a newly formed global sovereign debt roundtable gathers, she told AFP.
“We’re having useful technical discussions on important elements of debt restructuring. China has been participating, and we all continue to press China for improvements,” she said.
Washington will continue pushing for a speedier and more predictable operation of the G20  “common framework” for debt restructuring as well.
On Ukraine, Yellen said:  “Once again, we will work with all of our allies to insist that Russia cease its brutality in Ukraine.” She added that the United States would press for economic support alongside its partners on this front.
