0,CJP to take up plea to withdraw reference against Justice Isa,Pleas include the applications moved by govt to withdraw curative review petition; hearing to take place in CJP's chambers tomorrow.,"ISLAMABAD: Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial will take up on April 10 the federal government’s request to withdraw the infamous “curative review petition,” which was moved against Justice Qazi Faez Isa, a sitting Supreme Court judge, by the PTI government.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had recently ordered the authorities concerned not to pursue the curative review petition. He had asked them to withdraw the petition from the Supreme Court.
The CJP will take up in his chambers a set of 12 applications concerning the curative review. The pleas include the applications moved by the government for the withdrawal of the curative review petition.
On June 23, 2022, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar had also made a statement suggesting taking back the curative review petition, which his predecessor Dr Farogh Naseem had moved before the Supreme Court against Justice Isa.
The former PTI government had pleaded before the Supreme Court that its April 26, 2021 majority judgement in the Justice Qazi Faez Isa review case should not be left in the field for being “manifestly and patently unjust, against the public interest and public good which defeats the judicial accountability”.
On April 26, 2021, the apex court by a majority of six to four had overturned its majority ruling of June 19, 2022. The court had ordered investigation by tax authorities into three foreign properties in the name of the wife and children of Justice Isa.
The curative appeal was moved on behalf of President Dr Arif Alvi, the previous federal government through secretary law, former prime minister Imran Khan, former law minister Dr Farogh Naseem, former adviser on accountability Shahzad Akbar, etc.
The curative review had argued that the April 26 majority judgement had sufficiently closed the doors of judicial accountability in general as well as the accountability of Justice Isa in respect of allegations and information which had come on record. The majority judgement had also diluted the standards of judicial accountability, rather a shield was provided to the judges of superior courts to hide behind the doctrine of judicial independence only to evade judicial accountability, argued the appeal.
The majority judgement also failed to emphasise that the duty of the officials, judges, qazis and public servants to explain their finances and assets, owes its genesis to our religion and glorious heritage, apart from being fully backed by modern jurisprudence and that the assets and finances of close relatives of public servants, officials, judges, qazis, etc such as their spouses and dependent children are also required to be explained, the appeal stressed.
Moreover, the majority judgement had allegedly usurped the jurisdiction of the Supreme Judicial Council in violation of Articles 209 and 211 and hence patently unconstitutional and thus liable to be revisited since under the Constitution it is only the SJC which could have cleared Justice Isa.

1,"Two soldiers martyred, four hurt in Khyber IED attack",Outlawed TTP claims responsibility for the attack.,"KHYBER: Two soldiers lost their lives and four others were injured when their vehicle was targeted by an improvised explosive device (IED) in Bara tehsil of Khyber tribal district on Saturday, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.
Local sources said the security forces’ vehicle was passing through Miangano Kalay Khearr (dry stream) in the Malakdin Khel locality in the afternoon when it was hit by the IED, which was planted in the dry stream.
The ISPR statement said Naib Subedar Hazrat Gul, 37, a resident of Lower Dir, and Sepoy Nazir Ullah Mehsud, 34, a resident of South Waziristan, embraced martyrdom.
“Sanitisation of the area is being carried out to eliminate any terrorists in the area,” it said, adding that security forces were determined to “eliminate the menace of terrorism and such sacrifices of our soldiers further strengthen our resolve”.
Local sources said that nearby civilians rushed to the scene of the blast immediately after the incident and shifted the bodies and the injured to a treatment centre.
The injured soldiers were identified as sepoys Wajid, Haris and Niaz, and civilian Adnan.
A spokesperson for the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Muhammad Khurasani, claimed responsibility for the IED attack but exaggerated the number of deaths.
The attack comes a day after the top civil and military leadership reaffirmed their commitment to thwart terror threats and vowed to relaunch the National Action Plan (NAP) within a fortnight to crush militants reportedly coming in from Afghanistan.
Without directly blaming the previous PTI government for the resurgence of terrorism in tribal districts along the border with Afghanistan, they agreed to initiate new multi-pronged and comprehensive operations, as well as combined efforts on the diplomatic, security, economic and social fronts to eliminate militants.
A newly formed committee would present its recommendations within two weeks to implement the policy and draw its parameters.
Security forces have already stepped up operations. On Wednesday, a key militant commander and his seven associates were killed during an intelligence-based operation carried out by security forces in the Shinwarsak area of South Waziristan tribal district.

2,Schoolgirl poisonings continue across Iran,"At least “60 students were poisoned in a girls’ school in the town of Haftkel”, state television cited a local official as saying.","TEHRAN: Dozens of schoolgirls were poisoned on Saturday in several schools across Iran, local media reported, in continuation of the mysterious phenomenon that has shaken the country for months.
Since late November many schools, mostly for girls, have been affected by sudden poisoning incidents from gases or toxic substances, in some cases causing fainting and hospitalisation among the students.
At least “60 students were poisoned in a girls’ school in the town of Haftkel” in the oil-rich southwestern province of Khuzestan, state television’s IRIB news agency cited a local official as saying.
A number of schoolgirls were poisoned in “five schools in Ardabil in the northwest”, where the victims showed symptoms of “anxiety, shortness of breath and headaches”, a provincial medical official told the news agency.
In the northwestern town of Urmia, capital of West Azerbaijan province, “a number of schoolgirls were taken to hospital on Saturday after feeling sick”, ILNA news agency reported without further elaboration.
According to an official count provided on March 7, “more than 5,000 students” have been affected by similar poisonings in more than 230 establishments, located in 25 of the country’s 31 provinces.
On Friday, MP Hamidreza Kazemi, the head of the national fact-finding committee formed to investigate these cases, specified that “the final report” would be published “in two weeks”.
Separately, in an attempt to further rein in increasing numbers of women defying the compulsory dress code, Iranian authorities are installing cameras in public places and thoroughfares to identify and penalise unveiled women, the police announced on Saturday.
After they have been identified, violators will receive warning text messages as to the consequences, police said in a statement. The move is aimed at preventing resistance against the hijab law, said the statement, adding that such resistance tarnishes the country’s spiritual image and spreads insecurity.

3,Muslims have exclusive rights to pray inside Al Aqsa mosque: OIC,Adopts resolution warning of consequences if Israeli occupation forces continue infringement.,"UNITED NATIONS: The Organ­isation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) adopted a joint resolution on Saturday, emphasiSing that Muslims have an exclusive right to pray inside the Al Aqsa mosque.
In Doha, Qatar announced that it has started mediation to reduce tensions in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories.
On Thursday, the UN Security Council convened an emergency session to consider Israeli violence against Palestinian worshippers in Al Aqsa this week. The closed-door meeting was called by the UAE, the Arab League’s representative in the council, and China, one of its five permanent members.
 
 

The session followed two days of continued Israeli violence against worshippers inside the mosque and a rocket attack inside Israel on the Jewish Passover holiday.

Resolution warns of consequences if Israeli occupation forces continue infringement

The OIC resolution, passed at an extraordinary meeting of its executive council in Jeddah and made available at the UN headquarters in New York, reaffirmed the centrality of the Palestinian Cause, with Al-Quds Ash-Sharif and its sanctities at its heart, for the entire Islamic Ummah.
It underlined the eternal attachment of Muslims all over the world to the Al Aqsa mosque. The resolution also affirmed the Arab and Islamic identity of occupied East Al-Quds, the capital of the State of Palestine.
The resolution condemned the dangerous escalation by the Israeli occupation forces and terrorist settlers by repeatedly storming the blessed Al Aqsa Mosque during Ramazan. It noted that the escalation culminated in “the atrocious brutal attack on the night of 14th Ramazan on worshipers and those stationed in its courtyards while performing their prayers and rituals, including women and children.
The resolution warned of the consequences of the continued infringement by “the Israeli occupation authorities, their officials, and terrorist settlers” on the sanctity of the Al Aqsa mosque.
It held Israel accountable for the consequences of these dangerous and provocative actions, “as it continues to seek, through systematic brutal attacks, deliberate provocation, and repeated incitement, to inflame the situation and provoke a religious confrontation”.

4,"Saudi Arabia, Iran discuss reopening diplomatic missions","Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi has been invited by Saudi King Salman to Riyadh, a trip planned to take place after Ramazan.","RIYADH: A Saudi Arabian diplomatic delegation arrived on Saturday in Tehran to discuss the reopening of its diplomatic missions after a seven-year absence, Riyadh’s foreign ministry said.
The visit follows an unprecedented meeting between the foreign ministers of both countries in China this week after they agreed last month to restore diplomatic ties.
Saturday’s visit is part of “implementing the tripartite agreement” reached on March 10 between the two regional powers, brokered by China, to restore relations ruptured in 2016, the Saudi foreign ministry said, cited by the official Saudi Press Agency.
The two longtime Middle East rivals have now pledged to work together.

Omani mediators in Yemen to try to broker new truce

Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan and his Iranian counterpart Hossein Amir-Abdol­lahian met in Beijing on Thursday and vowed to bring “security and stability” to the turbulent Gulf region.
On Saturday, a Saudi “technical delegation” met Iran’s chief of protocol at the foreign ministry in Tehran, SPA said.
The two countries severed ties after protesters in the Islamic republic attacked Saudi diplomatic missions following Riyadh’s execution of a prominent cleric.
Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi has been invited by Saudi King Salman to Riyadh, a trip planned to take place after Ramazan.
Yemen truce
Omani mediators arrived in Yemen on Saturday to discuss a new truce between the Iran-backed Houthi rebels and Saudi Arabia, an airport source said, amid renewed moves to end the conflict.
Diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict have multiplied since the Yemeni government’s main foreign backer Saudi Arabia signed a Chinese-brokered deal to restore relations with Iran last month.
The top Saudi and Iranian diplomats met in Beijing, resuming diplomatic relations and pledging to work together to bring “security and stability” to their turbulent region.
Nearly a decade of war in Yemen has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives, both directly and indirectly, and triggered what the United Nations has called the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.
The Houthis seized the capital Sanaa in 2014, triggering the conflict with the government which has been backed for eight years by a military coalition led by regional heavyweight Riyadh.
The rapprochement between the two great regional rivals, Iran and Saudi Arabia, has fuelled hopes of reduced tensions in the Middle East, particularly in Yemen.
“A delegation from Oman has arrived in Sanaa to hold talks with Houthi leaders about the truce and the peace process,” a source at the capital’s airport, said.
The source said the delegation was accompanied by Mohammed Abdelsalam, the rebels’ chief negotiator, who lives in Muscat.
Oman has forged a reputation as a discreet mediator in Gulf disputes often involving Iran.
Abdelsalam himself tweeted that he had arrived in Sanaa with the Omani delegation, but without providing further details.
The United Nations special envoy on Yemen, Hans Grundberg, was in the Omani capital this week for talks on “the political process”.
A Yemeni government source said that the Saudis and Houthis have agreed in principle on a six-month truce to pave the way for three months of talks on establishing a two-year “transition” for the war-torn country.
The country enjoyed a six-month lull in fighting during a ceasefire last year, but that truce was not renewed after it expired on Oct 2.
Iran views the United States as an arch-enemy, but on Wednesday welcomed a call by the American special envoy for Yemen to back “the political process that we hope is coming”.
