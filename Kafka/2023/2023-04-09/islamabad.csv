1,Pims 19-strong waste management cell to monitor incineration,"Spokesperson says hospital produces over 5,000kg of non-medical, medical waste.","ISLAMABAD: After a scandal regarding the sale of infectious waste rocked the hospital, the management of the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) has appointed 19 officials to ensure that the hospital waste is incinerated on the premises instead of being sold in the open market.
The officials were given new assignments weeks after a waste management cell was established to prevent the sale of hazardous waste. Pims Spokesperson Dr Haider Abbasi, while talking to Dawn, said that the waste management cell has become fully functional.
“Waste is segregated carefully and a record is being maintained to ensure incineration within the hospital; only non-medical waste would go out of the facility,” he said.
“Segregation of the waste is not an easy job,” he said, claiming that at least 5,000 kilogramme of non-medical and 350-500kg infectious waste is collected in the hospital on a daily basis. He added that non-medical waste is dumped out of the hospital while infectious waste is burned.

Spokesperson says hospital produces over 5,000kg of non-medical, medical waste

“Buckets of three colours i.e. red, blue, and yellow have been placed in each department to put biohazardous waste and pharmaceutical waste, such as antibiotics, respectively,” he said. “Executive Director (ED) Dr Naeem Malik is personally monitoring the process to avoid any negligence,” he said.
According to a document, available with Dawn, four officials have been nominated for the operation and maintenance of the incinerator; 15 officials will ensure waste collection from wards and shift to the designated point.
Moreover, an assistant director of security has been directed to ensure the maintenance of the security register by all shift in-charges regarding the functioning of the incinerator till midnight.
It is worth mentioning that hospital waste can become the reason for infections as they contain blood, human parts and sharp surgical instruments among other dangerous materials. Across the globe, incinerators are used to burn such waste.
Since the sale of infectious waste was reported in the media, Pims has been trying to restore its image, as the management faced embarrassment not only at the national level but also at the international level through UN agencies.
It is worth mentioning that on February 27, a vendor hired by the Pims administration to incinerate medical waste on the hospital premises was found involved in the sale of infectious material, such as discarded syringes and blood bags, in cahoots with hospital employees.
Subsequently, a three-member fact-finding committee, headed by Prof of General Surgery Dr S.H. Waqar, was established, with a direction to submit a report within 48 hours.
On March 1, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also took notice of the sale of the infectious waste and directed an independent inquiry – to be submitted within two days – instead of an internal inquiry.
Later, the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on National Health Services also took notice of the sale of infectious waste by the Pims employees and the vendor instead of disposing of it in the incinerator.

As per the details of the case, CNPC came to Pakistan in early 2001 as a service provider to exploration and production companies in the fields of rigs and drilling. 
Pakistan during the first decade of 21st century was deemed a great potential for exploration and production companies and saw a great influx of foreign companies.
But great influx associates greater competition therefore CNPC found it difficult to establish and generate business with such foreign competitive companies. 
Considering the need of time and to get the necessary head-start, CNPC entered into an agreement with the local company to help procure 
drilling works for CNPC against a commission for each work procured in favour of CNPC.
From the inception to date, CNPC with the help of the local company, procured drilling contracts and was able to maintain its operation in Pakistan, now comprising over two decades.
The local company petitioned before the court against the alleged violation contractual obligations by CNPC.
The court passed a preliminary decree of $2.48 million in favour of the local company.

4,Beggars swarm roads of Rawalpindi,"Social welfare dept told to launch drive against professional beggars, says official.","RAWALPINDI: The influx of beggars, especially in markets and traffic signals, not only reflects poorly on the working of the administration in the garrison city but also creates problems for citizens.
Scores of beggars have converged at the Committee Chowk underpass creating nuisance for commuters, who find it difficult to navigate through the intersection on one of the busiest roads in Rawalpindi.
The federal capital is also facing a similar situation as toddlers can also be seen begging and sleeping at traffic signals on main roads even past midnight.
“You cannot even walk freely in the markets because beggars would chase you until you snub them,” said a working woman at Rawalpindi’s Saddar.

Social welfare dept told to launch drive against professional beggars, says official

Sajid Kiani, a resident of Satellite Town, said people, willingly or unwillingly, end up giving alms to the beggars.
Bilal Shah, a resident of Iqbal Road, said without a doubt impoverished people have a right to seek charity but we need to follow in the footsteps of famous social worker Abdul Sattar Edhi who once advised people against giving money to undeserving persons.
Professional beggars will continue daunting us unless we stop encouraging them, Mohammad Anwar, a resident of Chaklala Scheme-III, said, adding that people need to not fall prey to emotional blackmailing. He said that those who were genuinely poor and needy would never hurt their self-respect by begging.
The government should do something tangible and effective for reducing poverty and unemployment.
“Mere clamping down a ban on beggary will not work. First know and later deal with why people beg. Creation of jobs for the unemployed lot, inception of centres to rehabilitate the disabled and maimed beggars, and crack down on habitual ones will help contain the proliferation of this social nuisance,” Shamir Hussain said.
On the other hand, the district administration has failed to launch any kind of drive against beggary.
City Traffic Police formed an anti-beggary squad last year but stopped the task after the district police and the social welfare department were given the task to round up professional beggars.
City Traffic Police Officer Taimoor Khan said that traffic police did not launch any drive in this regard as the task was given to the district police, Child Protection Bureau and the social welfare department.
He said that the traffic police were working for smooth flow of traffic on all the roads of the garrison city.
When contacted, a district administration spokesman said they were planning action against professional beggars as citizens had been lodging complaints about the issue.
He said Commissioner Liaquat Ali Chattha had asked the social welfare department and the Child Protection Bureau to start a drive to arrest the beggars and arrange their rehabilitation.

15,Panelists urge institutions to stick to their roles,Lawyer says judiciary has become an ‘elite club’ with no representation of lower court judges,"ISLAMABAD: A panel of experts at a webinar urged the state institutions to stick to their jurisdiction as their “politically-motivated conflicts” could lead to socioeconomic deterioration and also damage the democratic process.
The webinar ‘Judicial Imperialism in Pakistan and its Impact on Society’ was organised by Devcom-Pakistan on Saturday. The panel comprised Farhatullah Babar, journalist Mazhar Abbas, Human Rights Law expert Huma Chughtai and Devcom-Pakistan Executive Director Munir Ahmed.
According to a statement, Farhatullah Babar said the chaos began in 2009 with a view of the then-chief justice that “parliament is not supreme but the Constitution — the way it is interpreted by the Supreme Council of Pakistan”.
He said 19th Amendment axed the powers of parliament regarding judicial oversight, including the appointment of judges that caused a concentration of like-minded or favourite judges in the courts.

Lawyer says judiciary has become an ‘elite club’ with no representation of lower court judges

“[Former] Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhary elevated 126 judges while ousting over 100 judges only by his own will; it was the beginning of judicial imperialism in Pakistan. Most suo motu actions were taken during his tenure under Article 184(3). The same practice continued by Justice Saqib Nisar, Justice Asif Khosa, and incumbent Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial,” he claimed.
Farhatullah Babar said, “The rational jurisprudence makes the judiciary more pertinent for interpretation of the laws but since 2009, it has evolved into an omnipotent judiciary. The 19th Amendment granted a veto to the chief justice for suo motu action... the judiciary sent three prime ministers home using the authoritative suo motu.” He suggested a larger consultative process among the political forces to end the present crisis and added that the Supreme Court judges also needed to talk to each other to end rifts.
According to Mazhar Abbas, the lawyers’ activism also played its role in building the judicial chaos. The activism by the legal community did not stop after Nawaz Sharif’s long march for the restoration of then-chief justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhary, he said, adding that after 2008, even elected legislature could not restrict the powers of the chief justice.
“Judges’ political support has created an unprecedented polarisation in the political arena and the judiciary itself. Dialogue is the only solution for political parties while strict adherence to the code of conduct for the judges [to end prevailing crisis],” he said.
He urged to scrap the titles of the PCO Judges who took their oath of offices under the Provisional Constitutional Order and stop their pensions and other benefits.
‘Elite club’
Huma Chughtai said the state institutions need to define their turf and avoid overstepping into other’s jurisdiction. Law-making in Pakistan had never been strong enough to restrict judicial activism instead it was apologetic, she added.
“Pakistan’s judiciary has become an ‘elite club’ where the subordinate or district judiciary has no representation. Judges in the high court and Supreme Court are appointed on the basis of favouritism. It has created groups within the courts while activism has taken to extremes. Judges need to pull them out of the chaos, divide, and polarization,” she said.
Munir Ahmed said Pakistan was a victim of a one-man power show that has led the country to judicial imperialism. “It is unprecedented even in South Asia. Supreme courts of our neighbouring countries take suo motu through a consultative process. It is not exercised anywhere in the world for political manoeuvring except in Pakistan. Parliament is supreme and it shall come up with unanimous legislation to curb the judicial dictatorship,” he said.

Muzaffarabad police registered the case under charges of rioting, armed with deadly weapon, unlawful assembly, mischief causing damage, criminal intimidation, assault to deter public servant from discharge of duty and obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions on the complaint of Customs Inspector Arshad Nadeem.
According to the FIR available with Dawn, Nadeem told the police the department received information that smuggled oil was being transported at an oil depot owned by Hanif Mand located in Mauza Sher Shah.  
He stated that soon three customs teams reached the spot. Hanif Mand, his brother, son, nephew including Aslam Mand, Puppu Shaikh, Asad Mand, Allah Ditta and Pappi Khakhaar along with 30 other unidentified persons were present there.
He said an oil tanker filled with 40,000 litres oil was parked in the depot and when the customs staff asked the people present at the site to provide documents of the oil tanker, they instead of showing the documents called other people and not only stopped the customs staff from performing their official duty but also tortured them.
He said constable Abid was attacked with wooden clubs and bricks while the remaining staff was also tortured.
He said the suspects smashed three official vehicles and took the tanker outside the depot forcibly.  
Sources in customs told Dawn that when the teams conducted a raid more than two dozen tankers were unloading the smuggled oil in nearby depots but the officials let them leave the vicinity and within half an hour they were outside the depots.
They said more than 200,000 litres smuggled oil was stored in three vehicles parked within the depot of Hanif Mand and its underground storage but the customs officials mentioned only 40,000 litres in the case which was stored in one of the tankers.
They said the smuggled Iranian oil is being stored in the vicinity of Sher Shah despite a team of customs being deployed at Chenab Toll Plaza.
They said storages have been constructed in the Sher Shah area for smuggled oil while the owners of these depots are paying ‘monthly’ to staff of the relevant departments including customs, police, customs intelligence and civil defence.   They said the storages have been constructed in thickly-populated areas, putting the entire population at risk.
