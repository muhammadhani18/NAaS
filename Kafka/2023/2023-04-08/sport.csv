Chaibi, 20, came off the bench and claimed the 85th minute winner to set up a meeting with Nantes.
The hosts were on the back foot early on against Toulouse, promoted this season.
The visitors made the most of their dominance 10 minutes before the break.
Dutch midfielder Branco van den Boomen broke down the right and Morocco’s Zakaria Aboukhlal headed home low down near the front post for his fourth goal in as many cup game this season.
Annecy’s response came in the fourth minute of first half added time.
Striker Alexy Bosetti was fouled in the box by Gabriel Suazo. The well-travelled 29-year-old converted into the bottom corner from the spot.
With 25 minutes left, Toulouse coach Philippe Montanier replaced Brazilian Rafael Ratao with Chaibi. 
With five minutes to go the substitute claimed his side’s place in the final.
He chipped Annecy goa­l­keeper Thomas Callens for a third goal in the competition this season.
The home side thought they had taken the game into extra time but substitute Moise Sahi’s half-volley from 30 metres was ruled out for offside with 90 seconds of the seven minutes of injury time played.
Toulouse held on despite Annecy’s late pressure to secure their first final appearance since winning the cup in 1957.

1,"Belarusians, Russians should be allowed to compete: FIG",LAUSANNE: Russian and Belarusian gymnasts who are not involved in Russia’s war against Ukraine should be allowed ...,"LAUSANNE: Russian and Belarusian gymnasts who are not involved in Russia’s war against Ukraine should be allowed to compete, the president of the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) Morinari Watanabe said on Thursday.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has recommended that Russians and Belarusians be allowed to return to international competition as neutrals since their ban last year in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Watanabe recently travelled to Ukraine to attend the funeral of rhythmic gymnastics coach Albina Deriugina and met the Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, Andriy Yermak, and Sports Minister Vadim Guttsait.
“I understand and support Ukraine’s position on the political side. But sport is independent of politics. Sport must seek peace even when governments and soldiers are at war,” Watanabe said in a statement published by FIG.
“[Ukraine] President [Volodymyr] Zelenskiy protects the Ukrainian people like family. I am protecting all gymnasts in the world like family.
“That’s why I support Ukrainian gymnasts and why I defend the right of Russian and Belarusian gymnasts who are not involved in the war to participate in competitions.
“I understand and respect President Zelenskiy’s position and I ask the Ukrainian government to understand my position as an International Federation president in the same way.”
In December, Zelenskiy opposed the idea of Russian athletes taking part in the 2024 Paris Olympics under a neutral banner as  “all their flags are stained in blood.”
Ukraine said on Friday its athletes will not be allowed to take part in qualifying events for next year’s Games if they have to compete against Russians, a decision the IOC criticised.
FIG will discuss the IOC’s recommendations for a gradual return to international competition for Russians and Belarusians at its next Executive Committee meeting on May 12-13, the statement added.
The IOC issued the recommendations last month after the initial ban on Russian and Belarusian athletes was introduced in March 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February last year, which Moscow calls a ‘special military operation’.

2,Six World Cup stadiums to be used for Asian Cup,"AFC president says tournament will be a ""true spectacle”; Iconic 974 Stadium is to be dismantled and donated to a developing country.","DOHA: Six of Qatar’s eight World Cup stadiums will be used for the Asian Cup to be staged in the Gulf state next January, the AFC has announced.
But the Lusail stadium used for the World Cup final and the iconic 974 Stadium made from containers will not be part of the 24-nation tournament to run from January 12 to February 10.
The Asian Cup was originally meant to be held this year in China but was switched and delayed because of the country’s coronavirus restrictions.
Asian Football Confederation president Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa said that based on Qatar’s hosting of the World Cup last year the Asian Cup will be “a true spectacle never before experienced in Asian football history”.
“We have every faith that they will showcase their unrivalled hosting capabilities, state-of-the-art infrastructure and warm hospitality,” he added in comments made when the Kuala Lumpur-based AFC released the dates late Wednesday.
 






 






Qatar will use the Al Janoub Stadium, Al Bayt Stadium, Ahmed Bin Ali Stadium, Al Thumama Stadium, Education City Stadium and Khalifa International Stadium which were all part of the multi-billion dollar infrastructure laid on for the World Cup.
The smaller Jassim bin Hamad Stadium and Abdullah bin Khalifa Stadium will also be used, the AFC said.
The 974 Stadium near the Doha seafront is scheduled to be dismantled and donated to a developing country. Some containers have already been taken away but authorities have not yet said where the stadium will go.
The 80,000 Lusail stadium where Argentina beat France in the World Cup final on December 18 is also due to be modified but Qatar has made no immediate comment on when that will start.

Jeruto, formerly a Kenyan who switched allegiance to Kazakhstan, won the 3,000 metres steeplechase gold at the 2022 world championships in Eugene where she also set a championship record, which was the third-fastest of all time.
The AIU said on Twitter that Jeruto had been suspended  “for the use of a Prohibited Substance/Method (ABP)”.
ABP refers to the Athlete Biological Passport, which shows discrepancies that can reveal the effects of doping.
The AIU said a notice of the charge has been issued to the 27-year-old distance runner, who also won the Diamond League gold in the same event in 2021.
Jeruto missed the Tokyo Olympics as she sat out her change of allegiance period.

5,Arsenal brace for Liverpool test as  relegation battle heats up,LONDON: Arsenal face a test of their Premier League title credentials against Liverpool this weekend as the scramble...,"LONDON: Arsenal face a test of their Premier League title credentials against Liverpool this weekend as the scramble to avoid relegation intensifies.
Manchester United and Newcastle will seek to consolidate their positions in the top four, while Frank Lampard takes charge for Chelsea’s visit to Wolves after returning to Stamford Bridge as caretaker manager.
Arsenal travel to Anfield on Sunday seeking an eighth consecutive Premier League win as they close in on a first English top-flight title for 19 years.
On paper, a match against faltering Liverpool does not look the toughest of tasks but Jurgen Klopp’s team are a tougher proposition at home than away, winning nine of their 13 league matches at Anfield this season.
Klopp saw positives in the goalless draw against Chelsea in midweek after three consecutive defeats in all competitions, praising his men for their attitude. 
“Now let’s carry on,” he said. “Anfield is waiting for us and we want to deliver. We have another 10 games to play and the next one is Arsenal.” The Gunners, who have not won at Anfield in the league since 2012, face a daunting set of fixtures in April, with matches against Manchester City and Chelsea to come later in the month.
But if they beat Liverpool, even defending champions City, eight points behind Arsenal with a game in hand, might begin to lose belief they can catch their title rivals.
RASHFORD RELIANCE
Marcus Rashford was once again the match-winner in Manchester United’s victory against Brentford on Wednesday, but Erik ten Hag is painfully aware that his side are over-reliant on the England forward.
United’s 1-0 win at Old Trafford, which lifted them back into the top four, was their first in the Premier League since mid-February.
Ten Hag finally ran out of patience with the blunt Wout Weghorst but despite their dominance, United were unable to add a second goal to Rashford’s first-half strike.
The Red Devils have not won a league match without Rashford being on the scoresheet since before the World Cup.
Ten Hag, whose side host Sean Dyche’s Everton on Saturday, admits it is “the truth” that United are too reliant on Rashford, who has 28 goals in all competitions this season.
But finding a solution is not easy. Weghorst has scored just twice since he joined on loan in January and Anthony Martial is finding his feet again after an injury-ravaged season.
The pressure at the bottom of the Premier League is growing by the week, with clubs taking drastic measures in the fight for survival.
Crystal Palace, Leeds, Everton and Southampton have all appointed new managers in recent weeks, while Brendan Rodgers left Leicester on Sunday.
Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis said Steve Cooper would remain in charge of the struggling club but warned results must “improve immediately”.
And David Moyes is clinging to his job as West Ham boss after a humiliating 5-1 home defeat by Newcastle in midweek, which left the club hovering above the relegation zone on goal difference alone.
Hammers captain Declan Rice is adamant he and his teammates cannot afford to sulk. 
“We are positive that we have enough to get out of this,” he said.  “We can only worry about ourselves. We have picked up results. It is down to us. And if we win our games, we will be all right.” 
Fixtures: 
Saturday: (1400 GMT unless stated) Manchester United v Everton (1130), Aston Villa v Nottingham Forest, Brentford v Newcastle, Fulham v West Ham, Leicester v Bournemouth, Tottenham v Brighton, Wolves v Chelsea, Southampton v Manchester City (1630); Sunday: Leeds v Crystal Palace (1300), Liverpool v Arsenal (1530).

FIFA barred the Southeast Asian nation from staging the May 20-June 11 event after the country’s football association (PSSI) in the predominantly Muslim country said it had cancelled the draw because the governor of Bali refused to host Israel’s team.
FIFA said that it “provisionally recommended a restriction on” the use of FIFA Forward development funds for the PSSI and would reconsider lifting the sanction after reviewing Indonesia’s plan to improve on Indonesian football.

7,Ramazan events continue to serve as Pakistan cricket’s production line,"Ramazan T20 tournaments in Karachi date back to the 60s, gaining a level of prestige that participating sides treat them as professional competitions.","KARACHI: Having recently arrived back in his hometown here after his debut series as a Pakistan player, Saim Ayub was all smiles as he shook hands with team-mates and staff in the Omar Associates dugout on the sidelines of the Naya Nazimabad Ramazan Cricket Tournament on a breezy Saturday night in the posh, gated housing society’s floodlit cricket ground.
While Saim, sporting a crisp white polo and a pair of light blue jeans, gathered congratulations from the metropolis’ close-knit cricket community, his team was being subjected to an onslaught by Attock Traders’ Yousuf Afridi out in the middle during the semi-final.
With a 128 to chase on a tricky surface, Omar Associates’ manager Azam Khan — a fatherly figure for the squad — wouldn’t have thought twice to send in Saim to face the new ball had the stylish southpaw been available to play.
 
 

Almost exactly a year earlier, he was. And was the one who lead the side to the tournament title. The rest, as they say, is history.
The last 12 months have seen Saim emerge as one of the hottest prospects in T20 cricket at the domestic level; finishing as the second-highest run-scorer in the National T20 Cup before being picked up by Peshawar Zalmi for the HBL Pakistan Super League, in which a more than impressive show earned him a called up in the Pakistan squad for the recent three-match T20 International series against Afghanistan.
But before Omar Associate’s openers Imad Alam and Mohammad Nafay went in to commence the chase, Saim had left the scenic venue.
The pitch was dry and Attock Traders spinners made hay of it. Despite being the strongest side taking part in the tournament, Omar Associates had no answers.
A mature partnership between Pakistan international Anwar Ali and Test veteran Asad Shafique did give the side some stability, only before it failed to make the final for the second time in a row.
Beating Omar Associates had got Attock Traders captain and another Test veteran in Khurram Manzoor ecstatic and the batter had a smile on his face until at least 15 minutes after the match was over.
What was it about a mere Ramazan tournament match that Khurram was so happy to win it? Why were Asad and Anwar being too cautious with their approach with the bat? These tournaments are meant to be entertaining, aren’t they?
But had these events been only about entertainment and festivity, they may have not produced a batter of Saim’s potential.
Ramazan T20 tournaments in Karachi date back to the 60s, when no one could even imagine T20 cricket being played at international level.
The city’s neighbourhood of Nazimabad, some claim, was where the format was born and the late-night hours of Ramazan had always been considered a great opportunity to play cricket.
Over the years, Ramazan tournaments — like the one at Naya Nazimabad and others including the one played during the day at the Karachi Gymkhana — have gained a level of prestige that participating sides treat them as professional competitions.
While these events serve business tycoons funding their operations and broadcast on national television as an impactful advertising tool, the participating players benefit massively.
“When a player is new and no one has seen him, these live tournaments give him exposure and the opportunity to be noticed by the country’s best coaches and teams, Asad told Dawn, adding that the quality of the participating players in Ramazan tournaments helps the competition.
“These teams are not club sides,” added the veteran. “Players with first-class cricket experience play here and it helps the youngsters gain confidence if they perform against high-quality players.”
Asad’s teammate Omair Bin Yousuf, who has been playing first-class cricket for the last four to five years and made his PSL debut for Quetta Gladiators recently, echoed his senior’s views on Ramazan tournaments.
“Ramazan cricket is very competitive; both in terms of the pitches and the players,” he said. “The participation of international level players makes such tournaments an opportunity for us to groom ourselves.
Other than Ramazan tournaments, Omair claimed the players of his level don’t get too many opportunities to play high-quality cricket at the local level.
“We play just a few matches of such quality over the year and also because it goes live it is a great stage for us to prove our mettle and increase our chances of becoming international cricketers,” said the right-handed batter.
Saim made the most of playing Ramazan cricket tournaments and ended up being capped for Pakistan and became a matter of pride for his teammates including Omair.
“I’ve been playing with Saim for a long time now, he is talented and very hard working and not many players have the quality that he has,” said Omair. “It has been very heartening to see him improve himself over the past few years and go on to play in the PSL and for Pakistan.
“It is a huge achievement for him and for us as well, because he played with us and we also want to emulate what he did.”

The Dutch government also pledged a top-level investigation of the match.
The game on Wednesday was stopped for almost 30 minutes after Ajax midfi­e­lder Davy Klaassen was hit on the head by the lighter.
Kick-off had been delayed as fans set off fireworks. There were also anti-semitic chants.
Police said on Thursday they had arrested 22 people, including a 32-year-old man suspected of throwing the lighter.
The Dutch Football Fed­eration (KNVB) anno­unced later on Thursday measures to prevent such an  “outrageous” incident from happening again.
“If a player or a referee is struck by an object from the crowd, the referee will immediately end the match,” the KNVB said in a statement.
“We are fed up with this kind of behaviour.”
The Dutch police union had earlier told tabloid newspaper Algemeen Dagblad the referee should have stopped the match altogether.
“Such bad behaviour should not be rewarded,” the union said.
Games between the bitter Amsterdam and Rotterdam rivals are often flashpoints but there has been a rising incidence of football violence in the Netherlands.
Dutch Justice Minister Dilan Yesilgoz said the incident would be investigated  “at the highest level.”

9,Bradburn named Pakistan head coach in unusual setting,"Dawn understands delay in Arthur’s appointment is down to PPRA rules requiring govt, semi-govt organisations to advertise vacancies offering compensation of Rs100,000 or more."," 

PAKISTAN fast bowler Shaheen Shah Afridi plays football during a training session at the Gaddafi Stadium on Friday.—M.Arif / White Star

KARACHI: Grant Bradburn was named Pakistan head coach in an extremely inconspicuous announcement by the country’s cricket board on Friday, while former gaffer Mickey Arthur’s return remained a mystery.
Arthur was all but set to assume duties as the national side’s “consultant team director” according to reports that emerged within the last few weeks, and the pursuit of his appointment is something the Pakistan Cricket Board’s (PCB) interim Management Committee chairman Najam Sethi has been vocal about.
However, Arthur’s name was nowhere to be seen in the PCB’s press release that included a list of the player support personnel for Pakistan’s upcoming five-match T20 and One-day International series against New Zealand.
The statement, however, said the PCB “will confirm the Pakistan team management for post-New Zealand series following the completion of the relevant recruitment processes, which are presently ongoing”.
Dawn understands the delay in Arthur’s appointment is down to the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority’s (PPRA) rules that require government and semi-government organisations to advertise vacancies that offer compensations of Rs100,000 or more.
The PCB advertised the vacancies for Pakistan’s team director, head coach, batting coach, bowling coach, fielding coach and strength and conditioning coach as late as in the last week of March with April 17 set as the deadline.
The advertisement went out only after Arthur confirmed his interest to take up the team director role and proposed names of support staff that he wanted to work with. Those names included that of Bradburn, Andrew Puttick for the batting coach position and former South African pacer Morne Morkel for the bowling coach post.
According to a source close to the PCB, either of the appointments can’t be made before the April 17 deadline “to ensure all interested candidates are given equal playing field”.
Bradburn, Puttick and Drikus Saaimon — Arthur’s choice for the strength and conditioning coach position — however, will enjoy a massive edge over their competitors for the roles with the trio being included in Pakistan’s player support personnel for the New Zealand series.
According to the source, Bradburn and Puttick, being Arthur’s choices, have been given “an opportunity to come to Pakistan” to understand the environment, talk to the players and “complete the process”. The duo joins the Pakistan squad — which gathered at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore on Friday for the side’s preparatory camp for the New Zealand games — on April 11.
The formal procedure is highly unlikely to cause any inconvenience in the implementation of Arthur’s plans for the Pakistan unit, which will have Abdul Rehman, who served as the side’s head coach in the recent T20 series against Afghanistan, as the assistant coach for the New Zealand series. Former Pakistan pacer Umar Gul will continue his duties as the bowling coach.
The squad was also joined by newly appointed team manager Rehan-ul-Haq and analyst Hassan Cheema. The duo, who have worked for HBL Pakistan Super League franchise Islamabad United since the league’s inception in 2016, are known for believing in modern cricketing strategies and have a data-driven approach.

Koepka torched the famed course’s par-5 holes for an eagle and three birdies in a bogey-free round. His superb shotmaking followed an opening 65, his low Masters round, and left him on 12-under 132 for 36 holes.
Australia’s Jason Day, was on 7-under overall through 15 holes after a double bogey at the par-5 15th.
Day birdied the par-5 second and made another at the third after dropping his approach three feet from the hole. After going bogey-birdie to end his front nine, Day birdied 11 and 13 before his disaster at 15.
That dropped him back level for second place with Spain’s Jon Rahm and Norway’s Viktor Hovland, who both opened with 65s and had just started their second rounds.
Koepka made a birdie at the par-5 second to grab the solo lead, then curled in a tricky 10-foot par putt at the third after chipping his approach over the green.
The 32-year-old Ameri­can eagled the par-5 eighth after a brilliant approach shot to reach 10-under, becoming the fastest to that mark at a Masters since Jordan Spieth on his way to victory in 2015.
Koepka cleared Rae’s Creek in two at the extended par-5 13th and notched another birdie, then added one more at the 15th.
Koepka was in the fifth group out on Friday with cold, windy and rainy conditions expected by the afternoon and all of Saturday.
World number one and defending champion Scottie Scheffler was 2-over on the day and 2-under overall after 11 holes while US amateur Sam Bennett had three birdies and a bogey to stand fifth on 6-under through 11 holes.
Woods, a 15-time major winner and five-time Masters champion, had just started after struggling to a 74 on Thursday, right on the projected 2-over cutline.World number two Rory McIlroy, who needs a Masters victory to complete a career Grand Slam, was 4-over overall through 10 holes.
On Thursday, Hovland, Rahm and Koepka shared the first-round lead, taking advantage of easier-than-usual conditions to card seven-under par 65s.

11,Confident Saim wants to create his own legacy,"Finishing as 2nd-highest run-scorer in National T20 Cup last year, he has only dazzled public since emerging onto domestic cricket scene hardly 2 years ago."," 

SAIM Ayub gestures during the media talk.—White Star

LAHORE: Saim Ayub has watched the world’s best southpaws in videos but doesn’t idolise any. The upcoming Pakistan opener wants to create his own legacy instead.
The left-hander has only dazzled onlookers since emerging onto the domestic cricket scene hardly two years ago.
After finishing as the second-highest run-scorer in the National T20 Cup last year, Saim showed he was meant for the big stage when he performed extraordinarily well for Peshawar Zalmi in the HBL Pakistan Super League earlier this year, scoring 341 runs at an excellent strike rate of 165.33.
His performance in the PSL earned him a place in Pakistan’s recent three-match T20 International series against Afghanistan, in which he played a decent inning in the side’s consolation victory in the final match.
He was one of only three players to be retained in the squad for Pakistan’s upcoming five-match series against New Zealand at home.
The 20-year-old’s shots range from conventional frontfoot and backfoot stokes to the more adventurous scoops, flicks and paddles. His “no-look” shot — essentially a paddle-scoop — has gained massive popularity following the PSL.
“I have seen videos of every lefty,” Saim said ahead of Pakistan’s first training session of the ongoing preparatory camp for the New Zealand games at the Gaddafi Stadium here on Friday.
“Saeed Anwar was also at the same place in popularity at my age but the way he emerged as a legend I will try my best to establish my name so that people could idolise me.”
Despite an amazing show in the PSL, Saim had to wait to find his touch against Afghanistan. His knock of 49 runs in the third T20 came only after he had failed to make an impact in the first two matches.
The Karachi-born southpaw said he found a clear difference in standard between the PSL and international cricket.
“There is a difference between the standard of international and league cricket and every cricketer has to make efforts to adjust to the international standard as soon as possible,” Saim observed.
“Though playing conditions in Sharjah and here in Pakistan are different, at the end, the players have to perform their best to win matches.”
Saim is a believer in confidence and said the trait was the key to success for every cricketer.
“I go in every game with confidence at my back and I try to remain positive,” he noted.
The youngster, who made his PSL debut for Quetta Gladiators last year, said he felt lucky to be playing Pakistan’s lethal pace attack in the nets. Saim said he was looking forward to giving his best in whatever opportunities that come his way and believed he could show flexibility across formats and across batting positions according to the team’s requirements.

12,Injured Topley exits IPL,NEW DELHI: England pacer Reece Topley will miss the Indian Premier League after suffering a dislocated shoulder...,"NEW DELHI: England pacer Reece Topley will miss the Indian Premier League after suffering a dislocated shoulder earlier this week, Royal Challengers Bangalore confirmed Friday.
Topley landed awkwardly on his 2.01-metre (6 feet and 7 inch) frame on Monday while fielding against Mumbai Indians and left the ground.
The star bowler has reportedly flown home, and his team announced on Twitter that he was replaced by South African all-rounder Wayne Parnell for the rest of the season. 
“Thank you for putting your body on the line and giving your 100%. We will miss you and wish you a speedy recovery, mate,” Royal Challengers Banga­lore tweeted on Friday. “Fearsome with the ball and fearless on the field! We don’t just call you top lad Topley for nothing.” The 29-year-old’s exit is the second blow to the team in days, after top-order batter Rajat Patidar was ruled out with a heel injury on Tuesday.
The franchise said hom­e­town pacer Vyshak Vijay­kumar, 26, would replace Patidar in the squad.
Bangalore are one from two this season after losing to Kolkata Knight Riders by 81 runs on Thursday evening.

13,Mushfiqur guides Bangladesh home in Ireland Test,DHAKA: Mushfiqur Rahim shrugged off Bangladesh’s mid-innings jitters to hit a quickfire half-century Friday and...,"DHAKA: Mushfiqur Rahim shrugged off Bangladesh’s mid-innings jitters to hit a quickfire half-century Friday and seal a seven-wicket victory over Ireland in their one-off Dhaka Test.
Ireland were bowled out for a second innings of 292 soon after resuming on the fourth day, and Mushfiqur top-scored for the hosts with seven fours among his 51 runs. 
“We had no particular ambition to dominate before the start of the game. We wanted to win it and we did it. I am happy with that,” said Bangladesh skipper Shakib Al Hasan. “We never feared a defeat. In Tests you get time to bounce back... so none of us thought we could lose this game.” 
Opener Tamim Iqbal made 31 and put on 62 runs with Mushfiqur for the third wicket. after Ireland saw a glimmer of hope with two crucial early wickets.
Liton Das gave Bangladesh a positive start but poor fortune saw him bowled for 23 as a Mark Adair bouncer struck him off the helmet and fell onto his stumps, dislodging the bails.
Three overs later, Najmul Hossain was caught by Andy Balbirnie at slip off Andy McBrine after making just four runs.
Najmul was initially declared not out by the on-field umpires but replays confirmed a fair catch to leave Ireland jubilant and Bangladesh reduced to 43-2.
But Mushfiqur and Tamim denied the visitors further success, taking Bangladesh to 89-2 by lunch.
Ben White dismissed Tamim after the break but Mominul Haque remained on 20 alongside Mushfiqur to take Bangladesh home.
Bangladesh also had pacer Ebadot Hossain to thank when his two wickets wrapped up Ireland’s innings at 292 runs.
The tourists added just six runs to their overnight 286-8 after Ebadot forced last man Graham Hume to give a catch behind the stumps for 14.
McBrine added just one run to his overnight 71 to give Ebadot a finish of 3-37. 
‘BIT OF A FRIGHT’ 
The visitors were staring down the barrel of an innings defeat on Thursday before debutant Lorcan Tucker became Ireland’s second Test centurion with 108.
Kevin O’Brien is the only other Irishman to have hit a Test century, scoring 118 against Pakistan during their maiden Test in 2018.
Harry Tector added 56 to lift Ireland from a precarious 13-4 and surmount a 155-run first-innings deficit. 
“It was certainly backs-to-the-wall stuff on day two and a lot of people probably wrote us off yesterday but our day was as good a Test day as Ireland has had,” said captain Balbirnie. “Having been 13 for four and to get a lead and hopefully give them a bit of a fright was good.” 
The visitors were all out for 214 runs in their first innings and Bangladesh posted 369 runs in response. Mushfiqur put the hosts in the box seat on the second day with his first-innings knock of 126. 
This week’s Test extends Ireland’s losing streak in the five-day format. They have now lost all four Tests they have played since becoming a full member of the International Cricket Council in 2017.
Ireland next head to Sri Lanka, where they will play two Tests in Galle, the first match beginning on April 16.
