0,City administrator thanks Four Paws’ team for treating Noor Jehan,KARACHI: Karachi Administrator Dr Syed Saifur Rahman held a farewell meeting with the Four Paws’ team on Friday at...,"KARACHI: Karachi Administrator Dr Syed Saifur Rahman held a farewell meeting with the Four Paws’ team on Friday at the Governor House.
The team arrived earlier this week on the request of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) to provide medical assistance to ailing zoo elephant Noor Jehan. The animal was later diagnosed with a large hematoma in the abdomen.
“The administrator thanked the team for coming to Karachi in time and providing the much-needed assistance in diagnosing and treating elephant Noor Jehan,” said a spokesperson for the KMC.
The administrator also requested the team to continue their assistance, which they later accepted, he added.
The team was led by Dr Amir Khalil from Egypt. It also included Dr Marina Ivanova from Bulgaria, Dr Frank Göritz, Prof Thomas Hildebrandt, and Mathias Otto from Germany, Pia Einheimler from Austria, and press coordinator Sandra Hönisch from Germany.
Noor Jehan had been suffering from illness and pain for over three months, which rendered her weak and partially paralysed, forcing the authorities to seek help from the international animal welfare group.
The Four Paws’ team was on its fourth visit to Karachi Zoo. In August last year, it performed major tusk surgeries on Noor Jehan and Madhubala, the other female elephant at the zoo.
In 2021, the team had furnished a report before the Sindh High Court, which was approached by a group of citizens worried over plight of animals at the zoo, recommending a series of steps on elephants’ welfare.
The team strongly suggested shifting the zoo elephants to Safari Park, which also houses two female elephants, because the latter facility had reduced noise pollution and provided a better species-specific environment.

2,"Flour crisis may deepen as govt, millers lock horns  over movement of wheat","• Food minister says restriction imposed to curb hoarding across Sindh • Millers demand free movement, say Karachi","• Food minister says restriction imposed to curb hoarding across Sindh
• Millers demand free movement, say Karachi already facing shortage                                
KARACHI: The controversy between the provincial government and the flour millers over the shunting of wheat to Karachi from interior parts of the province may further increase the price of flour in the metropolis in the coming days as the food department continued its action against unauthorised movement of wheat, it emerged on Friday.  
While the millers feared a wheat and flour crisis in the city due to restrictions on movement of wheat to Karachi, Food Minister Mukesh Kumar Chawla said that the action was launched to defeat hoarding across the province, ensuring no flour miller got the commodity more than the official quota of 6,000 bags of 100kg per month.  
He said that the provincial government had set a target of procuring 1.4 million metric tons of wheat for 2023-24 and it was imperative to keep a vigilant check on stocking of wheat by the hoarders.  
The millers said that the seizure of wheat trucks arriving from interior parts of the Sindh might result in increase in the price of flour that was already selling at Rs140-160 per kg in the city. They alleged that the wheat was being seized since March 1.  
Food Minister Chawala told Dawn that the procurement of wheat was in full swing and the restriction on the movement of wheat in the province was imposed to foil hoarding of the commodity.  
He said that the flour millers had stowed away a sizeable quantity of wheat last year.
“Some of the miller had stocked up to 200,000 bags of 100kg and later sold wheat in the open market at higher prices,” he said, adding that the food department had chalked out an ‘effective’ strategy to thwart any attempt of hoarding.  
The minister said that he had established check posts at the provincial borders and some other places to check the irregular movement of wheat.  
The flour millers, however, alleged that the officials at the checkpoints openly extorted money ranging from Rs75,000-100,000 per vehicle to allow transportation of wheat to Karachi.  
They alleged that the provincial government forcefully impounding truckloads of wheat and shifting it to its warehouses to achieve its wheat procurement targets.  
The sources in the food department said that the action against the movement of wheat was launched on March 25. They said that earlier 200 to 300 trucks of wheat were arriving Karachi. They said that the flour millers were given whole of the last week for bringing wheat to Karachi as per their quota.  
They said that the restriction of the movement of wheat would continue till the procurement target was not achieved.  
The flour millers said that the food secretary of Sindh had assured them that the checkpoints set up by the food department at Kathore and Matiari were to be abolished but they were still operating.  
They said that a vast cost difference existed in wheat as the grain within the province was available at Rs10,200 per 100kg bag while in Karachi, it was being sold at Rs11,700 per 100kg bag.  
The millers said Karachi was facing a shortage of wheat.  
They said that if the situation remained same and checkpoints were not removed, flour prices would shoot up massively in the city, and urged the provincial government to ensure free wheat movement to Karachi.  
Wheat harvesting has started within parts of the country and wheat yield results are clear that they could not meet overall grain requirement for 2023-2024.  
Flour millers urged the government to allow Karachi millers to directly import 50 per cent of earmarked imported wheat quantity privately.  
Wheat output level in the country has reduced due to weather conditions, floods, torrential rains and hail storms, millers said, adding that reducing the total output level, the overall wheat yield/availability within the country is not satisfactory to meet the local requirement in 2023 and 2024.  
Pakistan has imported 2.2 million tonnes of wheat in 8MFY23 costing $876m as compared to two million tonnes valuing $752m in the same period last fiscal.  
Despite huge imports and availability of local crop, consumers are still paying Rs2,315-3,160 for a 20kg flour bag as compared to Rs800-1,500 exactly a year back.

4,Murder of educationist Ajmal Sawand in Kandhkot condemned across Sindh,"PTI, Muttahida and SUP slam PPP govt for poor law and order.","KARACHI: Opposition parties in the province on Friday said that the killing of a prominent teacher associated with the IBA-Sukkur in Kandhkot reflected poor law and order and demanded that a strong action be taken against police and district officials for their “criminal negligence”.
Dr Mohammad Ajmal Sawand was on his way back to Sukkur from his Shawli village when attackers sprayed his car with bullets in the Shalo area of Kandhkot, killing him on the spot.
Condemning the incident, Leader of the Opposition in the Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Shiekh of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf lashed out at the Pakistan Peoples Party-led government in the province and alleged that it had appointed “corrupt and incompetent” police officers for “certain objectives”.
He said that the murder of an educated person like Dr Sawand was a result of ineffective policing in Sindh.

PTI, Muttahida and SUP slam PPP govt for poor law and order

“The police force in Sindh is actually not there to protect life and honour of people,” he said in a statement. “It’s there to protect the PPP feudal lords. They are paid by the government for the protection of interests of ministers, leaders and feudal lords of the PPP.”
The Muttahida Qaumi Movement Pakistan (MQM-P) condemned the killing of Dr Sawand and called it unfortunate that the tribal feud in rural Sindh had claimed life of a genius teacher who returned to the country after acquiring education in France to serve his own people.
“The MQM-P has always condemned tribal clashes in Sindh. This saga has claimed so many lives but, unfortunately, the provincial government has failed so far to stop this menace despite all resources and power,” said the MQM-P coordination committee in a statement issued on Friday.
The party demanded that the Sindh chief minister take notice of the killing and bring the culprits to justice.
The Sindh United Party (SUP) came up with almost same thoughts. 
Syed Zain Shah of the party said there was resentment among the people of Sindh against the PPP government amid growing number of criminal activities across the province, nexus between police administration and the criminals and unchecked exploitation of local people through certain tribal elders. 
“Apart from other crimes, there’s been a surge in kidnapping for ransom cases in Sindh,” he said.
“There’s an organised campaign that causes tribal clashes to achieve certain targets which claim human lives. Along with Karachi, no area of Sindh is safe for a common man. This is a result of 15-year rule of PPP. The PPP has ruined Sindh economically, politically and socially,” he added.

5,Christians observe Good Friday,Bakeries prepare hot cross buns in huge quantities to fulfil demands,"KARACHI: The Christian community observed Good Friday with religious rituals in the metropolis.
Good Friday commemorates the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. Therefore, it is a solemn occasion. You don’t hear church bells, there is no lighting of candles at the altar. The theme for the day is also red, symbolic for martyrs. In comparison, Easter Sunday is a day of rejoicing because it celebrates the resurrection of Christ.
Good Friday’s service comprises Bible readings, the veneration or unveiling of the cross and the communion where Christians have a small piece of bread and water in memory of the last supper. The services at several churches are also language-specific. For instance, there are Urdu and English services at most of the churches of the city. At some, there is also an additional Punjabi service along with a choir also singing hymns in all three languages. 
Many churches also have students act out the crucifixion of Christ. The young actors go around the church while stopping at 14 different stations where the actor playing Christ is beaten and pushed ahead to the cross. Simultaneously, there are scripture readings explaining the final moments of Christ’s life and their relevance in today’s world.

Bakeries prepare hot cross buns in huge quantities to fulfil demands

The month of Lent and Good Friday is a time to meditate and reflect on one’s actions. Fasting is also mandatory for those between the ages of 16 and 60 years on Good Friday. 
But after that there is also a custom among them to enjoy a snack, more specifically hot cross buns. These are sweet buns with cinnamon, raisins and a marzipan cross on top that is sprinkled with sugar. Bakeries bake them in huge quantities to fulfil demands. 
Most of these bakeries are located in Clifton and Saddar as a huge part of the Christian community resides there or they are located near the big churches. For instance, there are the United Bakery, Crispo Bakery and the most popular J.C. Misquita, which are located near the St Patrick’s Cathedral. There is also a Crispo Bakery branch in Clifton near the St Anthony’s Church. 
All these bakeries are quite well-known for their hot cross buns and all their buns taste different as they have their own secret hot cross bun recipes. Their customers, as indicated earlier, aren’t necessarily Christians as Muslims enjoy hot cross buns, too, and they wait for them all year. At bakeries on Good Friday they are also waiting in long queues with their Christian friends as the odour of freshly baked buns coming out from the kitchens tantalise the taste buds making the wait harder and harder.

7,"SHC sets aside death sentence  in kidnap, murder case",Bench expresses dissatisfaction with IO for faulty investigations,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Friday set aside death sentence handed down to a man by a sessions court in a kidnapping and murder case.
A sessions court had sentenced Mohammad Arshad to death in March last year for kidnapping and killing 21-year-old Gulfaraz in Khokhrapar in August 2017.
The convict, through his counsel, filed an appeal before the SHC against the trial court’s order. The bench comprising Justice Mohammad Karim Khan Agha and Justice Khadim Hussain Tunio allowed the appeal and exonerated the appellant after hearing both sides and examining the record and proceedings of the case.
The bench in its judgement observed that the victim had disappeared on Aug 8, 2017 and his body was recovered on Sept 16, 2017. The complainant did not try to lodge any FIR about disappearance of his younger brother and unable to furnish any explanation for such delay, it said.

Bench expresses dissatisfaction with IO for faulty investigations

The bench stated in the verdict that the complainant was informed by police about the arrest of the appellant who disclosed during interrogation about his involvement in the kidnap and murder case and this extrajudicial confession before police was made the basis of the FIR and further investigation.
However, it noted that any confession in police custody was of no evidential value in court and one police officer admitted that he did not get the appellant’s confessional statement recorded before a judicial magistrate.
The bench further observed that as per police, the body was recovered on a lead provided by the appellant; however, merely pointing out dead body without any other substantive evidence was insufficient to form the basis of the conviction, it added.
“In order to secure a conviction, there must be additional evidence which is consistent with the guilt of the accused while in the present case the murder went un-witnessed,” it added.
According to the call data record (CDR), the victim had attended two calls of the appellant on the day of his disappearance, but mobile phones and SIMs allegedly used in the offence were not recovered and produced before the trial court, the verdict stated.
Additionally, the prosecution failed to produce a transcript or audio recording of the relevant ransom calls while it must establish that callers on both ends were the same individuals whose CDR was being used, it added.
The bench expressed its disappointment over the investigating officer, who had failed to investigate the case impartially as he did not involve all potential parties including the owner of the plot from where the body was found.

10,Larkana commissioner bans wheat movement,LARKANA: Wheat movement from Larkana division to neighbouring districts and other provinces has been banned to...,"LARKANA: Wheat movement from Larkana division to neighbouring districts and other provinces has been banned to facilitate achievement of procurement target, it was officially announced on Friday.
Larkana Commissioner Ghanwar Leghari has imposed the ban for 30 days after, according to sources in food department, Deputy Commissioner Rabia Siyal made such a request in a communication dated March 20. She recommended the ban on transportation of wheat stocks outside the division,
particularly through the bordering districts of Qambar-Shahdadkot, Kandhkot-Kashmore and Jacobabad. 
In an official communication, it was apprehended that the free movement of wheat within the division and towards Balochistan and Punjab would make achievement of procurement target, set for the 2022-23 season, difficult.
The notification for the ban was issued on Thursday (April 6) to DCs and SSPs of all districts of Larkana division who have been asked to ensure implementation of the order in consultation with food department. 
They have been authorised to seize wheat stocks if found being transported in violation of the ban to other provinces.
At a recent meeting of all stakeholders chaired by the commissioner, it was decided to ensure achievement of the procurement target set at 410,000 tonnes in five districts of the division. It was also decided to do away with the practice of a one-kg deduction on every 100kg for the procurement.
