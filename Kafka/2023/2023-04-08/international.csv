0,Russia charges US reporter with espionage,Gershkovich is the first American journalist detained in Russia on espionage charges since the end of the Cold War.,"MOSCOW: Russian investigators formally charged Evan Gershkovich with espionage on Friday, but the Wall Street Journal reporter denied the charges and said he was working as a journalist.
Russia’s Federal Security Service, the main successor to the Soviet-era KGB, said on March 30 that it had detained Gershkovich in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg and had opened an espionage case against the 31-year-old for collecting what it said were state secrets about the military-industrial complex.
“Gershkovich has been charged,” Interfax quoted a source as saying.
TASS reported that FSB investigators had formally charged Gershkovich with carrying out espionage in the interests of the United States, but that Gershkovich had denied the charge.
“He categorically denied all the accusations and stated that he was engaged in journalistic activities in Russia,” TASS cited an unidentified source as saying.
Gershkovich is the first American journalist detained in Russia on espionage charges since the end of the Cold War.
The Journal has denied that Gershkovich was spying and demanded the immediate release of its “trusted and dedicated reporter”. The Journal said his arrest was “a vicious affront to a free press, and should spur outrage in all free people and governments throughout the world”.
The Kremlin said that Gershkovich had been carrying out espionage “under the cover” of journalism. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has told the United States that Gershkovich was caught red-handed while trying to obtain secrets.

1,Moscow threatens to scrap Ukraine grain deal,ANKARA: Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Friday threatened to abandon a landmark grain deal with Ukraine if...,"ANKARA: Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Friday threatened to abandon a landmark grain deal with Ukraine if obstacles to Moscow’s exports remained.
Negotiated in July by Turkiye and the United Nations, the agreement allows Ukraine — one of the world’s top grain producers — to export grain through a safe corridor in the Black Sea.
“If there is no further progress in removing barriers to the export of Russian fertilisers and grain, we will think about whether this deal is necessary,” Lavrov told a news conference in the Turkish capital Ankara, alongside his counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu.
The agreement has so far allowed the export of more than 27 million tonnes of grain and agricultural products. It was renewed twice. When it was extended in March, Russia said it would be valid for 60 days instead of the 120 days in the original agreement.
Moscow has been complaining that its side of the agreement, promising the right to export fertiliser, is not being respected.
Turkiye is pushing for a 120-day extension although it acknowledges that the agreement has not been fully implemented.
“We value the continuation of the agreement which is also important in terms of reducing the global food crisis,” Cavusoglu said.
There are no sanctions on Russian exports of food and fertilisers to global markets but the problems are related to the secondary sanctions imposed on shipping and insurance companies as well as banks.
“USA and England took some steps in terms of payment and insurance but we have to be fair, the problems continue”, Cavusoglu said, adding that barriers remained.
Lavrov also met with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan later on Friday.

2,Xi aims to ‘counter’ US with lavish treatment of Macron,GUANGZHOU: China’s Xi Jinping has given French President Emmanuel Macron an unusually lavish welcome on a state...,"GUANGZHOU: China’s Xi Jinping has given French President Emmanuel Macron an unusually lavish welcome on a state visit, which some analysts see as a sign of Beijing’s growing offensive to woo key allies within the European Union to counter the United States.
The two leaders visited southern China together on Friday, where Macron drank Chinese tea with Xi in a former residence of his father in the city of Guangzhou, capital of the economic and manufacturing powerhouse of Guangdong province.
Such forays by Xi with visiting leaders are rare. Diplomats say it underlines the importance Beijing attaches to this relationship with a key member of the EU as it looks for support against what Xi has called  “all-round containment, encirclement and suppression” by the US
“All Chinese foreign policy offensives have the US-China relationship in the background...so to work with any country, especially middle or big powers, like France, is something they’ll try to do to counter the US” said Zhao Suisheng, a professor of China studies and foreign policy at the University of Denver.
Noah Barkin, an analyst with the Rhodium Group, said China’s chief objective was to prevent Europe from aligning more closely with the United States.
“In this sense, Macron is perhaps Beijing’s most important partner in Europe,” he said. Macron is often considered by diplomats to be an important driver of key policies within the EU.
Macron travelled to China with European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, both pressuring China on Ukraine, but failing to wrest any public shifts in position from Xi. Still, Macron was given the full red carpet treatment.
Von der Leyen, who described China as “repressive” in a critical speech before her trip, cut a sometimes forlorn figure in Beijing, with a low-key greeting at the airport and not being invited to some state functions with Xi and Macron.
China’s state-backed Global Times newspaper said in an editorial on Thursday: “It is clear to everyone that being a strategic vassal of Washington is a dead end. Making the China-France relationship a bridge for China-Europe cooperation is beneficial to both sides and to the world.”   
‘Flattery’ 
Jean-Pierre Raffarin, a former French prime minister who has travelled extensively to China, said on the sidelines of a deal-signing ceremony in the Great Hall of the People that some of Xi’s charm was having an effect.
“Isn’t diplomacy, at one point or another, a bit of flattery?” he said. “There’s always a bit of that in human relations. Each side plays with that.”  
In Washington, China’s diplomatic engagement with France is being viewed with a degree of scepticism.
Beyond Ukraine, China would relish a realignment that draws it closer to Europe economically as relations with the United States fray, but such a shift is unlikely at this point, said people familiar with the US government’s thinking.
Washington is taking a wait-and-see approach to the European engagements with Beijing over Ukraine, according to China wathcers. On Thursday, Macron urged Beijing to “talk sense to Russia” over the war in Ukraine while von der Leyen said Xi expressed willingness to speak to Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky.
Xi did not mention a possible conversation with Zelensky in China’s official reports of his comments after the meetings.

3,Eight killed in BD tribal gunfight,DHAKA: At least eight people were killed during a gunfight between two tribal insurgent groups at a remote town in...,"DHAKA: At least eight people were killed during a gunfight between two tribal insurgent groups at a remote town in Bangladesh’s restive Chittagong hills, police said on Friday.
The skirmish took place near Ronwagnchhari, a town shut to tourists since October when security forces launched a crackdown against the Kuki-Chin National Front (KNF), a newly emerged rebel group.
The operation has displaced hundreds of tribal people, with some walking for days to cross the border and take refuge in a remote corner of northeastern India.
Local police chief Tariqul Islam said, two rival armed groups clashed on Thursday night and officers recovered the dead bodies of eight tribal people Friday morning.
“They were killed in a gun battle,” Islam said, adding that around 60 people had fled their homes in Khamtangpara village where the attack took place.
Another district police officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity said that the victims were Bawm, a small Christian tribal community.
They were suspected members of the KNF that had been shot dead by a splinter faction of the United People’s Democratic Front, he added.
Last month, the Bangladesh Army accused the KNF of killing one of its troops and injuring another.

China has proposed its own “peace plan” for Ukraine in Beijing’s first major diplomatic intervention into the conflict, but Ukraine and some Western leaders remain sceptical of Xi’s close relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Friday that the Kremlin had “monitored” the talks between the EU and China, but underlined that Russia had its own “rich relations” with Beijing.
“China is a very serious, very big power with its own sovereign position ... This is not the kind of country that changes its positions rapidly under external influence,” Peskov said, when asked if Russia was concerned Europe could persuade Xi regarding Ukraine.
After the talks, Xi expressed willingness to speak to Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky directly.

5,"Small ears, frizzy hair and dry ear wax: the genetics of mammoths",WASHINGTON: The largest-ever genetic assessment of the woolly mammoth has yielded new insight into this elephant...,"WASHINGTON: The largest-ever genetic assessment of the woolly mammoth has yielded new insight into this elephant cousin — an icon of the Ice Age — including about its fluffy hair, small ears, cold tolerance, fat storage and even dry ear wax.
Researchers on Friday said they had analysed the genomes of 23 woolly mammoths — including 16 newly sequenced ones — based on remains preserved in Siberian permafrost. They then compared them to the genomes of 28 modern-day Asian and African elephants.
“The objective was to find those mutations that are present in all mammoths but not in any of the elephants — that is, the genetic adaptations exclusive to the woolly mammoth,” said evolutionary geneticist David Dez-del-Molino of the Centre for Palaeogenetics in Stockholm, lead author of the study published in the journal Current Biology.
“We find that woolly mammoths had molecular adaptations in genes related to coping with cold Arctic environments, such as thick fur, fat storage and metabolism, and thermal sensation, among others,” Dez-del-Molino added.
The genomes included a mammoth from 700,000 years ago — near the origination time of this species on the Siberian steppes - and others that lived later in their history, thus showing how genetic adaptations evolved.
The species, which arose at a time when Earth’s climate was cooling, inhabited parts of northern Eurasia and North America. Most mammoths went extinct roughly 10,000 years ago amid a warming climate at the last Ice Age’s end, with scientists debating whether human hunting played a role. The last ones died out on Wrangel Island off Siberia’s coast 4,000 years ago.
The first complete mammoth genome was sequenced in 2015, after a partial genome in 2008.
The new study showed that 9 per cent of unique mutations already existed at the outset of the species, with continued evolution on certain traits. For example, mammoths evolved ever-fluffier fur and ever-smaller ears over time.
“Our 700,000-year-old woolly mammoth may have had larger ears than the mammoths of the last Ice Age,” Centre for Palaeogenetics evolutionary geneticist and study senior author Love Daln said.
One highly evolved gene was one that when “turned off” in laboratory mice results in unusually small ears. Woolly mammoths were about the size of modern African elephants, around 13 feet tall, but had much smaller ears to guard against losing body heat from a larger ear surface.
Several genes involving fur type and growth differed from modern elephants. One of them in humans is associated with Uncombable Hair Syndrome, a condition characterized by dry and frizzy hair that cannot be combed flat. In mammoths, fluffier hair, as well as fat deposits, would have helped provide insulation in the cold.
The mammoths had a mutation in a gene that in people is associated with having dry ear wax, though it is unclear how this gave them any advantage. The same mutation is associated with reduced body odor in the armpits in humans, though this may not mean mammoths had a dainty aroma.
“I very much doubt mammoths would have been sweating into their arm pits. This is a very unique human thing, I think. Other mammals regulate their body temperature in other ways. So it is very unclear if mammoths would have smelled differently because of this gene variant,” Daln said.
The study helped clarify variable shades of mammoth hair colour — brownish with a touch of red. Mutations in an immune system-related gene indicated the species adapted to a serious pathogen outbreak at some point.

6,Kyrgyz eco-activist’s ‘trashion’ tackles a burning problem,BISHKEK: A Kyrgyz environmental activist has found a way to combat toxic fumes choking her city by literally turning...,"BISHKEK: A Kyrgyz environmental activist has found a way to combat toxic fumes choking her city by literally turning trash into treasure, sewing clothes out of waste that would otherwise be burnt in a landfill or someone’s stove.
Garments are a major industry in the Central Asian nation of 7 million, but manufacturers often discard scrap material in landfills outside the capital, Bishkek, to be burned or scavenged to heat people’s homes.
Those fumes make the air even more toxic in Bishkek, which is already one of the world’s most polluted cities, thanks to its widespread use of coal.
But artist Cholpon Alamanova came up with a solution that makes use of a traditional patchwork sewing technique called kurak to recycle the textile waste into colourful blankets, clothes and accessories.
In doing so, her workshop has become part of a global “trashion” trend promoting the use of recycled, used, thrown-out and repurposed elements to create garments, jewellery and art.
The task engenders a warming feeling that motivates her to keep doing it, says Alamanova, while helping to keep alive the tradition.
“Every single item that we make with students imparts a very pleasant feeling that at least for a tiny bit, we have made Kyrgyzstan cleaner, and helped maintain the purity of its air, water and land,” she added.
Her team, which has grown to more than 80 women aged between 25 and 79, has processed 300 kg of fabric within a few months, winning public acclaim for fighting pollution while popularising kurak.

7,US judge defends lavish trips as ‘personal hospitality’,"ProPublica reports Thomas was a guest of mega-donor Harlan Crow for yachting in New Zealand, private flights and regular stays at his US properties."," 

Justice Clarence Thomas, a judge of the US Supreme Court.—AFP

WASHINGTON: US Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas defended himself on Friday over accusations that he accepted years of luxury travel trips from a Republican billionaire, saying that it was “personal hospitality” that did not need to be registered.
Staunch conservative Thomas was a guest of mega-donor Harlan Crow for yachting in New Zealand, private jet flights across the globe and regular stays at Crow’s properties in the United States, the ProPublica news outlet reported.
Thomas, 74, the longest-serving justice on the court, went on one trip to Indonesia that would alone have cost $500,000, it calculated.
In a statement, Thomas said that judicial colleagues had previously “advised that this sort of personal hospitality from close personal friends, who did not have business before the Court, was not reportable.”
The guidelines were currently being changed “and, it is, of course, my intent to follow this guidance in the future,” he added.
ProPublica, citing interviews and photographs and other documents, detailed how Thomas had joined Crow for trips to an exclusive all-male wilderness resort in California and at Crow’s private houses in Texas and New York state over 20 years.
Crow has made more than $10 million in donations to Republican political groups, ProPublica said, including half a million dollars to a conservative lobbying group founded by Thomas’ wife Ginni Thomas.
The ProPublica revelations prompted outrage from some judges and Democrat politicians, while legal reform groups called for fundamental changes in how the Supreme Court is run.

8,UAE rejects SA’s plea to extradite  graft-accused Gupta brothers,JOHANNESBURG: South Africa said on Friday it had learnt with “shock and dismay” that the United Arab Emirates ...,"JOHANNESBURG: South Africa said on Friday it had learnt with “shock and dismay” that the United Arab Emirates had turned down its request to extradite two brothers accused of orchestrating industrial-scale corruption.
Justice Minister Ronald Lamola said the government was notified on Thursday evening of a Dubai court decision not to allow the extradition of business tycoons Atul and Rajesh Gupta.
“We learnt with shock and dismay that the extradition hearing had been concluded in the Dubai court on Feb 13 and our extradition request was unsuccessful,” Lamola said in a statement.
The Guptas are alleged to have colluded with former president Jacob Zuma to siphon off state assets from South Africa, the continent’s most advanced economy.
South Africa filed the extradition request in July last year after the two were arrested in Dubai a month earlier.
The arrests followed the inking of an extradition treaty between Pretoria and the UAE.
The ultra-wealthy brothers ran a sprawling family business empire in South Africa for more than two decades after migrating from India.
South Africa’s case centres on an alleged 25-million-rand ($1.6m) fraud linked to an agricultural feasibility study —  small fry compared to the scale of other allegations facing the family.
Lamola said the extradition was denied on a technicality. The Dubai court determined that the UAE had jurisdiction on the charge of money laundering, as the crime in question was alleged to have been committed in the country as well as in South Africa, he said.

9,"China sends warships, aircraft around Taiwan","“We will never yield to suppression and we will not stop interacting with the world because of any hindrance,"" Taiwanese President Tsai says.","TAIPEI: China sent warships and aircraft near Taiwan for a second day on Friday and said the island remains its “inseparable part”, after President Tsai Ing-wen angered Beijing by meeting US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.
Three Chinese warships sailed in waters surrounding the self-ruled island, while a fighter jet and an anti-submarine helicopter also crossed Taiwan’s air defence identification zone (ADIZ), said the defence ministry in Taipei.
Tsai returned on Friday after visiting Taiwan’s dwindling band of official diplomatic allies in Latin America, with two US stopovers that included meetings with McCarthy and other lawmakers.
“We let the international community see that Taiwan is more united when facing pressure and threats,” she told reporters, describing her trip as a success.
“We will never yield to suppression and we will not stop interacting with the world because of any hindrance.”
 






Hours before her meeting with McCarthy in Los Angeles on Wednesday, China sent its Shandong aircraft carrier through Taiwan’s south-eastern waters on its way to the western Pacific.
Beijing said on Friday that “Taiwan is an inseparable part of China”, after repeatedly warning against the Tsai-McCarthy meeting.
“China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity will never be divided,” foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said at a regular press briefing.
“The future of Taiwan lies in reunification with the motherland.”
Journalists on Pingtan island, China’s nearest outpost to Taiwan, saw a military ship and at least three army helicopters transiting through the strait on Friday afternoon.
A silver-grey tugboat cruised southwards, about one kilometre from the shore, while the two aircraft flew northwards over the waters at a fairly low altitude.
It was not immediately clear if the movements represented an enhancement of normal patrols that Beijing conducts in the region.
Last August, China deployed warships, missiles and fighter jets around Taiwan for its largest show of force in years, following a trip to the island by McCarthy’s predecessor Nancy Pelosi.
Beijing’s response to the Tsai-McCarthy meeting has so far been more muted and China’s ADIZ incursions in the past two days have not risen beyond the activities of an average week.
The ADIZ is not the same as Taiwan’s territorial airspace, including a far greater area that overlaps with part of China’s own ADIZ and even some of the mainland.
Taiwan was on alert, with Premier Chen Chien-jen saying that its defence and security agencies were keeping a close eye on developments.

10,US asks Turkiye to stop trade with Russia,US State Department official says Turkish officials had been “very clear” that they had put in place a ban on the re-export of sanctioned goods to Russia.,"WASHINGTON: Turkiye has agreed to stop the transit of sanctioned Western goods to Russia after pressure from the G7, a senior US official said on Thursday, cautioning that Washington would monitor Ankara’s trade data with Moscow in anticipation of a drop.
James O’Brien, head of the US State Department’s Office for sanctions coordination, said Turkish officials had been “very clear” with various governments and agencies that they had put in place a ban on the re-export of sanctioned goods to Russia.
“It will take us some time to see it, but we will see trade data from March and April and we will expect to see this trade dropping dramatically,” O’Brien said.
The United States and its allies imposed extensive sanctions on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine, but supply channels have remained open from Black Sea neighbour Turkiye and other trading hubs, including Hong Kong.
The Turkish government handed companies a list of banned foreign goods and instructed them not to transship those to Russia from March 1, the Istanbul Ferrous and Nonferrous Metals Exporters Association said last month.
The policy comes after Washington and other members of the G7 bloc of wealthy nations have worked to persuade third countries to restrict sales of items that Russia can reuse on the battlefield.

11,French FM in rare meeting with Iranian counterpart,"PARIS: France’s foreign minister has held a rare face-to-face meeting with her Iranian counterpart in China, ...","PARIS: France’s foreign minister has held a rare face-to-face meeting with her Iranian counterpart in China, urging Tehran to release French nationals “arbitrarily detained” in Iran, the foreign ministry said on Friday.
Catherine Colonna, travelling with President Emmanuel Macron on his state visit to China, met Hossein Amir-Abdollahian in Beijing.
Amir-Abdollohian was leading the Iranian delegation in separate reconciliation talks in Beijing between Iran and its once arch regional foe Saudi Arabia.
China mediated the reconciliation last month in a sign of Beijing’s growing clout in the Middle East.
Colonna “renewed her urgent demand for the immediate release of the six French citizens who Iran is arbitrarily detaining,” the French statement said.
The six are among an estimated two dozen foreigners who activists and Western governments say are being held by Iran as hostages in a bid to extract concessions.
Iran’s foreign ministry confirmed the meeting took place, adding that “some consular issues were also raised during the meeting”. It did not specify further.
Contacts between Iran and European powers — including over the Iranian nuclear programme — have been drastically scaled down over Tehran’s deadly crackdown on the protest movement that erupted in September.
