2,Posting of DG health withdrawn hours after notification,PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa caretaker government on Friday notified a senior officer as director general health...,"PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa caretaker government on Friday notified a senior officer as director general health only to withdraw the appointment a couple of hours later for the second time in about a week.
Earlier, the establishment department had notified the appointment of Dr Jamal Nasir, an officer of management cadre in BS-20, as DG health.
A notification issued from the establishment department stated that Dr Nasir, who was serving as director Provincial Health Service Academy, had been transferred and posted as DG health.
He had replaced Dr Shukat Ali, who had been directed to report to the establishment department.
However, in the evening, another notification was issued by the establishment department stating that posting-transfer orders of Dr Nasir as DG health were inadvertently issued and are hereby withdrawn with immediate effect.
An official requesting anonymity told Dawn that the establishment department had conveyed to the officer that his notification had been withdrawn on account of not being approved by the Election Commission of Pakistan.
However, he said it was puzzling as to how the department could issue appointment order on such a senior position without going through the required procedure. He said the same appointment had been made twice in about a week only to be withdrawn within a couple of hours. 
The official said the caretaker chief minister had already approved the transfers, and both the officials were among the 43 senior officers, who were reshuffled on March 31.

Talking to Dawn, Anwar Shah, coordinator of the 7th digital population and housing census for Orakzai, said the Bulandkhel issue was resolved during a meeting of the officials of Hangu, Kohat and North Waziristan administrations.
 
 

He said as per the report of the divisional census in-charge, a total of 54,532 households were listed in the district. Mr Shah said the census results were expected to be announced in June.
Meanwhile, talking to Dawn on telephone, Orakzai deputy commissioner Tayyab Abdullah termed the successful completion of the census as a positive development as it would provide accurate and reliable data for better planning and resource allocation. He said the census exercise was concluded within the stipulated time.
He said a census support centre was established under the supervision of assistant commissioner, revenue, Asfandyar Khalid, and officials from the relevant departments played a vital role in the smooth conduct of the census.
BAN: Kohat deputy commissioner Dr Azmatullah on Friday banned kite flying with chemical and metal string for 60 days.
According to a statement, the order was issued as there was a likelihood of human casualties and damage to electrical wires due to kite flying with chemical or metal string.
Mr Azmatullah urged people to comply with the order and refrain from kite flying during this period, warning violators of the ban would be dealt with strictly under the law.
MAYOR CRITICISED: Opposition members of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf in the Kohat tehsil council on Friday outright rejected a resolution passed by what they said a few members of the house against functioning of a private fruit market in the district.
In a statement issued here, PTI members Qaiser Khan, Haji Ayub, Shah Hussain, Raees Khan and Abid Ali condemned city mayor Qari Sher Zaman of JUI-F for calling only four members of PTI out of 25 and conducting the house without its convener.
They criticised the tehsil council for overstepping its mandate and interfering into a matter solely related to the tehsil municipal administration. They said the matter regarding the fruit market had been pending in courts.
They alleged the mayor got the resolution passed through forced voting. They also accused the city mayor of distributing free flour on the basis of personal like and dislike.

6,Leopards kill 30 goats in Kaghan village,Shepherd says a two-member team of the wildlife department visited the animal shed and collected evidence before leaving.,"MANSEHRA: Two leopards attacked an animal shed in Shangiran village of Kaghan valley here on Thursday night killing 30 goats and injuring six sheep. 
Shepherd Mohammad Yaqoob told reporters that the felines possibly lived in the nearby Malkandi National Park or Khatta Mungloor forests and came to the village in search of food.
He said that it was the first such attack in the village.
Mr Yaqoob said that a two-member team of the wildlife department visited the animal shed and collected evidence before leaving.
He said that he also shared with the team the pictures of goats killed by leopards.
The shepherd said that work on a hydropower project had begun near the Malkandi National Park and Khatta Mungloor forests, so it could be the possible reason for the departure of wild animals from their natural habitat.
In February and March, the wildlife department seized two injured leopards from the Mansehra-Naran-Jalkhad Road in Kaghan Valley. One of them died at the Dodial Peasantry afterwards.
When contacted, divisional wildlife officer Taimur Shah confirmed the leopard attack and said it was being investigated by his department.

He said the two leopards possibly left their natural abode for food.

8,High court moved against delay in launch of BRT feeder route,"PHC asks transport dept, UMA to file response","PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court has directed the provincial transport department and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Urban Mobility Authority to respond to a petition seeking its orders for the start of a notified feeder route of the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) for Peshawar’s cantonment area.
A bench consisting of Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan and Justice Abdul Shakoor admitted to full hearing a petition jointly filed by Jamil Akhtar and several other residents concerned against the failure of authorities to launch the BRT feeder route between Peshawar Stadium Chowk in cantonment area to Pishtakhara Chowk on Ring Road.
The schedule for the next hearing will be issued later.
The petitioners requested the court to accept their plea and direct the respondents to ensure the early start of the bus service on the route in question to provide a comfortable mode of transportation to them and thousands of other residents.

PHC asks transport dept, UMA to file response

The respondents in the petition are the provincial government through its chief secretary, secretaries of the communication and works and transport and mass transit departments, managing director of the KP Urban Mobility Authority, and the cantonment executive officer of the Peshawar Cantonment Board.
The counsel for petitioners, Rahat Ali Khan Nahaqi, said the Peshawar BRT was a swift bus transit system, whose one part covered an east-west corridor serving 32 areas on a dedicated track for private buses and the other comprising a network of feeder routes for buses to enter and exit the system to travel on the streets.
He said the Peshawar BRT was inaugurated on Aug 13, 2020, as the fourth such service in the country.
The lawyer said in May 2018, the provincial government had notified the areas within KP as the Mass Transit Areas with an immediate effect for Peshawar’s district as off-corridor feeder.
He argued that while the feeder route from the Stadium Chowk to the Pishtakhara Chowk was mentioned in the notification, the petitioners and other people living along that route awaited its launch.
Mr Nahaqi said the company had been delaying the launching of the feeder route and that the Peshawar Cantonment Board had not been permitting the plying of the BRT buses on cantonment roads.
Meanwhile, three residents of Peshawar’s Warsak Road have filed another petition seeking extension of the BRT feeder route to Warsak Road claiming that a large number of people lived along the road requiring a modern public transport facility.
The petition is filed through lawyers Mohammad Jameel Khan and Saad Rabbani.
The petitioners said on June 7, 2021, the BRT feeder service was inaugurated beginning from Charsadda Road from Peshawar Firdous bus station to the Shah Alam village.
They added that some residents petitioned the court to seek extension of that route up to Naguman area.
The petitioners said the high court had accepted that plea on Oct 13, 2022, and ordered the extension of that feeder route up to Naguman.
They requested the court to order the extension of that route to Warsak Road.

Before the protest, the people visited the tehsil headquarter to get free flour from a distribution point set up at the government degree college, Allai. However, the situation went out of control when flour fell short.
Assistant commissioner, revenue, Mohammad Saleem, who was present at the distribution point, told Dawn that people of four village councils used to get free flour from the point. He claimed they distributed 2,500 bags daily, but over 3,000 people gathered at the distribution point on Friday, which led to shortage of the commodity. He said the people were asked to wait as the flour would arrive shortly, but they became unruly and stormed the assistant commissioner’s office.
The people told Dawn some got the flour, while others were left out, prompting them to protest. Hameedur Rehman, a social activist, said police officials present at the distribution point baton charged the people, angering them into storming the AC’s office.
The people after storming the AC office gathered at the main Chowk and staged a demonstration there.
Later, Naeem Shaheen, chairman of Tehreek-i-Inqilab, a political party, and Shah Faisal Khan, brother of a former JUI-F MPA, successfully negotiated with the protesters, making them to disperse.
