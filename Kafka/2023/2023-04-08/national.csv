0,Taftan trade gateway to reopen after nine years,QCCI says reopening of the Bazarcha Gateway will prove a breath of fresh air for local businesses.,"QUETTA: The government has decided to reopen Taftan Bazarcha Business Gateway on a trial basis from Saturday (today), almost nine years after it was closed in 2014 over security reasons.
According to officials, the high-ups of Pakistan Customs, National Logistic Cell (NLC) and business leaders of Quetta Chamber of Commerce and Industry (QCCI), have reached Taftan to make arrangements for the reopening of the gateway.
The QCCI has long been demanding reopening of the Bazarcha Gateway. 
They claimed that the closure affected small businesses and deprived the locals of jobs.
On Friday, QCCI President Haji Abdullah Achakzai, Senior Vice President Haji Agha Gul Khilji and Vice President Syed Abdul Ahad Agha inaugurated the restoration of trade activities on a trial basis.
Mr Agha said that reopening of the Bazarcha Gateway will prove a breath of fresh air for local businesses.
He expressed hope that very soon the gate­way will be opened for regular trade, providing boost to business and employment opportunities to locals.
Earlier, QCCI had signed an agreement with Pakistan Customs for the construction of a business terminal, fencing on the border and other works in Bazarcha.
The Federal Board of Revenue, NLC, QCCI, local tribes and the police have also made arrangements for reopening of the gateway.

The man was critically injured in the first blast and later died of his wounds. When labours working nearby gathered around the explosion site, another blast occurred, though no loss of life was reported.
Officials said unidentified miscreants used an improvised explosive device (IED) for the blasts.
“The IED was planted close to the under-construction watchtower,” a Levies official said, adding that a civilian, identified as Zhob’s resident Muhammad Usman, lost his life after being critically injured.
He was taken to a hospital in Harnai but died of his wounds before getting any treatment.
Soon after the blast, security officials and coal miners working in a nearby field rushed to the site. As they gathered there, another blast took place. However, no loss of life was reported in the second blast.
“It seems the miscreants detonated both IEDs with a remote control,” a Levies official said, adding that an investigation into the incident was underway.
The under-construction watchtower was partially damaged. Security forces have launched a search operation in the area to trace the elements.

4,Call for army action against dacoits in south Punjab,"NA members call out local authorities, police for “giving a free hand” to dacoits and criminals.","ISLAMABAD: Lawmakers belonging to the riverine area along the Sindh-Punjab border on Friday decried the poor law and order situation in their constituencies due to unchecked activities of criminal gangs and called for an army operation as the situation had gone beyond the control of police.
Speaking on points of order in the National Assembly soon after a brief question hour, the members belonging to both the treasury as well as the opposition benches, strongly protested against the local authorities, including the police, for “giving a free hand” to dacoits and criminals.
Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf referred the issue to the house committee on interior with a directive to come back with suggestions to resolve the matter.
The issue was raised by Sheikh Fayyazuddin of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) from Rahimyar Khan, who informed the house that dacoits had kidnapped two schoolchildren from Khanpur city earlier in the morning. Recently, he said, a video of two kidnapped men had gone viral on social media in which the dacoits were seen demanding the release of their accomplices from custody. They had threatened to kidnap children, if their demands were not met.

PML-N member tells NA two schoolchildren kidnapped from Khanpur

“Please do something to get these children released,” said the MNA, adding that dacoits in the katcha (riverine area) had made life difficult for local people.
A Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) dissident from Rajanpur, Sardar Riaz Mazari, endorsed the PML-N MNA’s views and said he had been raising this issue on the floor of the assembly for the past four years, but to no avail. 
Mr Mazari said several governments at the centre and the provinces had come and gone, but there had been no improvement in the area as far as the crime situation is concerned, exposing the powerlessness of local authorities and police.
“If the task is too tough for police, then use the army,” he suggested, stating that criminals had sent messages to locals asking them to give them five to 10 maunds of wheat as extortion when the crop would be ready. He claimed that even police had informed the deputy commissioner concerned that they could not perform duties during the ongoing census in the area.
Mr Mazari said that on one hand people were still reeling from the effects of rains and floods, while on the other they had been abandoned by the authorities to face the dacoits. He pointed out that criminals and dacoits had extended their activities from Rojhan and Rahimyar Khan, in Punjab, to Kashmore and Ghotki, in Sindh, fearing that soon they would spread throughout the country.
The PTI MNA said that last week he received a call from a PML-N MNA from Okara, Moeen Wattoo, who sought help for the recovery of two men kidnapped from his constituency. Mr Mazari said he informed Mr Wattoo that he could not do anything as his own people were being kidnapped. 
Mr Mazari called for a “targeted operation” by army in the area.
Mr Wattoo took the floor and endorsed the call for military operation, stating that police were perhaps not capable of handling the situation.
It may be recalled that the Sindh cabinet on March 10 had approved a plan to procure military grade weapons and surveillance equipment for police to launch a grand operation clean-up against dacoits with the support of Pakistan Army and Rangers in the riverine area of the province.
The cabinet, presided over by Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, authorised the inspector general of police to contact the police chiefs of Balochistan and Punjab so that a coordinated operation could be planned in the katcha areas.
The IGP had reportedly informed the cabinet that the weapons and surveillance system were required to take on hardened criminal gangs operating in the riverine area of Kashmore, Shikarpur and Ghotki districts.

5,"Pakistan bigger exporter of basmati  to Europe than India, panel told",Senate body criticises minister for absence from meetings,"ISLAMABAD: The Ministry of Commerce told a Senate panel on Friday that the European Union has not given any preferential access to Indian basmati rice.
Replying to lawmakers’ questions during a meeting of the Senate Committee for Commerce, the ministry’s secretary said that at present, Pakistan was exporting more basmati rice to European markets than India.
Basmati rice is a shared production of India and Pakistan. In the recent past, it became a source of a contentious trade battle between the two nations after India applied for an exclusive trademark that would grant it sole ownership of the basmati title in the European Union.
The secretary, Sualeh Ahmed Farooqui, said the EU had yet to make any progress

on the request while Australia has also rejected a similar request from India. Legal proceedings are still ongoing in the United States, he added.
The meeting of the parliamentary committee also criticised the persistent absence of Commerce Minister Naveed Qamar from meetings.
At the outset of the meeting, Senator Danesh Kumar said the minister was asked to appear for questions from senators. He later walked out of the meeting to register his protest.
The committee’s chairman, Senator Zeeshan Khanzada, said ministers should give importance to parliamentary committees and ensure their participation. Otherwise, the issue will be raised with the Senate chairman.
Senator Faisal Javed raised the issue of royalties to artists. He said Pakistani artists had the right to get a royalty for their art aired on government and private electronic media.
He complained that even the state-run PTV was not providing royalties to artists for streaming their old dramas and music.
The chairman of the Intellectual Property Organisation, an attached department of the commerce ministry, told the committee that a law was being drafted for the protection of artists’ rights.
He added that feedback has been sought from stakeholders on the draft which will be shared soon with the standing committee.
Trade Development Authority of Pakistan (TDAP) Chief Executive Officer Zubair Motiwala briefed the committee on export diversification efforts and increasing exports to Africa.
He said TDAP wanted to promote the export of dates, pink salt, and mangoes which have now been registered under Geographical Indication (GI) tags.
Efforts are being made to increase the export of seafood as well, he added.
Briefing on the efforts to boost trade, the commerce secretary told the meeting that a grand exhibition was organised in Dubai while the private sector was being supported by the commerce ministry to participate in an exhibition held in Germany.
The committee was informed that 197 international trade fairs and 10 local trade fairs were organised during the last four years to promote exports. 
Bushra Rehman of the Canada-Pakistan Chamber of Commerce infor­med the committee that Pakistan’s single-country exhibition would being held in North America in August. A total of 57 Pakistani companies will participate in this exhibition. The exhibition needed more support from the ministry and TDAP, she added.
The commerce secretary told the meeting that the production of dates has been greatly affected due to last year’s floods.
He said 300,000 tons of dates were exported annually, but this year only 5pc of them will be exported. The committee’s chairman said that the export capacity of the country should be prepared and provided to the committee in the next meeting by preparing a report on our current situation and comparison with different countries.

8,Gandapur sent to jail on six-day judicial remand,Court absolves PTI leader of charges in two criminal cases filed in D.I. Khan,"DERA ISMAIL KHAN: A local court on Friday absolved PTI leader Ali Amin Gandapur of charges in two criminal cases registered by Dera Ismail Khan police, but sent him to prison on six-day judicial remand in separate cases filed in Islamabad and Punjab.
Mr Gandapur, a former federal minister and PTI’s central leader, was arrested on Thursday night outside the building of the Peshawar High Court’s Dera Ismail Khan bench after an hours-long drama.
On Friday, he was produced before a judicial magistrate, Mazhar Ali. His lawyers requested the court to drop the charges, insisting that they were concocted and registered without evidence. They argued that there was no possibility to frame char­ges against Mr Gandapur based on the prosecution’s version.
The magistrate accepted the PTI leader’s plea and rejected the charges. However, Mr Ganda­pur was not set free as two other cases have been registered agai­nst him in Islamabad and Punjab.

Court absolves PTI leader of charges in two criminal cases filed in D.I. Khan

The magistrate also rejected requests by Islamabad and Pun­jab police seeking Mr Gandapur’s transit custody. He directed the representatives of both Islam­abad and Punjab police to fulfil the required documentation for further legal proceedings.
In the two FIRs registered against Mr Gandapur in D.I. Khan, the Cantonment Police Station charged him with multiple offences.
In one case, he was charged with blocking roads and raising slogans against the government during school and office hours, causing hindrance to students. It was alleged that he had gathered people in violation of Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Proce­dure invoked by the administration.
The FIR was registered under Section 147 (punishment for rioting), Section 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint) and Section 188 (disobedience of the order of a public servant) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
The second FIR was registered last year after Mr Gandapur released an audio message apprehending arrest of PTI chief Imran Khan. He was charged with using derogatory language against the government and national institutions.
On Friday, strict security measures were made at the court premises where Mr Gandapur’s brothers, former provincial minister Faisal Amin Gandapur and tehsil mayor Umar Amin Gandapur, were present along with several PTI workers.
Meanwhile, in Islamabad, a case against Ali Amin Gandapur was registered at Golra Police Station on charges of hatching a conspiracy against the state and acts of terrorism.
The FIR said the suspect directed his supporters to get prepared for an armed war against national institutions.
Meanwhile, D.I. Khan Deputy Commissioner Mansoor Arshad on Thursday imposed Section 144 in the district with immediate effect to ensure a peaceful environment.
According to a notification issued by the DC office, a ban has been imposed on unlawful assembly of five or more people in public places, pillion riding and the use of tinted glasses in vehicles for 11 days. The order will remain effective from April 6 to 16.

9,"‘Scathing note’, ‘mediocre judgement’: opposing views emerge on SC judge’s note",Fawad Chaudhry wonders how a judge can dictate or impose policy on a political party.,"• Fawad Chaudhry wonders how a judge can dictate or impose policy on a political party
• Shireen Mazari says polls ‘seem to be arousing fear in so many’
KARACHI: A “scathing note”, a “necessary unravelling”, a “mediocre judgem­ent” — Justice Athar Min­allah’s detailed note issued on Friday on the Supreme Court’s suo motu proceedings on the provincial polls’ delay attra­c­ted all kinds of reactions from people on both sides of the fence and the ones sitting on it.
“A mediocre judgement by all standards, technicality supersedes substantial issues,” PTI Senior Vice President Fawad Chaudhry said in a tweet.
He said that on the one hand, Justice Minallah’s note advocated the supremacy of parliament, but on the other, wanted to examine the dissolution (of the Punjab Assembly) in contravention of the Constitution. Besides, by referring to Lahore High Court, the note “acceded to the principle of elections”, Mr Chaudhry added.
In another tweet, while referring to Justice Minallah’s comments on a ruling by former National Assembly deputy speaker Qasim Suri and the PTI lawmakers’ decision to resign en masse, Mr Chaudhry said: “Political de­­cision making is prerogative of a political party, how a judge can dictate or impose a policy on a political party? How ama­zing are the observations.”
 






He said Justice Minallah had also recognised the principle of elections within 90 days in his dissenting note and had referred to the LHC decision in this context.
Dr Shireen Mazari, another senior vice president of the PTI, said Justice Minallah “has written more of a political statement than a judicial note, which is most unfortunate and disappointing too”.
“Elections seem to be arousing a strange fear in so many it’s amusing,” she tweeted.
 






When journalist Mubashir Zaidi said that he believed the Supreme Court had to constitute a full court to re-hear the elections petitions, Ms Mazari retorted: “So, every time the powerful disagree with a jud­gement it must be rejected?”
 






She added, “We know who are petrified of elections and who back them. We also know those who hate PTI and therefore want no elections.”
In his reaction, lawyer Muham­mad Ahmad Pansota believed that Justice Minallah “went a little overboard”.
To a question, he said a detailed or additional note could be issued by any judge in addition to the author judge. “It’s usually issued by a judge to dilate upon his finding in his own desired way.”
On the other hand, Lawyer Salahuddin Ahmed gave salient points of Justice Minallah’s decision in a Twitter thread and described the decision as a “scathing note”. Mr Ahmed appreciated the dissenting note, posting three “clapping hands” emojis.
 






Lawyer Reema Omer said that what was happening in the Supreme Court today was related to a separate constitutional crisis involving independence and impartiality of the judiciary, though she did not directly refer to Justice Minallah’s note.
 






After briefly describing how “some judges become party to the establishment’s persecution of their peer” and how the CJP allegedly misused his powers, she said: “Those aggrieved by these extraordinary manipulations and abuse of power are now speaking up, asserting their independence, and publicly recording their dissent with how the SC is being managed.”
“It is an unravelling — perhaps a necessary one — that has been long in the making,” Ms Omer said.

11,Who is BNA leader Gulzar Imam?,"PUTTING to rest months of speculations regarding the whereabouts of a Baloch separatist commander, Gulzar Imam, the...","PUTTING to rest months of speculations regarding the whereabouts of a Baloch separatist commander, Gulzar Imam, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) announced his arrest on Friday, describing it as a major counterterrorism achievement.
In mid-September, reports of Imam’s arrest had started circulating in intelligence and Baloch insurgent circles. Two months on, the Imam-led Baloch Nationalist Army (BNA) confirmed his arrest through its official channel ‘Baask’ and said that its founder was in the custody of Pakis­tan’s intelligence agencies. How­ever, the group did not disclose where, when, and how he was arrested.
Hailing from Panjgur district in Balochistan, Imam joined student politics in 2002 from the platform of the Baloch Students Organisation (BSO). Over the years, when several factions of BSO merged and formed the now-proscribed BSO-Azad,  Imam was made president of its Panjgur region around 2006.
Allah Nazar Baloch and Bashir Zaib, who are currently leading the other two major separatist groups — the Baloch Liberation Front (BLF) and the Baloch Liberation Army, respectively — also headed the BSO-Azad during their student lives.
When a crackdown began against BSO-Azad, Imam went underground and joined the Baloch Republican Army (BRA) — a proscribed separatist group led by Brahumdagh Bugti. He soon rose to be the group’s operational commander, according to political activists and journalists from Panjgur.
Between 2016 and 2018, three major Baloch separatist groups — the Hyrbyair Marri-led Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), the BRA, and the Mehran Marri-led United Baloch Army (UBA) — started developing internal rifts.
“The fragmentation in these groups began when their field commanders from the lower-middle classes challenged the groups’ heads, who are wealthy traditional Baloch tribal chieftains living in self-exile in Europe,” explained Fahad Nabeel, a security analyst at Geopolitical Insights, an Islamabad-based research firm.
Within the BRA’s ranks, Imam developed differences with its chief Brahumdagh Bugti over several iss­ues, particularly his leadership style.
In October 2018, the BRA expelled Imam from the group over his alleged involvement in extortion and extrajudicial killings. From that point onwards, the BRA was divided into two factions. 
On Jan 11 last year, Imam and Sarfaraz Bangalzai, a UBA field commander, merged their factions to form a new group, the BNA. On Jan 20, the BNA claimed responsibility for a bomb attack at Lahore’s Anarkali market. At least three people were killed and dozens injured in that attack.
Security experts and officials have hailed Imam’s arrest as a great achievement for law enforcement agencies.
“Imam’s arrest is a great achievement at the tactical level for the Pakistani security agencies, which can help them neutralise BNA’s network in Balochistan with the help of the information received from him through interrogation,” Abdul Basit, a research fellow at the Singapore-based S. Rajaratnam School of Inter­national Studies, told Dawn.com.
Experts are, however, sceptical of how much the arrest or elimination of one or two leaders would impact the overall Baloch insurgency. “The militants associated with the current wave of insurgency are ideologically motivated, not on the basis of tribes,” said Mr Basit.
