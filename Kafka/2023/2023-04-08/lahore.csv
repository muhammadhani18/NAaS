He said the Shehbaz Sharif government wanted to create political instability in the country. 
Mr Elahi was speaking to a delegation comprising KP Assembly Speaker Mushtaq Ahmed Ghani, Rao Abdul Rahman, former provincial minister Bao Rizwan and other leaders, who called on him at his residence on Friday. 
Mr Ghani briefed Mr Elahi about the progress on the petition filed in the Supreme Court related to the KP election and consulted him on political issues. 
Despite the clear order of the Supreme Court, the PTI president said Shehbaz Sharif and the cabinet were adamant not to hold the elections. He said passing unconstitutional resolutions against the Supreme Court by the Parliament was contempt of court and each and every minister should be taken to task. 
Mr Elahi said Shehbaz Sharif’s plan to make the army controversial would never succeed as the army always stood by the constitution and the masses. 
He said the parliament itself was a product of the election and asked how it could oppose elections. 
He said the caretaker government was doing everything that did not come under its jurisdiction except holding the elections. 
Parvez Elahi said the Election Commission of Pakistan had begun implementing the decision of the Supreme Court and issued the schedule and the code of conduct. He said provocative speeches against the judiciary were also a violation of the ECP’s code of conduct and the commission must take notice of the government’s rhetoric against the judiciary.

According to the first information report (FIR), Shayaan Hassan (11) and Subhan Hassan (6), sons of former medical superintendent of the Khanpur Tehsil Headquarters Hospital, Dr Hassan Mehmood, were going to school located in Model Town-B area in a car driven by the doctor’s driver Lal Khan.

The Khanpur city police registered the FIR (377/23) under section 363 of Pakistan Penal code against the unidentified kidnappers.
A CCTV footage of the incident shows a car overtaking the doctor’s car (carrying the two children) on a busy road, two armed alighting from it talk to the driver and later shift the children into their vehicle and drive away.  
District Police Officer (DPO) Rizwan Umar Gondal, on being informed of the incident, reached Khanpur and took briefing about the incident from local police.  
The DPO later told the media that some progress had been made in the kidnapping case, but he won’t share it with reporters immediately as it could impact the ongoing investigations.  
The Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) local chapter condemned the incident, demanding early recovery of the children.  
PMA Punjab Vice President Dr Jam Ghulam Qasim Sabbir told reporters that the association held an emergent meeting that condemned the government for its failure to provide security to people.

5,Two medical universities get new Pro-VCs,Violation of merit alleged at NMU,"LAHORE: The Punjab government has approved two summaries and appointed new pro-vice chancellors of the Nishtar Medical University (NMU), Multan and the University of Child Health Sciences (UCHS), Lahore. 
According to the notifications, gynecologist of BPS-20 Prof Dr Mehnaz Khakwani has been made Pro-VC of the NMU while professor of cardiology Dr Masood Sadiq has been appointed at the same post in the UCHS. 
The important slots of the both medical institutes had been lying vacant for quite some time. 
The Punjab Specialised Healthcare & Medical Education Department was under pressure by the senior faculty members of the both the universities to fill the slots on merit to avoid unrest as there were reports that these seats were kept vacant either deliberately or negligently, making the institutes suffer. 

Violation of merit alleged at NMU

Following the concerns of the faculty members, the department moved separate summaries, nominating three senior professors each against both slots. The department had nominated three senior medics of the NMU for appointment of one of them as Pro-VC. They included professor of radiotherapy Dr Ahmed Ijaz Masood, professor of gynae Dr Mehnaz Khakwani and professor of surgery Dr Iftikhar Hussain Khan according to the seniority list. 
It had proposed names of three senior faculty members for the same slot at the UCHS. They included acting VC of the UCHS Prof Masood Sadiq, Prof Muhammad Saleem and Prof Shazia Maqbool. 
Governor Balighur Rehman approved the appointments on Friday. 
However, an official highlighted an anomaly in the appointment of the new PRO VC of the NMU, saying that according to the merit, Prof Ahmad Ijaz Masood was the senior most among the three candidates nominated by the department for the post but the government allegedly ignored him and appointed Prof Khakwani who was second in the seniority list. The decision was also a violation of the Lahore High Court’s ruling, he said. 
The official said a full bench of the LHC, headed by Justice Shahid Waheed with Justice Shams Mahmood Mirza and Justice Sajid Mahmood Sethi as its members, had given a ruling in November 2020 that the senior most professor would be appointed as the pro-VC even if a single day of service remained before the age of superannuation. 
The judgment was given in the case of Prof Asad Aslam of the King Edward Medical University when he moved the court against the appointment of his junior colleague as the Pro-VC of the university. He had submitted in his plea that he was the senior-most KEMU professor but was illegally ignored for the post on the pretext that the length of his remaining service was less than three years. Consequent to the LHC ruling, Prof Asad was appointed as PRO VC of the KEMU, the official said.  
In the case of Prof Masood Sadiq, he added, the Punjab government followed the LHC’s order and merit but ignored the same while making appointment of Pro-VC of the NMU, Multan. 
The official said the PRO-VC served as acting VC in the absence of the regular VC. He said Prof Ijaz Ahmad Masood had earlier served the NMU as VC twice in 2018 and in 2020 and then as the pro-VC for a brief period being senior most among all the other faculty members.

According to the FIR lodged at the city police station under Sections 420 and 408 of the Pakistan Penal Code, some fake tokens were caught at a flour distribution point at the Government Islamia College, Chiniot.  
An investigation revealed that Omair Nawaz was in charge of the record of tokens being issued to recipients of bags. He confessed to embezzling 7,000 to 8,000 tokens, resulting in a loss to the national exchequer to the tune of Rs5 million to Rs6 million.
