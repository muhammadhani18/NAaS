0,Sharifs lead chorus asking top judge to step down,"Nawaz, Maryam seek CJP's resignation for his ‘glaring tilt’ towards PTI; private complaint filed in SJC against Justice Bandial.","• Information minister asks how verdict can be issued on petition ‘that doesn’t exist’
• Nawaz and Maryam seek top judge’s resignation for his ‘glaring tilt’ towards PTI
• Private complaint filed before SJC against Justice Bandial for ‘misconduct’
KARACHI: Amid a growing standoff with the judiciary, the government has called on Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial to step down because his position has become controversial.
The demand, made by Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb after a judicial note from Justice Athar Minallah was made public on Friday, was also echoed by PML-N supreme leader Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam.
Meanwhile, a complaint was filed against the CJP before the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) for ‘misconduct’, seeking a probe into the constitution of a bench for suo motu proceedings on Punjab and Khyber Pakht­unkhwa elections.
Addressing a news conference in Islamabad, Ms Aurangzeb said: “When there was no petition, questions arise as to why the bench was formed and why a decision was made.”
Four members of the SC bench wanted that a full-court bench proceed in the matter, she said, adding that political parties, too, were seeking a full-court bench so that the decision would be acceptable to people.
The minister said the CJP’s suo motu notice had been ‘dismissed’ by most members of the bench, yet a three-member bench was formed.
“Why was a bench formed on a petition which was dismissed and how can a decision be given on a petition which does not exist?”
She said political parties did not shy away from elections, but this was no longer just an election issue, rather a matter of ‘bench fixing’.
Ms Aurangzeb blamed the court’s handling of the election matter for creating a ‘constitutional crisis’, saying that elections should be held at the same time across the country after the completion of the assemblies’ constitutional tenure, and not on the whims of an individual.
Sharifs’ demand
Separately, PML-N chief organiser Maryam Nawaz Sharif echoed the demand that CJP Bandial should resign because “his tilt towards” her rival party, the PTI, was ‘glaring’.
In a couple of messages posted on Twitter, the PML-N chief organiser alleged that the top judge had flagrantly violated the law and Constitution to favour Imran Khan and the PTI.
 






“This blatant abuse of authority has led to an unprecedented revolt-like situation in the [Supreme Court]. Judges of impeccable repute have raised serious questions on CJP’s conduct & bias,” she wrote, claiming that no chief justice had ever been accused of such misconduct.
Her father, PML-N supreme leader Nawaz Sharif, also tweeted on the issue, saying that courts were meant to rescue nations from crises, not push them further into quagmire.
 






“Who knows what privilege the chief justice has employed to impose a minority opinion on a majority decision. Rather than causing further damage, a chief justice who has insulted his position and the constitution by furthering PTI’s agenda should immediately resign.”
Complaint against CJP
Filed by a private citizen, the complaint against CJP Bandial seeks a probe into the initiation of suo motu proceedings on KP, Punjab elections and constitution of a bench for the purpose.
Moved by Advocate Raja Sibtain Khan, the complaint claims that the CJP allegedly created a grouping within the SC by “keeping four judges in his basket”. By doing so, the complaint alleged, he was guilty of misconduct by luring those judges for his own personal motives and benefits and such practices were unknown to the framework of the Constitution and its dispensation, the complaint alleged.
The complaint said the CJP was allegedly guilty of misconduct and therefore should be removed from office immediately. While the greatest strength of citizens in constitutional dispensation rests with apex judicial institution, backed up by public confidence and trust of the people, the same was being diminished manifold due to assumption of jurisdiction by the incumbent CJP, the complaint alleged.
This warrants a serious probe under Article 209(5)(b) of the Constitution as the incumbent CJP allegedly committed ‘gross misconduct’ by being guilty of compromising his oath, relevant constitutional provisions and the dictum on the subject settled by the Supreme Court, according to the complaint.
The CJP allegedly constituted a bench according to the grouping so that he might be able to score a majority order in suo motu case on the KP, Punjab elections and other two constitutional petitions, the complaint alleged. This was not only a violation of Article 10-A, but also jeopardised the constitutional and fundamental rights of the people, it added.

1,Elections seem less likely as NSC announces anti-terror operations,Forum stops short of blaming PTI regime for terrorists’ return; minister says election was not on the agenda at key security huddle.,"• Body formed to give recommendations; NAP to be re-launched in a fortnight
• Forum stops short of blaming PTI regime for terrorists’ return
• Minister says election was not on the agenda at key security huddle
ISLAMABAD: Amid a thorny debate in political circles over the conduct of elections in Punjab in mid May, the top civil and military leadership on Friday reaffirmed their commitment to thwart terror threats and vowed to re-launch the National Action Plan (NAP) within 15 days to crush militants reportedly coming in from Afghanistan.
Without directly blaming the previous PTI government for the resurgence of terrorism in tribal districts along the border with Afghanistan, they agreed to initiate new multi-pronged and comprehensive operations, as well as combined efforts on the diplomatic, security, economic and social fronts for the elimination of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.
A committee formed for the purpose would present its recommendations within two weeks to implement the policy and draw its parameters.
The decisions were made at the National Security Committee (NSC) meeting, presided over by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza, Chief of Army Staff Gen Asim Munir, Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmad Baber, Naval Chief Admiral Admiral Muhammad Amjad Khan Niazi, chief ministers of four provinces and federal cabinet members attended the meeting.
The NSC’s decisions to launch a massive operation may further shrink chances of elections in Punjab, two days after the government had categorically refused to implement the court order regarding May 14 polls.
It was in this context that PTI Chairman Imran Khan, commenting on the convening of the NSC meeting, said that the government wanted to pit the armed forces of the country not against the judiciary, but the nation.
Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, while talking to Dawn, said that holding of elections in Punjab was not on the agenda of the NSC meeting and that was why the issue was not discussed in the civil and military leadership’s huddle. She, however, confirmed that a fresh NAP-like operation against militancy would start within 15 days.
Earlier, two similar plans had been launched in the country — first during Gen Pervez Musharraf’s regime in 2002 and the second during the previous PML-N rule in 2014.
Terrorists’ return
An official press release issued by the PM Office said, “NSC approved a multi-pronged comprehensive operation with the support of the government and the nation to eradicate the menace of terrorism from the country with a new resolve, determination and valour”.
 






“The committee proclaimed that the recent wave of terrorism was the result of the soft corner and the absence of a well thought-out policy against the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which was declared a terrorist organisation but against the public expectations and wishes, under the previous policy terrorists were allowed to return without any hindrance. In the name of confidence building, dangerous terrorists of the TTP were released from jails,” it noted.
“It was noted that due to return of the dangerous terrorists and support of different terrorist organisations to them from Afghanistan, peace and stability, which was the result of innumerable sacrifices and continuous efforts, was affected,” the official announcement said.
It was the 41st meeting of the security committee held in continuation of the one conducted after the deadly terrorist attack on the Peshawar Police Lines on Jan 2, 2023.
While emphasising comprehensive national security, it was declared that ‘relief to the people’ was of central importance. The forum was told that the government was taking measures in this connection. The meeting also acknowledged the sacrifices and efforts of the security forces for ensuring permanent peace for the nation.
The NSC reiterated the resolve to continue operation till the eradication of terrorism from Pakistan.
The committee also strongly condemned the increasing hatred and division in society and attempts to spread foreign-sponsored poisonous propaganda on social media against the state institutions and their leadership to achieve hidden targets and stated that those attempts were affecting national security.
While expressing resolve to foil the heinous designs of the enemies, the NSC said every effort would be made to maintain peace that was achieved with the supreme sacrifices and constant endeavours of the martyrs.
The NSC in its January sitting had reiterated its resolve to have “zero tolerance” for terrorism.

2,Returns on savings certificates raised by big margins,"The return on Regular Income Certificates has been raised to 12.84pc of total investment, an increase of 24 bps.","ISLAMABAD: After the central bank hiked its policy rate to a massive 21pc and following a historic surge in secondary market coupons, the Central Directorate of National Savings (CDNS) on Friday increased profit rates on all national savings schemes by significant margins.
The new rates will apply to deposits and investments made with effect from April 10. The rates, the highest in more than a decade, have been increased after the State Bank of Pakistan raised its key interest rate and yields on Treasury bills jumped to around 22pc earlier this week.
The returns on saving accounts and certificates are linked with the central bank’s policy rates and are normally kept slightly higher to ensure better returns to small savers without drastically affecting the government budget.
However, the government is paying over 21pc returns to secondary market players in investment bonds and Treasury bills but still paying lower returns to its own citizens.
According to a series of notifications issued by the Ministry of Finance on Friday, the CDNS has increased the profit rate on the Defence Saving Certificates by 261 basis points to 14.87pc. The rate was 9.29pc in May last year.
Likewise, the returns on Behbood Savings Certificates, Pensioners’ Benefit Accounts and Shuhada Family Welfare Accounts have been raised by 264 bps to 16.56pc.
The return on Regular Income Certificates has been raised to 12.84pc of total investment, an increase of 24 bps.
The profit margin on the three-year Special Saving Certificates and Special Savings Account was increased by over 400 bps to 17pc for the first five profits and to 17.8pc for the sixth profit. The average return for this category now stands at 17.13pc compared to 13.1pc previously.
The return on Saving Accounts (running accounts) has been increased by 400 bps to 18.5pc.
On the other hand, the return on Short-Term Savings Certificate has been raised to 19.92pc, 19.64pc and 19.82pc for three-, six- and 12-month tenors, respectively, after an increase of about 380, 364 and 386 bps.
The CDNS has dispatched the revised rate sheets to all the regional offices with instructions that the existing stock of blank special savings certificates, regular income certificates and defence saving certificates would now be issued at new rates from April 10.
The rates of national savings schemes are announced every two months and are linked to cut-off yields of long-term Pakistan Investment Bonds. As of the previous auction last week, the return on three-year and 10-year PIBs ranged above 21pc.

3,"Judges must not be seen as ‘politicians in robes’, says Justice Minallah",Agrees with three other judges’ decision to reject suo motu action; explains he didn’t recuse from nine-judge bench.,"ISLAMABAD: In a detailed judicial note in the Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa elections case, Supreme Court Justice Athar Minallah on Friday called for exercising “extreme restraint” in entertaining political questions, since public trust is eroded when the court is perceived as politically partisan and its judges are seen as “politicians in robes”.
In his “judicial order”, Justice Minallah also added a word of caution, saying the country was on the brink of a political and constitutional crisis and it is high time that all those responsible took a step back and resorted to some introspection.
Justice Minallah was among the four judges who had earlier rejected the suo motu case along with Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Yahya Afridi and Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhel.
“All the institutions, including the Supreme Court, need to set aside their egos and strive towards fulfilling their constitutional obligations,” he wrote.

Agrees with three other judges’ decision to reject suo motu action; explains he didn’t recuse from nine-judge bench

He said erosion of public trust in the independence and impartiality of the apex court could have been avoided if a “full court” was constituted, adding that a full court was also suggested in his earlier Feb 23 note.
It would have ensured the legitimacy of the proceedings, Justice Minallah emphasised while concurring with the opinion of Justice Yahya Afridi, who had dismissed the petition on the grounds of maintainability.
He also agreed with the joint note of Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhel, who held that the March 1 judgement had been dismissed by a majority of four to three and therefore the same should be considered as the “Order of the Court,” adding this was also the understanding at the meeting held in the anteroom on Feb 27.
Referring to the Feb 23-24 Supreme Court orders in which the nine-judge bench was re-constituted into a five-judge bench to assume suo motu jurisdiction on the provincial assemblies’ election, Justice Minallah in his 25-page “verdict” explained that he did not recuse from the nine-judge bench nor had any reason to dissociate himself from the larger bench.
Justice Minallah regretted that the current political climate in the country was so toxic that it was inconceivable that political parties would agree to having even a dialogue, let alone arriving at a consensus.
‘Political disputes’
In a document punctuated with sub-headings, Justice Minallah emphasised that extreme restraint should be exercised while assuming jurisdiction under Article 184(3), adding it was the duty of the court to ensure that political stakeholders were not encouraged to bring their disputes to courts for settlement by bypassing the institutions created under the Constitution.
He questioned the way resignations were tendered from the National Assembly en masse and two provincial legislatures were dissolved “as a political strategy”, rather noting that courts were first approached to compel the speaker to accept the resignations, and when accepted, the courts were again approached to have the decision reversed.
Role of court
In his judgement, Justice Minallah said this court cannot and must not appear or be seen as advancing political strategies of political stakeholders, adding that public trust would be eroded in the independence and impartiality of the court if it appears to encourage undemocratic norms and values. The court would be unwittingly weakening the parliament by encouraging political stakeholders to add their disputes to its dockets.
Justice Minallah said political stakeholders must establish their bona fides before their petitions could be entertained. The conduct of stakeholders has created an unprecedented political instability by resorting to conduct devoid of democratic values of tolerance, dialogue and debate.
Thus the conduct of the stakeholders does not entitle them to invoke the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Article 184(3) lest it is seen or appears to facilitate or promote undemocratic values and strategies, said Justice Minallah.
It is also alarming that the conduct of political stakeholders and their political strategies would create unprecedented political turmoil and instability in the country when political stability was a precondition for economic progress and prosperity. .
But the power struggle between the political stakeholders is undermining the welfare and economic conditions of the people of this country who have been made to suffer for a long time by depriving them of their fundamental rights, Justice Minallah regretted.
CJP’s powers ‘not unfettered’
He explained that it was not disputed that the Lahore High Court (LHC) had already allowed the petitions and rendered an authoritative judgement and its competence to have it implemented cannot be doubted.
Likewise, he noted that the Peshawar High Court (PHC) was also seized with the matter. In the light of the binding ‘salutary principles’ the petitions and suo motu jurisdiction must not be entertained lest it may interfere with the implementation of the judgement of the LHC and the proceedings pending before the PHC.
Referring to the power of the chief justice of Pakistan (CJP), Justice Minallah explained that discretionary powers of the Master of the Roster were not unfettered nor arbitrarily or capriciously — discretion exercised in a manner that preserves and promotes public trust and confidence. It is also an onerous duty of CJP to act in the best interest of the Supreme Court.
Moreover, the CJP and judges are jointly responsible to ensure that Article 184(3) jurisdiction was exercised to promote and preserve public trust. In case of breach of this duty the responsibility would rest with CJP and all judges, because they collectively constitute the Supreme Court, Justice Minallah said.

4,Baloch separatist group founder arrested in Panjgur: ISPR,QUETTA: The military has claimed the arrest of the founder of the banned Balo­ch National Army (BNA) during an...,"QUETTA: The military has claimed the arrest of the founder of the banned Balo­ch National Army (BNA) during an intelligence-based operation in the Prom area of Balochistan’s Panjgur district.
In a statement released on Friday, the military’s media wing said the “hardcore militant” was identified as Gulzar Imam alias Shambay. 
“A High-Value Target (HVT) was arrested in an “innovatively  conceived, carefully planned and meticulously executed” intelligence  operation spanning over months and across various geographical  locations,” ISPR said in a statement.
Imam was the founder and leader of the banned outfit BNA, which came into being after the amalgamation of the Baloch Republican Army and United Baloch Army, ISPR added.
He was “instrumental” in the formation of Baloch Raji Aajoi Sangar —  a coalition of three Baloch nationalist groups, namely Baloch Liber­ation Army, Baloc­histan Liberation Front and Baloch Repu­blican Guards — and remained its operational head, the military claimed, adding that he served as deputy to Brah­amdagh Bugti in BRA till 2018.
BNA had claimed responsibility for dozens of violent terrorist attacks in Pakistan including those on law enforcement agencies and sensitive installations in Panjgur and Noshki, the statement said.
The militant’s visits to Afghanistan and India are also on record while his linkages with foreign intelligence agencies were being investigated, the ISPR added.
Foreign intelligence agencies “also tried to exploit him to work against the state of Pakistan and its national interests,” the statement claimed. The arrest of Imam is a serious blow to the BNA and other militant groups, which have been “attempting to destabilise the hard-earned peace in Baloc­histan,” the ISPR said.
“Apprehension of a militant leader of this stature demonstrates the capability and resolve of LEAs to uproot the menace of terrorism as well as speaks volumes about the successes garnered thro­ugh supreme sacrifices of unsung heroes.”

5,Ruling alliance split on dialogue with PTI,"PPP opposes ""shutting the door"" on talks after JUI-F rejects the idea; conflicting views emerge within PML-N.","• PPP opposes ‘shutting the door’ on talks after JUI-F rejects the idea
• Conflicting views emerge within PML-N
• JI suggests polls in July
ISLAMABAD: The ruling coalition seems to be divided on holding talks with Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) to discuss elections, as Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) on Friday urged all political parties to sit together to resolve contentious issues whereas Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) have already rejected the idea of having a dialogue with Imran Khan-led party.
The ruling PML-N itself is split on the matter, with some of its leaders such as Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed asserting that they should talk to the PTI while some others such as Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah opposing the idea.
The PML-N and JUI-F have shown inflexibility for talks with the PTI at a time when the opposition party’s chairman Imran Khan has expressed willingness that not he but his party men could hold talks with the government on key national issues, including elections and crippling economy.
After PPP’s core committee meeting, which was chaired by its chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and PPP (Parliamentarian) President Asif Ali Zardari, PPP leader Farhatullah Babar in a statement said: “The meeting stressed that shutting the door of dialogue is not the solution. For this purpose, the party decided to approach all the parties in the coalition government for taking a joint position on the issue of dialogue among the political parties.”
Discussing recent court verdict regarding Punjab polls, Mr Babar said the PPP believed there were numerous reasons for the current political crisis, and not because the minority verdict should take precedence over the majority court verdict. But “this position is untenable legally, morally and politically and needs to be reviewed,” he said.
Mr Babar said the PPP was of the opinion that the judiciary’s honour and prestige should not be allowed to be impaired in any way. “To achieve this, it is essential that numerous apparently conflicting verdicts of the honourable court are resolved expeditiously,” he added.
The major ruling coalition partner also believed that in the interest of fair and free elections, general elections to all assemblies be held the same day, on a date provided in the Constitution. The PPP reiterated that it would not countenance any delay in the holding of elections beyond the mandate date in the constitution, he said.
Unwinnable fights
Earlier on Friday, PML-N Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed while speaking in the upper house of parliament said national unity was the need of the hour. He called for a dialogue to steer the country out of the political crisis. He advised the ruling coalition and the opposition PTI to end their ongoing fights with the judiciary and the military establishment, respectively. He asserted that the Constitution should be followed and elections should be held on time. “Political forces should not wait for a phone call from outside. Let us not get involved in unnecessary battles, because a fight against institutions is unwinnable,” he said.
He said that the executive was bound under Article 90 to comply with SC verdicts and Article 68 put restriction on discussing the conduct of superior courts judges in the parliament in discharge of their duties.
Meanwhile, Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) chief Sirajul Haq at a Seerat-un-Nabi Conference said that to stop uncertainty in the country, general elections should be called in July 2023.
Blaming both the ruling coalition and the PTI for polarisation in society that resulted in creating a divide within and among institutions, the JI chief said the parliamentary parties on both sides of the aisle should start dialogue on the election agenda if at all they were interested in saving the fragile democracy.
“The national institutions particularly the judiciary, the military establishment and the election commission should stand neutral in the best interest of the nation and the country and general elections should be held in July 2023 to stop uncertainty,” he asserted, while also accusing PDM member parties, the PPP and the PTI of protecting the status quo.
 
 

Recently Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah stated in categorical terms that the PML-N would not with the PTI for talks — a stance endorsed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
JUI-F to never sit with ‘criminal’
Also, in his speech in the National Assembly on Thursday, JUI-F leader Maulana Asad Mehmood declared that his party would never sit on the table with Imran Khan who, he said, was a ‘criminal’. “I want to say it categorically that we will not sit with Imran Khan for talks and to finalise a date for the elections. He is a criminal and should be tried under Article 6. This is the stance of my party. The judges had themselves declared that he [Imran] had violated the Constitution and today they [judges] have fallen in love with him,” said Mr Mehmood while referring to the judges’ advice that politicians should sit together.
Earlier on April 3, six ruling coalition partners after a meeting with some mediators from civil society had urged all ‘warring political forces’ to sit together and find an amicable solution to the prevailing political, economical and judicial crisis.
For this purpose, they also highlighted the need for holding a multiparty conference, according to a joint statement issued at a presser after the meeting at National Press Club.
