0,Business confidence slides to a record low,A majority (72pc) of the businesses surveyed expressed concerns about Pakistan’s potential default.,"KARACHI: Business confidence continued its slide in the first three months of 2023 amid multiple economic crises, according to the latest edition of the Gallup Business Confidence Index released on Friday.
“Last year’s political instability has carried over to combine with various economic crises and exacerbated business insecurity,” the report said.
Wave-9 of the survey is based on interviews with around 520 business owners conducted in the first quarter of 2023 across Pakistan. The exercise consisted of three broad strands, namely the current business situation, the future business situation and the direction of the country. Index values dropped on a quarter-on-quarter basis to an all-time low in each of the three strands.
Two-thirds of the businesses surveyed said they faced bad or worse conditions than before. There was a seven per cent increase in the number of businesses reporting “very bad” business conditions. With a fall of one percentage point from the preceding quarter, the Current Business Situation Score clocked in at -32pc.
The number of businesses saying they’d be worse off in the future increased 7pc from the preceding quarter. About 61pc businesses said their future expectations were “negative” while only 38pc expected the situation to improve. The Future Business Confidence Score worsened by 11 percentage points to -22pc on a quarterly basis.
Perceptions held by the business community about the direction of the country deteriorated from -75pc to -79pc in January-March, with as many as 90pc of the businesses saying the country was headed in the wrong direction.
Inflation remained the “most-cited problem” that most businesses (45pc) would like the government to solve. Compared to the preceding quarter, a higher number of businesses wanted the government to “help with currency depreciation” even though fewer of the same respondents believed the government should provide relief on utility prices.
The survey showed more than half (57pc) of the businesses didn’t carry out any layoffs in the quarter under review. As many as 58pc of the businesses reported raising their average output prices in the last three-month period. Of these, 45pc raised their prices between 20pc and 50pc.
A majority (72pc) of the businesses surveyed expressed concerns about Pakistan’s potential default. Of these, nearly half (49pc) showed a “significantly high concern”. About 17pc of the respondents said they weren’t concerned about the issue at all.
About 44pc of the businesses reported they faced daily loadshedding in the January-March quarter. Of those businesses that reported facing loadshedding, nearly three of every four businesses said they faced four hours or less of power outages every day.

1,Saudis okay $240m for  Mohmand Dam project,ISLAMABAD: Saudi Fund for Development (SFD) on Friday signed an agreement to extend a $240 million loan to Pakistan...,"ISLAMABAD: Saudi Fund for Development (SFD) on Friday signed an agreement to extend a $240 million loan to Pakistan for the construction of the $1.2 billion Mohmand Multipurpose Dam project and help transition towards green energy.
The agreement was signed by the Chief Executive Officer of SFD Sultan Abdulrahman Al-Marshad, and the Federal Secretary for the Ministry of Economic Affairs Dr Kazim Niaz. Saudi Ambassador Nawaf bin Said Al-Malki also witnessed the signing ceremony.
The Ministry of Economic Affairs said the loan agreement showed a strong partnership between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan in achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs) as Mohmand Dam was a major hydropower complex that will contribute to Pakistan’s energy security, increase sustainable water supply for agriculture and human consumption and improve resilience to floods.
The Mohmand Dam project started in 2019 is targeted for completion in November 2024. It is expected to enhance water and food security and improve the standard of living for people living in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where almost 80pc of the population resides in rural areas, boosting the region’s socioeconomic development by creating employment opportunities and reducing poverty levels. The project aligns with SDG-2 (food security), SDG-6 (clean water), and SDG-7 (clean energy) and embodies SDG-17 (partnerships for the goals).
The project, which is co-financed by the SFD, OPEC, Islamic Development Bank, and the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development, is expected to have a significant impact on Pakistan’s energy and water sectors. By using renewable energy sources, the project will generate 800 megawatts of electricity production capacity, contributing to Pakistan’s energy security.
In addition, the storage of 1.6 million cubic meters of water will support sustainable agricultural practices, enable irrigation of 6,773 hectares of new land, and increase the total cropping area from 1,517 hectares to 9,227 hectares in the province, facilitating agricultural activities.
During the agreement signing ceremony, the CEO of SFD emphasised the strong developmental ties between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. The CEO also highlighted the significance of cooperation between development funds, as evidenced by this project. He said this initiative was an extension of SFD’s continued support for development projects and programmes in Pakistan since its inception.
To date, SFD has financed around 41 development projects and programmes in Pakistan, amounting to approximately $1.4bn. In addition, SFD financed oil derivatives worth more than $5.4bn between 
2019 and 2023 to support Pakistan’s economy, this comes as a continuation of the support provided by the Government of Saudi Arabia to build a sustainable economy.
Dr Kazim Niaz expressed his sincere appreciation and gratitude to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for its unwavering support towards the development sectors in Pakistan through the SFD. He said Saudi financing had been bringing about positive developmental impacts on Pakistan and its people. The use of renewable energy would enable sustainable energy as well as water sources, which would enhance water and food security.

2,Bank lending to private sector plunges 74pc,The private sector borrowings plunged by 74.3pc to Rs266.4bn during the first nine months of the current fiscal year.,"KARACHI: The surging interest rate has left no option for the private sector to borrow costly money for running their businesses or plan expansion due an uncertain situation caused by the persistent political and economic instability.
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) data showed that the banks’ advances to the private sector had been declining as the fiscal year is approaching closure. 
The private sector borrowings plunged by 74.3 per cent to Rs266.4 billion during the first nine months of the current fiscal year compared to Rs1,036.6bn in the same period last year.
The steep fall in credit off-take to the private sector was not only because of the record interest rate but also due to persistent political and economic instability. Bankers believe money never goes for risks and the current situation is full of risks.
At the last auction of treasury bills held on April 4, it was visible that banks prefer to park their liquidity in government securities to earn risk-free high profits. 
The government picked Rs2.2 trillion against the target of Rs900bn while the maturity amount was even less than the auction target. 
Banks have been making heavy investments in government papers. More than Rs15tr have been invested in the Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs) so far and over Rs6tr in T-bills. These huge investments make banks profitable each year.
The State Bank under the guidance of the IMF increased the interest rate by 300 basis points in March and 100bps in April taking the policy rate to a record 21pc. The unprecedented CPI-based inflation at 35.5pc in March has worsened the situation as it increased the risk much higher for investments. 
Amid revenue shortfalls, the government is borrowing much more than the auction target to meet its rising expenditures despite strict measures demanded by the IMF. 
For bankers, investing costly money for profit-making ventures looks impossible, particularly in the wake of still rising inflation.
The massive interest rate hikes with short intervals by the SBP have only made the money the costliest ever but the strategy has utterly failed to achieve the core objective of taming inflation.

4,Weekly inflation stays above 44 per cent,"ISLAMABAD: Short-term inflation, based on the Sensitive Price Index (SPI), slightly eased but remained at an ...","ISLAMABAD: Short-term inflation, based on the Sensitive Price Index (SPI), slightly eased but remained at an elevated level of 44.49 per cent for the combined income group on a year-on-year basis for the week ending April 6, data issued by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) showed on Friday.
However, on a week-on-week basis, the SPI recorded an increase of 0.92pc with food items getting costlier, particularly fruits, potatoes and cooking oil in wake of the Ramazan-related demand spiral.
On a year-on-year basis, weekly inflation has stayed above 40pc since  late February. However, after hitting a record high of 46.7pc in the  week ending March 22, it has slightly eased in the previous two weeks.
The SPI is expected to intensify further due to other domestic and international factors, including rupee devaluation, costly petroleum products, hikes in general sales tax and higher electricity and gas tariffs.
Following the export of sugar, the retail price of sugar reached Rs130 per kg in markets, however, sugar’s outflow was eased upon the request of sugar mill owners associated with the incumbent government.
Likewise, the price of 20 kg flour is being sold at Rs3,200 by the retailers, which is higher than its price in rural areas and northern Khyber Pakh­tunkhwa. A similar trend was observed in the prices of cooking oil and vegetable ghee in the past couple of weeks.
Out of 51 items in the SPI basket, prices of 27 items increased while those of 7 items decreased, however, rates of 17 items remained unchanged.
During the week under review, the items whose prices increased the most over the same week a year ago were wheat flour (131.72pc), gas charges for Q1 (108.38pc), diesel (102.84pc), eggs (98.34pc), tea Lipton (97.63pc), rice basmati broken (84.92pc), bananas (82.23pc), petrol (81.17pc), rice Irri-6/9 (80.61pc), pulse moong (68.14pc), potatoes (65.95pc), pulse mash (56.70pc) and onions (55.75pc).
On a week-on-week basis, the biggest change was observed in the prices of chicken (15.87pc), sugar (13.48pc), potatoes (5.11pc), bananas (4.95pc), wheat flour (3.10pc), gur (2.12pc), eggs (1.26pc), milk fresh (1.24pc) and long cloth (1.95pc).
Products whose prices saw the highest decline over the previous week were tomatoes (14.96pc), onions (12.66pc), LPG (3.73pc), pulse gram (1.20pc), vegetable ghee 2.5 Kg (0.71pc), garlic (0.16pc) and mustard oil (0.03pc).
The government has been taking strict measures — hikes in fuel and power tariffs, withdrawal of subsidies, market-based exchange rate and higher taxation — under the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme to generate revenue to bridge the fiscal deficit, which may result in slow economic growth and higher inflation in coming months.
The government has been taking strict measures under IMF conditions that are likely to further cool the 
economy and stoke inflation. The 100bps hike in the policy rate to 21pc, and general sales tax from 17pc to 18pc will further increase retail prices of consumer goods.

Baluchistan Wheels Ltd (BWL) on Friday informed the Pakistan Stock Exchange that it would keep its production activities temporarily suspended on account of non-production days from April 7 till the end of Eidul Fitr holidays due to declining production volumes of assemblers and their dwindling sales.

Separately, Ghandhara Nissan Ltd (GNL) announced a complete plant shutdown from April 10 to May 1 due to extensive upgrading activities in the paint shop.
GNL had kept its plant closed from March 6-10 due to hurdles in the import of raw materials.
On Wednesday night, Pak Arab Refinery Ltd (Parco) temporarily suspended its refinery operations for five days as part of its scheduled maintenance. The refinery, in a press release, said it would resume its operation by April 11 and this maintenance would not affect the supply of diesel and petrol.
Suzuki bikes get costlier
Pak Suzuki Motor Company Ltd (PSMCL) on Friday increased the price of various models of two-wheelers by Rs29,000-46,000 from April 5.
The new price of GD110, GS150, GSX125 and GR150 is Rs322,000, Rs350,000, Rs469,000 and Rs501,000.
Defending the price hike, PSMCL Public Relations Head Shafiq Ahmed Sheikh said the company was passing on a very minimal portion of the adverse impact of high demurrage charges, rising overhead expenses, costly local and imported raw materials, non-opening of LCs due to foreign exchange crisis and rupee devaluation.
