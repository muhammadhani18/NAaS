0,"India can’t amend water treaty on its own, Senate told",Minister proposes separate court to hear constitutional matters.,"ISLAMABAD: The Senate was told on Friday that India could not unilaterally modify the Indus Waters Treaty. 
On India’s move to seek revision of the Indus Waters Treaty, PML-N Senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed said that the issue was linked with the future of the country. He said Pakistan had still not given an effective, solid and bold response over January 25 notice.
Minister for Climate Change Sherry Rehman, while responding to a calling-attention notice in the Senate moved by Leader of the Opposition Dr Shahzad Waseem and others, stressed that the treaty could not be changed until both parties — Pakistan and India — agreed. 
Confirming that Pak­istan had received a vague letter from India on January 25 seeking the revision of the Indus Waters Treaty, she claimed that it had been done by Modi’s government for internal consumption as elections were due in India next year. 

Minister proposes separate court to hear constitutional matters

She said they kept on looking for issues they could introduce in toxic discourse and recalled that the water issue had been raised during the previous elections as well.
She said India had accused Pakistan of violating the Indus Waters Treaty, but there was no clarity on how it had been done. 
“We feel it has been deliberately done to provoke domestic audience,” she remarked. Ms Rehman said the prime minister had been given a briefing while deliberations had also been held on it with the stakeholders, followed by a response to India on April 1.
The minister said: “The Permanent Indus Commi­ssion as defined in the Treaty is the appropriate forum to raise and discuss any concerns. Pak­istan is, therefore, happy to engage on any outstanding issue regarding the treaty at the level of the Permanent Indus Commission.”
Ms Rehman said that Pakistan was not panicking on the issue and was vigilant about its water resources. 
“The Indus Waters Trea­ty, 1960, has survived all kinds of tensions between the two countries and has played a vital role in managing the water resources between India and Pakistan. Pakistan is committed to the treaty and expects India to comply with it,” the minister said.
She said that Pakistan had timely raised objections to the construction of controversial dams, including Baglihar, Kishan Ganga and Ratle, by India on the rivers meant for Pakistan. Ms Rehman said that work was under way to enhance water storage capacity in the country.
She said work was also in progress on Diamer-Bhasha and Mohmand dams while 16 small- and medium-size dams were to be built in Sindh. 
“The reason is that we are too busy fighting among ourselves,” Senator Sayed said, adding that national unity was must to counter India. He said that China during his recent tour had given a message that all political parties should talk for interest of Pakistan and its people by going beyond their party lines and personal political affiliations.
Constitutional court
Another highlight of the day’s proceedings was Minister of State for Law and Justice Shahadat Awan’s proposal to form a separate court to hear constitutional cases, besides a federal Supreme Court for normal cases.
Responding to a calling-attention notice on the issue of pending cases, the minister revealed there were more than 380,436 cases pending in superior courts.
Giving a break-up of the pending cases, he said the Supreme Court had 51,744 cases, the Lahore High Court had 179,425 cases, the Sindh High Court had 85,779 cases, the Peshawar High Court had 41,911 cases, the Balochistan High Court had 4,471 cases and the Islamabad High Court had 17,104 cases. Additionally, the Federal Shariat Court had 103 pending cases, he said.

1,World food prices fall for 12th month running in March: FAO,"“While prices dropped at the global level, they are still very high and continue to increase in domestic markets,"" says FAO.","ROME: The United Nations food agency’s world price index fell in March for a 12th consecutive month, and is now down 20.5 per cent from a record high hit one year ago following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. 
The Food and Agriculture Organisation’s (FAO) price index, which tracks the most globally traded food commodities, averaged 126.9 points last month against 129.7 for February, the agency said on Friday. It was the lowest reading since July 2021. The February reading was originally given as 129.8. 
A combination of ample supplies, subdued import demand and the extension of a deal allowing the safe export of Ukrainian grain via the Black Sea contributed to the drop, FAO said. 
The Rome-based agency said the decline in the index reflected lower prices for cereals, vegetable oils and dairy products, which offset rises in sugar and meat prices. 
“While prices dropped at the global level, they are still very high and continue to increase in domestic markets, posing additional challenges to food security,” Maximo Torero, FAO’s chief economist said in a statement. 
“This is particularly so in net food importing developing countries, with the situation aggravated by the depreciation of their currencies against the U.S. dollar or the euro and a mounting debt burden,” he added. 
The FAO cereal price index fell 5.6pc month-on-month in March, with wheat registering a 7.1pc drop, maize a 4.6pc decline and rice easing 3.2pc. 
Vegetable oils fell 3.0pc, some 47.7pc down on the level the index hit in March 2022, while the dairy index was down 0.8pc. 
By contrast, sugar rose 1.5pc to its highest level since October 2016, hit by concerns over declining production prospects in India, Thailand and China. The meat price index rose by 0.8pc. 
In a separate report on cereals supply and demand, the FAO raised its forecast for world wheat production in 2023, now pegged at 786 million tonnes — 1.3pc below the 2022 level but nonetheless the second largest outturn on record. “Near-record sown areas are expected in Asia, while dry conditions are impacting North Africa and southern Europe,” FAO said.

2,"Israeli army bombards Lebanon, Gaza",Two Israeli sisters killed in West Bank attack,"JERUSALEM: Massive explosions and rocket fire pierced the night sky as Israel bombarded Gaza and Lebanon following rocket fire by Palestinian militants. 
The broadening of the conflict since repressive Israeli police clashed with Palestinians inside Jerusalem’s Al Aqsa mosque drew appeals for restraint from the international community, but the Israeli army vowed it would not allow Palestinian factions to open a new front in Lebanon. 
A barrage of over 30 rockets fired from Lebanon on Thursday marked the biggest escalation since Israel fought a 34-day war with Iran-backed group Hezbollah in 2006. 
Meanwhile, Two Israeli sisters were killed and their mother was seriously wounded in a shooting in the occupied West Bank on Friday.

Two Israeli sisters killed in West Bank attack

The Israeli army said it had launched a manhunt for the perpetrators of Friday’s shooting. It said the women were fired on in a car as they passed through Hamra junction, in the northern part of the Jordan Valley. 
There was no immediate claim of responsibility. 
Oded Revivi, mayor of the illegal West Bank settlement Efrat, confirmed the two dead were sisters, adding that the third woman who was seriously wounded was their mother. 
The attack came after the army carried out air strikes and an artillery bombardment before dawn in response to rocket fire from the Gaza Strip and Lebanon.
In response to Thursday’s rocket fire, Israel “struck targets, including terror infrastructures, belonging to the Hamas terrorist organisation in southern Lebanon”, the army said — the first time Israel has confirmed an attack on Lebanese territory since April 2022. 
Explosions were heard in Lebanon’s Tyre region as well as the Gaza Strip, where Israeli air raids had begun before midnight. At least three blasts were heard in the Tyre area.
Rocket launcher dismantled 
The Lebanese army said it had found and dismantled a multiple rocket launcher in an olive grove in the Marjayoun area near the border, still loaded with six rockets primed to fire at Israel. 
In Gaza, the Israeli army said it had hit two tunnels and “two weapon manufacturing sites” belonging to Hamas “as a response to the security violations of Hamas during the last few days”. 
The army said air defences intercepted 25 rockets on Thursday, while five hit Israeli territory. 
Israel “will not allow the Hamas terrorist organisation to operate from within Lebanon and holds the state of Lebanon responsible for every directed fire emanating from its territory”, it added. 
On Friday, Hezbollah deputy chief Naim Qassem said “the threats and intimidation of the Zionist leaders will lead nowhere”, adding that “the entire axis of resistance” was on alert.

3,Sharmeen to direct Star Wars film,KARACHI: Oscar-winning movie director Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy will become the first woman and person of colour to...,"KARACHI: Oscar-winning movie director Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy will become the first woman and person of colour to direct a film in the Star Wars franchise, which will also see actor Daisy Ridley reprising her role as Rey.
The announcement by Lucasfilm head Kathleen Kennedy came at a Star Wars Celebration event, held in London on Friday, alongside the revelation that at least three new live-action Star Wars films were on the way. Dave Filoni (who helmed The Mandalorian TV series) and James Mangold will be directing two of the films.
Ms Obaid-Chinoy’s project is said to be set 15 years after The Rise of Skywalker — the final film in the third Star Wars trilogy — and will focus on Rey’s character as she builds a new Jedi order.
This isn’t Obaid-Chinoy’s first foray into Hollywood — she also directed several episodes of Ms Marvel, the Disney TV show centring around a Pakistani girl who gains superpowers.
The Academy and Emmy award-winning director is known for documentaries such as Saving Face and A Girl in the River, and The Price of Forgiveness. She is currently involved in directing Paramount’s adaptation of the novel Brilliance, produced by Will Smith.

4,"Saudi Arabia, Oman to hold ceasefire talks with Houthis",RIYADH: Saudi and Omani envoys are planning to visit Yemen’s capital Sanaa next week to negotiate a permanent...,"RIYADH: Saudi and Omani envoys are planning to visit Yemen’s capital Sanaa next week to negotiate a permanent ceasefire deal with Iran-aligned Houthi officials and end an eight-year-old conflict there, two people involved in the talks said. 
The move signals that regional rifts are easing after rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran agreed to restore relations last month following years of hostility and backing opposite sides in Middle Eastern conflicts, including Yemen. 
A visit by Saudi officials to Sanaa is an indication of progress in Oman-mediated talks between the kingdom and the Iran-aligned Houthi movement, which run in parallel to United Nations peace efforts. 
Oman, which shares borders with Yemen, has been trying for years to bridge differences between Yemen’s warring parties, and more broadly between Iran and Saudi Arabia and the United States. A permanent ceasefire in Yemen would mark a milestone in stabilising the Middle East. 
If an agreement is reached, the parties could announce it before Eid holiday starting April 20, the sources said. 
The Saudi and Yemeni governments did not immediately respond to requests for a comment. 
The Houthis, who ousted the internationally recognised government from Sanaa in late 2014, de facto control north 
Yemen and say they are rising up against a corrupt system and foreign aggression. 
They have been fighting against a Saudi-led military alliance since 2015 in a conflict that has killed tens of thousands and left 80 per cent of Yemen’s population dependent on humanitarian aid. 
The discussions are focused on a full reopening of Yemen’s ports and airports, payment of wages for public servants, a rebuilding process and a political transition, the sources said. 
Saudi Arabia restarted its direct talks with the Houthi group last summer after both sides failed to renew a UN-brokered truce deal. 
The UN hopes to resume a peaceful political process which would lead to a transitional unity government, if a ceasefire agreement is reached.

5,India tightens screws on online news with ‘official fact-checkers’,"NEW DELHI: The Modi government has notified norms making it obligatory on “intermediaries” to “not publish,...","NEW DELHI: The Modi government has notified norms making it obligatory on “intermediaries” to “not publish, share or host fake, false or misleading information in respect of any business of the Central government”. The fact-checking unit of the government will identify what is “fake, false or misleading information”, The Wire said on Friday.
The intermediaries are defined as “an intermediary, including social media intermediary and significant social media intermediary”.
The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology’s (Meity) gazette notification modifying the Information Technology rules, 2021, was released on Thursday.
“Government has decided to notify an entity through Meity and that organisation then would be the fact-checker for all aspects of content online and only those content that are related to the government,” Press Trust of India reported minister of state for electronics and IT Rajeev Chandrasekhar as saying.
Internet firms like Google, Facebook and Twitter may lose protection if they fail to remove content identified by the government-notified fact-checker as “false or misleading information”, the minister said.
“We will certainly have an outliner on what the organisation will look like. Whether it will be PIB (Press Information Bureau) fact check and what will be the dos and don’ts. We will certainly have that shared as we notify,” he said.
The notification of these amended rules will “cement the chilling effect on the fundamental right to speech and expression”, particularly on news publishers, journalists, activists and others, said digital rights group Internet Freedom Foundation, quoted by The Wire.
Several opposition parties had raised concerns over the IT Rules’ draft amendments and termed them “highly arbitrary and unilateral”. “This is nothing but silencing the internet, the digital media platforms, and the social media platforms,” a Congress spokesperson told The Wire.

6,Tesla workers shared sensitive images recorded by customer cars,Some of the recordings caught Tesla customers in embarrassing situations.,"LONDON: Tesla Inc assures its millions of electric car owners that their “privacy is and will always be enormously important to us”. The cameras it builds into vehicles to assist driving, it notes on its website, are designed from the ground up to protect your privacy.  
But between 2019 and 2022, groups of Tesla employees privately shared via an internal messaging system sometimes highly invasive videos and images recorded by customers’ car cameras, according to interviews by Reuters with nine former employees.  
Some of the recordings caught Tesla customers in embarrassing situations. One ex-employee described a video of a man approaching a vehicle completely naked. 
Also shared: crashes and road-rage incidents. One crash video in 2021 showed a Tesla driving at high speed in a residential area hitting a child riding a bike, according to another ex-employee. The child flew in one direction, the bike in another. The video spread around a Tesla office in San Mateo, California, via private one-on-one chats, like wildfire, the ex-employee said.  
Other images were more mundane, such as pictures of dogs and funny road signs that employees made into memes by embellishing them with amusing captions or commentary, before posting them in private group chats. While some postings were only shared between two employees, others could be seen by scores of them, according to several ex-employees.  
Tesla states in its online Customer Privacy Notice that its camera recordings remain anonymous and are not linked to “you or your vehicle”. But seven former employees told Reuters the computer programme they used at work could show the location of recordings which potentially could reveal where a Tesla owner lived.  
One ex-employee also said that some recordings appeared to have been made when cars were parked and turned off. Several years ago, Tesla would receive video recordings from its vehicles even when they were off, if owners gave consent. It has since stopped doing so.  
“We could see inside people’s garages and their private properties,” said another former employee. “Let’s say that a Tesla customer had something in their garage that was distinctive, you know, people would post those kinds of things.”  
Tesla didn’t respond to detailed questions sent to the company for this report. 
About three years ago, some employees stumbled upon and shared a video of a unique submersible vehicle parked inside a garage, according to two people who viewed it. Nicknamed Wet Nellie, the white Lotus Esprit sub had been featured in the 1977 James Bond film, The Spy Who Loved Me.  
Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk had bought it for about $968,000 at an auction in 2013. It is not clear whether Musk was aware of the video or that it had been shared. Musk didn’t respond to a request for comment.  
To report this story, Reuters contacted more than 300 former Tesla employees who had worked at the company over the past nine years and were involved in developing its self-driving system. More than a dozen agreed to answer questions, all speaking on condition of anonymity.  
Reuters wasn’t able to obtain any of the shared videos or images, which ex-employees said they hadn’t kept. The news agency also wasn’t able to determine if the practice of sharing recordings, which occurred within some parts of Tesla as recently as last year, continues today or how widespread it was. Some former employees contacted said the only sharing they observed was for legitimate work purposes, such as seeking assistance from colleagues or supervisors.
The sharing of sensitive videos illustrates one of the less-noted  features of artificial intelligence systems: They often require armies  of human beings to help train machines to learn automated tasks such as  driving. 
Since about 2016, Tesla has employed hundreds of people  in Africa and later the United States to label images to help its cars  learn how to recognise pedestrians, street signs, construction vehicles,  garage doors and other objects encountered on the road or at customers  houses. To accomplish that, data labelers were given access to thousands  of videos or images recorded by car cameras that they would view and  identify objects.
