1,"FIA, police restrained from taking adverse action against PTI leader","IHC Justice Aurangzeb seeks report from Pemra on PTI plea against ban on Imran's coverage, says it is ""least step"" to counter violence in such events.","ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Friday restrained the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and Islamabad Police from taking any adverse action against former minister and leader of PTI Murad Saeed and sought details of the cases registered against him so far.
IHC Justice Arbab Mohammad Tahir took up the petition of Saeed.
Petitioner’s counsel Sher Afzal Khan Marwat adopted before the court that the incumbent government had registered cases against hundreds of PTI workers and leaders over their protest against the regime change.
He said that in most of the cases, the complainants were the workers of PML-N.
He pointed out that the interior minister is also hurling threats on PTI leadership and the worst is that the government has withdrawn the security of former Prime Minister Imran Khan and other leaders of PTI.
He requested the court to seek details of the cases pending against Murad Saeed with FIA and police in order to enable him to file pre-arrest bail in the relevant courts.
On the request of the counsel, the court restrained the FIA and police from taking any adverse action against Saeed until the receipt of the details of cases registered against him.
Meanwhile, IHC Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb sought a report from Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) on PTI’s petition against the ban on coverage of Mr Khan on his court appearance.
Faisal Fareed Chaudhry, counsel for the petitioner, adopted before the court that the Pemra’s directive of banning the coverage of Mr Khan is against the political norms.
Justice Aurangzeb remarked that the government was supposed to take measures to counter violence in such events and imposing a ban on coverage was the least step.
The court adjourned further hearing for a fortnight.

2,"Mental health app, helpline launched","ISLAMABAD: The government on Friday announced the launch of Humraaz, a mental health application, along with an...","ISLAMABAD: The government on Friday announced the launch of Humraaz, a mental health application, along with an integrated helpline of 1166. 
“Today Pakistan takes an important step to address and acknowledge mental health,” head of Prime Minister’s Strategic Reforms Sulman Sufi tweeted. 
Describing the phone app as a step that paved way to end mental health stigma, the official explained that mental disorders were highly prevalent worldwide and could often have a detrimental impact on the life of affected individuals, and to date remain mostly under-treated. Although a wide array of evidence-based treatments existed, the majority of individuals with symptoms of mental disorders remained unchecked and untreated, even in high-income economies. A sizeable count of people suffered due to various mental health challenges ranging from mild through medium to severe conditions. 
In a statement, the government said poor mental health may range in severity and type from anxiety and panic attacks to bipolar disorder and depression etc. Apart from structural treatment barriers such as availability, affordability and time constraints, attitudinal factors play an even greater role in non-treatment-seeking behaviour. 
People suffering from these types of disorders and issues look for ways to cope and deal with the challenges associated with such health conditions. They looked for support from others who understood what they were going through.“Unfortunately, not all of them know where to look for help, or even have a clear idea what problem they have. Furthermore, the idea of seeking medical help in case of mental health related issues is so stigmatised in society that people hesitate to reach out to seek advice in this regard.” 
According to Mr Sufi, Humraaz with the integrated helpline was developed in collaboration with Ministry of Health Services, Regulations and Coordination, World Health Organisation (WHO), National Information Technology Board (NITB) and Federal Directorate of Immunisation. 
The initiative aimed to provide consultative services of relevant practitioners/groups for curative purposes to citizens having psychological issues such as depression/self-harming thoughts etc. 
The app is now available in Google and Apple stores and the toll free helpline 1166 is also active.The app will provide one-stop solution to the citizens having depression/self-harming thoughts/other mental health issues.Some of the key features of the app included guided and principle based counseling and psychotherapy sessions, daily activities monitoring, 24/7 connection with professionals, international standard knowledge base, ChatBot (including self-assessment), WhatsApp support, appointment and booking.It also provides support groups of people for help and sharing of experiences, more than 140 psychologists/psychiatrists registered in the initiative, out of which almost 60 plus are psychiatry resident doctors and counselors.Besides booking appointments based on availability/preferred timeslots of the psychologists/psychiatrists, more than 30 government psychologists/psychiatrists were onboard for providing free consultation services to the citizens having mental health concerns and self-harming thoughts.

3,CDA’s auction of kiosks may not sit well with prospective traders,Meeting takes up proposal to give plots on rent to private schools instead of auctioning them,"ISLAMABAD: The initiative to auction off vending points (kiosks) in various locations of the city by Capital Development Authority (CDA) is likely to face strong criticism as small businessmen would not be able to compete with business tycoons during the auction.
The civic agency is all set to auction 200 vending points on May 15, 16 and 17, out of the total 1,800 planned for 10-year lease.
However, officials Dawn spoke to said that this policy instead of promoting small businesses might just make them helpless in before business tycoons.
Resultantly, the small businessmen and unemployed youth will not be able to get any benefit from the scheme.

Meeting takes up proposal to give plots on rent to private schools instead of auctioning them

“There are hundreds of opportunities for big businesses to compete but in these small opportunities consideration should be given to small business owners and the un-employed lower strata of society,” he said.
Another official said: “The idea of having planned vending points is very good. This step will add beauty to Islamabad and it will also end the culture of pick and choose allotment. The project is a great initiative but the mode of their disposal through auction is strange. We support transparency but open auction is not a solution,” he said.
The official said that instead of open auction, the CDA should allot vending points through computerised balloting in transparent a manner under controlled rate.
“There should be controlled prices like Rs500,000 or Rs10,00,000 for small vending points and these sites should be allotted through Nadra balloting to low income groups,” he said. 
Another officer said that under open auction, there are chances that one vending point will be auctioned against millions of rupees, depending upon locations. 
The said vending points will be setup on CDA’s land and Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad (MCI) will dispose them off through auction. After the auction, the CDA is also planning to remove existing kiosks, which are illegitimate. 
“This will be troublesome for poor khokha owners as they will face double action - compete with business tycoons in auction if they want to get planned one, and later face operation against the existing one,” he added.
Last month, the CDA had decided that kiosks should be constructed with a specific design at the sites, which are permissible under Islamabad’s master plan and all kiosks will be leased out after open auctions.
It is relevant to note here that there were over 450 kiosks in Islamabad including licenced ones and illegal, but the MCI after cancelling licences in one go, demolished all of them some years ago.
Later on, many kiosk owners re-constructed their kiosks, but CDA did not own them and since the past few years, owners of kiosks are being informed by CDA that new kiosks with proper designs will be constructed. Sources said that the issue of auction of vending points was also discussed in a pre-board meeting that was held here in CDA’s headquarters.
Besides other issues, the meeting also discussed another controversial policy of leasing out around 150 school plots worth billions of rupees against monthly rent to private school operators. Sources said that in CDA’s land disposal regulations, there is no concept of renting out plots, rather, CDA is supposed to auction the plots. But in a strange move, the CDA’s planning wing proposed that plots should be given to private schools on rent basis. As per CDA, this step will help it move out private schools from residential areas.
It is relevant to note here that private school business is considered one of the best profitable businesses in Islamabad with revenue generated each month through high fees. 
CDA is all set to help these businesses by offering its plots worth billions of rupees on monthly rent.
A few days ago, a board member of CDA said that there is no malafide intention behind this initiative, rather the CDA wants to get rid of non conforming use of residential houses, where private schools are operating, he said.

He said that most of the diseases could be prevented by taking precautionary measures and Pakistan, being a developing country, could hardly afford to fully meet the healthcare needs of its over 220 million population through curative treatments due to limited resources.
The president gave these remarks while chairing the 4th meeting of the Senate of the Health Services Academy (HSA), at Aiwan-e-Sadr. The meeting was attended by the members of the Senate of HSA.
A statement issued here said that during the meeting, the president said that Pakistan needed to make goal-oriented and time-bound plans to improve its public health sector, adding that preventive healthcare should be the priority of the country’s health policy.
He highlighted that some countries had tremendously improved their health sectors by focusing on preventive health and investing in the intellectual development of their human resources.
The meeting was also briefed about the impacts of global warming and climate change which would likely increase the burden of diseases due to rising temperatures. 
The meeting stressed the need for exploring funding options from international donors for research and development in the public health sector.
The statement said that it was also emphasized to develop a resource mobilisation strategy to meet the future financial needs of HSA as well as the healthcare programmes in the country. 
The meeting also underscored the importance of devising a National Plan for Public Health to effectively address the challenges being faced by the country’s health sector.
The meeting endorsed the minutes of the 3rd Senate meeting of the Health Services Academy.

Potohar Organisation for Development Advocacy (Poda) organised an event titled ‘Health for All: SRHR For Women and Girls in Pakistan’ in connection with World Health Day. 
A large number of people representing all walks of life, including university students, health workers, mediapersons, health experts, lady health workers and women representing rural communities participated. 
Poda Executive Director Sameena Nazir said the foundation of a society’s progress was its healthy citizenry. 
She urged the government to increase its annual per capita health budget to ensure citizens’ access to quality healthcare, especially rural women and adolescent girls. 
“We must not forget women and girls’ health and hygiene needs in the Annual Development Plans (ADPs) at the district level because a country’s well-being depends on healthy citizens,” said Ms Nazir. 
Afshan Tehseen, child and human rights activist and former chairperson National Commission on the Rights of Child (NCRC), said investing in health would free the government and communities from unnecessary burden of diseases. 
“There is no specific provision regarding right to health in the constitution of Pakistan. It is our dire need to include right to health provisions, especially for women and girls, in the constitution,” said Poda legal expert Khawaja Zahid. 
Speakers were of the view that access to healthcare facilities for quality sexual and reproductive health needs was the basic right of women and adolescent girls, and guaranteeing this right was the foremost duty of the government.

The visit of the Pakistani business delegation to Ethiopia would be remembered as “Hijra Trade”, he said while calling the initiative “the most successful” in his life.
He said the business community from East African countries had been contacting him since the visit of the trade delegation and evincing interest in promoting trade with Pakistan.
