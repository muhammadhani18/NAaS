0,China simulates Taiwan strikes during drills,"China’s war games sent planes, ships and personnel into “the maritime areas and air space of the Taiwan Strait.","BEIJING: Chinese fighter jets and warships simulated strikes on Taiwan on Sunday as they encircled the island during a second straight day of military drills launched in response to its president meeting the US House speaker. 
The exercises sparked condemnation from Taipei and calls for restraint from Washington, which said it was “monitoring Beijing’s actions closely”. 
Dubbed “Joint Sword”, the three-day operation — which includes rehearsing an encirclement of Taiwan — will run until Monday, the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) Eastern Theatre Command said. 
China’s war games sent planes, ships and personnel into “the maritime areas and air space of the Taiwan Strait, off the northern and southern coasts of the island, and to the island’s east”, the army said as it launched the exercises, engineered to flex Beijing’s military muscles in front of Taiwan and the world. 
A report from state broadcaster CCTV on Sunday said drills had “simulated joint precision strikes against key targets on Taiwan island and surrounding waters”, adding that forces “continued to maintain the situation of closely encircling the island”. 
The write-up went on to say the air force had deployed dozens of aircraft to “fly into the target airspace”, and ground forces had carried out drills for “multi-target precision strikes”. 
Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen immediately denounced the drills, which come after she met US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in California. 
She pledged to work with “the US and other like-minded countries” in the face of “continued authoritarian expansionism”. 
In Washington, a State Department spokesperson said the United States had “consistently urged restraint and no change to the status quo”, but noted it had ample resources to fulfil its security commitments in Asia.

1,Macron says Europe must not be ‘follower’ of US or China on Taiwan,"“We don’t want to get into a bloc versus bloc logic,” the French leader adds.","PARIS: French President Emmanuel Macron said in an interview published on Sunday that Europe must not be a “follower” of either the US or China on Taiwan, saying that the bloc risks entanglement in “crises that aren’t ours”.
His comments risk riling Washington and highlight divisions in the European Union over how to approach China, as the US steps up confrontation with its closest rival and Beijing draws closer to Russia in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine.
“The worst thing would be to think that we Europeans must be followers and adapt ourselves to the American rhythm and a Chinese overreaction,” Macron told media including French business daily Les Echos and Politico as he returned on Friday from a three-day state visit to Beijing.
Citing his prized ideal of EU “strategic autonomy”, the French leader said that “we must be clear where our views overlap with the US, but whether it’s about Ukraine, relations to China or sanctions, we have a European strategy.” “We don’t want to get into a bloc versus bloc logic,” he added, saying Europe “should not be caught up in a disordering of the world and crises that aren’t ours”.
China views democratic, self-ruled Taiwan as part of its territory and has vowed to take it one day, by force if necessary.
Macron discussed Taiwan with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Friday, during a visit in which he was feted but more hawkish EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was kept mostly at arm’s length.
His Elysee Palace office said the talks had been “dense and frank” and that the French president was concerned about “growing tensions in the region” that could lead to “a terrible accident”.

Sunak, 42 — who was just 17 when the Good Fri­day Agreement was agreed, largely ending three decades of violence in the UK province — said it was “an incredible moment in our nation’s history”.
“It was a powerfully rare example of people doing the previously unthinkable to create a better future for Northern Ireland,” the British leader added.
“It is that promise of a better future that we offered to everyone in Northern Ireland that I will be thinking of first and foremost over the coming days.” Sunak will participate in a number of events next week to commemorate the signing on April 10, 1998, of the US-brokered peace accord, agreed between the governments in London and Dublin, and the Northern Irish political parties.
On Tuesday evening, he will welcome Biden to the province, meeting him on the tarmac as the US leader steps off Air Force One for his first visit there as president.
The pair will “undertake a programme of engagements”, including a bilateral meeting, Sunak’s Downing Street office said.

3,Israel hits Syria after rockets fired towards Golan Heights,JERUSALEM: Israeli jets hit Syrian military targets on Sunday in response to rockets launched towards...,"JERUSALEM: Israeli jets hit Syrian military targets on Sunday in response to rockets launched towards Israeli-occupied territory overnight, Israel’s military said, as violence flared again following cross-border exchanges of fire during the week.
State media in Syria reported explosions in the vicinity of the capital Damascus as Israel said its forces continued to hit Syrian territory after six rockets were fired overnight towards the Golan Heights.
Israel said artillery and drone strikes hit the rocket launchers and were followed by airstrikes against a Syrian army compound, military radar systems and artillery posts.
The Israeli military “sees the State of Syria responsible for all activities occurring within its territory and will not allow any attempts to violate Israeli sovereignty,” the Israeli Defence Forces said in a statement.
The Syrian defence ministry said its air defences had responded to the Israeli attacks and intercepted some Israeli missiles. It said no casualties had been reported with only material damage caused by the strikes.
Sirens had sounded earlier near towns in the Golan Heights as rockets were launched from Syrian territory, but no damage or casualties were reported. Israel seized the Golan Heights in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed the 1,200-square-km territory in 1981, a move not recognised by most of the international community.
Only three of the rockets crossed into Israeli-controlled territory, with two falling on open ground and a third intercepted by air defence systems, the military said.
Lebanon-Based Al Mayadeen TV said the rocket salvoes were claimed by Al Quds Brigades, the armed wing of the Iranian-backed Palestinian Islamic Jihad movement.
On Thursday, more than 30 rockets were fired towards Israel from southern Lebanon, drawing cross-border counterstrikes from Israel on sites linked to the Islamist movement Hamas in Lebanon and Gaza.
The cross-border exchanges came amid sharply increased tensions between Israel and Palestinian groups following Israeli police raids in recent days on Al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, which caused outrage across the Arab world.
Israel said the operations were intended to dislodge groups of what police called extremists that had barricaded themselves into the mosque armed with firecrackers and stones.
But the raids, during the month of Ramazan, drew a furious reaction and concern even among Israel’s US allies, with mobile phone footage from inside the mosque showing police beating worshippers.
The site in Jerusalem’s Old City, holy to both Muslims and Jews, who know it as Temple Mount, has been a longstanding flashpoint, notably over the issue of Jewish visitors defying a ban on non-Muslim prayer in the mosque compound.
Clashes there in 2021 helped set off a 10-day war between Israel and Hamas. The recent exchanges of cross-border fire have awakened memories of that conflict.
Despite fears of further violence around the mosque on Saturday, there were no reports of serious disturbances overnight.

4,"Russian strikes kill man, daughter in Ukraine",It is the latest Russian strike on civilian infrastructure in Ukraine as Moscow’s invasion stret­ches into its second year.,"KYIV: A 50-year-old man and his 11-year-old daughter were killed after Russian missiles struck a house in the southeastern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, officials said on Sunday.
It was the latest Russian strike on civilian infrastructure in Ukraine as Moscow’s invasion stret­ches into its second year.
“The enemy carried out a missile attack on Zaporizhzhia and killed another Ukrainian family,” the head of the State Emergency Service, Sergiy Kruk, said on social media.
The girl died in an ambulance, said the head of Zaporizhzhia City Council, Anatoliy Kurtiev.
Rescue workers pulled the girl’s 46-year-old mother alive from under the rubble.
Her elder daughter was not at home when the Russians struck at night, the State Emergency Service said.
Kurtiev said two Russian missiles struck a residential building, adding that windows and roofs were damaged in dozens of neighbouring houses.
The region of Zaporizh­zhia is one of four Ukrainian provinces Russ­ian President Vladimir Putin claims to have annexed last year.

5,An AI-obsessed photographer who tricked Instagram,Jos Avery found a new creative outlet last September: the artificial intelligence programme Midjourney.,"PARIS: Jos Avery was given a camera almost four decades ago, sparking a lifelong fascination with photography. But last September he found a new creative outlet, one that led him to deceive thousands of people: the artificial intelligence programme Midjourney, which generates wild and wonderful images from brief text instructions.
“Soon after starting with Midjourney, I became obsessed with the creative possibilities,” Avery said.
Midjourney and rivals like DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion generate unique pictures by mashing up a vast back catalogue of images they have been “trained” on. For Avery, a 48-year-old software engineer and lawyer by training from Virginia in the United States, Midjourney was liberating.
He said it allowed him to create beautiful art without needing to tackle his own social anxieties. “Then I started to wonder if I could make AI images that could pass for photographs,” he said.
This led to his fateful experiment: He started an Instagram account to house his Midjourney output, without being entirely upfront about the origins of the images.
‘Misleading’
“At the beginning, I don’t think many people thought the images were photographs,” he said. “The eyes and skin were unrealistic.” He fixed these glitches with a dose of Adobe Photoshop, eventually 
populating his Instagram feed with stunning and stark portraits of beautiful — but unreal — people.
More users flocked to his feed, and more of them began to think the images were genuine. “People would ask in the comments about my camera and lens equipment,” he said.
“I’d respond with the equipment I actually use for real photos or equipment I had included as part of the prompt.” He admits his answers were “misleading” since they suggested he had used his gear to create those specific images.
Yet he just got deeper into the deception, spending hours choosing and editing images to boost the realism and deleting earlier efforts that were more obviously AI-generated. His follower count was rising rapidly, so the experiment was a success. But he was struggling to maintain the facade.
Losing sleep
“It grew far beyond my expectations,” Avery said. “The followers and my misleading answers made me feel uneasy, and I had trouble sleeping at night.” He eventually told the specialist website Ars Technica what he had done, added a mention of AI to his Instagram biography and started to give honest answers to his followers.
“I’ve slept a lot better since then,” he said.
Although he did get some abuse — “I had to block about 30 people” — he said the reaction overall was positive, and his Instagram account, now with almost 40,000 followers, is still growing.
These days he populates it with both real photography and clearly labelled images generated from Midjourney. He said the AI tool has been hugely beneficial, helping him discover a love for portrait photography.
But the downside is that once again he isn’t sleeping so well — he stays up all night creating images on Midjourney.

6,Reindeer racing king crowned  in Arctic tournament,INARI: Finland crowned its reindeer racing king on Sunday when 14 reindeer and jockeys competed for the title in the...,"INARI: Finland crowned its reindeer racing king on Sunday when 14 reindeer and jockeys competed for the title in the season’s final match of the increasingly popular Arctic sport.
Wearing skis, helmets and ski goggles and pulled by harnesses attached to the reindeer, Finland’s top 14 competitors raced one kilometre around an oval against the clock in the northern town of Inari.
Reindeer Verneri and jockey Janne Alatalo came out on top in one minute and 35.26 seconds, in mild six-degree Celsius (43 Fahrenheit) weather that made for slushy snow conditions at times.
Reindeer races have been organised in Finland since the 1950s, according to Seppo Koivisto, president of the country’s reindeer racers’ association Suomen Porokilpailijat, which organises competitions. “This is a hobby for those involved in reindeer herding. The animals are usually reindeer herders’ reindeer,” Koivisto said.
Racing reindeer are trained professionally during the winter season. From spring to autumn, they live freely in the forest. Koivisto said the sport has  “developed enormously in recent years”. “There are currently 700 racing reindeer in the register,” he said ahead of the weekend event.
“Two characteristics are sought after in a reindeer. One is physical characteristics, as in structure, and the second is the mental side,” he said.
“No matter how good the physical qualities are, if it doesn’t have the desire to compete, it won’t do anything in the races.” Sunday’s final race of the season, the Poro Cup, attracted several hundred spectators. The races have even caught the eye of tourists.
“The exoticism also seems to be of interest to foreign visitors who happen to be here in Lapland ... and they come and watch the races,” Koivisto said.

7,Pope expresses ‘deep concern’ over unrest in Israeli-held areas,Says the renewed violence “threatens the desired climate of trust and mutual respect needed to resume dialogue”.,"VATICAN CITY: Pope Francis noted his “deep concern” on Sunday over a flare-up in tensions between Israel and Palestinians, delivering an Easter Mass in which he denounced the barriers to peace in the world.
He said the renewed violence “threatens the desired climate of trust and mutual respect needed to resume dialogue”, addressing a crowd of some 100,000 gathered in Saint Peter’s Square.
The Argentinian pontiff, a week after leaving hospital, also cited a string of “stumbling blocks” to peace in the world during his traditional Easter message, making special mention of the war in Ukraine.
“Help the beloved Ukrainian people on their journey towards peace, and shed the light of Easter upon the people of Russia,” he said.
“Comfort the wounded and all those who have lost loved ones because of the war, and grant that prisoners may return safe and sound to their families.” He drew attention to conflicts around the world, from Syria to the Democratic Republic of Congo, and offered prayers for victims of the earthquake in Turkiye and Syria.
This week has seen a surge in violence and unrest between Israel and Palestinians at the same time as the Ramazan, Passover and Easter have coincided.
The pope called for a resumption in dialogue to ensure peace “in the Holy City (of Jerusalem) and in the entire region”.
The 86-year-old pope has returned to his duties after a recent stay in hospital following a bout of bronchitis.
On Saturday evening, he presided over the Vigil mass in Saint Peter’s Basilica in the Vatican, a two-and-a-half-hour ceremony performed before 8,000 people.
On Friday evening however, he stayed away from the Good Friday “Way of the Cross” service as a precaution because of the intense cold, the Vatican said.

8,US teacher fired after having students write own obits,Says his challenge to students was to “get rid of all the fluff and show them what’s important in the world”.,"MIAMI: A high school teacher in the US state of Florida has been fired after he assigned students to write their own obituaries ahead of an active shooter drill.
The Orange County School District said in a statement seen by news media that “a teacher gave an inappropriate assignment about school violence… (and) has been terminated”. It provided no further detail.
Jeffrey Keene, a veteran teacher who was hired at Dr Phillips High School in Orlando in January, told a local Fox subsidiary that he was dismissed without explanation.
An apparent copy of the assignment posted by Keene on Facebook shows that he had asked his upper grade students to imagine, as part of a psychology lesson, that “today was your ‘last day’ alive” and write their own death notices.
He further asked students to think about “why the United States is having so many mass shootings,” and to consider “what kind of ‘positive actions’ can we… take to ‘decrease the number of mass shootings?’”
A disclaimer at the bottom of the assignment says it is in “no way” intended to upset anyone, though Keene said some students apparently complained to school counselors.
Keene, 63, told Fox that his challenge to students was to “get rid of all the fluff and show them what’s important in the world”.
“If you can’t talk real to (the students), then what’s happening in this environment?” Keene asked. “In my mind, I’ve done nothing wrong.”
He told Fox that he planned to appeal the decision, though as a probationary teacher not yet a member of the teachers’ union he has less leverage to do so.
Orlando was the site of one of the country’s deadliest mass shootings — the June 2016 assault by a 29-year-old gunman at the Pulse nightclub that killed 49 people.
One of the worst US school shootings occurred a few hours’ drive south, in the Miami suburb of Parkland, when a 19-year-old shooter killed 17 people in 2018.
Gun violence — and what to do about it — is a deeply divisive issue in the United States. Two state legislators in Tennessee were recently expelled from the assembly after interrupting debate to demand gun control measures.

9,Iranian delegation set to visit Saudi Arabia this week,The two countries have pledged to bring back security and stability to the turbulent Gulf.,"TEHRAN: Iran’s foreign ministry said on Sunday a delegation will visit Saudi Arabia by Friday to pave the way for reopening its diplomatic missions there following a similar move by Riyadh.
The announcement comes a day after a Saudi delegation arrived in Tehran on a similar diplomatic trip, and follows a historic meeting between the two Gulf countries’ foreign ministers in China.
“We are expecting a foreign ministry delegation to visit Saudi Arabia” by Friday, Deputy Foreign Minister Alireza Enayati said in an interview with state television.
“Two separate delegations will go to Riyadh and Jeddah”, ahead of reopening Iran’s embassy and consulate respectively.

The two countries have pledged to bring back security and stability to the turbulent Gulf

Saudi Arabia severed relations with Iran in January 2016, after its embassy in Tehran and consulate in the north-western city of Mashhad were attacked by protesters demonstrating over Riyadh’s execution of cleric Nimr al-Nimr.
Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and his Saudi counterpart Prince Faisal bin Farhan met in the Chinese capital on Thursday after Tehran and Riyadh agreed last month to restore diplomatic ties.
In a joint statement, the ministers pledged to bring back security and stability to the turbulent Gulf.
Iran and Saudi Arabia have backed rival sides in conflict zones across the region, including in Yemen.
Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi has been invited by Saudi King Salman to Riyadh, a trip planned to take place after Ramazan.
Riyadh leads a military coalition that supports the internationally recognised government in the Arabian Peninsula country, while Tehran backs the Houthi rebels who control the capital Sanaa and large areas of the north.
The two Middle East powerhouses had held several rounds of dialogue in Iraq and Oman before reaching the agreement in Beijing, negotiated over five days between Iran’s secretary of the Supreme National Security Council Ali Shamkhani and his Saudi counterpart Musaad bin Mohammad Al-Aiban.

10,Worshippers celebrate in Jerusalem amid violence,"Israel has recently struck targets in Gaza, Lebanon and most recently Syria.","JERUSALEM: Thou­sands of worshippers held tense celebrations in Jerusalem on Sunday, as Christian Easter coincided with Jewish Pass­over and Ramazan, amid a surge in violence in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 
Israel has since struck targets in Gaza, Lebanon and most recently Syria in response to rocket fire mostly blamed on Pales­tinian militants, while separate attacks in the West Bank and Tel Aviv killed three people, including an Italian tourist. 
On Sunday, pilgrims crowded into the narrow alleyways of Jerusalem’s Old City, flanked by heavily-armed Israeli security forces deployed following the recent deadly attacks. 
Churchgoers were ushered through the courtyard of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, built on the site where Christians believe Jesus was crucified, buried and resurrected. 
“[I had] some doubt, taking into consideration recent events, but still I decided to go,” said 50-year-old Paulius Majauskas, visiting from Lithuania. 
Near the church, thousands of Jewish pilgrims gathered at the Western Wall for the traditional priestly blessing of Passover. Judy Green, 60, said the blessing was “beautiful, very uplifting” at the Western Wall, the holiest place where Jews can pray. 
The Western Wall lies in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem and sits below the Temple Mount, the most sacred site to Jews, known to Muslims as Al-Haram al-Sharif.
The raised compound is home to Al Aqsa mosque, the third-holiest site in Islam and the focal point for Ramazan celebrations.

11,Tesla to build battery plant in Shanghai,"The factory, which will have an initial capacity of 10,000 Megapack units per year, is expected to “start production in the second quarter of 2024”.","SHANGHAI: Tesla will build a new facility in Shanghai to make its Megapack batteries, Chinese state media reported on Sunday.
The factory, which will have an initial capacity of 10,000 Megapack units per year, is expected to  “start production in the second quarter of 2024”, according to the Xinhua News Agency.
The US electric car maker says its Megapacks are intended to store energy and stabilise supply for power grids, with each unit able to store more than three megawatt-hours of power.
The plant will be Tesla’s second factory in the Chinese city after its massive Shanghai Gigafactory, which broke ground in 2019. Lu Yu, a local official, said the new battery factory was expected to create an  “industrial cluster” worth more than $14 billion, according to Xinhua. 
The announcement comes after Tesla chief Elon Musk presented a vague but ambitious plan to investors to turbocharge growth.
Tesla has hit its stride after years of losses, scoring an impressive string of earnings records as it has added factories and ramped up production.

12,Saudi team in Yemen for peace talks with Houthis,SANAA: A Saudi delegation was in Yemen’s capital on Sunday to negotiate a potential new truce with the Iran-backed...,"SANAA: A Saudi delegation was in Yemen’s capital on Sunday to negotiate a potential new truce with the Iran-backed Houthi rebels who control the city, diplomats said, as Riyadh sought a way out of the war. 
The Saudi officials are “in Sanaa to discuss moving forward to create peace in Yemen,” said a Yemeni diplomat based in the Gulf region, information that was confirmed by a second diplomat. 
Saudi officials did not respond to requests for comment. 
The delegation’s arrival comes roughly a month after China helped broker a surprise rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran, fuelling hopes for progress on ending the Yemen conflict that has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. 
The top Saudi and Iranian diplomats met in Beijing on Thursday, pledging to work together to bring “security and stability” to their turbulent region. 
Omani mediators arrived in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, on Saturday. 
The Houthis seized the city in 2014, triggering the conflict with the internationally recognised government which has been backed for eight years by a military coalition led by Riyadh. 
A truce announced roughly a year ago has significantly reduced active hostilities within Yemen, and is still largely respected even though it officially expired in October. 
A Yemeni government source, on condition of anonymity, said on Saturday that the Saudis and Houthis had agreed in principle on a six-month truce to pave the way for three months of talks on establishing a two-year “transition” for the war-torn country. 
The deal is expected to fulfil key Houthi goals, including paying salaries of civil servants in Houthi-controlled areas and lifting operational restrictions on Houthi-controlled airports and ports. 
Also on Saturday, the head of the Houthis’ prisoners of war committee told rebel media that 13 prisoners freed by the Saudis had arrived in Sanaa, in exchange for one Saudi released earlier. 
Saudi officials have not commented on the report. 
In early March, the United Nations confirmed that the rebels and Yemen’s internationally recognised government had agreed to exchange more than 880 prisoners. 
‘Exhausted from the war’ 
Sanaa residents said on Sunday that they hoped for a breakthrough that would go beyond a Saudi exit, stressing the need for a political resolution among their country’s warring parties. 
“The visit of a Saudi delegation to Sanaa bodes well. We want the war to end. We are tired,” said 23-year-old Ali Hussein. 
Abd al-Salam Shamir, 29, said: “The country is exhausted from the war, and we want all politicians to be one hand now in building Yemen.” 
A 46-year-old teacher in the port city of Hodeida, who gave his name as Mansour, bemoaned the heavy economic toll of the fighting. Like other civil servants in Houthi-controlled zones, Mansour, who declined to give his surname, has not received his salary in seven years. 
“War is not just rockets and missiles, it also means the deterioration of our economic situation,” he said. 
As talks on Yemen appeared to make progress, the United States said it had sent a nuclear-powered guided-missile submarine into the Suez Canal in recent days.

13,US Justice Dept opens probe into leak of secret documents,Israel rejects claim Mossad backed protests against overhaul of judiciary.,"WASHINGTON: The US Department of Justice on Saturday said it has begun an investigation into a trove of leaked US documents, many related to Ukraine, that have spread to the internet.
The breach appears to include assessments and secret intelligence reports that touch not only on Ukraine and Russia but also highly sensitive analyses of US allies.
“We have been in communication with the Department of Defence related to this matter and have begun an investigation,” a Justice Department spokesperson said.
A steady drip of dozens of leaked documents and slides have made their way onto Twitter, Telegram, Discord and other social media and chat sites in recent days, and new documents continue to surface.

Israel rejects claim Mossad backed protests against overhaul of judiciary

The Pentagon said on Friday it was “actively reviewing the matter” and that it had formally referred the apparent breach to the Justice Department.
US officials told the Washington Post that some documents appeared to be manipulated but many were consistent with CIA World Intelligence Review reports that are shared at high levels within the White House, Pentagon and State Department.
Defence analysts say any breach of internal classified US documents would be both damaging and potentially embarrassing.
In addition, the leak would prove valuable to Moscow by showing how deep US intelligence has penetrated parts of the Russian military apparatus, US media said.
Other documents include apparent information about internal debate within the governments of US allies.
Issues raised’
On Sunday, a South Korean presidential official said, South Korea is aware of news reports about a leak of several classified US military documents and it plans to discuss “issues raised” as a result of the leak with the United States.
One of the leaked documents, showed details about internal discussions among top South Korean top officials about US pressure on Seoul to help supply weapons to Ukraine, and its policy of not doing so.
The document, which does not appear to have a date on it, said that South Korea had agreed to sell artillery shells to help the United States replenish its stockpiles, insisting that the “end user” should be the US military. But internally, top South Korean officials were worried that the United States would divert them to Ukraine.
The report was based in part on signals intelligence, which suggests that the United States had been spying on one of its most important South Korean allies.
The South Korean presidential official, speaking to reporters, declined to respond to questions about US spying or to confirm any details from the leaked documents.
Asked if South Korea planned to lodge a protest or demand an explanation from the United States, the official, who declined to be identified, said the government would review precedents and cases involving other countries.
South Korea has signed major deals providing hundreds of tanks, aircraft and other weapons to Nato member Poland since Russia invaded Ukraine. But President Yoon Suk Yeol has said that a South Korean law that forbids supplying weapons to countries engaged in conflict makes it difficult to send arms to Ukraine.
The South Korean official said there was no change to South Korea’s policy.
Yoon is scheduled to meet US President Joe Biden on April 26 during a state visit to Washington.
Israel’s government rejected claims raised in documents that leaders of its foreign intelligence service Mossad had supported nationwide protests against a proposed overhaul of Israel’s judiciary.
The New York Times on Saturday published that Mossad leadership had encouraged its staff and Israeli citizens to join the mass protests.
The office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that the report was “mendacious and without any foundation whatsoever”. “The Mossad and its senior officials did not and do not encourage agency personnel to join the demonstrations against the government, political demonstrations or any political activity,” it said.
Netanyahu’s overhaul plan has sparked unprecedented public anger since his coalition of hard-right and religious parties came to power late last year, and has also caused alarm among Israel’s Western allies.
The proposed legislation would enable parliament to override Supreme Court decisions and hold control over judicial appointments.
After weeks of intensifying demonstrations, Netanyahu in late March relented and said he would delay the contested reforms to allow for compromise talks with opposition parties.
