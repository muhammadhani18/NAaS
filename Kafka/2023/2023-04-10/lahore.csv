2,Punjab notes: Less aggressive world? Let her lead,One witnesses an unending phenomenon in human evolution; aggression. Aggression is seemingly an essential component...,"One witnesses an unending phenomenon in human evolution; aggression.
Aggression is seemingly an essential component of survival strategy in animal kingdom where we came from. It is a means to ensure access to food, territory, safety and protection of offspring, among other things. One way to defend is that what is worth defending is to be defended with all the resources at one’s disposal. Another choice is to flee and find another sanctuary with or without putting up a fight. Both the manners of defence are employed by animals, even by the powerful and ferocious.
A group of animals attacked by a group of different species first defends its territory and its members with all its might. If it cannot ward off the danger by repulsing the assault, it gets disabled or killed or it simply runs away if possible. If you watch footage or videos coming from animal parks, wildlife sanctuaries and reserves from anywhere, you cannot fail to note the following points: one, among mammals male is larger in its built and stronger than female. Two, it’s aggressive and dominant (Hyenas are an exception). Three, main responsibility of defence is on its shoulders and most of the time it does the fighting.
The fight can be inter-group and intra-group. Inter-group fight is usually about territory. Since resources are not limitless, animals at certain point feel compelled to go out in search of what we metaphorically call greener pastures. But no greener pasture remains unoccupied. So the wandering ones have to take on the settled ones in order to survive and the settled ones have to defend what they already have with all the ferocity they are naturally gifted with. The result is the migration or destruction of those who lose the fight. On both sides males lead their troops and do the battle.
Intra-group fight is less nasty but can be cruel at times. It’s mostly done by males to have dominance which usually appears in the form of having unfettered access to food and mating. One can see spectacular brawls between males in mating season. This is not to say that females in the animal world are totally devoid of aggression. They are generally not aggressive but they can be in certain situations. They can be ruthlessly aggressive if and when there is a perception of threat to their progeny. In short among animals display of aggressive behavour is a means of communication regarding food, territory, mating rights and threatening situations. It’s much more pronounced in males than females.
Interestingly, the situation is not much different when we look at the world of humans. The reason is - whether we like it or not - we are part of animal world and are ruled by the natural laws which rule it. Men are physically stronger than women. This crucial difference has led to an unsavoury situation which challenges what they have achieved in a long evolutionary process; humanisation.
Humanisation is organically linked with the development of human brain and its resultant product, human consciousness. Human consciousness cannot at present at least defy the natural laws that govern all the living creatures; they are born, have a certain span of life and then die. What it can defy or redefine is the relationship of humans with one another by going beyond what is dictated merely by instincts. Such an ability is shown by the superstructure we have built on the base of our material life; human values. The moral concept of equality and dignity of a person, for example, cannot be gender-based if we as humans have gone beyond the principle of might.
So far we humans have been able to ward off the external threat that can create conditions of our dying out as a species. But the internal threat remains a potent source of unrelenting anxiety. It’s nothing other than human aggression which eventually leads to violence that looms large in all our activities. It emanates from the dark recesses of male psyche partly created by nature but more so by socio-economic and cultural and moral institutions premised on the primacy of the male. The primacy of the male is nourished by aggression or threat of aggression locally and globally. Locally it appears as exploitation and suppression of the powerless and women and globally it is shown by powerful nations/ countries in acts of covert and overt wars waged against the weak nations in pursuit of dominance. All such agendas are set by men who seem to be perpetually in power. Imagine if we reverse the roles; women are in charge of setting the agenda and men are made responsible for its execution. Will we see less aggression or face less violence on the face of earth? Surely we will. Women can be aggressive, even violent but to a much less degree. Their inherent sense of self-preservation is stronger than their instinct of aggression. This is the gift bestowed on them by nature for being mothers. Those who give birth are endowed with the natural art of protecting life. Remember their great contribution through peaceful activities to human development and welfare? It was the introduction of agriculture in the era when men were out hunting. It was not aggression but labour done with care that has provided us with a reliable source of food supply. Notwithstanding the residue of aggression from primeval forests that women carry, they are better suited to lead us to a less violent tomorrow. This tomorrow has to be tomorrow, not a hazy point in the distant future.
What’s our today? A perennially present moment ravaged by aggression which in the words of poet Bulleh Shah, can ‘open the gate of hell’. A foolish act by violent men can rip apart the gate of hell unleashing what is beyond our wildest dreams. “Hatred, even of meanness contorts the features / Anger, even against injustice makes the voice hoarse,” says poet Brecht. If hatred and anger at individual level are that dehumanising, imagine what would happen if the powerful covetous men full of hatred and anger fiddling with nuclear buttons push them! Let the goddess Durga stop them with her ten hands. What is urgently needed is not powerful men but wisely caring women who could lead us to a peaceful future where our children are not used as cannon fodder for territorial acquisition or corporate profit or maintenance of what is patently unjust for the dispossessed and the vulnerable. — soofi01@hotmail.com

He told reporters on Sunday that undemocratic forces got an opportunity to come into power as a result of clashes among political parties in the past.
He said that all stakeholders should come on the same page for conducting transparent elections and dialogue among political forces is a must to put the country on a truly democratic path.
He regretted that for the first time in the history of the country, there is an open war ongoing between the parliament and the court. 
Mr Haq said that the national institutions have become controversial and are badly divided, fights among the ruling parties are not ending and this fight or disagreement is not for any national or public agenda but for power.
He said that there is no shortage of resources in the country. The problem is their unfair distribution, corruption and mismanagement. 
He said the elite, two percent of the country’s population, has usurped the resources of 98 percent of the people as the rulers are not ready to reduce their protocol and privileges.
He said the federal cabinet of the debt-ridden country consists of 85 members.
The JI leader said that all countries of South Asia have surpassed Pakistan, while inflation in the country has reached its historical peak and the situation has come to a point that in the last few days, 20 people lost their lives for a bag of flour.
Due to the incompetence of the current and previous governments, every sector of the economy suffered disaster, businessmen are getting calls for extortion and kidnapping for ransom, but the rulers were asleep, he said.

8,HEC workshops on varsities’ financial autonomy,"LAHORE: Higher Education Commission (HEC), Pakistan, under Higher Education Development in Pakistan (HEDP) project,...","LAHORE: Higher Education Commission (HEC), Pakistan, under Higher Education Development in Pakistan (HEDP) project, conducted two extensive capacity-building workshops for public sector universities on financial autonomy in Lahore and Karachi.
Over 45 senior finance officials, including treasurers and registrars from various public sector higher education institutions (HEIs) attended the workshops.
HEDP has already trained more than 100 participants from different institutions in the last three years.
The workshop in Lahore was attended by around 25 registrars of public sector universities and their staff from across the country, including federal capital, Azad Jammu & Kashmir, Sindh, Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.  
The key thematic areas of the training included the features of the framework for financial autonomy, better financial management, improvement in the governance of public sector universities, and practical illustrations for implementation of the framework.
The allocation of public funds for the higher education sector in Pakistan remains low compared to international standards, owing to competing demands from other sectors.
The HEC is thus encouraging public sector higher education institutions to enhance the revenues from non-traditional sources. It is also one of the key development objectives of the HEDP project, where the governance of the higher education sector is to be strengthened by supporting the financial autonomy of universities.
After consultations with around 100 institutions across Pakistan, a framework for revenue enhancement and fund generation for public sector universities was developed.
In the collective brainstorming, the programme members suggested automating the processes in the universities and the availability of dashboards for the vice chancellors and other administrative members to review the financial status online.
The training is led by HEDP Financial Management Specialist Mr Khawaja Zahid, in collaboration with the financial experts who were engaged to conduct different sessions during the workshop.

The four-day visual art workshop would be conducted by noted calligrapher Irfan Ahmed. The workshop is being organised in connection with the month of Ramazan.
Calligraphy has a special place in Islamic civilisation and culture. The previous calligraphy workshop held at Alhamra Cultural Complex, Gaddafi Stadium, remained a successful experience for the council as the artworks produced by the young artistes in that workshop were of great substance.
There will be a good number of participants in the workshop being held at Alhamra Cultural Complex, The Mall. Whatever works the participants would produce during the four-day workshop would be put on display in an exhibition to be held at the conclusion of the visual art activity. 
The council; however, has asked the participants to bring their own material to participate in the workshop such as canvas, pen and paints.

10,Govt comes up with plan to curb sugar smuggling,Official says check-posts on borders with other provinces are being made effective.,"LAHORE: As rates of white sugar have soared up apparently because of smuggling of the sweetener with the advent of Ramazan, the Punjab government has decided to devise a mechanism with the help of other provinces and local sugar mills to check the menace.
Punjab Food Secretary and Cane Commissioner Muhammad Zaman Wattoo says for hauling of sugar from Punjab to other provinces a permit issued by the district administration concerned will be mandatory.
He says check-posts on borders with other provinces are being made effective.
A spokesperson for the Customs says that they have foiled bids to smuggle out of the country at least 848 tonnes of sugar during the last two weeks.
Mr Wattoo says a crackdown has been launched against hoarders in the province.
He claims that so far 46,000 bags of sweetener have been recovered from different hoarders in Punjab and raids are being conducted on many more storages on receiving secret information.
He says that cases are being registered against the accused under the Prevention of Speculation in Essential Commodities Act 2021.
Penalty under the law is a minimum of six months jail term and fine not less than Rs100,000.
The Economic Coordination Committee had on Jan 3 allowed the export of 250,000 million tonnes of sugar when the sweetener was available at an average of Rs93 per kg across the country.
But, sources say at least 0.4m tonnes of the commodity had so far been exported and thus its local rates shot up to Rs130 per kg and the sugar mills pocketed Rs115 billion extra in the process.
PFA: The Punjab Food Authority (PFA) is carrying out inspections of food points to prevent adulteration and the sale of substandard food, thus ensuring the provision of healthy and safe food to the people during Ramazan.
The food safety teams examined more than 100 food points, such as production units, hotels, dairy shops, restaurants, general stores, and others. As a result of the inspections, the PFA stopped the production of two food points, penalised 18 food business operators with hefty fines, and served warning notices to 82 eateries for improvement. In addition, 3,050 litres of substandard milk were discarded.
The PFA took action against those who did not take proper measures to control insects, used substandard ingredients in food, had poor hygiene conditions, and failed to present the necessary records to the raiding teams. Furthermore, the workers of the food points did not have medical certificates.
The PFA has urged the public to cooperate by reporting any counterfeit food items or practices to the authority. The public can call the 1223 helpline or post complaints on the PFA’s social media accounts.

While it is not a perfect document, the 1973 Constitution has played a pivotal role in shaping the country’s democratic system and federal character, and in upholding the fundamental rights of its citizens.
The moral worth of a country’s constitution lies in its ability to put in place a structure of government that defines limits to the exercise of authority by institutions of the state, and to lay down the rights, obligations and attendant principles that must be drawn upon when interpreting the law.
In this sense, the 1973 Constitution was significant in recognising and guaranteeing certain basic rights to all citizens, regardless of their religion, race or gender. 
Perhaps most significantly, the 18th Amendment to the Constitution, passed in 2010, is a testament to the resilience and evolution of Pakistan’s democratic system. 
It devolved greater powers to the provinces, transferred key powers from the president to the prime minister and the Parliament, and ensured greater financial autonomy for the provinces.
In a time fraught with political discord, HRCP calls on all political stakeholders and citizens to rally behind the shared values of the 1973 Constitution.
