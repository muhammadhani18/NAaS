0,Footprints: The line for a square meal,The nobility of the government’s initiative is lost on those who have to wait endlessly in line.,"IT is an overcast day in the capital as I make my way to G-11; where I have been reliably told I will find what I am looking for. Then again, it isn’t hard to find a neighbourhood wh­ere free flour distribution centres have been established. 
That ubiquitous, unm­ar­ked awning — known locally as a tamboo — usually seen with a truck parked at one end and a queue snaking out the other, is a dead giveaway. 
Aimed at providing the basic necessity to around 100 million people in Punjab, Khyber Pakh­tunkhwa, and the federal capital territory, the programme was initiated on the first of Ramazan and is expected to continue for another few days, until the 25th of the holy month. 
The idea, though well intentioned — essential too, some may argue — has had its share of bad press. Disorder and stampedes during distribution have led to nearly a dozen deaths countrywide. 
But now that the scheme is nearing its end, I thought it pertinent to examine how far things had come, and whether the intended beneficiaries of the programme — the most impoverished of households — have benefited from it.
I chose to visit two distribution points; one in the aforementioned Islamabad locality, and the mega centre established at the cricket stadium in Rawalpindi. 
As I sized up the people lined up to receive the handout, I noticed that they were not just those who live below the poverty line. There were people from across different income groups; blue- and white-collar workers, who were finding it hard to cope with record levels of inflation on their meagre salaries. 
The distribution point in the capital was a run-of-the-mill affair; there were seats for women and the elderly, while everyone else had to wait in line. There were only two, gender segregated counters, with the women’s one being a bit overcrowded. First, one had to submit their identity card at the counter, where staff entered it into an app to verify the eligibility of the candidate with the Nadra database. Once eligibility was confirmed, a slip would be handed over to the distribution staff, who would hand over as many bags as the system authorized them to. 
Although this wasn’t a massive operation (the centre distributed around 2,000 bags per day), an excise official who was managing the distribution centre, told me that more than 70 personnel, including police, volunteers and district administration staff are deployed at the centre from 6am to 5pm. Although the dedication of these officials is hardly in doubt, it is a fact that lines do become painstakingly long, especially for women who have come to the distribution point with their children, or are pregnant. This can be a problem, especially for those working as labourers, domestic or otherwise, who cannot afford to spend so much of their day away from work. 
By contrast, the mega centre in Rawalpindi seemed like a well-oiled machine. Equipped with 40 counters, this venue seemed on a sunny day to be far more suited to the purpose, and official estimates put the number of bags handed out here every day at around 25,000. 
As was to be expected, around 100 personnel, mostly from the district administration, were performing their duties here. According to the assistant commissioner on site, the centre worked round the clock. 
The 40 counters are operated by more than 60 personnel, while over 200 police personnel, including women police, were deployed at the centre in three shifts across 24 hours.  
But while those waiting in line were glad to be receiving the handout, the overwhelming response I got was from people calling on the government to make wheat flour more affordable, so that everyone could purchase it. Indeed, the nobility of the government’s initiative is lost on those who have to wait endlessly in line.
I even met a Railways employee who openly confessed that it was impossible to make ends meet on what he made. But he and others like him all demanded that rather than a ration-style handout, people should be allowed the dignity of going to the shops and buying subsidised flour for themselves. 
Mussarat Bibi, a pregnant woman who had come to the distribution centre on foot said that while she was happy to take the free flour to feed her family of ten, it would be great if the government cut down the price of flour available in the market after Ramazan, so even the poor could at least afford to eat.
This resonated with me; the inflation graph seems unrelenting and once the free flour scheme ends with the close of Ramazan, what will become of the people who have come to rely on the government-provided flour? A normal 15kg bag of flour, which used to cost around Rs1,500 not too long ago, is now priced well over Rs3,000, and even then is seldom found in stock at your corner grocery shop.
Another question raised about the scheme was regarding the quality of the flour being provided for free. People I spoke to, however, said that after some teething issues at the beginning, the quality of flour being handed out had generally improved and was good enough for consumption.
But my lasting takeaway from this experience has been my puzzlement over the cost of the exercise. Every day, we are told of the economic crisis facing the country and the need for austerity. But then, even when it needs to implement a programme to help out the neediest segments of society, the government has to deploy an untold number of resources, taking away hundreds of officials from their regular duties at police stations, hospitals and schools and placing them at flour distribution points. 
All of this makes me wonder; there must have been a better, more efficient way to do this.

1,Political parties concerned over new military operation,"Mohsin Dawar says govt, security forces have lost public trust.","PESHAWAR: Political parties on both sides of the aisle have voiced their opposition to a possible military operation to root out militancy.
On Friday, the top civil and military leadership reaffirmed their commitment to thwart terrorism threats and vowed to relaunch the National Action Plan (NAP) within 15 days to crush militants reportedly coming in from Afghanistan.
The decisions were made at the National Security Committee (NSC) meeting, which the government said was in continuation of a previous meeting convened after a militant attack inside Peshawar’s police headquarters in January, in which 86 people, mostly police officials, were martyred.
Political parties, including allies of the federal government, however, have expressed their concerns over the possible military offensive against militants, with most saying that those who brought back the militants should be brought to justice before launching an offensive against militants.

Mohsin Dawar says govt, security forces have lost public trust

An ally of the federal government, the National Democratic Movement (NDM), said the government had lost public trust.
“They [government and security forces] have lost public trust. People don’t believe them any more even if they launch 100 military operations against militants,” MNA Mohsin Dawar, the NDM’s chairman, told Dawn.
He said that “only cropping won’t work”, and the militants’ leadership should also be eliminated.
Mr Dawar questioned that there was no space for talks with the militants in the initially agreed NAP. Still, talks were initiated by the previous government and they got matured during this incumbent government’s tenure, he said.
He said that a complete shift in the government’s Afghan policy was required. “The government supports the Afghan Taliban, who support the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP),” he claimed.
In a statement issued on Saturday, the NDM said the news emerging from the NSC meeting had created “serious concern among Pashtuns”.
The NSC meeting, the party said, had talked about starting a military operation “without going after the root cause of terrorism, Afghan policy and Project Taliban”, which meant “going back to the sham operations from 2007 to 2014 and the policy of good Taliban and bad Taliban”.
It said Pakhtuns had already suff­ered death, destruction and dis­p­lace­ment on a large scale and “they are not going to put up with it now”.
“The NSC meeting has mentioned in a passing way the mistake of the previous government in allowing TTP to enter [Khyber] Pakhtunkhwa. This is a mistake which has led to the deaths of hundreds of people, both civilians and security personnel,” it said.
“The question is that in a country where elected prime ministers can be put on trial for far minor allegations, why can’t the security tsars be arraigned before a tribunal for such a huge security breach? Why not proper accountability of players responsible for the security lapses?” it asked.
Aimal Wali Khan, provincial president of the Awami National Party (ANP), said that any operation against militants would face resistance until and unless those who brought the militants back were brought to justice.
Mr Khan stated that the “facilitators” including President Dr Arif Alvi, the former prime minister Imran Khan, former KP chief minister Mahmood Khan, former spymaster Faiz Hameed and former KP cabinet member Barrister Muha­mmad Ali Saif should be immediately arrested and asked to locate the areas where the militants were rehabilitated.
“The facilitators [those who brought back the Taliban to Pakistan] should be brought to justice before any decision on a fresh military offensive against militants,” he said in a statement issued on Sunday.
Jamaat-i-Islami also staged a demonstration in the South Waziristan district on Sunday against a possible military operation.
