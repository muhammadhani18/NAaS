1,"‘Maladministration’ hallmark of local administration, residents complain","Twin cities witness rise in overpricing, traffic violations, crime rate","ISLAMABAD: People who remember Shehbaz Sharif as a “good administrator” during his stint as the chief minister of Punjab for over a decade have been waiting for more than a year for the premier’s intervention to address rampant maladministration and unbridled price hike currently plaguing the twin cities.
Along with an increase in beggary and traffic congestion, these problems have added to the miseries of people already hit by unprecedented inflation due devaluation of the Pakistani rupee against the US dollar.
A few years ago, people witnessed raids by magistrates and assistant commissioners on wholesale and retail markets daily wherein heavy fines were imposed and shopkeepers were arrested for selling items at exorbitant rates besides hoarding.
That was a routine exercise of the local administration to keep a strict check on prices of essential items through district and town-level price control committees that brought stability to the prices of food items.

Twin cities witness rise in overpricing, traffic violations, crime rate

At present, it is believed that the current political impasse between the ruling alliance led by Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) is not giving the premier much time to address people’s sufferings.
In addition to this, local administrations have been acting like silent spectators since the PTI came into power in 2018, and the attitude remains the same even to this day -- a year after the ouster of the PTI by the PML-N.
Prices
No check on the prices of food items is a common complaint against the current government. The district administrations in Islamabad and Rawalpindi, however, claimed that they were keeping a strict check on the prices in the markets. Ground realities, however, speak otherwise.
A market survey revealed that milkmen had increased prices of dairy items by Rs5 in Ramazan and meat sellers have posted an increase of Rs50 in the prices of beef and mutton. Loose milk is now selling from Rs180 to Rs200 per litre and yogurt at Rs220 to Rs 240 per kg.
Beef (with bones) sells at Rs850 and boneless at Rs1000 per kg. 
The price of mutton is at an all-time high — it is being sold at Rs1800 per kg. With the advent of Ramazan, people have been complaining about the sharp rise in the prices of dates, Besan (ground grams), fruits, and vegetables.
“Whenever I go to the market with the gap of a couple of days, I find meat, mutton, milk, yogurt, and chicken prices increased by Rs5 to Rs10 per litre/kg. Is this the administration of local authorities,” questioned a retired government official, Saeed Ansari, at the Karachi Company commercial centre.
A woman who was busy shopping at F-11 Markaz complained that the prices of fruits and vegetables were so high that she found it difficult to buy them even once a week to make fruit salad.
Beggary
An influx of beggars in the twin cities especially at markets and traffic signals not only reflects poor administration of authorities in the twin cities but also puts people in complicated situations, residents have complained.
“You cannot even walk freely in the markets because a group of beggars would chase you until you snub them,” said a working woman at Saddar Market, Rawalpindi.
Dozens of beggars who converge at the Committee Chowk underpass make life harder for commuters, who find it difficult to navigate through the intersection on one of the busiest roads in Pindi. The federal capital is also presenting a bleak picture of administration as toddlers can be seen begging and sleeping at traffic signals on main roads of Islamabad even past midnight.
Traffic mess
Unchecked traffic violations in the two cities have also exposed how efficient the traffic police are. “For the last few years, we see motorcyclists and truck drivers plying their vehicles on the fast lane on major roads and highways, and if they are asked to abide by the rules, they get angry in response,” said a citizen, Riaz Khan.
Despite these rampant violations, the traffic police have failed to launch awareness campaigns -- as they used to -- through displaying of banners and placards. “But unfortunately we have not seen such campaigns for a long time,” he said while referring to such drives over the past years.
Street crime
According to media reports, street crimes have also gone up in the twin cities, with incidents of car snatchings and muggings on the rise. The increase in crime rate reflects poor governance and police work, a resident said.
Efforts underway to control hike
When contacted, Dr M Abdullah Tabassum, a spokesperson for the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) administration, claimed that efforts have been doubled to control artificial price hikes in Ramazan.
While giving details about the first week of Ramazan, Dr Tabassum said: “Our teams led by assistant commissioners and other senior officials have conducted inspections at 1,939 places in Islamabad and imposed Rs177,000 in fines for overcharging.”
About action against beggars, the official said 127 beggars were arrested under a campaign and 11 illegal petrol pumps were sealed. An official of the Rawalpindi district administration claimed the prices were under control. A senior official of the local administration, however, agreed that the administration was inactive regarding the price lists.
A senior official of the Punjab Information Department (PID) also agreed that the local administration was uncertain about launching a campaign against price hikes, but in the wake of Ramazan, it has geared up efforts to keep prices in check.
He quoted the chief commissioner of Rawalpindi as saying that the local administration was imposing fines of Rs700,000 to Rs800,000 per day on profiteers.

2,Importance of rural journalism highlighted,TAXILA: President of his own faction of the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) Afzal Butt has said media ...,"TAXILA: President of his own faction of the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) Afzal Butt has said media in Pakistan was passing through a crucial time as it was facing massive curbs on freedom, censorship as well as mass layoffs from the electronic and print media industry. 
Addressing the reception arranged in honour of the newly-elected body of National Press Club (NPC) by the Taxila Press club on Sunday, Afzal Butt said that rural journalism had always suffered in Pakistan.
He said out station reporters (OSRs) of electronic media and correspondents of print media were the voice of millions of voice-less people who have a capacity to draw attention to the administration, police, judiciary and legislators to take action and provide protection to the poor. 
NPC President Anwar Raza lauded the role of rural media in highlighting the issues and problems of masses living in small cities and towns.
Finance Secretary Nayyer Ali said press freedom was meant to differentiate between right and wrong as mudslinging, character assassination or agenda-setting had nothing to do with journalism.
Taxila Press Club President Rizwan Shah, in his address, said out station reporters are always being targeted and their voices are suppressed by influential land lords, politicians, criminal gangs and even the bureaucracy.

3,"44 held for smuggling wheat, flour in Pindi: DC","TAXILA: Bids to smuggle over 1,480 metric tonnes of wheat and wheat products were foiled and 44 people were sent...","TAXILA: Bids to smuggle over 1,480 metric tonnes of wheat and wheat products were foiled and 44 people were sent behind bars for smuggling wheat and flour in the district of Rawalpindi in the last two weeks.
This was stated by Deputy Commissioner Rawalpindi Hassan Waqar Cheema while briefing newsmen about the anti-wheat smuggling activities here on Sunday. He said from March 25 to April 6, the district administration with the assistance of the police and the food department averted 44 attempts to smuggle wheat and flour in 44 vehicles among them 22 trailers from various parts of Punjab to KP.
“As many as 12 first investigation reports were also registered against the people involved in the illegal movement of wheat and wheat products.”
He added that 32 vehicles were confiscated and a number of crew members were booked and arrested accordingly. He said that 287 metric tonnes of wheat products like flour, fine flour and maida smuggling bids were also foiled during the period.
During the crackdown against the wheat products smuggling mafia, 12 vehicles were impounded which were involved in illegal movement of wheat products. Responding to a question, Mr Cheema said that wheat wad largely being smuggled from Lahore and Gujranwala while flour was being smuggled from the local flour mills to various parts of KP and Hazara division.
He said that seven check posts were established at various points of the district to check the anti-wheat smuggling activities. He said bids were foiled at designated and undesignated routes especially Islamabad-Peshawar Motorway (M-1), Rawalpindi-Peshawar GT Road and link routes especially Taxila-Khanpur road and Taxila-Hattar road.

4,PTI’s women activists take to the streets again,Countrywide protests to be held from next week against inflation,"TAXILA: The women’s wing of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) took out a rally and a protest demonstration against inflation and the wheat flour crisis. 
A large number of women, carrying banners and placards, turned up to participate in the demonstration staged at Uppal chowk and raised slogans against the government in favour of the party leadership. 
PTI has announced that it would start countrywide protests against the price increase from next week and stated that the economy was on a slide and the lives of people have become difficult due to skyrocketing inflation in the country.
Addressing the protest rally, former provincial minister Malik Taimour Masood Akbar said that inflation in the country has reached 31 per cent. 

Countrywide protests to be held from next week against inflation

He slammed the government for the unprecedented increase in cost of living in the country, saying that the price of roti has gone up to Rs20 from Rs12, while broiler chicken’s price has increased from Rs300 to Rs750 per kg. “The Rs8 increase in electricity will put the entire country into shock while expecting inflation to be 30 percent - highest in 75 years,” he said, adding that the government was not passing on the impact of decrease in oil and edible prices in the international market. The PTI leader further stated that the price of electricity during their government was Rs16-18 per unit and today this price has gone up to Rs36. 
He claimed that the federal government took the country to the verge of destruction and an unparalleled price hike was imposed on people, adding that it was the duty of the government to provide essential items to people at reasonable prices. Political parties leading the government in the centre and provinces are busy in political tug-of-war and least concerned about the miseries of people.
Senior vice president of PTI’s women wing Kalsoom Chaudhry said that historic high inflation in Pakistan is taking a very heavy toll on the poor and even the lower and middle class. Ms Chaudhry said that the PDM government was not concerned about inflation, poverty and poor economy, but with the popularity of Imran Khan. Shazia Azhar said that inflation in Pakistan hit a record high of 35.4 percent in March, as experts criticised the government’s wrong policies which led to the surging food and energy prices. She said that inflation has made it impossible for women to meet household expenses. 
“Women are made to stand in long queues to buy wheat flour at subsidised rates,” she said, adding that rulers had failed to deliver. She said that leaders of the PML-N and PDM were equally responsible for the prevailing economic meltdown, inflation and law and order situation in the country. She said that people were compelled to commit suicide due to unprecedented inflation and joblessness in the country. She questioned whether the provincial government should explain how the poor would buy 1 kg flour for Rs155.

5,No raid should be conducted without SHO’s consent: CPO,RAWALPINDI: After taking notice of involvement of four Muhafiz Squad officers in the murder of a civilian in...,"RAWALPINDI: After taking notice of involvement of four Muhafiz Squad officers in the murder of a civilian in Pirwadhai, City Police Officer (CPO) Syed Khalid Hamdani issued a directive to all police wings concerned which states that no police party would conduct a raid without knowledge of the relevant station house officer (SHO).
A directive issued by the CPO to senior superintendent of police (operations), SSP (investigation), SP (headquarters), divisional SPs, SHOs and in-charges of Elite Force, Dolphin Force and Muhafiz Squad states that no police raids will be conducted without the directions of SHOs concerned when raids are badly needed.
The CPO further said that the SHO concerned will lead the police raid by following standard operating procedures (SOPs) and taking all precautionary measures.
Likewise, the in-charges of all police posts will have to follow fresh orders. The SHOs must ensure that no one was held illegally in police lockup and that no incident occurred while they were being held, he said and directed relevant officials to make police patrolling more effective. 
He said a patrolling officer should either be a sub-inspector or assistant sub-inspector and the in-charge officer must ensure proper picketing.
Four police officials of the Muhafiz Squad were booked on charges of killing a young man during a raid in Pirwadhai area on Friday night which sparked panic among his heirs and residents of the area, who blocked the road and demanded their arrest.
Basit Khan, 23, a plumber, lost his life when he was reportedly shot by a police official in Pirwadhai area on Friday night.
After the incident happened, the CPO suspended the four police officials and issued orders for registration of an FIR against them.

7,Al-Shifa Eye Trust sets new record of treating patients,RAWALPINDI: Al-Shifa Eye Trust on Sunday said it had set a new record of treating half a million eye patients in...,"RAWALPINDI: Al-Shifa Eye Trust on Sunday said it had set a new record of treating half a million eye patients in rural and remote areas of the country during the last year through its 1,500 free camps.
The patients included around two hundred and fifty thousand children who were provided best possible treatment, it added.
Retired Maj Gen Rehmat Khan, the president of Al-Shifa Trust, while briefing media persons about the outreach programme achievements in 2022-23 added that the army had helped the trust in arranging the free eye camps in remote areas, including Waziristan, Malakand, Pasni, Gwadar, Zhob, Jiwani, Gilgit-Baltistan and Chitral.
“Through these camps we aim to reduce the cases of avoidable vision impairment, alleviate the suffering of underprivileged patients, especially in deprived areas, improve the eye health of the community, raise health awareness and reduce the level of poverty associated with visual impairment.”
He said that free eye camps were held in the underprivileged areas including Loralai, Chaman, Skardu, Chitral, North and South Waziristan and Malakand.
About 250,000 children were screened for different eye diseases in girls’ and boys’ schools and surgical camps were established conducting 12,000 surgeries in rural areas of Pakistan, he said.
He said that Pak Army ensured foolproof security, transport and other facilities for teams of doctors conducting camps in difficult terrains.
In some areas of South and North Waziristan, the army personnel provided food and accommodation and arranged all other facilities paving the way for treatment and surgeries of the people.
Recently, Al-Shifa Trust Eye Hospital established a two-day free surgical and school screening eye camp in Zhob which was sponsored by the 29 Brigade of the army, he said.
The complicated cases from remote areas are referred to Al-Shifa Trust Eye Hospital, Rawalpindi, he said, adding that the trust started an outreach programme in 1992 and its free eye camps were covering the entire country.
Dr Tariq Usman, General Manager of the Al-Shifa Centre for Community Ophthalmology, said the trust runs one of the widest spread outreach programmes. “We are increasing the number of free eye camps in remote areas where the patients lack access to resources for quality medical facilities,” he added.

8,President directs ombudsperson to decide harassment case afresh,Says opportunity of hearing should be given to complainant and senior official of Air varsity,"ISLAMABAD: President Dr Arif Alvi on Sunday directed the Federal Ombudsman for Protection against Harassment of Women at Workplace to decide the matter of alleged sexual harassment at the Air University Islamabad afresh by affording an opportunity of hearing to both the parties.
He stated the ombudsman had previously not given an opportunity to the parties, including the opportunity to produce evidence, and had rejected the complaint of the woman in a slipshod manner.
The president gave these remarks while deciding on a case where a woman employee of the Air University Islamabad had filed a complaint with the Federal Ombudsman Secretariat for Protection against Harassment (FOSPAH). She had stated that she faced workplace harassment at the hands of a senior university official in 2019 when she reported a serious matter of “MBBS students using drugs on college premises and their involvement in immoral activities.”
FOSPAH had rejected her complaint by stating that the complainant had failed to prove her case beyond reasonable doubt and that the complainant had leveled allegations of general nature. Feeling aggrieved, the complainant filed a representation with the president.

Says opportunity of hearing should be given to complainant and senior official of Air varsity

While accepting the representation, the president stated that the allegations narrated by the complainant against the accused were of serious nature, which needed an appropriate probe and evidence to reach the right conclusion. He noted that the ombudsman, instead of following the procedure, had drawn the conclusion on the basis of contents of the complaint by observing: “The complainant has levelled allegations of general nature against the administration, and that a representative of the organisation appeared and told that none of the complaints had been ever filed and he belied the stance of the complainant.”
The president observed that the ombudsman had placed reliance solely on the contents of the complaint and the statement of the representative of the organisation and as a sequel rejected the complaint. He added that no opportunity of producing evidence or cross examining the representative had been afforded to the complainant despite the fact that in the preliminary order the ombudsman had observed that the allegations were of grave nature which required evidence but subsequently no evidence was recorded and the complaint was rejected in a slipshod manner.
The president concluded that in view of the gravity of the allegations, full opportunity of hearing to the parties should have been afforded, including an opportunity to produce evidence.
He said the denial to afford the opportunity of producing evidence was violation of Article 10-A as enshrined in the Constitution, the provisions of the Protection Against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act 2010 and the principles of natural justice.
The president, therefore, set aside the order of FOSPAH and remitted the matter to the ombudsman to decide it afresh by affording opportunity of hearing to the parties.

A police official allegedly killed his uncle and injured his son in the Race Course area incident.
Police said the suspect identified as Ahmad was an official of Punjab Constabulary (PC). He is the fifth police official booked by in Rawalpindi in two murder cases during the last two days. However, none of them has been detained by the police so far. Of the five police officials, four were associated with Muhafiz Squad.
Omer Azmeer, a resident of Dhoke Chaudhrian, lodged an FIR with the Race Course police stating that he and his father Haji Imrooz Khan were sitting in their pen when Ahmad appeared on the scene in uniform and challenged them.
He said Ahmad threatened to teach them a lesson for allegedly killing his brother and fired gunshots at him, injuring him critically.
As his father came to his rescue, he was also shot and injured by Ahmed, the FIR said.
The injured were shifted to the District Headquarters Hospital (DHQ) where Khan died. The deceased was an uncle of the alleged killer.
A police spokesman said the concerned unit had been informed about the constable’s involvement in the incident and raids were being conducted to arrest him.

11,Jogging track for women planned in Pims,"""It will encourage women who usually avoid walking and other physical activities to start walk,"" says spokesperson.","ISLAMABAD: The management of Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) has decided to establish a ladies park in the hospital.
The park will also have a jogging track and will be available for female staff of the hospital. In a one of its kind decision, the management of the hospital has started development work and plantation.
Pims spokesperson Dr Haider Abbasi, while talking to Dawn said that although the hospital discouraged patients to bring more than one attendant along with them but because of the culture of Pakistan, a large number of attendants come to the hospital.
“The management has decided to establish a ladies park so they could go there for walks. It would not only encourage women who usually avoid walking and other physical activities, to start walk but at the same time the rush of attendants in the hospital will decrease,” he said.
He said that the park was the brain child of Pims Executive Director Professor Naeem Malik and according to his knowledge it will be the only example in public and private sector hospitals of Islamabad.
“Being a cardiologist, Dr Malik believes that physical activities such as jogging and walk keep people healthy and chances of a number of diseases including cardiovascular diseases are reduced,” he said.
He said that in Pakistan, 25pc of adults were diabetic and it showed that the whole nation had a tendency to relax rather than engage in physical activities.
“We want to give awareness to masses that they should start at least walk, if not jogging, because people will remain healthy and it will ultimately decrease the burden from hospitals. Jogging track at the hospital is the best effort to give awareness to masses,” he said, adding that a separate and renovated building for School of Nursing has been completed and advanced endoscopy facilities like Endoscopic Ultrasound and Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) were also made functional in the hospital.
It is worth mentioning that ERCP is a procedure that combines upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy and x-rays to treat problems of the bile and pancreatic ducts.
“The Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machine is being installed and will be functional soon,” he said.
Pims is one of the largest hospitals of Pakistan and on an average 10,000 to 15,000 patients visit the hospital on a daily basis. As on an average, two attendants come to the hospital along with each patient so the number of visitors reach 30,000 per day.

12,CDA meets today to finalise sites for cricket and football stadiums in Islamabad,Civic agency to take up rent policy for private schools.,"ISLAMABAD: The Capital Development Authority (CDA) will meet today to approve locations for international cricket and a football stadiums in the federal capital as well as formulate a policy to rent out plots to private schools under strict criteria.
Sources said that for the cricket and football stadiums, two sites (20 acre each) have been proposed near Motorway (MI) and Kuri. The decision about these sites will be made during the meeting chaired by Noorul Amin Mengal, which will take up a 28-point agenda.
Last year, the CDA proposed a stadium in Saidpur. But the idea was dropped later on. Similarly in 2012, CDA and the Pakistan Cricket Board joined hands for the construction of a stadium but the project was scrapped by the Supreme Court in 2018 as it was being built in Skharparian which falls in the national park area.
According to sources, the CDA’s planning wing proposed a site of 20 acre in the Kuri area for the football stadium. CDA officials told Dawn that having a cricket stadium in the capital was a “need of the hour”. However, they said Islamabad had one of the best football stadiums in the Sports Complex. They said that besides exploring new sites, the CDA should also look if it could help the sports board upgrade the Jinnah Stadium. Some years ago, Pakistan successfully hosted the South Asian Women Football Championship at the Jinnah Stadium.

Civic agency to take up rent policy for private schools

Rent policy for schools
The board meeting will also discuss a policy related to plots for private schools. Earlier, the CDA used to auction its plots, but this time the civic agency “wants to rent out its schools plots to private school operators to shift the existing schools from residential areas”.
The CDA officials said that schools registered with the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), the Federal Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education (FBISE), and the Private Educational Institutions Regulatory Authority (Peira) will be considered.
The plots will be rented out on the basis of a 100 points formula, said the CDA chairman. 
Mr Mengal told Dawn that the CDA was going to introduce a rental policy for schools to end the non-conforming use of residential houses.
There is no truth in reports that the policy is aimed at facilitating major school chains, rather schools that charge less fees and those operating in the residential areas will be real beneficiaries of this policy, he added.
Sources confirmed that the schools, which are charging up to Rs5,000 fees per month will be eligible to have 25 marks while schools charging Rs5000-6000 monthly fees will get 20 marks.
“We have 100 qualification marks and schools charging up to 5000 per month will get 25 marks and those operating in residential areas will get 20 marks,” the chairman said, adding that those schools, which will get CDA’s plot on rent will be bound to raise their fee around four per cent after a year (12pc after three year) “as we want to provide relief to parents” as well.
It is relevant to note here, as per existing rules, the civic agency cannot rent out its plots, but it is supposed to auction plots. An official said, if said summary is approved by the board, then CDA will go for amendments to the Islamabad Land Disposal Regulations.
During the meeting, the board will also consider CDA’s proposal of auctioning vending points and shops in art and craft villages, matters relating to parking plazas, and revised layout plan of sectors C-16 and C-17 will also be taken up.

Several churches organised midnight services on Saturday night where prayers were offered. The midnight services were followed by morning services at the churches of various denominations in the garrison city.
Large congregations were seen in these churches on Sunday where religious prayers in the context of resurrection of Jesus Christ after his crucifixion were offered. People prayed for peace, love and brotherhood in the world.
In their sermons, clerics stressed on the need for religious tolerance and brotherhood saying: “All of us must use our efforts and play a positive role for the development of the country and spread love and peace.”
Distribution of Easter eggs is the main attraction of the festival for children. Anthony Masih said that the main feature of Easter is Easter eggs which symbolise life. He said that Christians give the gift of Easter eggs to their children, adding that these eggs were prepared from chocolate and easily available at main stores in the city so there was no need to prepare them at home.
Zahoor Bhatti said: “For Christians, Christmas is the main event of the year when they celebrate the birthday of Jesus and on Easter, they celebrate the day of his resurrection while offering their prayers and enjoy the day with their families.”
Meanwhile, the Rawalpindi police made special arrangements for security in and around churches. Political leaders visited localities of Christian citizens and expressed solidarity to convince them to vote for them in general elections.
