But in Urdu literature a penname or...","A PSEUDONYM, or a fictitious name, is a term that includes penname, too. But in Urdu literature a penname or takhallus has a slightly different meaning from a pseudonym.
Pseudonym may be assumed for hiding one’s real name. Contrarily, takhallus, a widely used term in Urdu and Persian poetry, is a penname taken for claiming one’s right on a piece of writing rather than keeping the real name secret. A poet may use takhallus in the last verse in a ghazal, or any other poetic expression, to refer to him or herself. The practice of taking takhallus began in Iran when some Persian poets felt that their couplets could be plagiarised or attributed to other poets and mentioning their name in poetry would lessen the threat, wrote Dr Syed Abdullah in his book Mabaahis.
Takhallus is usually a well-known penname since poets use it with the intension of registering their identity and not to conceal it. For instance, everybody knows that Ghalib is a takhallus used by Mirza Asadullah Khan. But this takhallus was not used when Ghalib wrote Lataaif-i-Ghaibi, a book that Ghalib himself wrote and published it with title mentioning Miandad Khan Sayyah, a friend of Ghalib’s, as author. The book, supporting Ghalib’s views, was a part of ongoing controversy over Burhaan-i-Qaat’e, a Persian dictionary.
In Urdu literature, assumed names or fictitious names are used for concealing an author’s identity for certain reasons, for example, fear of persecution by the ruling regime because of political and ideological differences. Similarly, replying to a rival author or literary group without having to mention one’s real name was a reason.
Another interesting reason was earning extra money by writing a romance novel for female readers: many popular romance Urdu novels published in the 1950s and 1960s with a female main character and purporting to be written by women writers were in fact ghost-written by male writers. Their publishers’ perception was that a romantic-sounding female name as author on title would appeal more women as well as male readers.
This romantic halo around a female writer back then was a sure-fire way of attracting a lot of attention and some used it quite well. Fazl-e-Haq Qureshi, for instance, had assumed the pseudonym Tahira Devi Sherazi, a famous though non-existent woman writer. Niaz Fatehpuri used to write by the fictitious name Qamar Zamani Begum. Many fans did not know that no such female writer existed who wrote such highly imaginative and romantic pieces. Shah Nizamuddin Dilgeer, editor of Naqqaad, Agra, was so impressed with the writer that he fell in love and began writing love letters to her.
Another reason for hiding one’s identity as writer was social taboos as a century or so ago being a poet or writer carried a stigma for a woman. Many talented women writers had to hide behind a veil as well as a pseudonym. For instance, Qurrat-ul-Ain Hyder’s mother used to write by the name Bint-e-Nazr-ul-Baqar. Zainab, the real name of Mrs Abdul Qadir, a well-known writer of Urdu horror fiction, was not known till many years after she shot to literary fame. Maulana Zafar Ali Khan’s sister and Raja Mehdi Ali Khan’s mother, Hubbiya Khatoon, wrote with the initials Hey-Khey (H.Kh.). Her collection of poetry was published under the title Nava-i-Haram. The real name of Zey Khey Sheen (Z.Kh. Sh), a talented female poet, was Zahida Khatoon Shervaniya.
According to Muhammad Husain Azad, Mushafi, an Urdu poet of a high stature, used to sell his ghazals to earn a few rupees, albeit some researchers have taken exception to Azad’s statement. But it is a fact that in past many writers and poets had to sell their manuscripts to earn their bread and butter.
Among the writers and poets who concealed their identity are some other stalwarts too: Mirza Farhatullah Baig, a stylish humorist, used Mirza Alam Nashrh as penname. Sajjad Hyder Josh, another humorist, wrote using the name John Bill. The real writer behind the pseudonym Sindbad Jahazi, a famous columnist, was Chiragh Hasan Hasrat. Ahmed Nadeem Qasmi would write a column but the name of writer, as published, was Anqaa and sometimes Panj Darya. Ibn-e-Insha took many pseudonyms including Haji Baba Isfahani, Durvesh Damishqi and Pehla Durvesh. Imroze was a leading Urdu daily back in 1950s and 1960s. It published satire column and the writer was Chahaar Durvesh, but it was written alternatively by Ibn-e-Insha, Qazi Abrar Siddiqi, Tufail Ahmed Jamali and Nasrullah Khan.
When literary feud between writers of Punjab and UP began, an informal literary circle with the name Niaz Mandaan-i-Lahore was formed. Its members included bigwigs like Pitras Bukhari, Hafeez Jalandhary, M.D.Taseer, Abdul Majeed Salik, Imtiaz Ali Taj, Sufi Tabassum and Pandit Hari Chand Akhter. Several of them wrote many pieces as rejoinders and rebuttals with pseudonyms.
In our time, Waheed Qureshi used Mir Jumla Lahori and Mushfiq Khwaja used Khama Bagosh as pseudonym.

2,PM’s adviser credits ‘hectic efforts’ for economic improvement,Bilal Kayani says govt has averted default and made significant progress in rebuilding the economy.,"ISLAMABAD: The prime minister’s coordinator on economy and energy has credited the government’s “hectic efforts” for the improving macroeconomic indicators in the last eight months.
Addressing a press conference on Sunday, Bilal Azhar Kayani said the current account deficit narrowed by 68 per cent year-on-year during the last eight months. The fiscal deficit came down from 3.4pc to 2.8pc and there was a primary surplus of 0.9pc of GDP this year as compared to a primary deficit of 0.6pc recorded during the last year of the PTI government.
“The current government has averted default and made significant progress towards stabilising and rebuilding the economy,” he added.
Mr Kayani claimed that before the “imposition” of Imran Khan’s government in 2018, the economy was on the path of sustainable economic growth with six per cent GDP growth and inflation of less than 4pc.
Noting the achievements of the PML-N government from 2013 to 2018, he said work on energy projects under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) was initiated to produce about 12,000MW of energy. Besides, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme was completed and an operation against terrorism was launched.
He claimed the government led by ex-PM Nawaz Sharif put the country on the track of economic development, creating over six million jobs.
“Then Imran Khan was imposed and during four years of his government, inflation continuously incre­ased, four finance ministers were changed and over 20m people were pushed below the poverty line.

3,No white paper can cover up PTI’s ‘incompetence’: govt,"Marriyum Aurangzeb says nothing can help Imran ""cover up his corruption, incompetemnce and the violation of the Constitution he committed"".","ISLAMABAD: Minister for Information and Broadcasting Marriyum Aurangzeb on Sunday said PTI chief Imran Khan could not justify his “tenure of destruction” blighted by alleged corruption and incompetency by simply issuing a white paper.
“Whether he issues white, red or yellow paper, nothing can help Imran Khan cover up his corruption, incompetency and the violation of the Constitution he committed during his government’s tenure,” she said in a statement after the PTI issued a white paper on the coalition government’s one-year performance.
Ms Aurangzeb said it was the ruling alliance that had made concerted efforts to steer the country out of economic crises created by the previous government.
“How can Imran Khan, who himself plunged the country into an economic quagmire which ushered in sheer poverty, extreme inflation and massive unemployment, question the performance of a government which came into power just one year ago?” she wondered.
She said a person who brought the country to the brink of default issued a white paper, which ironically had no mention of circular debt in the power sector, which jumped to Rs2,400 billion from Rs1,100bn during his tenure.
There was also no mention of circular debt in the energy sector, which she said soared to Rs1,400bn under the PTI administration’s watch.
She said Mr Khan had also not dared to mention the “wrong policies” of his government that led to higher prices of wheat, sugar, gas and electricity.
Besides, the PTI government had taken record loans of Rs20,000bn, which was not mentioned in the white paper, she said, adding that the coalition government had repaid $11 billion debt in one year.
The former premier had angered almost every friendly country by pursuing wrong policies during his four-year rule, she alleged, adding that the white paper had also failed to mention the previous government’s policies that rendered six million people jobless and pushed 20m below the poverty line.

5,"SBP governor, secretaries to attend IMF-WB meetings","Meetings at the IMF and World Bank headquarters will consider ""uncertainties and risks weighing heavily"" on the global economy.","WASHINGTON: The 2023 spring meetings of the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) begin in the US capital on Monday to consider “uncertainties and risks weighing heavily” on the global economy.
The April 10-16 meetings at the IMF and World Bank headquarters will also focus on the effects of climate change, which is threatening lives and livelihoods around the world.
The meetings bring finance ministers and central bank governors from across the globe who use the opportunity to renew their contacts with international financial leaders. Some also hold bilateral meetings with US Treasury and State Department officials.
The secretaries of finance and economic affairs and the State Bank governor will represent Pakistan in the meetings as Finance Minister Ishaq Dar decided not to come.
An official statement underlining the issues that will be discussed at these meetings, noted that a “stubborn inflation, the cost-of-living crisis, and slower growth effects” were hurting the poor and most vulnerable.
“Record high debt is holding back developing countries, and the effects of climate change are threatening lives and livelihoods around the world, the statement added. Experts urged the World Bank and the IMF to make a comprehensive plan for addressing the issues confronting the developing world.
A picture on the UN Foundation’s site showed how last year’s floods in Pakistan caused widespread devastations and international financial institutions to develop a new mechanism to “help communities on the receiving end of (climate change) catastrophes”.
“Many lives were lost, and millions lost their homes, with one-third of the country submerged,” the caption under the picture pointed out.
A World Bank report, released soon after the floods, noted that “Pakistan urgently needs significant investments in climate resilience to secure its economy and reduce poverty.”

6,PTI leader Gandapur remanded in police custody for one day,ISLAMABAD: An Islamabad judicial magistrate on Sunday remanded PTI leader Ali Amin Gandapur in police custody for a...,"ISLAMABAD: An Islamabad judicial magistrate on Sunday remanded PTI leader Ali Amin Gandapur in police custody for a day in a terrorism case that charged him with threatening the government and national institutions.
Mr Gandapur, a former federal minister, was arrested on Thursday night outside the building of the Peshawar High Court’s Dera Ismail Khan bench after an hours-long drama and remanded to the city’s central jail for six days. 
On Saturday, the Islamabad and Punjab police from Bhakkar reached D.I. Khan and took him to Islamabad.
The FIR registered against Mr Gandapur mentions an audio leak in which he could purportedly be heard using derogatory language against the federal coalition. The case was registered on April 8 at Islamabad’s Golra police station under Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act.
On Sunday, Mr Gandapur was presented before a duty magistrate as it was a day off. Footage from outside the court showed the PTI leader being escorted by the police with his head covered with a cloth.
During the hearing, the government’s lawyer read out loud the charges against Mr Gandapur, saying his remarks had created fear among the institutions, according to a Dawn.com report.
“The charges against him are very serious. He talked about taking over Islamabad and using weapons,” the lawyer said, adding that Mr Gandapur deserved to be sent to jail for life for such comments.
Mr Gandapur’s lawyer, Babar Awan, argued that the charges were baseless and wondered how cases could be registered on leaked audios.
“A number of audio clips emerged featuring [PML-N leader] Maryam Nawaz and even judges … were cases registered against them as well?” he asked.
Mr Awan then contended that Mr Gandapur should not be remanded in police custody for more than 24 hours. However, the prosecution said the case fell under the jurisdiction of the anti-terrorism court (ATC) and not the judicial magistrate.
Subsequently, the judge remanded Mr Gandapur into police custody for a day and instructed the police to present him before the Islamabad ATC on Monday (today).

7,Heroes of difficult pathways march on in fight against polio,"Despite the harsh weather, they marched onwards, in the hope of protecting children of their community from the crippling polio virus.","AS snowflakes began to fall and the icy chill of winter blew over her small village, community health worker (CHW) Bibi Marjana, accompanied by her mother and father-in-law, wrapped her veil around the face and covered her body in an effort to fight the severe cold.
Despite the harsh weather, they marched onwards, in the hope of protecting children of their community from the crippling polio virus.
The 26-year-old Marjana, a mother of five, has been associated with the Polio Eradication Initiative (PEI) for the last three years. She works in Pishin — one of the high-risk polio districts in Balochistan.
Her husband is a hotel employee. Her mother-in-law Noor Nama also started working with the PEI three months ago to support her family.
They both work in Barshore Tehsil of a sprawling Pishin district where the population is scattered across a large,  almost inaccessible area.
There are villages which even people travelling on cars or motorcycles find it difficult to reach. The health workers have to walk two to five kilometres to go from one house to another in some of the villages.
“The weather was severe, but it couldn’t shake our will and passion. We were determined to reach every child and so we did,” said Marjana.
“My target is to vaccinate 84 children. The figure is lower than other CHWs’ targets, but my area is very challenging.
“I have to climb mountains to vaccinate under-five children. Travelling through these areas during times of snowfall is difficult and causes delays in achieving the target.
“Sometimes we are stuck in between. But we try to perform our duty with zeal and honesty,” said Marjana, determination writ large on her face.
The experience of Noor Nama, the 54-year-old mother-in-law of Marjana, is no different. She, too, negotiates treacherous terrain to perform her duty.
“My daughter-in-law is working for a noble cause. I joined her to play my part for the well-being of my community.
“I am able to support my family as well. It’s very difficult to find women in our area who perform such hard tasks,   going door to door for vaccinating children. But luckily my husband Hidaytullah is very supportive. He accompanies us during the campaign. 
“We are all working to save our children from life-long disability,” said Noor Nama, with pride.
Lurking danger
Pishin is a high-risk district. Although the province hasn’t had a polio case for almost two years, the threat is always present that poliovirus is ready to strike somewhere because of an extensive population movement to and from the district, from other provinces and parts of Afghanistan.
“It’s all because of our community health workers that the district has no polio case. The women are local, from the same community and have easy access to houses.
The ratio of female-male ratio is 70-30 percent in Pishin district. The percentage is even lower in rural areas and Barshore is one such Tehsil,“ said Kaleemullah, district communications officer in Pishin.
These women are working to bring about a behavioural change as they not only administer polio drops, but also give awareness to villagers about immunisation.
“Last but not the least, they are breadwinners, too. It’s very difficult to have women as CHWs in our district. We campaigned hard to persuade many families to let their females join the PEI programme.
“We now have 50 female frontline CHWs, out of 96, in  Barshore alone,” said Mubeen, the communication officer in Pishin. “Marjana, her mother-in-law and father-in-law sometimes hitch a ride on a tractor to vaccinate children.
“They have to walk mile upon mile to reach a single child at the top of a mountain. If one house is on the mountain,  another is beside a stream gone dry. But they work with dedication and honesty to administer polio drops to every child,” Mubeen added.
Community-based volunteers (CBVs) in Balochistan have been a pivotal link to strengthening disease surveillance and awareness, increasing vaccine coverage, and providing basic health information to improve health outcomes in hard-to-reach areas.
Syed Zahid Shah, who works at an emergency operation centre, applauding the efforts of women workers, said: “There are almost 4,000 CBV staff working in different districts of Balochistan. The women working on the frontline as community health workers in the province  are the true heroes of the PEI programme as they bear every hardship, whether cultural, social, security or environmental.”
They should be respected and given a befitting recognition as they go the extra mile for saving the future of Pakistan, Zahid Shah observed.

According to a statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), an exchange of fire took place between security forces and militants in the Razmak of North Waziristan district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. 
The security forces effectively engaged the militants and gunned down one of them. Weapons and ammunition were recovered during the operation, the ISPR said.  
The second shootout took place in the Karama area of South Waziristan, resulting in the martyrdom of a sepoy. 
“Naik Fazal Janan, resident of District Hangu, having fought gallantly, embraced martyrdom,” the ISPR statement said, adding that a sanitisation operation was being carried out to eliminate any other terrorists found in the area. 
The security forces are determined to eliminate the menace of terrorism and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers further stren­gthen our resolve, it said. 
This is the second counter-terrorism operation in the tribal area, close to the Afghanistan border in less than a week. 
On Wednesday, an alleged militant commander and his seven associates were killed during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) carried out in the Shinwarsak area of South Waziristan. 
A sepoy was martyred while four others, including two officers, sustained injuries during the IBO. 
Earlier on March 10, five terrorists were killed during IBOs in North and South Waziristan districts.
