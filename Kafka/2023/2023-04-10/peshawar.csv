JUI-F leader and Khar tehsil council chairman Haji Said Badshah, PPP leader Aurangzeb Khan, JI leaders Farmanullah, Liaqat Khan, ANP provincial joint secretary Shah Naseer Khan, trader leaders Haji Shah Wali Khan, Haji Khan Bahadar, and Khar neighbourhood council chairman Anwar Hussain were among those in attendance.

They alleged dealers were charging the poor people at the distribution points for free lour.
They claimed officials of the local food department, management of flour mills and dealers were involved in the corrupt practices. 
They asked the provincial government, secretary food department and the Bajaur deputy commissioner to look into the matter.
Meanwhile, the Dera district administration will hold an open kutchery on Monday (today) to listen to complaints of citizens regarding free flour distribution.

3,Young volunteers earn appreciation  for arranging free Iftar,"PESHAWAR: A group of young volunteers, arranging free Iftar on a roadside for the last five years at Saddar Chowk in...","PESHAWAR: A group of young volunteers, arranging free Iftar on a roadside for the last five years at Saddar Chowk in Peshawar, has earned public appreciation.
Adnan Khan, provincial chief of Fix It, a not-for-profit organisation, said that he and his 50 active colleagues arranged free Iftar also called ‘Datarkhwan’ for poor labourers, daily wagers, children and women on a roadside in Peshawar Saddar on daily basis.
“There were more than 300 young volunteers. They are ready online to join them on our call whenever a need arises,” he said. He added that they provided free Iftar to poor students living in private hostels during Ramzan and they sometime helped the organisation in arranging the meal.
Adnan said that although the number of people remained fluctuating, yet more than 200 persons including children, women and elderly turned up at their free Iftar, which provided a sumptuous food variety along with cold drinks and fruit chaat.
He told this scribe that several volunteers pledged supply of food, fruits and other edibles as they appealed to donors always for food items and not for cash.
He said that the main objective of the initiative was to help out needy and poor people, who could not afford different food items for Iftar. There are daily wagers in different corners of the city who earn less than what they need to afford their two-time meal.
“We don’t demand money from donors rather we ask them to buy us food items for our free Dastarkhwan. There are people, who bring us food parcels. Some people wish to take food items home and our volunteers give them away packages for home,” said Asghar Ali, another volunteer. 
Fix It has its own makeshift kitchen on roadside, cooking variety of foods relished by fast keepers. “Yes we have our own makeshift kitchen where our volunteers cook several kinds of dishes, cold drinks alongside fruits that our guests love to relish at Iftar. There is also a separate Dastarkhwan for women and children. Some visitors are even attendants with their patients in hospitals,” said Mansoor Akhtar, another volunteer.
Shah Wali Kaka, 59 from Bajaur tribal district, a daily wager, said that he could not earn enough to afford his Iftar and that’s why he showed up at free Iftar along with his three colleagues.
Adnan Khan told Dawn that his organisation would extend free Iftar to other cities of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. “Presently Nowshera is selected for arranging this initiative. It will be extend to the entire province,” he added.
He said that young people could contribute to such an initiative.

The road was blocked in November last year when Kaghan valley received heavy snowfall. National Highway Authority, which had started clearing snow from that main artery last month, removed all glaciers from the road and cleared it to traffic.
“The NHA would take some two to three weeks to clear this artery up to Babusar Top, restoring the traffic between KP and GP,” Hassan Deen, the chairman of Hoteliers Association in Kaghan, told journalists.
He said that traders and hoteliers would welcome tourists to Kaghan on Eidul Fitr. He said that as the artery was cleared to traffic, the police post in Naran was also made operational by DPO Zahoor Babar Afridi.
With the reopening of MNJ road, the first digital census will be started in Kaghan valley.
BAKERS: The bakers on Sunday announced not to pay the re-gasified liquefied natural gas price to Sui Northern Gas Pipelines.
“We are being supplied with natural gas and SNGPL wants us to pay the price of RLNG, which is unjust and unacceptable to us at any cost,” Wajid Shah, the president of District Bakers Association, told a press conference.
Flanked by other office-bearers of the association and their counsel Advocate Najmul Hassan Khan, he said that SNGP supplied natural gas to domestic and commercial consumers across the province but it wanted to receive the traffic, which it had fixed for RLNG.
Speaking on occasion, Najmul Hassan Khan said that bakers had moved Peshawar High Courts’ Abbottabad Circuit Bench against that injustice and April 13 was fixed for hearing of the peition.
He said that SNGP also increased natural gas traffic from Rs1,283 per MMBTU to Rs1,650 recently and now wanted to charge rates for such a product, which was never used by his clients.

5,No raid should be conducted without SHO’s consent: Rawalpindi CPO,"SHOs must ensure that no one is held illegally in police lockup and that no incident occurs while they are held, CPO says.","RAWALPINDI: After taking notice of involvement of four Muhafiz Squad officers in the murder of a civilian in Pirwadhai, City Police Officer (CPO) Syed Khalid Hamdani issued a directive to all police wings concerned which states that no police party would conduct a raid without knowledge of the relevant station house officer (SHO).
A directive issued by the CPO to senior superintendent of police (operations), SSP (investigation), SP (headquarters), divisional SPs, SHOs and in-charges of Elite Force, Dolphin Force and Muhafiz Squad states that no police raids will be conducted without the directions of SHOs concerned when raids are badly needed.
The CPO further said that the SHO concerned will lead the police raid by following standard operating procedures (SOPs) and taking all precautionary measures.
Likewise, the in-charges of all police posts will have to follow fresh orders. The SHOs must ensure that no one was held illegally in police lockup and that no incident occurred while they were being held, he said and directed relevant officials to make police patrolling more effective. 
He said a patrolling officer should either be a sub-inspector or assistant sub-inspector and the in-charge officer must ensure proper picketing.
Four police officials of the Muhafiz Squad were booked on charges of killing a young man during a raid in Pirwadhai area on Friday night which sparked panic among his heirs and residents of the area, who blocked the road and demanded their arrest.
Basit Khan, 23, a plumber, lost his life when he was reportedly shot by a police official in Pirwadhai area on Friday night.
After the incident happened, the CPO suspended the four police officials and issued orders for registration of an FIR against them.

6,PTI’s women activists take to the streets again,Countrywide protests to be held from next week against inflation,"TAXILA: The women’s wing of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) took out a rally and a protest demonstration against inflation and the wheat flour crisis. 
A large number of women, carrying banners and placards, turned up to participate in the demonstration staged at Uppal chowk and raised slogans against the government in favour of the party leadership. 
PTI has announced that it would start countrywide protests against the price increase from next week and stated that the economy was on a slide and the lives of people have become difficult due to skyrocketing inflation in the country.
Addressing the protest rally, former provincial minister Malik Taimour Masood Akbar said that inflation in the country has reached 31 per cent. 

Countrywide protests to be held from next week against inflation

He slammed the government for the unprecedented increase in cost of living in the country, saying that the price of roti has gone up to Rs20 from Rs12, while broiler chicken’s price has increased from Rs300 to Rs750 per kg. “The Rs8 increase in electricity will put the entire country into shock while expecting inflation to be 30 percent - highest in 75 years,” he said, adding that the government was not passing on the impact of decrease in oil and edible prices in the international market. The PTI leader further stated that the price of electricity during their government was Rs16-18 per unit and today this price has gone up to Rs36. 
He claimed that the federal government took the country to the verge of destruction and an unparalleled price hike was imposed on people, adding that it was the duty of the government to provide essential items to people at reasonable prices. Political parties leading the government in the centre and provinces are busy in political tug-of-war and least concerned about the miseries of people.
Senior vice president of PTI’s women wing Kalsoom Chaudhry said that historic high inflation in Pakistan is taking a very heavy toll on the poor and even the lower and middle class. Ms Chaudhry said that the PDM government was not concerned about inflation, poverty and poor economy, but with the popularity of Imran Khan. Shazia Azhar said that inflation in Pakistan hit a record high of 35.4 percent in March, as experts criticised the government’s wrong policies which led to the surging food and energy prices. She said that inflation has made it impossible for women to meet household expenses. 
“Women are made to stand in long queues to buy wheat flour at subsidised rates,” she said, adding that rulers had failed to deliver. She said that leaders of the PML-N and PDM were equally responsible for the prevailing economic meltdown, inflation and law and order situation in the country. She said that people were compelled to commit suicide due to unprecedented inflation and joblessness in the country. She questioned whether the provincial government should explain how the poor would buy 1 kg flour for Rs155.

9,High court moved against dissolution of teaching hospitals’ BoGs,Petitioners claim caretaker setup has overstepped its authority,"PESHAWAR: The members of the boards of governors of 10 medical teaching institutions (MTI) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have challenged in Peshawar High Court the decision of the caretaker provincial cabinet to dissolve all these boards.
The members have filed 10 almost identical petitions related to their respective BoG, requesting the court to declare as illegal, without lawful authority and to set aside the impugned decision of the caretaker cabinet taken in its meeting on March 16, 2023.
The petitioners requested the court to declare that the role of caretaker setup was confined to running day-to-day affairs of the state with the help of available machinery and could not take policy decisions and permanent measures including recruitments, making appointments, transfers and postings and removals.
They sought interim relief from the court requesting it to stop the government from taking any action against the petitioners in the light of the impugned decision.

Petitioners claim caretaker setup has overstepped its authority

They sought directives of the court for implementation of a judgment of Supreme Court of Pakistan in line with spirit of Part VIII of Constitution and section 230 of Elections Act, 2017.
Eight of the petitions were filed through Advocate Ali Gohar Durrani whereas the two others were moved through former advocate general Shumail Ahmad Butt.
The respondents in the petitions are: KP government through its chief secretary, provincial secretaries of health and administration departments and Election Commission of Pakistan through its secretary.
In the same cabinet meeting of March 16, the government had also decided to dissolve the policy board of MTIs and subsequently on March 28 the government through a notification sacked its members.
Four of the members of the policy board have challenged their removal in the high court and recently the court has suspended the said notification to the extent of those petitioners.
The previous Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government had passed Medical Teaching Institutions Reforms Act (MTIRA) in 2015 to run the teaching hospitals through BoGs instead of health department.
As per law, BoGs are authorised to make top appointments such as medical director, dean, hospital and nursing directors from the market on competitive salaries to run the hospitals and their affiliated medical colleges.
The petitioners stated that the BoGs of respective MTIs had several achievements to their credit and it was only natural that the boards would be allowed to complete their tenure. However, they said that to their utmost surprise, a summary was moved by the health secretary to remove the members of BoGs. They said that the summary was placed before the caretaker cabinet, which approved it on March 16.
They contended that the minutes of the said meeting clearly reflected that chief secretary and health secretary recorded their dissent by making it clear in unequivocal terms that the caretaker government lacked the authority to dissolve boards as per Section 230 of Elections Act.
They said that section 230 of Elections Act prohibited the caretaker government from making any policy decision in the province and thus its decision was illegal and without lawful authority.
The petitioners contended that as soon as the caretaker setup was appointed, its mandate under the Constitution was to hold free and fair elections in aid of ECP and no caretaker cabinet could make policy decision even in relation to appointment and posting of civil servants.
They stated that the principle was settled by Supreme Court in a case after the Constitution (Eighteenth Amendment) Act, 2010, was passed. They said that the Supreme Court had ruled that a caretaker government was empowered only to carry out day-to-day affairs of the state with the help of available machinery/resources/manpower and it could not take any policy decision and permanent measures including recruitments, making appointments, transfers and postings of government servants.
“It must leave such matters to the elected government, which takes charge as a result of elections,” the court had ruled.
The petitioners also referred to a judgment of PHC wherein it was ruled that the caretaker government enjoyed limited powers of administrative continuity within the available resources while preventing any major decision from being taken.

13,Burn cases in Peshawar witness alarming increase in Ramazan,"Burns and Plastic Surgery Centre director says, ""Gas load-shedding is another issue due to which people use cylinders for cooking purposes.""","PESHAWAR: The public sector Burns and Plastic Surgery Centre, Hayatabad, has been receiving more cases in Ramazan due to the haphazard approach of people to make different sorts of food items within a short time.
“Burn cases have almost doubled in Ramazan as people spend most time cooking in a disorganised manner, which causes them burn injuries,” Prof Tahmeedullah, the director of Burns and Plastic Surgery Centre, Hayatabad, told Dawn.
He said that the centre received six burn patients on average per day in the month of Ramazan. “It is twice the number of patients, we got before Ramazan. Gas load-shedding is another issue due to which people use cylinders for cooking purposes,” he added.
He said that during Ramazan more people remained present in the kitchen trying to prepare meals and other edible items in a shorter time due to which their clothes often caught fire and resulted in burn injuries.

Expert says surgeons at district level will be trained to treat patients locally

“This happens both during Sehri and Iftar because people rush to kitchen to make preparation without showing patience. Another main cause is gas load-shedding due to which people switch to cylinders and encounter the bursts that cause severe injuries,” said Prof Tahmeed.
“Even a lady doctor, who has sustained 70 per cent burns due to a cylinder blast recently, is being treated at the intensive care unit,” he said. Mostly, people open the pressure cooker despite the presence of gas, which bursts and causes injuries to them.
“The people also use equipment, which sucks gas during low pressure that causes leakage and ultimately harms the nearby people,” he said. He said that the victims of burns included women, children, adults and elderly people, who received 10 to 70pc injuries. He added that most of the affected persons were brought to the centre with burn injuries to eyes, hands, face and other parts of the body.
“To reduce high incidence of burn injuries during Ramazan, we are asking people to exercise restraint and don’t rush through cooking in kitchen to avoid gas leak-induced explosions,” he said.
The director of the burns centre said that people used gas carelessly in kitchen, which led to explosions and fire eruptions. He said that children shouldn’t be allowed in to kitchen. He added that more than 10pc burn injuries entailed high morality, but little care at home could reduce the incidence.
“Due to patients’ load at the centre, we have decided to impart training to general surgeons in management of burns at the district level so they could handle cases in their own hospitals instead of referring them to us, said Prof Tahmeed.
He said that each and every general surgeon working in district and tehsil level hospitals could get one-week free training at the burns centre. “They will be given certificate to cure burn cases,” he added.
He said that above 10pc of burns could be referred to the centre because they required more facilities, which were available at the centre. He said that often 50pc beds at the centre remained occupied by burn patients. He added that 70pc patients were referred to the centre from different districts.
Prof Tahmeed said that many hospitals had burn wards with trained staff but patients were still sent to Peshawar that worsened their condition. He added that most of the injuries were totally preventable provided people took precautionary measures while working in kitchens.
The 120-bed centre, which became operational in 2019, not only treats burns patients but also creates awareness among people about ways to prevent burns and electric injuries to protect them from complications.
“Even if treated, people with burns face health, social, psychological and physical issues. They cannot lead a normal life like before. The sole solution is prevention, which costs nothing but just care,” said the director of the centre.

The retired employees have expressed concerns over the stepmother’s attitude of UET with the pensioners and demanded of Governor Haji Ghulam Ali, the chancellor of the public sector universities in the province, to take notice of the matter.
Talking to this scribe, a number of retired professors, former deans and other retired employees of UET said that salaries and pensions of the government employees were increased at the start of the current financial year. However, they said that the retired employees of UET were yet to see their pension increased as per decision of the government.
They said that it took six months for UET to get the government’s decision approved by its syndicate in December 2022.
The six-month arrears would, however, be released gradually to the serving employees, they said. Similarly, the pensioners would start receiving their increased pension from January 1 as per the decision of the syndicate and their six-months arrears, too, would be issued gradually as per the mechanism adopted by the university in line with its financial status, they said.
The retired employees said the university administration had assured them that they would get their increased pension as well from January. “But four months have also passed of the assurance and no increase has been be made in the pensions,” they added.
They said that the governor should take notice of the situation and ensure release of increased pensions to them.

While talking to local media persons, they said that some part of the busy road in front of Sethi Mills had caved in due to a leaking water pipeline. “We approached the WSSC many times to repair the pipeline but to no avail,” said Waqas Ali, a resident of Amankot.
The locals said that traffic jams at the damaged section were frequent and also cause of several accidents. 
“During the previous three months, the bad shape of the road has caused more than 20 accidents. We have contacted the district administration, WSSC and PKHA but no one paid any heed to our requests to repair the road,” said Abdul Khaliq, another resident of Amankot, adding that during the rainy season, the road presented scene of a big pond.
“I cannot open my shop when there is rain as a big pond of water is created just in front of my shop,” said Khalil Ahmad, a shopkeeper.
The local residents warned the district administration, WSSC, and Pakhtunkhwa Highway Authority that they would stage a protest and block the road to traffic if it was not repaired.
When this scribe contacted Shaida Mohammad, the CEO of WSSC Swat, he said he had directed his staff to repair the pipeline. This scribe tried to contact the district administration, but no one answered the call.
