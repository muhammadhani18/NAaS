Roy Hodgson’s side erased Patrick Bamford’s first half opener with a superb display of counter-attacking at Elland Road.
Marc Guehi equalised just before the break and Palace turned on the style after half-time with emphatic finishes from Jordan Ayew, who netted twice, Eberechi Eze and Odsonne Edouard.
Palace’s first win at Elland Road since 2006 lifted them six points clear of the relegation zone, while Leeds remain just two points adrift of the bottom three.
The south Londoners were without a win in 2023 before Hodgson replaced the sacked Patrick Vieira until the end of the season.The early signs were not encouraging for Palace as Sam Johnstone had to repel Brenden Aaronson’s shot before leaping to his left to save Luis Sinisterra’s stinging strike.
Leeds put pressure on palace and was finally rewarded in the 21st minute when Bamford met Aaronson’s corner with a glancing header that boun­ced in off the far post.
Leeds resumed their barrage, with Jack Harrison’s free-kick palmed away by Johnstone and Robin Koch’s header saved by the over-worked Palace keeper.
Pascal Struijk’s header forced yet another superb save from Johnstone moments later.
But somehow Palace survived the seige and snatched an equaliser in first half stoppage-time.
Eze whipped in a free-kick that Schlupp flicked towards Guehi, who got to the ball before Leeds keeper Illan Meslier and volleyed home from close-range.
Palace were energised by their leveller and took the lead in the 53rd minute.
Ayew had scored only once all season but he rose to meet Olise’s pin-point cross with a fine header that gave Meslier no chance.
Hodgson’s men had all the momentum and they struck again two minutes later as Eze found Olise, raced onto his return pass and slotted home from 10 yards.
With Leeds in disarray, Edouard drove in Palace’s fourth goal from Olise’s pass in the 69th minute and Ayew bagged the fifth with a close-range finish eight minutes later.
CITY ROUT SOUTHAMPTON
On  Saturday, Erling Haaland netted a brilliant bicycle kick as he scored a  brace on his return to Manchester City’s starting line-up after injury  in a 4-1 Premier League win at bottom side Southampton on Saturday.
The  Norwegian took his tally of league goals to 30 for the season as City  snuffed out any ideas Southampton may have had about pulling off an  upset to aid their battle against relegation.
City remain second on 67  points, five behind Arsenal after 29 games of the 38-game season.  Southampton are bottom on 23 points, four behind Everton in 17th.
Haaland  shook off the rust and opened the scoring. After fluffing a couple of  early touches, he found the net for the visitors in the final minute of  the first half, meeting Kevin De Bruyne’s cross with a powerful  close-range header that gave Southampton keeper Gavin Bazunu no  chance.
Jack  Grealish made it 2-0 in the 58th minute, sprinting onto another sublime  pass from De Bruyne before firing a left-foot shot that Bazunu saved,  only for the winger to slam home the rebound with his right to double  City’s advantage.
Grealish turned provider 10 minutes later,  racing away down the left before chipping a cross to Haaland, which the  Norwegian acrobatically volleyed home, landing on the turf and sitting  cross-legged with a broad smile on his face to celebrate.
He was  replaced by Julian Alvarez and though Southampton pulled a goal back  through substitute Sekou Mara in the 72nd minute, they conceded a  penalty almost immediately and Alvarez restored City’s three-goal lead  from the spot.
City manager Pep Guardiola said Haaland  is of the  same calibre as Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo after the  victory.
“We have lived two incredible decades with Cristiano Ronaldo and  Lionel Messi, but he is on that level,” Guardiola told.

1,Bangladesh call up uncapped pacer for Ireland ODIs,DHAKA: Bangladesh on Sunday included uncapped left-arm pacer Mrittunjoy Chowdhury in their squad for the three-match...,"DHAKA: Bangladesh on Sunday included uncapped left-arm pacer Mrittunjoy Chowdhury in their squad for the three-match One-day International series against Ireland next month.
The matches, which will be held at Chelmsford in England on May 9, 12 and 14, are part of the ICC Super League and crucial to Ireland’s chances of qualifying for this year’s World Cup in India.
The 21-year-old Mrittunjoy, a member of Bangladesh’s Under-19 World Cup-winning squad, replaced injured Taskin Ahmed, who had been suffering from a side strain.
Taskin missed the recent one-off Test against Ireland at home due to the injury, which was expected to sideline him for about four weeks.
Bangladesh beat Ireland by seven wickets in the Test after also winning the preceding ODI and Twenty20 series.
Conditions for the matches would be “challenging”, chief selector Minhajul Abedin told reporters while announcing the team.
But he added: “Our team is more experienced now than the past. We have enough ability to adapt quickly.” 
Batsman Liton Das and pacer Mustafizur Rahman, who are playing in the Indian Premier League, have been retained in the squad.
Star all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan, who withdrew from the IPL citing a family emergency, was also retained.
Pace bowler Shoriful Islam returned to the ODI side while left-arm spinner Nasum Ahmed missed out.
Squad: Tamim Iqbal, Liton Das, Rony Talukdar, Najmul Hossain, Towhid Hridoy, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim, Yasir Ali, Mehidy Hasan, Taijul Islam, Ebadot Hossain, Shoriful Islam, Mustafizur Rahman, Hasan Mahmud, Mrittunjoy Chowdhury.

2,Koepka and Rahm set for Masters showdown as Woods withdraws,The final day at Augusta will unfold without golf’s biggest name.,"AUGUSTA: Brooks Koepka and Jon Rahm were poised for a Masters Green Jacket showdown on Sunday on a marathon day of high drama at Augusta National that could be a watershed moment in the LIV Golf and PGA Tour feud.
Even before the first ball was struck, there was a surprise when Tiger Woods announced he was withdrawing from the tournament due to a foot injury, his surgically repaired leg, mangled in a near fatal 2021 car crash, unable to stand up to the challenging weather and demanding course layout.
After two days of interrupted play caused by ferocious winds that toppled trees and lashing rains, the field of 53 returned to the water-logged course to complete the third round with LIV Golf standard bearer Koepka four clear of Spaniard Rahm at the top of the leaderboard.
Although there is plenty of golf to be played, the pair have broken clear of a pack that will need to produce something special to challenge and hope for a stumble by the frontrunners with amateur Sam Bennett lying third, seven shots back.
Critics of LIV Golf have branded the Saudi-bankrolled big-money venture as uncompetitive and little more than a sportwashing enterprise by a country eager to polish its human rights record.
A Koepka victory will not end the human rights questions but would give the rebel circuit some of the credibility and legitimacy it craves. If Koepka or another LIV player were to walk away wearing the Green Jacket it would be a major marketing coup for the rebel circuit which also has British Open champion Cameron Smith of Australia among its members.
The final day at Augusta will unfold without golf’s biggest name after Woods’s withdrawal 75 minutes before third-round play resumed at 8:30am (1230 GMT).
Woods, the last of 54 players to make the cut, was limping down the 17th fairway on six over par through seven holes when play was called off on Saturday due to bad weather.
The 47-year-old American has won the Masters five times, most recently in 2019, but he has struggled since his car crash.
“I am disappointed to have to WD (withdraw) this morning due to reaggravating my plantar fasciitis,” Woods said on Twitter.
“Thank you to the fans and to The Masters who have shown me so much love and support. Good luck to the players today!”  Plantar fasciitis is tissue inflation that causes pain in the heel.
On Saturday, Koepka had extended his  lead to four shots over Spaniard Jon Rahm when third-round play was suspended for the day due to intense rain that waterlogged the course. 
Koepka, who began the day two shots clear of Rahm with amateur Sam  Bennett a further two strokes back, had one birdie through six holes and  was staring at an 11-foot par putt at the seventh when play was  suspended. 
It marked the second consecutive day that rain interrupted play at the year’s first major as 39 golfers returned early on Saturday to complete their second round.

Borussia Dortmund’s 2-1 win over third-placed Union Berlin maintains the  pressure on the perennial German champions’ bid for an 11th straight  Bundesliga title.
The Bavarians, who face Manchester City in the Champions League quarter-final first leg next week, had been beaten at home by Freiburg 2-1 in the DFB Pokal last eight on Tuesday.
Desperate to make amends and protect their Bundesliga lead, Bayern had possession and a couple of good chances in the first half.
But it was Freiburg who came closer to scoring with Ritsu Doan catching Bayern’s Alphonso Davies napping on the stroke of halftime but sending his effort onto the post.
It was De Ligt who took matters into his own hands after the interval, beating keeper Mark Flekken with his unstoppable missile into the top corner.The Bavarians lead the title race on 58 points, with Dortmund on 56 in second place.
A late goal from substitute Youssoufa Moukoko took Dortmund to a nervy victory over Union.
Dortmund  took the lead midway through the first half, Malen poking in a Raphael  Guerreiro cross from close range, his third goal in as many matches.
Union fought back in typical fashion, Kevin Behrens levelling the scores with the away side’s first shot on target.
Dortmund  coach Edin Terzic brought on captain Marco Reus and teenage striker  Moukoko with 15 minutes remaining and the two combined for a crucial  goal in Dortmund’s bid to unseat Bayern as league champions.Union remained third with 51 points, three points ahead of RB Leipzig, who won 1-0 at Hertha Berlin to leapfrog Freiburg into fourth.
With  the first half winding down, Leipzig’s French defender Mohamed Simakan  rose high to meet a corner, with his scuffed shot falling at the feet of  midfielder Amadou Haidara, who tapped home.
Leipzig wasted several chances but held on despite a late charge from Hertha.
Elsewhere, Bayer  Leverkusen won 3-1 at home against Eintracht Frankfurt to leapfrog  their opponents into sixth while goals from Ellyes Skhiri, Eric Martel and Linton Maina secured Cologne a  3-1 win at Augsburg.
Mainz’s  late season run towards a Europa League place took a hit after a 2-2  home draw against Werder Bremen, with each side scoring twice in the  final five minutes.

5,Real Madrid crash to Villarreal defeat as title chances fall further away,"With this solid victory, Real Sociedad are four points clear of Villarreal and six ahead of Betis.","BARCELONA: Samu Chu­k­w­u­eze scored twice to inflict a further blow on Real Madrid’s title hopes as they were beaten 3-2 by Villarreal at home in La Liga on Saturday despite twice taking the lead.
Carlo Ancelotti’s side had been imperious as they thra­shed rivals Barcelona 4-0 at the Camp Nou in the Copa del Rey semi-finals on Wednesday.
Yet they could not build on that momentum as they fell to a defeat that left them on 59 points in second place and opened the door for Barcelona to go 15 points clear at the summit if they beat Girona on Monday.
Real host Chelsea on Wedn­esday in the first leg of their Cham­pions League quarter-final tie.
“It was a difficult game, we had chances and we could have made it 3-1 and slowed down the pace of the game, but it didn’t happen,” Ancelotti told Movistar Plus. “We could have defended better. To be honest, it was hard for us to be 100% motivated, it’s quite normal.”
Real took the lead after 15 minutes when Marco Ase­nsio’s cross bounced off Villarreal’s Pau Torres and into the net for an own goal.
Villarreal found the equaliser in the 39th minute through Chukwueze, who cut inside from the centre of the box and beat Nacho before firing low out of Thibaut Courtois’s reach.
Vinicius Jr restored Real’s lead two minutes into the second half with a simple finish in front of the Villarreal goal for his ninth league strike of the season.
Quique Setien’s side levelled again in the 71st minute when Madrid’s defence failed to clear, allowing Jose Luis Morales to fire home from close range, with VAR overturning the initial offside decision.
Chukwueze scored his second 10 minutes from fulltime with a spectacular strike from the edge of the box into the top-left corner to win the match for Villarreal and silence the home fans at the Santiago Bernabeu.
“It’s a crazy goal,” Chukw­ueze said.  “It’s a dream to score this goal and win here. I’m very happy for this game. The future is going to be much better. I have to take advantage of this moment and keep improving.”
Earlier, Mikel Oyarzabal and Takefusa Kubo struck for Real Sociedad in their comfortable win over Getafe.
Amid  a run of inconsistent form after a strong start to the season, La Real  suffered Europa League elimination and in recent weeks allowed teams to  close in behind them in the hunt for Champions League football.
Atletico Madrid, third, overtook Real Sociedad in March after they dropped points in a draw with lowly Cadiz.
With this solid victory, Real Sociedad are four points clear of Villarreal and six ahead of Betis.
In the night’s other mat­ches, Athletic Bilbao bounced back from their Copa del Rey semi-final defeat  by Osasuna this week with a 2-1 win over Espanyol. Barcelona  winger Ez Abde, on loan at Osasuna, shone and struck twice for the cup  finalists in a 2-1 win over bottom of the table Elche.

With four victories on the trot the country-bred Sardar Gee came rushing from behind at a ferocious speed in the dying strides to nose out bay colt Big Beat at the finish line while bay filly Nimal Princess finished third among seven runners.
In the last seventh and last race of the day, Sardar Gee was piloted home by  Safdar Hussain with a precise judgment to receive a loud applause from the  crowd. 
The bay horse was trained by Khawaja Qamar Hameed and co-owned by Zain-ul-Abideen and Malik Asghar Ali.
A race earlier the rank outsider colt Sword Of Faateh put up a smashing performance to win the Malik Ghulam Nabi Memorial Cup run over 1100 metres. 
Riden by Deenar Mirwani, the colt blitzed down the home stretch to beat front-running colt Shaman by about two lengths. 
Chestnut colt Timeline finished third while the favourite colt Sir occupied the fourth berth in a very dismal show.

7,"Lazio down Juve to cement second place, Roma go third",MILAN: Sergej Milinkovic-Savic and Mattia Zaccagni scored as Lazio showed a ruthless attacking streak to beat Juventus 2-1,"

ROME: Juventus’ Angel Di Maria controls the ball during the Serie A match against Lazio at Stadio Olimpico.—AFP

 
MILAN: Sergej Milinkovic-Savic and Mattia Zaccagni scored as Lazio showed a ruthless attacking streak to beat Juventus 2-1 at home on Saturday while Paulo Dybala moved Roma just behind their capital city rivals with the only goal at Torino.
Lazio have 58 points, five ahead of AS Roma in third with nine matches left in the campaign. Juve, who are fighting for a place in the top six, are seventh with 44 points, four points behind Atalanta, who occupy the final European qualification spot.
Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri was absent from the match due to flu symptoms and assistant manager Marco Landucci replaced him.
The hosts broke the deadlock seven minutes before the interval when Milinkovic-Savic converted a cross inside the box with a half-volley from close range.
The goal was given after a VAR check after Juve defender Alex Sandro appeared to be pushed prior to Milinkovic-Savic finding the net.
Yet the euphoria inside the Stadio Olimpico lasted only four minutes before Adrien Rabiot bundled in the equaliser from a corner, after Lazio keeper Ivan Provedel had saved Gleison Bremer’s header.
Although the match was evenly contested, Lazio’s second goal in the 53rd minute was an impressive demonstration of the team’s attacking ability.
Felipe Anderson pulled the ball back from the right towards Luis Alberto, who back-heeled it into the area where an unmarked Zaccagni placed it into the bottom-left 
corner.In the night’s other fixture, Dybala fires Roma into the third place.
The Argentinian has been Roma’s talisman since arriving as a free agent last  summer, and he was once again key when he confidently netted his 11th  league goal of the season in the eighth minute in Turin from the penalty  spot.
Dybala’s strike was enough for Jose Mourinho’s solid side to leapfrog both Milan and Inter Milan.
It  was a classic Mourinho-style performance from Roma, a traditionally  flaky team who have become an extremely well-drilled outfit and could  make Europe’s top competition next season as a result.
Elsewhere, smart second-half  finishes from Nicola Sansone and Riccardo Orsolini at Atalanta moved  eighth-placed Bologna to within five points of their opponents, who sit  sixth and in the Europa Conference League spot. 
Thiago  Motta’s team are two points ahead of Fiorentina, whose winning run ended  at nine matches after M’Bala Nzola’s goal gave  Spezia a 1-1 draw in Florence.
Adolfo Gaich’s stoppage-time strike gave Verona a  potentially huge 2-1 win over Sassuolo while Sampdoria are heading  towards Serie B as two late goals from Luka Lochoshvili and  Leonardo Sernicola gave Cremonese a dramatic 3-2 away win in Genoa and  left their distraught hosts bottom of the division.

8,Messi and Ramos give PSG win to ease pressure on coach Galtier,Those losses had piled the pressure on Galtier amid reports he may not even see out the season.,"PARIS: Lionel Messi scored one goal and set up another for Sergio Ramos as Paris St-Germain won 2-0 at Nice on Saturday to restore their six-point lead at the top of the Ligue 1 table and ease the pressure on coach Christophe Galtier.
Messi converted a Nuno Mendes cross in the 26th minute before Gianluigi Donnarumma produced several key saves and Dante was denied by the woodwork as PSG’s goal lived a charmed life on the Cote d’Azur.
Ramos then ended any doubt about the outcome when he headed in a Messi corner with 14 minutes remaining, as PSG bounced back from suffering consecutive home defeats.
Those losses had piled the pressure on Galtier amid reports he may not even see out the season.
The result clearly meant a lot to Galtier, who was in charge at Nice last season and expressed his displeasure at a banner unfurled by the home supporters aimed at his mother.
It was a first defeat in 15 matches in all competitions for Nice since Didier Digard replaced Lucien Favre as coach in January.
The Ineos-owned club remain eighth in the table.
Messi’s 14th Ligue 1 goal of the campaign that opened the scoring came at the end of a week in which it emerged he was likely to leave Paris when his contract expires in the summer.
Donnarumma saved well from Nicolas Pepe and Terem Moffi before half-time, and Dante then sent an effort off the underside of the bar six minutes into the second half, with the ball bouncing down onto the line and then hitting the post.
Ramos made it 2-0 but there was still time for Danilo Pereira to head against his own crossbar late on.
Earlier, bottom side Angers claimed their first Ligue 1 win since September as they beat European hopefuls Lille 1-0.
Substitute Halid Sabanovic scrambled in the only goal of the match with six minutes left as Angers ended a run of 21 matches without a win.
That means they will not match the French top-flight record for the most games without a win in a single season — that record is held by Arles-Avignon who went 23 matches without a victory in 2010/11.
They nevertheless remain seven points adrift at the bottom of the table and 12 away from safety with only eight games left.

9,Zaman eyes opportunities to win matches for Pakistan,"The slingy pacer, who has consistently shined in death overs in domestic cricket and PSL over the past two to three years, is ready to wait for his chance.","

PAKISTAN pacer Zaman Khan speaks during a media talk.—White Star

 
LAHORE: Zaman Khan has only bolstered what was already a lethal Pakistan pace attack and the emerging right-armer will have to compete hard to cement a place in the national side. 
He put on a decent show in his debut series against Afghanistan, in which Pakistan went with a young side. 
But with the seniors back for the upcoming Twenty International series against New Zealand, Zaman may not play all matches with the likes of Shaheen Shah Afridi, Haris Rauf and Naseem Shah fully fit and available.
The slingy pacer, who has consistently shined in death overs in domestic cricket and the HBL Pakistan Super League over the past two to three years, however, is ready to wait for his chance.
“Every bowler is different; some are good with the new ball and some are good at the death,” he told reporters on the sidelines of Pakistan’s ongoing preparatory camp for the New Zealand matches. 
“It is for the management to decide where they bring me into use but whenever I get the chance I’ll try my best to win matches for Pakistan.”
Although Zaman and co. ended up losing the three-match T20I series against Afghanistan 2-1, the youngster is more positive about the New Zealand series, given the side is not strengthened with its seasoned members. 
“Against Afghanistan the conditions were a bit different and the players were new, he said. “In the New Zealand series we will have the home advantage as well as our senior players. 
“If you have the likes of Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan in the team, it boosts the confidence of all the other players and winning matches becomes considerably easy.”
Zaman is a find of PSL franchise Lahore Qalandars’ Player Devel­opment Progr­amme, which also unearthed Haris, while the side turned Shaheen into a superstar. 
Zaman said life would have been different for him had it not been for the franchise.
“Before playing for Lahore Qalandars, life was difficult,” he said. “But after that, things really improved for me. 
Shaheen Bhai and Haris Bhai supported me a lot, doing net practice with them, playing matches with them have helped me learn a lot. 
“We won two finals together and hopefully in the future as well I would like to keep learning.”
