0,Situationer: Judiciary-govt standoff may see an eventful day,The bewildered nation will be focused on the capital’s Constitution Avenue on Monday.,"AMID prevailing political and economic crises, the bewildered nation will be focused on the capital’s Constitution Avenue on the opening day of the new week on Monday (today) as the government is set to get approval of the controversial law clipping the suo motu powers of the chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) in the joint sitting of parliament, coinciding with the golden jubilee celebrations of the signing of the 1973 Constitution.
Besides regular and separate sittings of the National Assembly and Senate, Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf has convened a special “National Constitution Conven­tion” in the NA hall.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has also convened another special meeting of the federal cabinet before the joint sitting of parliament, rescheduled to meet at 4pm, to discuss the strategy to counter the March 30 Supreme Court’s verdict seeking general elections in Punjab on May 14. The apex court in its verdict had set April 10 deadline for the federal government to provide Rs21 billion to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for holding the elections to Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa assemblies.
Since there are reports that the government might not release the required funds, the ECP is also expected to meet on Monday as it would be required to present a report before the three-member bench headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial on Tuesday (tomorrow) in this regard.
 
 

And adjacent to the Parliament House, CJP Bandial in his chambers will be examining the federal government’s request to withdraw the infamous curative review petition which was moved against Justice Qazi Faez Isa, a sitting Supreme Court judge, by the previous Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government. The case pertains to investigations by tax authorities into three properties in the names of the wife and children of Justice Isa.
Amid all these activities, the much intriguing will be the joint session of parliament where the government is set to approve the Supreme Court Practice and Procedure Bill 2023 with some amendments. The said bill had been returned to parliament by PTI-backed President Dr Arif Alvi on Sunday, prompting a strong reaction and protest by the ruling coalition. Expressing dismay over the move, Prime Minister Sharif had accused the president of belittling his office.
Political and judicial quagmire thickened when the federal cabinet on Sunday after a special meeting declared that it remained unable to reach a decision regarding the release of funds to the ECP for the elections owing to the prevailing poor economic situation and decided to meet again and leave the matter to be decided by parliament.
A special National Constitution Convention will also be held between the National Assembly and Senate sittings in the morning and the joint session in the afternoon. A ceremony to lay the constitution monument’s cornerstone will also take place. It has been anticipated that the monument would be finished before August 14. The monument would serve as a symbol of Pakistan’s commitment to democracy and its adherence to the principles enshrined in the Constitution.
The National Assembly Secretariat issued the agenda for the joint session which included the controversial SC bill, besides having a debate on “the national issues in order to create awareness and building consensus”. The issues included law and order and terrorism, economic policy, respect for national institutions, China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, population explosion and climate change impacts.
The lawmakers have been holding debate on all these issues simultaneously for the past couple of joint sittings as well as in the National Assembly, but they have been mostly targeting the judiciary in their speeches for allegedly having a tilt towards PTI Chairman Imran Khan and giving verdicts in his favour. The government and the opposition in the National Assembly, comprising the PTI dissidents, have been demanding constitution of a full court bench to hear the polls’ delay case, instead of the selective three-judge bench.
 
 

After the issuance of the detailed verdict by another SC judge Athar Minallah against the three-judge bench decision, the ruling coalition has now even raised the demand of the CJP’s resignation.
Also, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) will be taking up the petition in which PTI challenged the ban on the live telecast of Imran Khan’s speeches by Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra).
Interestingly, all these happenings are coinciding with the 25th anniversary of the Ojhri Camp disaster which had been remembered as a day of mass mourning until few years back to remember the day in 1988 when in the early morning, the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi received a dreadful shock. It all began with a low-density explosion at the Ojhri Camp, an ammunition depot situated at the centre of Islamabad and Rawalpindi, followed by a huge one, after which all kinds of missiles, rockets and projectiles started raining down in all directions. The investigations of the incident in which over 100 people had lost their lives remain inconclusive to this day.
Business will be as usual in the Senate where the highlight would be the passage of a resolution of reminding the state of its responsibilities of promoting educational and economic interests of the backward classes, raising standards of living of people, controlling food inflation, and restarting Ehsas Ration programme.
The Senate Secretariat has issued a 22-point agenda for the private member’s day which includes introduction of a number of bills.
On the other hand, the National Assembly Secretariat has also issued a seven-point agenda which includes two call attention notices “regarding smuggling of Indian Chalia, Gutka, Mawa and other harmful substances through Afghanistan border” and “charging of enormous electricity rates from tube wells for agriculture consumption”.

1,PTI issues scathing ‘white paper’ on PDM’s rule,"Imran says political parties cannot be crushed through violence, asks supporters to be ready for street protests as govt won’t hold polls.","LAHORE: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf launched a white paper on Sunday to mark the first year of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) — a multi-party coalition that ousted Imran Khan-led government via a no-trust vote in April last year — in power and underlined how the ruling coalition had “devastated” economy and “contravened” the Constitution.
The document spans six chapters and passes a scathing judgement on the PDM government’s style of governance, particularly the treatment meted out to the opposition party by the ruling coalition. It also deliberates on issues related to economy, Constitution, democracy and rule of law, political exploitation of state institutions, attack on judiciary, ‘chained’ foreign policy, and law and order.
 






The party has dedicated the white paper to PTI chief Imran Khan, party workers, and the people of Pakistan, who are “fighting and facing torture for real independence” and democracy.
The PTI chairman also spoke via video link from his residence in Zaman Park on the launch of the white paper. The former premier accused the government of ravaging the country’s all institutions, rule of law, and the economy as well as violations of basic human rights.

Imran says political parties cannot be crushed through violence, asks supporters to be ready for street protests as govt won’t hold polls

Mr Khan claimed that the federal government would not allow elections to be held as per the court order and urged his supporters to remain prepared to take to the streets for the sake of basic human rights and justice. Stating that the nation was now awake to protect its rights and standing with the judiciary, Mr Khan said the nation would be required to come out on roads in both situations — either the government does not hold elections, or elections are held after a crackdown on PTI with its leadership incarcerated. “We should be ready for all kinds of situations,” he asserted.
 






Imran Khan accused former army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa of hatching a conspiracy alongside PM Shehbaz Sharif to topple his government with the help of former envoy Hussain Haqqani.
Mr Khan asked, “Would anyone question the man (Bajwa) who ravaged the country’s all indicators for his extension which was promised by present PM Shehbaz Sharif.”
Mr Khan also admitted that the conspiracy to overthrow his government was not hatched in the US. It was actually Gen Bajwa who had orchestrated the conspiracy with the help of Shehbaz Sharif and then hired Hussain Haqqani to launch propaganda that “Gen Bajwa was pro-America and Imran Khan was anti-America”. “The cipher made entry came only after the conspiracy had taken its roots,” the former premier acknowledged.
On the day when he left the PM office with “only a diary in his hand”, Mr Khan said the PTI had launched a white paper that what actually had happened to Pakistan during the past year. He said the nation must know the fate of Pakistan just because a few people took a decision behind closed doors.
Mr Khan said his government inherited a bankrupt economy in 2018 when Pakistan was facing its highest $20 billion current account deficit with only $8 billion in reserves. “The PTI government stabilised the economy…fought against the coronavirus pandemic…eventually boosted the economy to rise by 5.7 per cent and 6 per cent during the last two years of its rule,” he asserted.
He lamented the growth rate had now slid down to 0.4 per cent which has pushed at least four million people below the poverty line. “The 12 per cent inflation has now risen to almost 35 per cent,” he added.
Stating the PDM government faced no crisis and still blowing the trumpet of the rise in terrorism, Mr Khan claimed there was a grave surge in terror incidents during the PTI government but it controlled the “menace and drove Pakistan from terrorism to tourism”. He claimed the incumbent rulers did not rehabilitate the TTP when the Afghan Taliban sent them back to Pakistan. It may be noted here that the PTI government had planned to resettle TTP militants in tribal districts.
Speaking about the prohibited funding case, Imran Khan claimed, “The foreign funding case has ended and the Toshakhana case will meet the same fate…Nawaz Sharif and Asif Ali Zardari would now be caught in this case.” The Toshakhana record was now available and their act of stealing cars would be exposed soon, he claimed.
Mr Khan said the PDM government also attacked the media, imposed restrictions through “unidentified people” and now it was coercing TV channels not to broadcast his speeches. “This is a state of freedom of speech that even the head of the country’s biggest political party is not allowed to speak to the masses,” he regretted. He said the PDM government also desecrated the fundamental rights of people by unleashing torture on PTI leaders and workers in Lahore on May 25 last year.
The PTI chairman said a political party that wanted free and fair elections as this was the only way to end the crises faced by Pakistan. He added that the party never wanted to be part of any violence and give the government a chance to postpone elections. “The government tried its utmost that the PTI leaders and workers would react and it could claim that the security situation was not normal to hold elections,” Mr Khan claimed.
 






Among “144 cases instituted” against him, the PTI chief said that he had also been implicated in a treason case by a magistrate since he had called an intelligence agency officer ‘Dirty Harry’ and a ‘psychopath’. The PTI chief also narrated attacks on his life and said the JIT record that was exposing the government’s three functionaries’ plans to “eliminate him” was sabotaged.
Giving a message to the “all-powerful” and Nawaz Sharif for making a ‘London Plan’, the PTI chief said political parties could not be crushed by violence, torture, and harassment tactics. He stressed every individual should be brought under the law and said “a woman” was chiding the judiciary and the judges but no one was holding her accountable.

2,‘Grand operation’ against katcha area outlaws starts in Punjab,"11,000 police personnel taking part in action; IGP Usman Anwar says facilitators based in riverbeds being treated as terrorists.","RAHIM YAR KHAN: An alleged gangster was killed while his six accomplices and a policeman were injured after Punjab police launched a ‘grand operation’ against robbers and kidnappers in the katcha area of the Indus near the Sindh border on Sunday.
Punjab Inspector Gene­ral of Police (IGP) Dr Usman Anwar at a presser at the DPO office here said an intelligence-based operation against the outlaws was already in progress for the last few months after kidnap-for-ransom cases increased this year.
He said the grand operation was launched in the early hours of Sunday on the reports of a premiere intelligence agency of the country and the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) of Punjab.
Dr Anwar said both the agencies were keeping an eye on the activities of criminals in the area and their facilitators. “We are treating the facilitators based in the riverbed as terrorists and warned them against giving shelters to the outlaws.”

11,000 police personnel taking part in action

Sources said the operation was started in Machka and Katcha Karachi areas where several hideouts of the criminal were eliminated. They said the IGP and his team came under fire when they reached Machka.
The IGP said mainstreaming the katcha area dwellers by opening schools, dispensaries and building roads along the river was necessary to stop misuse of the territory. The IGP said office of the CTD head is being shifted to Rahim Yar Khan till the completion of the operation. “To maintain law and order in the area, there is a need of a very strict operation to clear the area from criminals.”
He said according to the National Security Council (NSC) decisions all resources would be provided to the police. He said it was an ideal time for police to establish/restore check posts in the area before monsoon.
A press release issued by the office of the Regional Police Officer of Bahawalpur Rai Babar Saeed identified the dead as Mustafa who was killed during the exchange of fire. The RPO said 11,000 police personnel drawn from other police ranges had participated in Sunday’s operation. They included 5,000 personnel from the Punjab Cons­tabulary and 2,000 from Multan, DG Khan and Bahawalpur police ranges.
Meanwhile, Dacoits looted Rs1.1 million, snatched a bike and iPhone from a trader near the Dashti Farm area of Machka at 6pm when the IGP was leading the operation, it is learnt Katcha area 
The Indus bed falling between Rahim Yar Khan and Rajanpur districts is 15 to 20km wide where water runs in the shape of large and small steams for 10 to 11 months in a year. It is completely filled during monsoon floods.
The kacha area which stretches up to Dehrki and Obaro in Sindh is over 100km long. So far six major operations have been carried out in the area since 2006.During the 2016 operation against the Chotu gang, army was called out after police failure to clear the area.
The IGP did not agree with a questioner that main police operations in the area had been carried out in the past during the wheat harvesting season and bulk of the yield was taken away by the personnel posted or patrolling in the area.
Honey trap 
During the last two years, the gangsters had changed their kidnap strategy. They now phone their potential victims and lure them through girls with marriage offers. Through this mode, they would strike in the entire Punjab. In a couple of cases, their victims came from Peshawar.
In some cases, they would attract people by offering them used tractors, cars and bikes at cheap prices.

4,"Govt set to push shift from gas to electricity, energy-efficient buildings",Plans 10-year transition strategy under a project envisaging annual savings of over Rs500bn.,"ISLAMABAD: The government plans to embark on a 10-year transition strategy to shift from gas to electricity in commercial, industrial and residential sectors, and push energy-efficient buildings under a Rs45 billion energy efficiency and conservation project, which envisages energy savings of over Rs500bn a year.
The project was formally cleared by the Central Development Working Party a few days ago for negotiations with the World Bank for a $150 million loan, including a $15m technical grant for capacity-building of the National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority. However, it was observed that a 10-year transition period was too long and should be minimised.
The project’s sponsors — the Ministry of Science and Technology and the Energy Efficiency Authority — have reported to the Planning Commission that Pakistan’s current energy-saving potential was around 10m to 12m tonnes of oil equivalent — a unit of energy defined as the amount of energy released by burning one tonne of crude oil.
The country’s current primary energy supply stands at about 95m tonnes of oil equivalent and is projected to go beyond 115m in 2025 at an annual growth rate of 5.8pc, as its per-capita energy consumption is expected to increase from 405 kilograms of oil equivalent to 469kg during the period.

Plans 10-year transition strategy under a project envisaging annual savings of over Rs500bn

High energy intensity combined with the high and increasing cost of energy in Pakistan has serious implications for disposable incomes and for economic competitiveness.
 
 

Energy costs already represent over one-fourth of average household expenditure, and with ongoing tariff reform measures required to reduce the circular debt issue, this percentage would rise further.
For industry, the combination of costly and inefficient use of energy puts Pakistan at a significant competitive disadvantage, especially in internationally exposed sectors of the economy.
The project aims to reduce fossil fuel imports, leading to foreign exchange savings and improving the country’s fiscal situation, cut household expenditures, especially on heating and cooling needs, and foster a green and efficient economy, thus supporting Pakistan’s objective to reach upper-middle-income status by 2047 — when the country turns 100.
The project also aims to help meet nationally determined contributions goals by reducing 20pc of the total projected greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. The energy sector would be the main focus for emission reduction as it contributes 46pc of the total emissions.
According to a study conducted by the World Bank for the project, a 25pc reduction in building energy use across all sectors could translate into energy savings of 16 gigawatt-hours, providing cost savings of about Rs291bn per year.
The efficiency gains by shifting gas consumption to electricity could go significantly beyond Rs250bn per year — another component of the multi-purpose project.
Most buildings in Pakistan were not constructed with high energy-efficiency standards, resulting in significant unnecessary energy consumption and costs for consumers.
Besides, in some parts of the country, space heating is required in winter along with inefficient heating of water, which is another drain on depleting domestic gas supplies.
In summer, inefficient buildings lead to higher cooling demand, particularly during peak hours, putting a strain on the national grid and requiring the use of expensive and polluting peaking plants.
The project will involve energy audits and benchmarking of all large federally owned buildings, demonstration of deep energy efficiency retrofits of several ‘showcase’ buildings and development of standardised materials and specifications to support the retrofitting of buildings in the commercial, public and residential sectors.
The project would help the development of building design templates that can be freely provided to housing authorities, relevant government departments and businesses to enable them to specify and construct new energy-efficient buildings as per new “green building codes”.
The building sector consumes 26pc of the total gas consumption in the country, mostly for space and water heating in a highly inefficient manner at the most subsidised rates in the absence of any regulations and standards for appliances.
Strangely, access to the piped gas network is 24pc, whereas access to electricity is more than 73pc. On top of that, with gas shortages every winter, rising gas prices and the country’s increasing reliance on imported liquefied natural gas, an energy efficiency initiative becomes more critical.
The National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority has estimated that savings of 10-12pc in winter and 20-25pc in summer utility bills can be achieved by using inverter air conditioners.
In winter, around 46 million standard cubic feet per day of gas would be saved by switching from gas heaters to inverter ACs.
This component will therefore support a gradual shift from gas to electricity to meet heating requirements in the targeted sectors.
This would be carried out in parallel with changes to building designs and codes to ensure improving the energy efficiency of buildings and delivering a coordinated approach that considers both the thermal insulation of buildings and also the efficiency of heat and cooling services provided within them.
Based on current analysis and ongoing studies, the project will involve launching a trade-in scheme for households and businesses to voluntarily replace their inefficient gas geysers or boilers and space heaters with electrically powered alternatives.
This will be based on heat pump technology and replacement of inefficient heating technologies and the upgradation of processes, in particular those that promote a shift from gas to electricity in industrial sectors based on a revolving loan fund to also provide credit lines to households and businesses.

5,Cabinet to place polls funds issue before parliament today,"Resolves to meet today again to chalk out line of action; minister proposes ""hardline"" approach towards president.","• Resolves to meet today again to chalk out line of action
• Endorses decisions taken by National Security Committee
• Ministers propose ‘hardline’ approach towards president
LAHORE: A meeting of the federal cabinet on Sunday decided to refer to parliament the issue of the release of funds to the Election Commission of Pakistan for holding elections in Punjab on May 14 as ordered by the Supreme Court.
The meeting chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif at his Model Town residence continued for more than two hours. No agenda had been issued before the meeting.
 






Most cabinet members, including Riaz Pirzada, Sajid Toori, Maulana Abdul Wasae, Hashim Notezai and Amir Muqam, participated in the meeting through a video link. Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, Khawaja Saad Rafique, Azam Nazeer Tarar, Atta Tarar and others joined it from Lahore.
A strategy to address the matters surrounding the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Bill 2023, besides the Punjab election funds, came up for discussion during the huddle.
A participant said that the cabinet could not agree on the suggestion that the funds should be partially released to avert any adverse Supreme Court ruling for violation of its April 4 verdict in which the federal government had been asked to release Rs21 billion by April 10 for holding polls in Punjab. He said the meeting decided to expand its consultation on the issue and referred the matter to parliament, whose joint session is scheduled for Monday afternoon.
He said the meeting also approved the decisions taken by the National Security Committee (NSC) on Friday regarding anti-terrorism operations to nip militancy in the bud. He said that at one point government officials were sent out of the meeting for some off-the-record discussion among the cabinet members.
He added that some members suggested not to compromise on the supremacy of parliament and proposed a hardline approach against President Arif Alvi, who sent back the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Bill 2023 instead of signing it into law.
In a hint that the government is not ready to hold the polls as per the top court verdict, Planning and Development Minister Ahsan Iqbal said in Narowal that elections in the country would be held simultaneously in the month of October. He said holding polls in Punjab prior to other provinces would create trouble and the country had suffered results of such elections in the year 1971.
 
 

Talking to the media in Model Town, PM’s special assistant Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan said the government would take no unconstitutional steps. However, he said there were two apex court “verdicts: one by four judges and the other by three. And [the government is confused on] what is the real verdict?” He said Justice Athar Minallah’s decision raised many new questions.
He said the government believed in holding simultaneous general polls across the country. About the Constitution’s article that calls for holding polling within 90 days after the dissolution of an elected house, he said that there are also other articles in the Constitution that need to be fulfilled.
Indirectly criticising some “pro-PTI” decisions of the Supreme Court, he said the country is suffering from politics in courts and referred to Justice Minallah’s note which said that courts are not a forum for raising political questions.
Meanwhile, a press release issued after the cabinet meeting said that the huddle discussed in detail the court’s 4-3 verdict and also the resolution adopted by the National Assembly on April 6, 2023. It said Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar briefed the meeting about different legal and constitutional aspects.
After a threadbare discussion and consultation on the issue, the cabinet unanimously directed the finance ministry to consult the law ministry for preparing a summary to get guidance from the parliament on the matter and present it before the cabinet meeting to be held again on April 10 (today) for making a decision on the future line of action, concluded the statement.
Meanwhile, Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb stated that significant decisions might be taken in the huddle today (Monday). A source in the government told Dawn that Sharifs were in complete mood to defy the CJP-led three-member bench’s decision to hold elections in the province on May 14 and there was no secret in it.
