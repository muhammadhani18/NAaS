South SSP Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that Imran Ali, 32 suffered a bullet wound in the foot. He was shifted to the South City Hospital where his condition was stated to be stable.
He said that four suspects arrived at the driveway of McDonald in an SUV and asked for food. The staff told them that the time to serve food was over and they were having Sehri for themselves. As the staff asked them to leave, one of the suspects — who was reportedly intoxicated — got enraged, pulled out a rifle and started firing. One of the bullets hit the manager when he tried to come out to see what’s going on.
A case was registered at the Darakhshan police station under Section 324 (attempted murder) against unknown persons on the complaint of victim Ali. He stated in the FIR that the incident took place at around 4.45am. He said that the suspects escaped in their vehicle.

1,Christian community in Karachi celebrates Easter,"Priests at churches light the big Easter candle with a cross on it, bless it and then take it around the church to light other candles with it.","KARACHI: The Chris­tian community celebrated Easter Sunday with much joy and happiness. The celebrations in all the city’s churches began early, at midnight with a big Sunday mass.
While just two days ago, on Good Friday, there were no church bells or lighting of candles, for Easter there was a candlelight vigil at midnight. And there were also the bells ringing, calli­ng everyone to chur­ch, announcing that Christ has risen.
It was the celebration of new life. The priests at churches lit the big Easter candle with a cross on it, blessed it and then took it around the church for others who had brought their own candles for midnight mass to light them with it and spread the light. In the background, the Church choir sang sweet and happy hymns.
After the midnight mass, which went on till around 2.30am, there is the morning mass. It is attended by all those who might have missed the midnight mass. Everyone looks happy and fresh. Everyone wears new clothes that may have not been very prominent earlier at midnight. It is time to celebrate and rejoice.
Meanwhile, the city’s bakeries were selling Easter eggs. The eggs signify new life. Easter eggs that are sold at the bakeries are not the usual chicken eggs that you can boil, fry or prepare omelettes with. These are hollow eggs, bigger in size than usual eggs, stuffed with goodies.
Some have a hard marzipan shell and when you shake them you can tell that they have sweets inside. Some are made of chocolate. At the United Bakery in Saddar this year, they had Easter eggs of all flavours. The ones wrapped in golden foil were chocolate, while the ones in red, blue and green foil were strawberry, vanilla and mint. The chocolate ones got sold out first.
Children also prepare their own Easter eggs at home by painting and decorating egg shells. There are also very expensive Easter eggs sold abroad that are studded with precious stones and used as jewellery boxes as well as eggs that are themselves the jewels and passed on through generations as precious heirlooms.
Another fun character seen around this time is the Easter Bunny. The smiling Easter Bunny is usually carrying a load of Easter eggs in its basket. The bunny is an Easter symbol because it represents fertility, springtime and hence new life.

2,Sindh govt shelves plan to increase fare of Peoples Bus Service,Operations of electric buses expanded to Bahria Town as 3 more routes announced; condemns killing of IBA-Sukkur teacher Dr Ajmal Sawand.,"

Information Minister Shajeel Memon speaks at the press conference on Sunday.—PPI

 
KARACHI: The Sindh government on Sunday announced that three more routes of the electric bus Service would start operation between April 13 and 18 and one of the routes would cover Bahria Town Karachi, a gated housing society located on the outskirts of the metropolis.
Sindh Information Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon, who also holds the portfolio of transport, also declared that his government had dropped a proposal to increase the fare of the Peoples Bus Service in view of rising inflation.
“Three new routes of electric buses are being introduced in the blessed month of Ramazan,” Sindh Information Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon, told a press conference. 
The minister said that the first of the three new routes would cover areas between Al-Asif Square in Sohrab Goth and Tank Chowk in Malir Canton­ment. It would become operational on April 13.

Operations of electric buses expanded to Bahria Town as three more routes announced

Buses on the second route will ferry passengers from Bahria Town Karachi to Tank Chowk, Malir Cant, from where people can take buses on an already operational route up to Naumaish. This route will become operational on April 14, he added.
“The third route, which will become operational from April 18, will start from North Karachi and culminate and Dockyard via New Karachi, Al-Asif Square, Ayesha Manzil, Guru Mandir, Empress Market and I. I. Chundrigar Road,” he added.
“This is the true reflection of the leadership of the Pakistan Peoples Party and Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah who are giving top priority to Karachi and its people. Our chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari personally monitors all development projects in the metropolis,” he said.
To a question, he said that the transport department had shelved the proposal to increase the fares of the Peoples Bus Service after the Sindh chief minister instructed to provide as much relief to the people amid growing inflation.
“As of today, each route of the Peoples Bus Service on average covers a distance of 30-40 kilometres in just Rs50 per passenger which is less than the cost of motorcycle fuel,” he added.
He said that the Sindh government has so far provided Rs2,000 each to more than 2.93 million families.
Condemns Sawand’s murder
To a question about the killing of Dr Ajmal Sawand, a prominent teacher associated with the Institute of Business Admin­istration-Sukkur, in Kandhkot, the minister said that the Sindh government had strongly condemned the incident.
“The chief minister has already taken notice of the incident and whoever is involved in this crime will be dealt with iron hand. The murderers will be arrested soon,” he added.
Criticising President Arif Alvi for returning legislation involving the Supreme Court, the information minister said that the president by doing so in fact questioned the authority and supremacy of parliament.
He advised Dr Alvi to stay from “politicising” the constitutional office of the president.
“Please resign from your office if you [Dr Alvi] want to play the role of a member of the Imran Khan’s tiger force,” he said. “We do not want to see our institutions scandalised.”
Referring to former prime minister Imran Khan, he said that the man who was removed by the no-confidence motion was still trying to harm the country.

The arrests were made in joint raids carried out by Rangers and police in Saddar, Manghopir and Banaras areas.
A spokesperson for the paramilitary force identified the suspects as Mohammed Kamal Khan and Abdul Qadir and said that they were involved in targeted killings and extortion racket.
He said that the suspects demanded protection money from a local trader by using different SIM cards of Pakistan and Afghanistan. He said that their handler, identified as Afsar Khan, was based in Afghanistan.
They used to share cell phone numbers of different traders of Karachi with Afsar Khan. They also sent the money to Afghanistan, he said.
“During questioning, the suspects have confessed to have shared five cell phone numbers of different traders of Karachi with their handlers in Afghanistan, demanding bhatta and killing two traders over non-payment,” said the Rangers spokesperson.
The suspects have been handed over to police for further legal proceedings.

4,"‘Up to 8m Karachiites’ may remain uncounted in census, fears MQM-P","Party statement says ""majority of high-rise residential buildings remain uncounted""; warns of sit-in on Sharea Faisal if concerns not addressed.","KARACHI: Raising serious concerns over the ongoing digital census, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) on Sunday accused the authorities of deliberately keeping the count of Karachi population lower than the real and warned that if its concerns were not addressed, the party could take to streets and stage a sit-in on Sharea Faisal.
It also expressed the apprehension that up to ‘eight million’ people might remain uncounted in Karachi alone.
First, it was a meeting of the party’s coordination committee, where a number of issues, including the current political situation, national economy and ongoing digital census, were discussed.
A statement issued after the meeting, which was chaired by party convener Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, said that the MQM-P wasn’t satisfied with the so far progress of the digital census and warned that such an exercise would not give the required results.

Warns to stage sit-in on Sharea Faisal if concerns not addressed

“There are several areas mainly in Karachi and Hyderabad where enumerators have not reached yet and people remain uncounted,” the party said in the statement.
“Similarly, enumerators deliberately kept the number of population low wherever the digital census was conducted. For instance, a family of eight or nine is recorded as a unit of four or five people. Majority of high-rise residential buildings remain uncounted where people are still waiting for enumerators,” it added.
The coordination committee warned that with such flaws in the process,  there was a strong possibility that ‘seven to eight million’ people might remain uncounted in Karachi and it would not serve the purpose of the multi-billion rupee exercise.
Later, addressing an Iftar-dinner organised by the party in North Nazimabad, senior MQM-P leader Dr Farooq Sattar said that the party’s concerns remained largely unaddressed and it would only push it to take to streets to register their protest.
“This census is a matter of life and death for people of Karachi and urban Sindh,” he said. “The people at the helm and mainly the Pakistan Peoples Party know it well that if the fair census is held, the next chief minister of Sindh would be from urban Sindh.”
“So every effort is being made to manipulate the original population count. But if they aren’t counted fairly, we would take to streets and converge on Sharea Faisal to prove the real population of this city,” he said.
He said that it was sheer injustice to the people of Karachi that their basic constitutional right was being violated and they were deprived of their due share in the national resources by a flawed digital census.

5,Victims of street crime in Karachi share stories of distrust in police,"In many cases, police grill victims instead of taking prompt action; several incidents go unreported due to police behaviour.","KARACHI: While official figures indicate that over 21,000 cases of street crime took place in the first three months of 2023, the actual figure appears to be way higher than the reported one as a large number of victims were either denied registration of FIRs or they themselves chose not to approach law enforcers due to lack of trust in them.
According to police, incidents of mobile phone snatching, robberies and motorcycle/car snatching has fallen in the category of street crime. In 2022, around 85,000 cases, while 21,544 such cases were reported during the current year till March 31.
While 34 innocent citizens were killed by muggers over resistance in the metropolis during the first three months, the Karachi police claimed to have killed over a dozen criminals in encounters and arrested over 650.
Thousands of people have been deprived of either their cell phone or their motorcycle in the metropolis during the current year. Most of them reported the incident to police, but there are several incidents that have gone unreported.

In many cases, police grill victims instead of taking prompt action; several incidents go unreported due to police behaviour

Dawn spoke to many victims of street crime who opted to go to police stations concerned to report a crime but despite several visits failed to get their FIR registered.
A young man, Muhammad Kashif, told Dawn he had become a victim of the street crime five times in three years, but he never succeeded in getting an FIR registered. “Every time, they [police] gave me a katchi report — an entry in the roznamcha, or daily diary, of the police station — but no FIR,” he added.
Young Abubakar Awan was, in the recent past, deprived of his cell phone and other valuables by armed muggers in Nazimabad. He told Dawn he went to the Nazimabad police station to lodge an FIR, but the attitude of the police was so discouraging that he returned home without lodging the FIR. He said police grilled him in a manner as if they considered him the real criminal. “I left [the police station] without any hope,” he said.
Last month, a young A-level student was deprived of his cell phone at gunpoint in Federal B Area when he got off from a rickshaw to meet a friend. His parents got the SIM blocked but chose not to report the incident to the police as they believe it would be a waste of time.
And in some cases in which FIRs were lodged within 24 hours of the incident, the response of the police was lethargic.
Police unmoved despite viral videos
Videos of CCTV cameras are increasingly going viral on social media in which it’s clearly seen that even women are not safe these days in Karachi.
A last year’s incident in which armed men looted around 20 people at a teashop within close proximity of the Gulshan-i-Iqbal police station is one example in which the crime did not get the attention of police until the CCTV footage of the robbery went viral on social media.
The incident took place on the night of Dec 27, 2022 when two men, one carrying a rifle, approached scores of people sitting at a teashop, held them at gunpoint, collected their cell phones and wallets, and rode away on their motorbike.
Some of the victims told Dawn that those who were deprived of their valuables went to the nearby police station to report the incident. The policemen asked multiple questions before registering the FIR. The police later visited the teashop, inspected the area, and asked them to go home.
They said no one from the police contacted them for two days until they [victims] retrieved the CCTV footage of the incident using their own contacts. When the video went viral on social media, the SHO concerned called the victims, asking them to come see him at the police station. When they reached there, he questioned why they put the video on social media and then asked them to give him all the details.
One of the victims, whose iPhone was snatched, managed to locate his phone near Alladin Park the same night. He informed the police, but they asked him to wait, and after a considerable delay, when they were ready to change the location of the phone, around a week after the incident, the iPhone Finder shows the location of the snatched phone in Hyderabad, which suggests robbers may have left Karachi.
“We have no hope or expectation from the Sindh police,” said one of the victims, asking not to be named. “We believe this incident would be forgotten with time, and no one would deliver us justice.”
Former Citizen-Police Liaison Committee (CPLC) chief Jameel Yousuf, however, says the crime rate has decreased since the 1990s, but it’s still a concern for the people.
He told Dawn that it was unfortunate that, despite having resources, law enforcement agencies that were designed to deal with the issue of street crime were not playing their roles. “They must be accountable to the citizens for their losses and lack of responsibility.
Mr Yousuf said that the police should focus on advanced technologies such as centralised mapping systems and tracking technologies.
He said that the CIA police should primarily track down criminals, no matter where they are traced. They should also conduct strict snap-checking in order to reduce the city’s crime rate.

7,KWSB put on notice on plea against illegal hydrants,KARACHI: The Sindh High Court has issued notices to the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board and other respondents on a...,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court has issued notices to the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board and other respondents on a petition against illegal hydrants in district west.
A two-judge bench headed by Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi directed the KWSB to take strict action while engaging law-enforcement agencies if such hydrants were being illegally operated in violation of apex court orders and file compliance report.
While putting the respondents as well as advocate general on notice for April 18, it directed them to file comments at next hearing with an advance copy to the lawyer for petitioner.
A resident of Orangi Town petitioned the SHC stating that 16 illegal hydrants were running in different parts of the district and the people were facing shortage of water on account of such illegal operation of hydrants.
The lawyer for the petitioner argued that the officials of water utility had failed to discharge their duties to curb such illegal activities and instead they have become facilitators of culprits/hydrant mafia and deprived the people of potable water.
Besides the hydrant mafia, the counsel asserted that influential people in connivance with the officials of KWSB have also obtained illegal water connections compelling area people to buy water from tanker mafia.
The lawyer further contended that illegal hydrants were being run in Pakhtoonabad, Kunwari Colony, Qasba Colony, MRP Colony, Manghopir, Qaimkhani Colony and other parts of district west.
She argued that the Supreme Court had issued directives to the relevant authorities to remove all such illegal hydrants, but the official respondents were conniving with such mafia.
Citing the officials of KWSB and anti-corruption establishment (ACE) as respondents, the counsel further submitted that an inquiry against officials of water utility in this regard was pending before the ACE, but illegal hydrants were still continuously operating in the district.
The bench issued pre-admission notices and states: “In the meanwhile, the officials respondents are directed to ensure that if illegal hydrants are being operating in District West as detailed in para-2 of instant petition in violation of orders passed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court, strict action shall be taken, while associating the law enforcement agencies and compliance may be furnished on the next date.”

On April 10, 1973 the Constitution of Pakistan, drafted by the then government led by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was approved by the country’s parliament. Karachi, as has always been the case, was leading the way in welcoming the constitution. On April 11, the media claimed that week-long celebrations for the passage of Pakistan’s permanent constitution would begin in the city from April 12. The elaborate programme chalked out both at official and public levels included organising symposia, sport rallies, Mehfil-i-Milad and thanksgiving prayers. April 12 and 13 were declared public holidays. The Karachi Development Authority (KDA) decided to provide pieces of land for stalls at nominal fee of 30 paisa per stall to the drama groups, theatre and circus companies during the seven days which were to perform at different times. Spots available for that purpose were at Clifton Beach, North Karachi, Orangi and Gulshan-i-Iqbal. 
On April 12, Prime Minister Z A Bhutto authenticated the constitution which earned unanimous acclamation from various organisations and representatives of all shades of opinion in Karachi. They included, among others, former chief minister of Sindh Pir Ilahi Bakhsh; chairman of the Pakistan Hindu Panchayat Mukhi Chitromal Chandan; General Secretary United Muslim League (Karachi zone) Shaikh Liaquat Hussain; MPA Taj Bibi Baluch; Pir Sahib of Lauri Sharif, Pir Gul Hasan; and Provincial Minister for Law and Parliamentary Affairs Syed Qaim Ali Shah. 
On April 13, Chief Minister of Sindh Mumtaz Ali Bhutto met with a 35-member delegation from North Nazimabad and other parts of the city and expressed the hope that the passing of the constitution would open a new chapter of closer understanding and better cooperation between the ruling party and the Opposition. The chief minister said the government welcomed constructive and healthy criticism by the Opposition of the government’s policies as it would enable it to eliminate their drawbacks and run the administration in a democratic manner.
While the things on the political front seemed warm and cordial, on April 11, the Karachi Met Office put all its teams on alert because a dust storm lashed the lower parts of Sindh including the Karachi region reducing the humidity to 11 percent at 5pm and shooting the temperature up to 107F — only five degrees short of the highest April temperature of 112 degrees recorded in 1947. The sudden change in weather was caused during the night, and the hot wave which could be felt as early as 9am peaked in the afternoon hours.
For the Sindh capital itself the week was very special in one more way. On April 9, Provincial Health Minister A W Katpar inaugurated the Sindh Medical College (SMC) at the Jinnah Post-Graduate Medical Centre (JPMC). According to a report published in Dawn, the college had the capacity of imparting education to 154 students. The minister claimed a provision had been made for the expansion of the institution some time later. He called for cooperation of medical practitioners to achieve the desired objective of the SMC, adding in an effort to remove the shortage of doctors, the government had doubled the seats at medical colleges in the province from 400 to 955.

9,Irrigation infrastructure destroyed by recent floods restored: minister,"Says Rs47bn being spent on rehabilitation of farmlands, installations; donors’ contribution of $30bn awaited","HYDERABAD: Sindh Irrigation Minister Jam Khan Shoro has said that the irrigation infrastructure, including parts of the Left Bank Outfall Drain (LBOD), destroyed during the 2022 floods in the province had been restored. He emphasised the need for more planning to avert destruction in the monsoon.
The minister was speaking to journalists at an Iftar programme organised by Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) MPA from Latifabad Abdul Jabbar Khan in the area’s municipal ground on Sunday. He also briefly spoke at the gathering. Besides the host MPA, Sindh PPP information secretary Ajiz Dhamra, Mohamamd Faisal Khan, Kashif Shoro and other party leaders and activists attended the programme.
Mr Shoro recalled that Sindh had suffered $30bn damage in the 2022 rainfall and floods as was assessed after the natural calamity. He said the provincial government had estimated the cost of irrigation infrastructure’s rehabilitation at Rs47bn and started the work.
He said that with the Rs47bn, works of emergency nature like plugging of dyke breaches and rehabilitation of canals to restore of water supply to growers for Rabi sowing had been completed and then other works were undertaken. The minister said that due attention was paid to the repair and strengthening of FP (flood protective) bund to see what kind of works was required.

Says Rs47bn being spent on rehabilitation of farmlands, installations; donors’ contribution of $30bn awaited  

He also pointed out that LBOD’s damaged part was repaired, adding that only one breach, in Puran Dhoro natural waterway, had occurred. 
The minister described last year’s unprecedented rainfall as “of catastrophic proportion” as was observed by the UN secretary general.
He noted that when Britishers had built the Sukkur Barrage, they had closed those channels that used to be the main source of water supplies for cultivation. He said these waterways were closed because seven canals off-taking from the barrage were created to feed Sindh’s agricultural lands. “Now under the given conditions, these old waterways (dhoras) have to be restored and this is a gigantic task,” he said. 
The irrigation minister said that the quantum of rainfall in Sindh in 2022 was so huge that even a developed country would have taken time to respond to it.
About Manchhar Lake, he said that the Aral head and tail was being rehabilitated and its capacity was being enhanced to let more water flows pass through this channel in the time of emergency around the lake’s area. “Whenever Manchhar is needed to be offloaded into the Indus river, the latter is found getting higher flows which makes it impossible to empty the lake,” he argued.
Jam Khan Shoro said that the $30bn amount was also shared in a donors’ conference and the participants had made commitments in this regard. If received, the money would be utilised to repair the damage from rains and flood, he said, and pointed out that most of the damage was suffered by Sindh.

Speaking at a press conference at the local press club, Khalid Bandhani, Sher Mohammad Bandhani and others, along with the missing transport operator’s brother Sajid Qureshi, claimed that at around 1am on April 6, policemen picked up Raees Qureshi and since then his whereabouts remained unknown.
Sajid Qureshi, narrating the details, claimed that some people in civvies along with some others in police uniform took away his brother. 
He said employees of Raees Qureshi were present when two of the police personnel talked to him and asked him that to accompany them. Raees walked towards a double cabin vehicle parked at some distance and he was made to board it, Sajid added.
He said a surf vehicle, a double cabin Revo, and two police mobiles were 
parked outside the office of Raees Qureshi during the episode. Sajid said he later approached several police stations but no one present there gave proper replies to his question about his brother’s whereabouts.
In reply to a question from the journalists, Sajid denied his brother’s link with mainpuri trade. 
The association’s office-bearers and Sajid also held a protest demonstration outside the press club against alleged enforced disappearance of Raees Qureshi.

11,Candidates protest over ‘favouritism’ in SPSC exam results,"Commission rejects accusations, explains reasons for delay in process","HYDERABAD: Candidates of Sindh Public Service Commission (SPSC) exams for the post of lecturer staged a protest demonstration outside the local press club on Sunday against alleged violation of merit.
They were led by candidates Hussain Bux Chandio and Ram Oadh, along with Khalid Sahowal, a civil society activist. 
They maintained that the apex court and Sindh High Court had directed the SPSC to publish the results of written test and interviews on its website but the commission did not comply with the directive. They alleged that merit was not followed in the process.
The leaders told the media that the SPSC did not also follow the marking policy of interviews as defined by Sindh High Court. They said that only one member of the interview team conducted the interviews where the required decorum was not followed.

Commission rejects accusations, explains reasons for delay in process

They claimed that candidates were not asked for their demonstrations and presentations which was otherwise necessary to determine their academic capabilities. They informed that only questions related to Pakistan Studies and Islamiat were asked whereas not a single question of literature or other subjects was put to the candidates.
They also alleged that candidates with 58 marks were selected and the one with 81 marks was left out. Likewise, they added, candidates from college side were given preference over gold medalists and MPhil students. They accused the commission of nepotism.
The protesters’ leaders informed the media that the SPSC had declared written test results of English subject lecturers and interviews were concluded on March 16. The final results were declared on late in the evening on March 31 instead of March 16 or 17. “This shows that merit was violated in preparing the results,” they argued.
They further pointed out that the schedule for interviews of Sindhi subject lecturers was issued and March 21 was fixed as the last date but the interviews were postponed without assigning any reason. The interviews were held on March 24 and the results declared after one week i.e. March 30. The delay in announcing the results also made them to believe that transparency was not observed, they said. 
They urged the SPSC secretary to follow merit, and warned that they would move court otherwise.
Meanwhile, a statement issued by the SPSC said: “It is clarified that the orders of the Honorable High Court are being complied with in their true letter and spirit. Every Committee constituted in this regard comprises three members (one senior member SPSC who is the chairman of the committee, one more member from SPSC as member and the third one a professor from IBA, Sukkur or if there is no professor in that particular subject then a senior professor from a government college)”.
When contacted, the newly-appointed SPSC chairman, Mohammad Wasim, rejected all the allegations. He told Dawn that all SPSC members have equal marks with the exception the chairman of the committee who would adjust fraction mark. He said interviews were conducted under surveillance of CCTV cameras and all recordings were secured. He said the committee comprised very senior civil servants and one subject specialist from Sukkur IBA, which allowed applicant to demonstrate his/her presentation skills.
