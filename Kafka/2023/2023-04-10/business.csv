0,Sharing responsibilities and prosperity,Political polarisation has undermined national unity based on common values required to make steady economic progress and shared prosperity.,"The current economic and political mess is triggered by a murky set of rights enjoyed by the authorities embellished by major lapses owing to the corresponding blurred responsibilities.
And the fundamental rights of common citizens, which are needed to allow them to improve their quality of social life and livelihood, are stifled, which creates social exclusion.
In the last 75 years of independent existence, we have failed to resolve the issue of sharing rights and responsibilities equitably among the three tiers of government: federal, provincial and local. Political polarisation has undermined national unity based on common values required to make steady economic progress and shared prosperity.
The dismal conditions have activated over 100 civil society organisations to form a group — the Mediators — to organise a multi-party meeting to de-escalate mounting political tensions and find amicable solutions to the economic, political and judicial crisis. They have succeeded in enlisting the support of six coalition government partners. Persistent efforts are required to succeed.

Their struggle should continue to realise a new social contract within the broad framework of the 1973 Constitution embedded with a long-term vision.
After a thorough study of the causes and effects of the first worldwide stagflation in the early 1970s, certain social scientists concluded that rights and responsibilities needed to be widely dispersed to avoid such crises in future. The then-emerging strategy for a people-centred economic development was set aside to pursue financial globalisation to combat stagflation which is now back with a vengeance.
In Pakistan, the consumer inflation rate has hit an all-time high of 35.4 per cent. The State Bank expects the inflation rate to remain high in the near term. The latest World Bank (WB) forecast is that economic growth will drop to 0.4pc in FY23 against 2pc, estimated in January, and 5pc achieved during FY22. The Asian Development Bank sees a growth rate of 0.6pc.
And as a result, WB projects that poverty measured at the lower middle-income poverty line ($3.65 per day 2017 purchasing power parity per capita) would push 3.9m people into poverty this fiscal year compared to FY2022.
The Federation of Pakistan of Chambers and Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) has rejected the policy rate by 100 basis points (bps) to an all-time high 21pc on April 4 aimed at taming super inflation. The FPCCI noted that the benchmark interest rate has risen by a whopping 1,125bps in the last 14 months but has failed to check inflation.
Inflation is stated to be the worst form of taxation as the authorities now collect more tax revenue from the surge in prices of goods and services than from economic growth.

Inequalities in human capital outcomes have widened over time between the rich and the poor, men and women, and urban and rural areas 

There are widespread complaints that the taxation system is imbalanced and unfair as the bulk of the revenue is collected from indirect taxes, burdening the poor and less privileged beyond their capacity to pay.
A Senate Committee was recently informed by Pakistan International Airlines that 15 of the airline’s pilots had left the country because of major pay cuts in the form of high taxes.
It is argued that taxpayers can be encouraged to voluntarily and fully discharge their tax liabilities if every rupee of tax collected is well spent. The mode of taxation and the way tax money is squandered does not enjoy social sanction.
And international lenders like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and friendly countries are losing confidence in Islamabad’s ability to carry out its part of agreed programmes linked to any bailout. Only China has helped Pakistan to avoid debt default through $1.8 billion refinancing and a rollover of old debts of $2bn in March.
Facing the risk of foreign debt default and the delay in disbursement of the $1.1bn IMF tranche, frustrated Finance Minister Ishaq Dar says Pakistan must end its dependence on the Fund.
Dwelling on the issue of public debt, an eminent financial analyst finds no evidence yet of firm resolve in implementing major structural reforms for progressive resource mobilisation and eliminating extravagance in the current expenditure. This will continue to impact the current account deficit.
Pakistan has also been very slow in investing more in intangible assets, such as design, branding and software, than in tangible assets, like machinery, buildings and computers. According to noted scholars, this is the main source of long-term success in advanced countries.
That brings us to the issue of human resource development. Human capital makes up 61pc of Pakistan’s wealth, yet its level of human capital is among the lowest in the world, says the latest World Bank report. About 90pc of the formal and informal workers are employed in micro-enterprises.
Inequalities in human capital outcomes have persisted or widened over time between rich and the poor, men and women, and urban and rural areas and among the provinces.
The report suggests that if Pakistan could achieve its Human Capital Index value at the average level of South Asian peers and (no less importantly) bring the use of human capital to employment outside farming, the country’s GDP per capita would rise by 144pc, eight times more than business as usual.
Simultaneously, brain drain has assumed serious proportions. According to a media report quoting the Bureau of Emigration, 92,000 highly qualified professionals such as doctors, engineers, Information Technology experts and accountants left Pakistan in 2022, mainly for the Middle East, in pursuit of decent jobs and dignity.
The main reason behind poverty in the country is the non-utilisation of natural resources appropriately, says Federal Minister for Water Resources Khursheed Shah. He suggested that 15pc of the GDP should be annually budgeted for the construction of small and big dams. According to experts, mini-dams are an effective tool for poverty reduction.

1,When chai becomes a luxury,"As rupee depreciates and inflation spirals upwards, increasing prices of milk and sugar, the sweet hit of caffeine will continue to become less affordable.","

Source: PBS

 
If the country shares a single all-consuming addition, it is the morning cup of chai. But many do not have the willpower to, or even the luxury of, limit intake to a single cup given the necessary sugar and caffeine hit required to sustain momentum throughout the day.
Thus the increase in its price by 3x over the last decade, according to data by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, hits wallets harder than people realise.
A humble cup of everyday caffeine costs roughly Rs50. If a person consumes three cups a day, every day, the number multiplies to Rs4,500 a month. In a country where the minimum wage is Rs15,000, tea drinking can consume a whopping 30pc of income.
The largest importer of tea in the world, Pakistan’s annual imports are roughly half a billion dollars. To put things in perspective, if the entire country forwent drinking tea for two years, the amount saved would be roughly equal to the last tranche of the International Monetary Fund loan that the country is desperately trying for. No wonder Minister Ahsan Iqbal made the meme-worthy comment about decreasing tea consumption last year.
Instead of importing using borrowed money, Pakistan’s agrarian economy should consider growing local tea. There was a time when Pakistan was a bulk producer and exporter of tea, but the country’s split in 1971 left the country perpetually dependent on imports for its caffeine addiction.
Local farmers are not interested in cultivating arguably one of the most in-demand imports despite having some tracts of land suitable for growing tea leaves. Not only is the initial investment for plantations high, but it also takes years to recoup since it takes five to six years before the leaves can be picked to be made into tea.
Tea is imported, mostly from Kenya, and blended to create the distinctive taste and strength of each brand. The rest is all marketing.
As the rupee depreciates and inflation spirals upwards, increasing the price of milk, creamers and sugar, the sweet hit of caffeine in the morning will continue to become less affordable.

Complain the right way
If you want to advance your career, you should learn to complain well.⁠ Stay silent and you’ll stew in resentment and let burgeoning problems fester. Speak up and you can alert leaders to hidden issues, fix the frustrating parts of your job and show you’re ready for the next step up. Of course, you have to do it gracefully — or risk becoming the department whiner.⁠ Some managers and employees are irked by negative performance reviews they see as unfair, as companies move on from an era of gentle feedback and look for new ways to cull the ranks.⁠ Approach bosses armed with potential solutions. Stick to the facts, and the impact the problem is having on the business. What opportunities are you having to forgo because of roadblocks? Lay out what you have tried so far to show you have taken initiative. Pitch your proposed fix, but leave the door open for their input.⁠

Recycling pencils
Here’s a mind-boggling fact: over 13m hectares of forests are lost annually to deforestation. Forty-two per cent of those forests are used for manufacturing timber-based products that constitute around 18-20bn pencils. That’s an estimated 8m trees being chopped down every year just for writing utensils, while around 9m used pens are thrown away worldwide each year. All of this paper and plastic waste mostly ends up in landfills. Some plastic flows into water bodies where it breaks down, polluting the water and harming ocean life. When it comes to “saving the planet,” making any kind of impact can feel overwhelming. But there is something more of us can do to play a small but valuable part. Gather all the disposable pens and pencils you already own. Make it a point to use every writing utensil to its full capacity before disposing of it. In the future, invest in refillable pens or pencils that can be recycled.

Which will grow faster: India or Indonesia?
If you are looking for growth opportunities among the world’s 20 biggest economies, two stand out: India and Indonesia. The Asian giants, with a combined population of 1.7bn, are forecast by the IMF to be the two fastest-growing top-20 economies in 2023, and over the next five years. Both are pioneering strategies for getting richer in an era of de-globalisation, fraught geopolitics, automation and energy shifts, even as they seek a political formula that wins elections and avoids social unrest. Whether they succeed matters not just for their people and the investors betting many billions of dollars on them. It will also set an example for scores of other countries searching for new and reliable ways to develop in the 2020s and beyond.

Consultants to influencers
First came the social-media influencer. Now some aspiring influencers are finding it more profitable to assist others in the industry.⁠ Being an influencer doesn’t always mean an easy supply of free swag, trips and brand-endorsement deals. Few come close to the earning power of TikTok stars such as Charli and Dixie D’Amelio. The hurdles to building a profitable personal brand online have spurred a cottage industry of influencer helpers, many of them one-time influencers who say they have found a more pragmatic way to be a social-media entrepreneur and do what they love. There is more consistent money in supporting social-media creators with services such as video editing, content strategising and matching them with promotion-seeking brands, say many influencer helpers.

4,Inflation myths of Ramazan,An increase in regional trade of in-demand food items and a more efficient supply chain could curb higher prices during the holy month.," 


There is a popular belief that inflation rises during Ramazan, with authorities solely fixated on stocking up and artificial price hikes. Prices tend to escalate during Ramazan, with a general surge of 31.5 per cent in recent months, and several food items experiencing up to a 60pc increase in prices from their pre-Ramazan levels.
While stocking up may be a contributing factor towards higher prices, it does not play a pivotal role. There are structural inefficiencies in the retailers’ supply chain and a lack of regional trade in Pakistan, which causes a price hike.
 
 

This phenomenon is simply an application of the law of demand and supply, which remains applicable during both Ramazan and Christmas, just as it does throughout the year. Only when the demand for a product exceeds its supply a disequilibrium arises, leading to fluctuations in price.
Some local intellectuals have cited Western countries where prices for certain goods remain unchanged or low during Ramadan as an argument against the idea that prices increase during religious holidays in Pakistan. However, this explanation overlooks the fact that Muslims are often in the minority and may not be as well-off as the majority population in these countries.

An increase in regional trade of in-demand food items and a more efficient supply chain could curb higher prices during the holy month

Conversely, during Christmas in these same countries, prices for certain goods often increase due to higher demand from consumers who celebrate the holiday such as gifts, decorations, and special foods and drinks associated with Christmas.
Similarly, during the holy month of Ramazan, certain food items and fruits are in high demand, particularly during the suhoor and iftar meals. Middle-class and lower-middle-class consumers tend to purchase these items on a daily basis during Ramazan, even if they cannot afford them at other times, as this month holds special significance for them.
In addition, well-off individuals and charitable organisations often donate food and fruits to those in need as an act of charity, particularly to the labour class working in metropolitan cities. This practice further increases the demand for specific food items and fruits during Ramazan by 30-40pc, while the supply remains constant, leading to a disequilibrium in the market between demand and supply.
The state can overcome the challenges related to the availability of food items and fruits during Ramazan by bolstering its regional trade with neighbouring countries, including India, Iran, Afghanistan, and China. By enhancing regional trade, Pakistan can potentially increase its access to a wider range of products, including cost-effective and high-quality food items and fruits.
This would enable Pakistan to effectively address supply-related issues during Ramazan and ensure a steady supply of products for the general public.
Regarding the solution in the domestic market, one approach that can potentially address the issue of high prices is to enhance the efficiency of the value chain of retailers and marts, eliminating the intermediary role. In Pakistan’s big cities, several retail stores and marts, including Canteen Stores Department, Hyperstar, Al-Fatah, Metro, Imtiaz Super Market, Save Mart, and Punjab Cash and Carry, have been established.
Despite their establishment, their supply chain system could be further optimised for efficiency. By employing an efficient method for collecting materials from farms and production centres, these stores can ensure that they maintain sufficient stock levels and can source materials at reasonable costs. This optimisation can subsequently lead to the reduction of prices, thus making products more affordable for the general public.
The Utility Stores Corporation has reported that there are over 4,000 retail stores located throughout the country. As it currently manages 108 of these stores, the Canteen Stores Department has become the second-largest retail chain in Pakistan.
However, most retail stores in the country rely on intermediaries, particularly Sabzi mandi and wholesalers, for their supply chain operations. These stores do not have their own farms and also lack a direct link with farmers. As a result, they have limited control over the quality and pricing of their products, as the middlemen influence these factors in the supply chain.
Let us examine the example of Tesco, one of the largest retailers in the United Kingdom, which maintains a complex and extensive supply chain that involves numerous suppliers, warehouses, and distribution centres.
In the backward chain, Tesco collaborates with thousands of suppliers worldwide to procure products, including farmers, manufacturers, and distributors. It owns several large warehouses where products are received from suppliers and stored until they are required in stores.
In the forward chain, Tesco utilises various transportation methods to transport products from its distribution centres to its stores. Products are then stocked on shelves in Tesco’s stores and made accessible to customers.
Tesco’s efficient supply chain allows it to provide less expensive products and make them available to a larger consumer base. This is possible because Tesco has invested heavily in its supply chain infrastructure. This is a lesson for retail stores in Pakistan to own efficient supply chains.
In a nutshell, regulatory bodies could concentrate on developing stronger economic connections with neighbouring countries to promote the smooth flow of goods across borders. This can assist in increasing the availability of food products, reducing transportation expenses, and enhancing market competition, all of which can contribute to lower prices.
An efficient supply chain of stores can also help to manage inflation in food products, which is frequently impacted by inefficiencies such as the involvement of middlemen and traders who add extra costs and complexity to the distribution process.
By eliminating these intermediaries, retailers can decrease expenses and pass on these benefits to consumers. Moreover, by upgrading logistics and distribution channels, retailers can guarantee that food products are transported quickly and efficiently from farms to markets, which reduces spoilage and waste.

5,PSX investment — an alien concept,The stock exchange is relatively untapped since capital flows to real estate and gold,"The financial markets of any country are essential for its economic growth. About one out of 100 people in Bangladesh invests in the stock market, while 4.5 per cent of India’s population is involved in the financial markets.
Considering these figures, it seems certain that the proportion of Pakistani investors would fall in the same range. However, the figure is quite dismal, with only 0.1pc of the population or about 250,000 people investing in the market. Among these, the number of active investors remains well below 100,000, compared with India, where the active investor count is above 10 million, followed by Bangladesh, with almost 2m people participating in financial markets.
Stock market investment remains an alien concept for the people. The first words that come to the minds of the masses when talking about the market include ‘gamble’, ‘conventional’ and ‘risky’. This owes largely to the malpractices of brokers amid weak controls, resulting in financial losses for investors during the 2008 crisis.
Lack of knowledge also remains at the heart of the problem. People don’t even know how to open an account with the broker, let alone make informed investment decisions. Even finance professionals find it cumbersome to get the hang of the fundamental and technical analysis of the shares, which impedes their market participation.

The stock exchange is relatively untapped since capital flows to real estate and gold

Discipline is imperative while investing in the stock market. However, herd behaviour is a norm prevalent in the Pakistani market, where investors try to follow the rally without conducting or studying proper research. As a result, they also panic at times of selling pressure leading to blood baths where people lose their fortunes and curse the market as a whole.
In addition, these investors spread their delusions, thus moulding the attitude of prospective investors against the market. As a result, the fact that stocks as an asset class are lucrative for long-term investing is overshadowed because of the investors’ uninformed and uneducated investment decisions.
Pakistani society is a consumption-oriented society with an abysmal savings rate. They prefer spending lavishly or investing in real estate and gold. The market capitalisation of the Pakistan Stock Exchange stood at Rs 7.5 trillion for FY22, and the value of the mutual fund industry at Rs1.2 trillion compared to Rs88tr for real estate and Rs21tr for bank deposits.
Religious factor also comes into play where the belief that stock investing doesn’t conform to Islamic teachings is ubiquitous in the minds of the general public.
Financial markets do not grow in solitude; they rely immensely on other financial sector components, including banks, asset management companies, and insurance companies. However, rather than exposing their assets to the stock market, these institutions prefer ‘playing safe’ and rely heavily on the public sector. Even individuals seem obsessed with investing in banks, government bonds and national-saving schemes, which prove detrimental to the health of the stock market.
The current precarious situation, however, induces hope about the immense potential of financial markets, which remains untapped. The foremost step is to create awareness among the masses about the mechanism for investing in the stock market.
Youth forms a predominant part of the country’s population and are more receptive to novel ideas, so they should be the prime target. The exchange and other players in the market should coordinate their efforts and partner with different universities to enhance awareness about the stock market and the investment discipline required to exploit returns from this investment avenue.
A viable and fruitful strategy would be to organise trading competitions where the participants are provided with virtual currencies along with fitful training sessions. This virtual trading with illusory currency will amplify their market and investment knowledge by practising investment in the real-time market. Top traders should be provided with cash deposited in their brokerage accounts to translate the entire experience into increased market participation.
The brokers also have a role to play in addressing low involvement. Special attention should be directed to investors who are a novice to ensure they do not suffer a setback owing to their lack of experience and knowledge. The brokers should also spread their networks to smaller cities and conduct awareness sessions in far-flung areas to allure the prospects.
Awareness should also be created about the Islamic index (KMI Index) to dispel the doubts of conservative investors. Attention should be directed towards digital marketing along with television and radio marketing to alter the immutable attitude of people as well as spread information among the masses.
The ten-year returns (year-to-date from CY2011–CY 2021) remain rosy for the stock market (14.55pc) compared to gold (6.67pc), Defence Saving Certificates/Special Savings Certificates (9.38pc), Pakistan Investment Bonds (8.98pc), t-bills (7.6pc) and deposits (5.01pc).
Special attention should be directed towards this potent sector to ensure that the prospects do not remain bleak and the economy benefits from the increased liquidity in the country’s financial markets.

11,Navigating the global cash crunch,"While only solace could potentially be sought in mergers and acquisitions, they probably won’t be enough to keep top talent from moving abroad.","Barely a year ago, there was optimism all around whenever you talked to people from the startup ecosystem. Coming on the back of a stellar 2021 — that saw investment surge more than 5x — the ecosystem was flush with a high. It continued into the first quarter of 2022, giving the impression that our moment is here to stay. Only to become what seems like a blip now.
There were already glaring signs of trouble by the second quarter, beginning with layoffs at Airlift — barely nine months after they had announced an $85 million round — and subsequently shutting off operations. Other well-funded players, including Retailo and Truck It In, cut their workforces significantly. Meanwhile, the funding continued to decline — falling below pre-Covid levels by Q4-2022.
While the deal flow recovered from those lows during the first quarter of 2023, the outlook is still quite bleak. Two of the biggest platform-based tech companies operating in Pakistan — Daraz and Foodpanda — recently laid off more than 10 per cent of their staff, with the latter doing it much more discretely. Market reports suggest that there might be more in the offing.
Things aren’t any better at relatively smaller startups, as Jabberwock Ventures also reportedly fired five to six people, including a change of guard at its Swyft Logistics, while Byte slashed its workforce by 30pc. The situation is so bad across the globe that even insanely profitable companies like Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon have made tens of thousands redundant.

With a spate of layoffs, Pakistan’s nascent startup ecosystem is in a pit of uncertainty

Around 131,000 workers in US-based tech companies have been laid off in mass job cuts in 2023, according to Crunchbase tracker. Pitchbook data shows that venture capital (VC) in the United States fell for the fifth quarter straight. Even the few glimmers of hope seem to be vanishing now.
For example, the much-cited dry power and its pipeline are also drying up, with few investors looking to take exposure to VC. In fact, with just $11.7 billion raised across 99 funds in the US, this year is on pace to be the slowest since 2017 for fundraising. Being a major provider of liquidity across the globe, this will have a significant international impact.
Actually, it already is, especially in Asia, where funding dipped 57pc year-on-year and 33pc quarter-on-quarter between January and March. This was again the fifth straight quarter of consistent decline and the second time when dollar value has returned to at least 2018 levels. Basically, all the gains from the post-Covid era seem to have been pared.
This slowdown could have serious consequences for Pakistan’s nascent VC-backed startup ecosystem. Because if Asian economies with consistently high growth rates and far better risk profiles are seeing massive declines in investments, what chance do we stand, considering that most of the funding into the country was from foreigners?
That’s concerning, despite all the flaws of the asset class, its philosophy and a lack of applicability to Pakistani realities. For one very simple reason: it was practically the only form of capital available to new businesses. Hardly anything else is out there: banks aren’t going to lend to small and medium enterprises and even if they do, who can even pay markups exceeding 25pc? All is quiet on the subsidised Kamyab Jawan Programme because, well, we are sleepwalking into sovereign default.
Meanwhile, net foreign direct investment during 8MFY22 was just $784 million, down 40.4pc compared to $1.32bn in the same period of last fiscal year. Similarly, both equities and debts have seen outflows from international investors. Even the Gulf money is becoming hard to come by now.
What options do local businesses have at their disposal then? At least the ones that don’t completely screw them over by taking a majority stake and all decision-making power? Barely any. Amid all this doom and gloom, the only solace could potentially be sought in some signs of mergers and acquisitions.
In the last quarter, Portugal-based S4 Digital bought stakes in two local companies — Bramerz and HR Ways while fintech Abhi raked up 20pc of logistics player BlueEx. More importantly, two Pakistani software bigwigs, 10Pearls and Arbisoft, have also recently announced acquisitions of foreign entities. This is an encouraging sign and is part of the growing shift in the home-grown IT services industry to show some ambition for scale.
However, in a pit of uncertainty and worsening economic indicators, these feel-good stories can’t go too far and probably won’t be enough to keep the top talent from moving abroad, even the ones who were staunchly against the idea a year ago.

12,Digitisation — the way forward,"OICCI report recommends tax, financing and regulatory incentives for investment in local production for boosting digital infrastructure.","Digitisation can significantly boost the GDP growth rate and expand the size of the country’s economy. A report on Pakistan’s digital journey, Recommendations for Digital Transformation in Pakistan, argues that digitisation has the potential to add $60 billion to the economy by 2030 if the government creates a favourable investment climate for local and foreign investors to fill in the large gaps in digital infrastructure and connectivity.
The report prepared by the Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce & Industry (OICCI) covers wide-ranging suggestions to boost digital infrastructure and connectivity, e-governance, e-commerce, EdTech, Fintech, AgriTech, HealthTech, IT exports and Web 3.0 technologies.
It quotes international research that a 10 per cent increase in broadband penetration increases the GDP by 1.38pc.
“Digitisation offers innovative employment prospects to the 23pc of Pakistan’s population falling in the age group of 20-34 years. This report offers key proposals for the policymakers on various aspects of digital transformation of the economy,” OICCI chief executive and secretary general Abdul Aleem told this correspondent.

Internet penetration in Pakistan has increased to 49pc, but almost half of the market is still on 2G with an average download speed of 14.9 Mbps versus the South Asian average download speed of 17.3 Mbps

Recent global experience shows that the countries that have adopted digital technology and bridged digital connectivity gaps have grown more rapidly than their peers and increased their global competitiveness. Currently, Pakistan ranks 90th out of 120 countries on the Inclusive Internet Index and 110th among 140 countries on the Global Competitiveness Index.
“One of the biggest challenges facing Pakistan’s digital economy pertains to the inadequate digital infrastructure,” argues Mr Aleem. “Pakistan lags behind other regional countries when it comes to digital infrastructure and mobile connectivity, impeding efforts to exploit the potential of digital technology fully.”
Internet penetration in Pakistan has increased to 49pc, but almost half of the market is still on 2G with an average download speed of 14.9 Mbps versus the South Asian average download speed of 17.3 Mbps.
The report points out that limited optic fibre coverage is the root cause for slow and limited internet, with only 9pc cell towers connected to optic fibre compared to the international benchmark of 40pc and the regional comparison of 80pc in Malaysia and 90pc for Thailand.
Digital gaps become quite obvious across rural-urban and gender divides and within the major cities depending upon the socio-economic profile of the areas.
“Remoter regions and rural areas have a limited footprint in terms of fixed broadband services, which differ within cities according to the socio-economic profile of each region. Pakistan has a paltry 1pc penetration rate of optic fibre compared to regional peers like Vietnam with 44.5pc and Malaysia with 32.1pc,” it says.
The absence of true market competition, with the PTCL holding 70-75pc market share (until 2020), higher licensing fee, taxes and duties and challenges in the right of the way serves to hamper the local development of optic fibre and are proving to be major disincentives for the efforts to increase the capacity of the operators.
Quoting the report, Mr Aleem believes that digitisation can help the inclusion of the underserved population of society. “Around 23 million children are out of school and we have less than one physician for every 1,000 people in Pakistan. To help Pakistan overcome these issues it is important to digitise the education and health sectors.”
The report notes that in recent years there has been tremendous development in Digital Financial Services. But Pakistan is still a cash-based economy with less than 5pc merchants accepting digital payments. Besides promoting digital modes of payments, the government also needs to encourage international e-commerce companies to set up regional offices in Pakistan.
“Indonesia worked on similar lines, and now its e-commerce market size has grown to $30bn. It is now expected to reach $54bn by 2025 and supports 26m jobs directly and indirectly,” it underlines.
Further, digitisation can bring a lot of efficiency to government services, boost productivity and help improve ease of doing business (EODB).
“Philippines can be a good example where public service delivery was digitised under the E-government Master Plan (EGMP) that has helped the country, ranked 95th in EODB 2020 rating, register improvements of 29 notches. Our government should take advantage of modern technologies such as Machine Learning, Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence to improve competence in public departments, document the economy and increase the tax revenues,” the OICCI recommends.
In order to promote the digitisation of the economy and reduce the connectivity gaps, the report recommends tax, financing and regulatory incentives for investment in the local production of mobile phones and optic fibre for creating jobs as well as boosting digital connectivity and infrastructure. More importantly, the report suggests that the government should focus on expanding 4G technology ‘for all’ rather than 5G ‘for few’.
At present, 4G penetration stands at 47pc whereas the countries that have commercially launched 5G first achieved around 70pc or more 4G penetration. It proposes that the government reduce spectrum prices for mobile network operators to encourage them to invest in infrastructure to improve quality and data speed.
“Revenues could be collected over time rather than all at once.
Besides, the government should allocate maximum spectrum to the operators for internet usage to achieve the goal of digital Pakistan besides charging spectrum prices in home currency rather than dollar-denominated.
“Additionally, the government should consider having sufficient redundant cables to meet the growing demand and address unforeseen circumstances. An enhanced effort to incentivise investment into developing submarine cable infrastructure is required to ensure network redundancy and to cater to increased data rate demands,” the report suggests.
While Pakistan’s mobile market has significant potential, current levels of mobile internet adoption, smartphone adoption and digital services are unable to support the efforts to exploit this potential without improving and expanding digital infrastructure to catalyse the growth of a digital revolution in Pakistan.

13,Finance: Pauperising the people,"Stalled economic growth, skyrocketing inflation, closing factories, people losing jobs — all point to structural issues in governance and administration.","Pakistan’s economy has long been suffering from several structural problems. But instead of finding sustainable solutions to those problems, our successive governments have often relied on quick fixes.
These problems have so much compounded that the government of the day alone cannot address them successfully. Problems like alarmingly high levels of domestic and external debts, fiscal deficit, unemployment, poverty and critically low levels of exports, remittances, foreign investment and foreign exchange reserves are all interlinked. And all of them are structural in nature.
To address them, Pakistan needs to formulate sustainable, long-term policies and ensure its flawless implementation year after year — for a decade or so. But that is possible only under a stable, vibrant democracy — not military dictatorships or hybrid regimes.
Pakistan in 2023 is facing such deep-rooted economic problems that if a long-term policy for economic reconstruction is not designed and owned by all stakeholders of the state and if it is not implemented honestly, we may not see a prosperous Pakistan emerging even in 2033.

The politicians are worsening economic problems in their bid to prevent the erosion of their voter base

 
 

But for that to happen, political stability is a must. How and how early this required political stability is achieved amidst the ongoing political and constitutional crisis will determine how best we can sustainably address our structural economic problems. It is a defining moment in Pakistan’s history, and any misstep will cost the nation dearly for decades.
The World Bank recently said Pakistan’s economy might grow just 0.4 per cent during this fiscal year ending in June and projected only 2pc growth for the next fiscal year. It said poverty is projected to increase to 37.2pc this year pushing an additional 3.9m people into poverty as compared to last fiscal year.
In the last fiscal year (under the PTI government), Pakistan’s GDP grew 6pc, but it started a nosedive right from the beginning of this fiscal year (under the PML-N-led coalition government). Estimates vary for this year’s economic growth, with the World Bank projecting 0.4pc and the government forecasting 1pc plus.
Even if we assume that the economic growth this year will be 1pc (down from 6pc last year), the five percentage points loss of growth means job losses of no less than 2.5m.
This means by June this year, about 9.5m employable Pakistanis will be without a job since, at the end of last fiscal year, the total number of employable but jobless citizens stood around 7m.
Imagine what is going to happen with so many people having no jobs (though some of them will have low-paid jobs in the informal economy).
Imagine what may happen with an additional 3.9m people being trapped in poverty and the poverty rate hitting 37.2pc. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out how all this can feed extremism and terrorism in the country, necessitating the allocation of even greater resources from the national exchequer to fight the twin menace.
Amidst such grim economic challenges, politicians remain engaged in bad politics. The (incomplete) National Assembly has passed a resolution against the Supreme Court and instructed the federal government not to facilitate elections in Punjab on May 14.
The government’s demand for a full court to decide the timing of elections may have merit. But rejecting the apex court’s current verdict violates the Constitution. It is certainly messy politics and will only deepen the ongoing politico-economic crisis.
When PTI dissolved the provincial assemblies of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa earlier this year, it did a disservice to the economy. Who didn’t know that this move would create more uncertainty and would, in turn, make the economic crisis graver? But they did it. And now the PML-N-led coalition ruling the federation seems reluctant to go to polls.
 
 

Our politicians keep making mistake after mistake for political gains or to avoid the erosion of political capital, only to contribute to the worsening of economic problems. The country cannot afford these foul politics anymore.
Economic growth has stalled, forex reserves of the central bank are not enough to cover imports of even a month, inflation is skyrocketing, factories are closing, farms are not producing enough to feed 225 million Pakistanis, people continue to lose jobs and poverty has become so widespread and acute that men and women are losing lives just to get a sack of free wheat flour, distributed by the government.
These are extraordinary circumstances. And they point to serious gaps in governance and administration. Nothing conventional will work under these circumstances.
Take the example of conventional inflation-fighting by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). It keeps raising interest rates only to see inflation rise even faster. Something somewhere is terribly wrong.
Higher interest rates contain inflation only when they are accompanied by fiscal discipline and only in economies that are well documented and where governance and administration have not become alien words.
In Pakistan, not only fiscal discipline remains missing, but the informal economy also keeps growing while governance and administration continue to weaken. How can the local administration crack down on smugglers and hoarders if it cannot ensure the smooth distribution of free flour?
And how can a civilian government ensure the maintenance of law and order — so vital for economic growth — if it permanently needs a paramilitary force in Karachi, the economic hub of Pakistan, to do that?
Notwithstanding another 100 basis points increase in SBP’s policy rate announced recently, high inflation is here to stay. The World Bank says inflation will average around 29.5pc in the current fiscal year ending in June. Annualised national average consumer inflation in March 2023 stood at 35.4pc with food inflation at 47.1pc in urban areas and 50.2pc in rural Pakistan.

14,Importance of governance to attract investors,"New investors demand increasingly strict conditions, including the parliament’s and Supreme Court’s approval.","I am currently faced with a situation. I have a fully executed, legally binding contract, and nobody is responding to our letters or phone calls to make payments, let alone executing them.
The ordeal is over seven months old with no end in sight, and the bad news is that this is not the only case. This is how the public sector functions. Businesses are repeatedly told that if they want to do business with the public sector, this is how it will be; hence it needs to be factored in.
It seems beyond the comprehension of our policymakers that such processes are disastrous. Over decades, the public sector has decided that businesses are villainous. Paying money on time is a cardinal sin. Profit is sinister. Violating contracts is child’s play.
 
 

Consequently, despite being an attractive destination for investments, investors shy away from coming to Pakistan.

New investors demand increasingly strict conditions, including the parliament’s and Supreme Court’s approval

When we talk about the government, most say it is caught between a rock and a hard place. Whether it is or is not, the fact of the matter is we are under a mountain of debt.
Recent International Monetary Fund negotiations have centred around reevaluating every corner of Pakistan’s economy, including the energy sector.
The worrisome circular debt within the energy sector is among the top pain points dominating negotiations. At approximately Rs4.2 trillion, it can bring the country to a standstill if corrective treatment is not urgently administered.
The malaise, however, is a combination of several factors aside from the fiscals. Absence of a business-friendly and competitive environment for investors in the sector and an inability to ensure governance and consistency of agreed policies have brought us to this stage where most investors prefer rent-seeking models and pass all market risk to the government and ratepayers.
An unsatisfied customer is bad news and is very expensive for the business. A recent survey conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers found that 59 per cent of customers will give up on a company after several bad experiences and 17pc after only one.
Investors are no different. Rather, they are far more stringent in the way they evaluate countries and investment opportunities.
In Pakistan, deals have been struck without working out the potential consequences. Steel mill privatisation and Reqo Diq are prime examples. Moreover, power purchase agreements and energy purchase agreements are not honoured, with some ending in litigation and some under renegotiation.
Adhocism drives decisions, further complicating matters. As a result, the new investors are demanding increasingly strict conditions, including the parliament and Supreme Court approval. Public sector corporations or relevant ministerial departments deal with these matters in other countries.
Pakistan’s energy needs are rising as the youth bulge adopts a high-energy way of living. With surplus capacity existing within its power generation sector and depleting gas reserves, significant upgrades are required for its transmission and distribution and supply infrastructure as well as reforms in the energy sector to tackle the issue.
The government has again reiterated its commitment to privatise distribution companies, which are one of the root causes of the circular debt along with inconsistent and counterproductive policies. The regulator has repeatedly raised this point in its State of Industry reports.
However, the treatment meted out to K-Electric investors does not bode well. Media reports indicate that Saudi investors lament that they have invested billions of rupees into the company, which has benefited the consumers as well as the government, but have been unable to earn any return.
Ironically, the government itself owns 26pc stake, but a lack of consistent policies has prevented it from earning from this transaction. It is safe to assume that any new investor coming into the transmission and distribution segment would also want similar guarantees and a rent-seeking model as adopted by independent power producers instead of trusting the government to do the right thing on commercial terms.
Another example is the unfinished transaction of PTCL, where Etisalat has been withholding the payment because Pakistan did not transfer several properties as per the deal terms. The government was again unable to benefit from the transaction as it owns a significant portion of PTCL.
Similarly, the value of OGDCL and PPL, which was Rs160.44 and Rs207.07 in 2011-12, had gone down to Rs93.37 and Rs75.31 in February 2023. The main reason behind their decline is the circular debt, which is ironic as the government holds 74.97pc and 67.51pc stakes, respectively, in these entities. Once circular debt is cleared, these entities will pay dividends, most of which will go back to the government.
Had these entities been commercially treated, the value of these entities, which can be considered national wealth, could have increased substantially over time, benefiting the government itself. More importantly, investor confidence in Pakistan would have risen.
It is food for thought for our bureaucrats, regulators, policymakers and those who matter why investments are made on market terms abroad but require iron-clad agreements in Pakistan.
Are these investors different from the ones conducting business elsewhere? Or are policy inconsistencies, rigid regulatory and bureaucratic mindset inculcated through years of National Accountability Bureau, judicial activism and populist narratives which drive them away?

15,Agriculture: Growing local paan,Growers in Ghora Bari taluka are paying serious attention to paan cultivation to make Thatta home to betel vine cultivation — a high-value cash crop.,"A flock of egrets descended on the water collected in depression pockets of Indus’s riverbed in the riverine area. The riverine area in Ghora Bari taluka Thatta looked picturesque as the flows moved calmly. Sheds of betel vine (paan) dot the katcha area on the right side of the mighty Indus. Flows from the sea, however, intrude into Indus in the absence of adequate flows from the Kotri barrage downstream that are necessary to keep sea intrusion in check.
Betel vine is chewed by many, irrespective of community background, as a mouth freshener or for mild intoxication.
It is grown mainly in the riverine belt downstream of Kotri Barrage, the last one on Indus, in the Thatta district. A recent visit to the coastal district’s riverine area in Ghora Bari taluka revealed that growers are paying serious attention to paan cultivation to make Thatta home to betel vine cultivation, a high-value cash crop.
Climatic conditions in the coastal strip are favourable for it. Its cultivation was mostly seen in the union council Girnar of Thatta and areas like Keti Bundar, Ghora Bari, Dhandari, Udasi, Dhandari, Mor Chaddhai and Pabiyo etc.

Through a partnership of landowners and contractors, betel vine is grown in Sindh, which earns up to Rs20m in three years after the plants start giving yields

 
 

“The Arabian Sea is hardly 35km away from this point, which is downstream of Kotri barrage in Ghora Bari where we are standing,” says Ali Nawaz Lakho. “We are increasing our acreage of paan cultivation as the katcha area climate suits it.”
Mr Lakho said that he had raised private bunds, locally known as zamindari bunds, around his land where he had grown betel vine under sheds. “Our land is on high ground, so we were not affected during the floods of 2022 as they passed smoothly to sea, but the 2015 floods impacted us,” he said.
Growers like Mr Lakho have been involved in contractual farming for the last several years, pitching in their share by providing land while traders bear other expenses like structure and inputs costs. Interestingly, investors from areas like Dera Ismail Khan, a district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, are investing in business heavily and consistently.
Mohammad Iqbal alias Balo from Dera Ismail Khan is one of them, who has been associated with the business for 10 years and is Mr Lakho’s business partner. There were many other Lakho-Balo business duos in paan farming. “I am not alone in business, as others from his home district are connected with this trade as well,” said Balo, thick marks of betel vine chewing visible on his teeth.
Betel vine is grown in rows under sheds of varying sizes depending on the size of the investment. The sheds ensure a controlled environment as paan, a sensitive crop, needs sunlight and moderate temperature to grow.
Varieties of paan like saanchi, salon and Pakistani are grown. Growers believe one row has the potential of giving 10kg yields of paan and is sold for Rs2,000-Rs2500 per kg usually, but as low as Rs1500 during the offseason. The commercial value of the produce is determined in Nankwara mandi of Karachi.
According to Balo, shed preparation-related expenses are a one-time investment and last for three years. About Rs2.5 million is needed for one acre of investment, which includes inputs costs such as fertiliser, animal dung, seeds and flower pots.
Other materials for the structure of sheds include wood that works as pillars, wire and palm mats. Around 300 pieces of palm mats are used in an acre. Ten pots can be used for seed cultivation in a row underneath the shed; roughly 2,000 pots are used in an acre.
“Contractors like us cover about 75pc of expenses or investment while the remaining 25pc comes from the Zamindar through land,” informs Balo. “You can earn up to Rs20m in three years after paan starts giving yields,” he discloses. Paan is usually grown in March and starts giving produce by October. By next spring, the plants look like a jungle.
Senior Vice President of Sindh Abadgar Board Mahmood Nawaz Shah recalls that paan cultivation was experimented with in Tando Allahyar, but it didn’t work for farmers who opted for it, perhaps due to weather conditions.
Mr Shah, himself a progressive grower of major crops, observed that “paan is a high value and intensive crop that involves higher investment.” However, the local pan does not have properties like the size and flavour of the imported pan,“ remarked Mr Shah.
 
 

Traders or commission agents note that local pan’s price has increased lately as its imports were affected due to the recent appreciation in the dollar’s rate. Sindh’s pan was sold for Rs3,500 to Rs4,000 kg in Karachi’s market.
According to Thatta-based trader Abdul Aziz Memon, pan’s crop was affected due to flooding last year and the quantum that remained unaffected fetched higher prices in the market.
