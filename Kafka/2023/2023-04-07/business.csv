0,Saudi Arabia gives financing pledge vital for reviving IMF deal: Aisha,Expects similar support from other countries will lead to staff-level agreement.,"ISLAMABAD: The government on Thursday said that Saudi Arabia had conveyed its commitment to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for its bilateral financial support to Pakistan and hoped similar assurance from the United Arab Emirates or some other source would lead to the much-delayed staff-level agreement (SLA) with the Fund and unlock multilateral disbursements.
Responding to questions from journalists, Minister of State for Finance & Revenue Dr Aisha Ghaus Pasha said Pakistan had received an indication from the IMF that Saudi Arabia had confirmed its support for Pakistan to help bridge the external financing gap that has been hampering the SLA for almost two months in completing 9th review of the $7bn Extended Fund Facility (EFF) in limbo since October last year.
According to some media reports, Saudi Arabia has committed to IMF that it would extend a $2 billion loan to help Pakistan meet its external financing needs, but there is no word from the official sources when will the pledged amount credited to the State Bank of Pakistan’s account.
Responding to another question, she said UAE’s support will play an important role in reaching SLA with IMF but Pakistan was also in contact with other friendly countries like Qatar, China and others to bridge the financing gap. She said no other option except the IMF programme was currently under consideration by the government as the Fund’s requirements and reforms were in the interest of the country in addressing domestic and external deficits.

Expects similar support from other countries will lead to staff-level agreement

She said IMF wanted to take Pakistan towards structural reforms which are in Pakistan’s interests. We have to live within our means whether fiscal or external account, she said and added that the country was fully committed to the IMF programme.
She said a Pakistani delegation would be participating in spring meetings of the World Bank and IMF in Washington starting early next week and Finance Minister Ishaq Dar was part of the delegation but could stay back home because of domestic issues.
However, she did not have a chance to see the senior minister to know if any change to his itinerary might have happened
Dar meets US envoy
Separately, Mr Dar had a meeting with US Ambassador Donald Blome and discussed deep-rooted historic and durable bilateral relations on economic and trade fronts.
The minister briefed the envoy about the economic outlook of the country and the challenges being faced and the policy decisions being taken by the government to steer the economy towards a positive trajectory leading to economic stability and growth.
“The finance minister also informed the envoy on the progress in talks held with the IMF and reiterated the commitment of the government to complete the programme”, said an official statement which quoted Mr Blome showing confidence in the policies and programmes of the government for economic sustainability and socio-economic uplift of the masses and extended support to further promote bilateral economic, investment and trade relations.
Appointments
Earlier, Dr Pasha assured the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue of completing the process for appointments of National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) and Zarai Taraqiati Bank Ltd (ZTBL) presidents by end of the current fiscal year.
The appointment in NBP is pending since January 2022 and that of ZTBL is lying vacant for over six months as parliamentarians raised serious questions as to what was preventing the government from appointing presidents of the two state-run banks and members of the Competition Commission of Pakistan.
She conceded these were governance issues but said the entire cycle for the appointment of NBP president was completed which was subsequently re-advertised due to some issues and the selection was pending with the State Bank of Pakistan for clearance under fit and proper criteria.

1,African lender eyes Silkbank,The bank is in desperate need of new capital to meet regulatory requirements.,"KARACHI: International Commercial Bank (ICB) of South Sudan, an African lender founded in 2011, has expressed interest in investing in Silkbank Ltd, a troubled entity facing undercapitalisation.
One of the smallest listed lenders, Silkbank told shareholders on Thursday ICB has expressed interest in subscribing to its shares “up to the extent of 50 million euros”. In rupee terms, the size of the potential investment amounts to Rs15.7 billion. In contrast, the total value of the bank is a little less than Rs10.1bn on the stock exchange.
Silkbank has been making losses for many years. Its accumulated losses amounted to Rs20.27bn at the end of 2020, the latest period for which the bank has published its financial accounts.
The bank is in desperate need of new capital to meet regulatory requirements. Its capital stood at Rs3.16bn against the prescribed minimum capital requirement of Rs10bn at the end of 2020.
Similarly, its capital adequacy ratio was -4.45pc against the prescribed level of 11.5pc on Dec 31, 2020.
Speaking to Dawn, an analyst with a development finance institution said the foreign bank will likely invest in newly issued shares — as opposed to the existing shares — at a predetermined price. As a result, the shareholding of the existing stakeholders will get diluted, he said while requesting that he not be identified owing to his company’s policy on making public comments about ongoing deals.
“There won’t be any tender offer to minority shareholders since the investment will materialise through new shares only,” he said, adding that majority shareholders will sign off on the investment scheme in an extraordinary general meeting.
The major shareholders of Silkbank are Arif Habib Corporation Ltd (28.23pc), former finance minister Shaukat Tarin (11.55pc), International Finance Corporation (7.74pc) and Zulqarnain Nawaz Chattha (7.75pc).
Last year, a property development company with links to former Punjab minister Aleem Khan also expressed interest in acquiring the bank. But it withdrew from the potential deal citing a change in its business priorities.
Silkbank has also been facing asset quality issues for some time. Its coverage ratio — which is the reserved allowance for loan losses divided by the total amount of non-performing loans — was already “very low” and may have further deteriorated given the considerable increase in interest rates since 2020.
It posted a net loss of Rs6.57bn in 2020 versus a net loss Rs3.95bn in the preceding year.
Silkbank will formally pursue the potential investment by holding discussions with ICB to finalise the “terms and conditions and documentation,” it said.

2,Ecnec okays five projects worth Rs1.3tr,Cost for power generation from Diamer-Basha dam surges 60pc.,"ISLAMABAD: The cost of power generation facilities of the 4,500-megawatt Diamer Basha dam project is estimated to have surged by a massive 60 per cent (Rs555 billion) in nine months – between June 2022 and now – to Rs1.5 trillion just because of currency devaluation.
The revision in the cost estimates of power generation facilities to Rs1.236tr in January this year from Rs933.6bn according to June 2022 PC-1 was approved by the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) alongside four other development projects on Thursday.
The meeting presided over by Finance Minister Ishaq Dar approved a total of five projects with a cumulative estimated cost of Rs1.312tr.
Strangely, the Ecnec approved the development of power generation facilities under Diamer Basha dam at a revised cost of Rs1.236tr at the exchange rate of Rs234 per US dollar instead of Rs160.09 per dollar based project cost in June 2022.
The cost approved by the Ecnec increased by about 25pc (Rs303bn) higher in six months – between June 2022 to January 2023 – to Rs1.237tr because of exchange rate losses. The revised approved cost also includes Rs598bn in foreign exchange component (FEC).

Cost for power generation from Diamer-Basha dam surges 60pc

However, the interbank exchange rate on Thursday stood at Rs284.42 per dollar which leads the project cost to Rs1.5tr and remains open to escalation. The meeting was told that in June 2009, the capital cost of the entire Diamer Basha Multipurpose project (including dam and power generation) was estimated at Rs894bn.
Because of external financing limitations, the project was spilt into dam and power generation facilities for development in two separate projects. The dam part was approved at an estimated cost of Rs480bn in November 2018 while a separate portion worth Rs175bn for land acquisition and resettlement was approved – both these components are under execution.
The Ministry of Water Resources and Wapda then separately submitted another PC-1 (Planning Code-1 a term used for the detailed feasibility study for project execution) for power generation facilities at a total cost of Rs933.584bn (at the rate of Rs160/$) with foreign exchange component of Rs409bn and was cleared by Central Development Working Party (CDWP) in June 2022.
Now, the cost of the project was updated to Rs1.236tr on the average floating exchange rate of January 2023 at Rs234 and was approved by the Ecnec on Thursday. This also includes a foreign exchange share of Rs598bn. The project will be implemented by Wapda.
The Ecnec approved the “Land Acquisition, Affected Properties, and Compensation for Rajanpur-Dera Ghazi Khan Section as four-Lane Highway and Dualisation & Rehabilitation of Dera Ghazi Khan-Dera Ismail Khan Section of N-55” project at a rationalised cost of Rs11.377bn without FEC. The committee also approved the “Reconstruction of Turbat-Mand Road from Motorway (M-8) to Iranian Border (Radeeq) project at a rationalised cost of Rs19.57bn.
The meeting also approved the “Construction of Panjgur-Gichak-Awaran Road” at the rationalised cost of Rs27.64bn without FEC. The Ecnec also approved Digital Economy Enhancement Project at a modified cost of Rs17.47bn, funded by the World Bank-IDA loan. The project plans to ensure the improvement in digitalisation efforts undertaken so far throughout Pakistan.
Ministry of IT & Telecom along with NITB, Nadra, PITB, IGNITE and Board of Investment (BoI) will execute the project.

3,Rupee stages spectacular rally against US dollar,The State Bank reported the closing price of dollar as Rs284.42 against Rs287.85 on Wednesday.,"KARACHI: The record-breaking devaluation of the rupee finally halted as the dollar lost Rs3.4 in the interbank market on Thursday after a reported assurance from the Saudi government to provide $2 billion for deposits.
The currency market took the assurance seriously with the hope that the IMF will finally release the much-needed tranche to unlock the inflows from other sources.
The State Bank reported the closing price of dollar as Rs284.42 against Rs287.85 on Wednesday. The rupee appreciated by Rs3.42 or 1.21 per cent.
After uncapping the exchange rate, the dollar kept increasing against PKR but was moving in the range of Rs280-285 for the last couple of weeks.
However, the PKR started losing to set a new record as it reached Rs287.85. The currency dealers and experts were expecting the dollar at Rs300 while the open market had crossed Rs295 a day before.
“I believe the PKR appreciated against the US dollar only because of the reports that appeared in the media that Saudi Arabia was ready to provide $2bn to keep in the account of State Bank,” said Zafar Paracha, general secretary of the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan.
Hopes were high in the market after this disclosure of this $2bn news. The finance minister is scheduled to visit the UAE for another $1bn required to fulfil the IMF demand. Pakistan needs to improve its foreign exchange reserves before becoming eligible for the IMF tranche.
“It looks that the government will succeed in convincing the IMF,” said a researcher, adding that the situation would be clear once the IMF announces its satisfaction.
He also said PML-N supreme leader Nawaz Sharif would visit Saudi Arabia to perform Umrah that may lead to a meeting with the Saudi authorities and release the much-needed $2bn Saudi fund.
Several figures have been reported in the media for current financial year FY23 that Pakistan required unlocking the IMF inflows. After monetary policy was announced on April 4, the State Bank governor while answering questions stated that out of the $23bn that had to be repaid within the current fiscal year, most payments have either been rolled over or made.
Topline Securities reported that the SBP governor said that $4.5bn have to be repaid by the end of June out of which $2.3bn will be rolled over and $2.2bn has to be repaid to bilateral and multilateral lenders. Only $100m has to be repaid to commercial lenders.

4,SBP reserves dip,Foreign exchange reserves held by the SBP fell by $36m to $4.20bn during the week ending on March 31.,"KARACHI: Foreign exchange reserves held by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) fell by $36 million to $4.20 billion during the week ending on March 31, announced the central bank on Thursday.
However, the total liquid foreign reserves of the country declined by $56m to $9.8bn while central banks’ holdings dipped by $20m to $5.6bn during the week.
The SBP foreign exchange reserves saw a massive outflow of $354m to $4.244bn from the year’s highest level of $4.598bn it touched in the week ended on March 17.
The central bank held $10.5bn in its foreign reserves in April 2022 when the country was experiencing the worst political turmoil that led to the ouster of the PTI government.
The dollar appreciated by Rs101 against the local currency amid fast dwindling reserves since the inception of the PDM government in April last year.
The greenback gained Rs54 after Ishaq Dar took charge of the finance ministry in September 2022.

5,Global growth seen slipping below 3pc,"“With rising geopolitical tensions, with inflation still running high, a robust recovery remains elusive,"" says IMF managing director.","WASHINGTON: The International Monetary Fund expects global economic growth to dip below three per cent in 2023 and to remain at around 3pc for the next five years, Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Thursday, flagging increased downside risks.
That is the global lender’s lowest medium-term growth forecast since 1990, and well below the average growth of 3.8pc seen in the past two decades.
Georgieva said strong monetary and fiscal policy actions to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had prevented a much worse outcome in recent years, but growth prospects remained weak given persistently high inflation. Bank failures in Switzerland and the United States had exposed financial vulnerabilities that increased the downside risks for the global economy, she added.
“Despite surprisingly resilient labour markets and strong consumer demand, despite the uplift in China, we expect the world economy to grow less than 3pc this year,” she said in a speech ahead of next week’s spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank.  “Growth remains historically weak now and in the medium-term.” 
“With rising geopolitical tensions, with inflation still running high, a robust recovery remains elusive, and that harms the prospects of everyone, especially for the most vulnerable people and the most vulnerable countries,” she said at an event hosted by Meridian House and Politico.
Global growth dropped by almost half to 3.4pc in 2022 following the shock of Russia’s war in Ukraine from the 6.1pc rebound seen in 2021.
Georgieva said India and China would account for half of global growth in 2023.

6,Stocks rally as hopes rise for loan approval,KARACHI: Bulls ruled the trading floor on the Pakistan Stock Exchange on Thursday as investors celebrated the reported deposit,"KARACHI: Bulls ruled the trading floor on the Pakistan Stock Exchange on Thursday as investors celebrated the reported deposit of $2 billion by Saudi Arabia.
Arif Habib Ltd said the additional deposit from the Gulf nation removed a major stumbling block to the release of the overdue tranche under the International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan programme.
