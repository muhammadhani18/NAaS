America, and Australia.","PARIS: Earth had its joint second-warmest March on record with Antarctic sea ice shrinking to its second-lowest extent for that month, the EU’s climate monitoring agency said on Thursday.
“The month was jointly the second-warmest March globally,” tied with 2017, 2019 and 2020, the Copernicus Climate Change Service said. The hottest March on record was in 2016.
Its report is based on computer-generated analyses using billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft and weather stations around the world.
It said temperatures were above average over southern and central Europe and below average over most of northern Europe.
They were far warmer than average over much of North Africa, south-western Russia, Asia, north-eastern North America, South America, Australia and coastal Antarctica.
Conversely, it was much colder than average over western and central North America, the agency said.
Global warming is causing sea ice to decline and sea levels to rise, raising warnings that dangerous tipping points could be reached. Copernicus said Antarctic sea ice extent was the second lowest for March in the 45-year satellite data record, at 28 per cent below average.
It reached 3.2 million square kilometres on average, 1.2m sq km below the 1991-2020 average for the month. It had reached the smallest area on record in February for the second year in a row, continuing a decade-long decline.
In the north meanwhile, Arctic sea ice extent was 4pc below average and joint fourth lowest for March on record, though concentrations were above average in the Greenland Sea.

1,China deploys warships near Taiwan after  US meeting,TAIPEI: China deployed warships through waters around Taiwan on Thursday as it vowed a “firm and forceful”...,"TAIPEI: China deployed warships through waters around Taiwan on Thursday as it vowed a “firm and forceful” response to the island’s president meeting US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.
Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen held talks with McCarthy in Los Angeles on Wednesday, expressing gratitude afterwards for the meeting, which included other US lawmakers.
“Their presence and unwavering support reassure the people of Taiwan that we are not isolated and we are not alone,” Tsai told reporters.
China had repeatedly warned both sides that the meeting should not take place, and deployed an aircraft carrier through waters southeast of Taiwan hours before the talks.
Three additional warships were detected in waters separating the island from mainland China, Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defence said on Thursday morning.
An anti-submarine helicopter had also crossed the island’s air defence identification zone, according to the ministry.
And China deployed coastguard vessels for unusual patrols that sparked a protest from Taiwan.
China carried out its largest air and sea exercises around Taiwan following a visit to the island in August last year by McCarthy’s predecessor, Nancy Pelosi.
China then deployed warships, missiles and fighter jets into the waters and skies around Taiwan.
Its response to the McCarthy meeting has so far been on a much lower level, but still left Taiwan on high alert.
Taiwan’s defence minister described the timing of the deployment of the Shandong, one of just two Chinese aircraft carriers, as “sensitive”.

2,Macron says ‘counting’ on Xi to ‘bring Russia to its senses’,BEIJING: French President Emmanuel Macron called on his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Thursday to “bring ...,"BEIJING: French President Emmanuel Macron called on his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Thursday to “bring Russia to its senses” over Ukraine and urged him not to deliver weapons to Moscow.
The French president, who arrived on Wednesday for a three-day state visit, has made clear he is seeking to dissuade China from supporting Russia’s invasion of its neighbour.
“I know I can count on you to bring Russia to its senses and everyone to the negotiating table,” Macron told Xi during a bilateral meeting in Beijing.
During the talks, Xi expressed an intention to speak with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky when the time comes, according to a French diplomat.
Xi went to Moscow last month to reaffirm his alliance with Vladimir Putin — framed as an anti-Western front — but has not yet spoken on the phone with Zelensky.
European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, who is accompanying Macron on his visit, welcomed Xi’s stated willingness to hold talks with Zelensky.
“It was interesting to hear that President Xi reiterated his willingness to speak when conditions and time are right,” she told a news conference in Beijing following talks with the Chinese leader.
Macron “pressed Xi Jinping not to deliver anything to Russia that would be used for its war against Ukraine”, added the French diplomat, following Western claims that Beijing could be mulling arms shipments to support Russia’s war.
Those comments were echoed by von der Leyen, who said she had warned Chinese leaders on Thursday that arms shipments to Russia would “significantly harm” relations.
“China’s position on this is crucial for the European Union,” she said.
“As a member of the UN Security Council, there is a big responsibility and we expect that China will play its role and promote a just peace, one that respects Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, one of the cornerstones of the UN charter,” von der Leyen said.
Macron has said during his trip that Beijing can play a “major role” in finding a path to peace in the conflict and welcomed China’s “willingness to commit to a resolution”.
Moscow poured cold water on prospects of a Chinese mediation, insisting on Thursday it had “no choice” but to press on with its offensive in Ukraine.
“Undoubtedly, China has a very effective and commanding potential for mediation,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
“But the situation with Ukraine is complex, so far there are no prospects for a political settlement,” he said.
But Macron’s visit to China, his first since 2019, comes as Western pressure mounts on Beijing to help push for peace in Ukraine.
Beijing is officially neutral, and Xi has never condemned the Russian invasion.
Macron said he wants to “be a voice that unites Europe” over Ukraine, and that coming to China with von der Leyen serves to “underline the consistency of this approach”.
Von der Leyen said in a Thursday meeting with Chinese Premier Li Qiang that relations between the EU and China had grown “complex in recent years”.
Macron’s talks with Xi were followed by a trilateral meeting with von der Leyen, after which the French and Chinese leaders held a state dinner.
Macron will travel to Guangzhou in southern China to meet students on Friday, taking with him a broad delegation of top politicians, business leaders and even celebrities, including composer Jean-Michel Jarre.

3,India and China spar over visas for their journalists,Indian media reports two Indian journalists barred from returning to their jobs in China while latter says its journalists received unfair treatment in India.,"NEW DELHI: India and China broke into fresh diplomatic sparring on Thurs­day, accusing each other of creating visa hassles for their journalists posted in New Delhi and Beijing.
The exchange came days after India objected to China renaming or “standardising” names of 11 locations in the eastern state of Arunchal Pradesh, which China calls southern Tibet and claims as its territory.
Indian newspapers repor­t­ed this week that two Indian journalists posted in Beijing were barred from returning to their jobs in the Chinese capital from India.
Correspondents for The Hindu newspaper and state broadcaster Prasar Bharati were told on Tuesday that their visas have been frozen, an Indian source familiar with the issue said.
Asked about the visa suspensions, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said on Thursday that Chinese journalists have received unfair and discriminatory treatment in India for a long time, and a Xinhua journalist was recently asked to leave India by March 31.
“China has always treated Indian journalists well,” Mao said. Chinese authorities have been in touch with the Indian government, which did not respond “nor correct the mistake”, she said.
“China therefore has to take corresponding counter measures to safeguard our legitimate interests. China welcomes Indian journalists to work in China. If India can correct its mistakes, China is willing to continue to facilitate Indian journalists in China,” Mao added.

4,Japanese military helicopter missing with 10 on board,TOKYO: A Japanese military helicopter with 10 people on board disappeared from radar on Thursday near an island in...,"TOKYO: A Japanese military helicopter with 10 people on board disappeared from radar on Thursday near an island in the southern region of Okinawa, army officials said.
The aircraft had been on a reconnaissance mission when it went missing in the afternoon, in what the Ground Self-Defence Force (GSDF) described as an “aerial accident”.
Search and rescue operations are ongoing, GSDF chief of staff Yasunori Morishita told reporters.
“To rescue everyone who was on board as soon as possible, we will continue to do our utmost... using the vessels and aircraft of the maritime and air self-defence forces, as well as coastguard patrol ships,” he said.
What appeared to be an aircraft part had been found, but it was not clear whether it belonged to the helicopter in question, Morishita said.
Two pilots, two mechanics and six crew members were on board, including a GSDF general from the 8th division, he added. The helicopter belonged to the army’s branch in the southern Kumamoto region, according to public broadcaster NHK. After taking off from Okinawa’s Miyako island, it was scheduled to have returned after an hour-long flight, NHK said.

5,French study warns of pesticide traces in water,French authorities alerted to the possible presence of chlorothalonil metabolites by studies carried out in Switzerland.,"PARIS: France’s public health watchdog said on Thursday that mass testing of drinking water revealed traces from a banned pesticide in half the samples, showing how potentially harmful chemicals persist in the environment.
The National Agency for Food, Environment and Workplace Security (Anses) began a testing regime in 2019 to identify around 200 complex chemical compounds originating from pesticides or explosives which are not normally sought in its routine checks.
The agency said “one case in particular stood out “: traces left behind from a fungicide known as chlorothalonil, sold widely by Swiss chemicals group Syngenta in Europe from the 1970s until it was banned by the EU in 2020.
 

Screengrab of a tweet by Anses. — Twitter/@Anses_fr

A chemical produced when the fungicide breaks down, known as metabolite R417888, was found in “more than one in two samples. Furthermore, it was found in higher-than-authorised quantities in more than one sample in three,” Anses said.
The results are likely to raise questions about the presence of other undetected chemicals in drinking water and pose potentially major operational and financial challenges for water companies.
French authorities were alerted to the possible presence of chlorothalonil metabolites by studies carried out in Switzerland.
In February, Anses ordered a halt to some uses of one of the most widely used weed-killers in France, S-metazachlor, which is also produced by Syngenta, after finding excessive levels in groundwater.
Mildew protection
Chlorothalonil, sold under the brand name Bravo by Syngenta, was a best-selling product to prevent mildew and mould on crops such as barley and wheat, as well as potatoes, peas and beans.
It was banned in the European Union after a review by the European Food Safety Authority concluded it was potentially carcinogenic amid concerns about the contamination of groundwater.
Anses said in a report last year that laboratory studies on chlorothalonil had linked it to kidney tumours in rats and mice, while other studies have suggested it has played a role in the vast decline in bumblebee populations.
Syngenta, which was bought by ChemChina for $43 billion in 2017, lobbied against a ban on its product, pointing to other studies that disputed any carcinogenic effect.
The multinational sued Switzerland’s Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office (FSVO) after it warned that chlorothalonil was a probable carcinogen.
It says on its Swiss website that reports about water contamination had “needlessly undermined citizen’s confidence in our drinking water.” It also sought to stress how authorised levels of chlorothalonil in Switzerland — and the EU — were extremely low at 0.1 micrograms per litre of water, which was the equivalent concentration of “dissolving a grain of sugar in 200,000 bathtubs of water.”
Farming groups criticised the EU at the time over the ban, calling it overly precautionary.
Anses said its testing had involved taking 136,000 samples across France from groundwater sources or treated water, but said they represented only about 20 per cent of all water distributed in the country.

6,Sarcophagus of Pharaoh  Ramses II unveiled in Paris,PARIS: The sarcophagus of ancient Egyptian pharaoh Ramses II was unveiled to reporters in Paris on Thursday ...,"PARIS: The sarcophagus of ancient Egyptian pharaoh Ramses II was unveiled to reporters in Paris on Thursday following its rare journey outside of Egypt.
The ornate coffin will be on show to the public in the French capital from April 7 to Sept 6.
Benedicte Lhoyer, scientific adviser to the exhibition, said the  “exceptional” loan was thanks to  “an unprecedented cooperation between France and Egypt”. The Ramses II exhibition is on a tour that includes the United States and Australia, but only France is receiving the sarcophagus, in recognition of the assistance from French scientists who helped save the mummy from decay following a previous visit to Paris in 1976.
The mummy itself has stayed behind this time, since Egyptian law now forbids transporting royal mummies abroad.
Ramses II, also known as Ramses the Great, ruled for more than 60 years during the 13th century BC and oversaw major military conquests and monumental construction projects, while also finding time to father more than 100 children. “In short, he was an extraordinary king,” said Lhoyer.
France has 54 antiquities teams working in Egypt, an official said — the most of the 25 countries who currently have research teams there.
The yellow-painted cedar-wood sarcophagus, which depicts the recumbent king in bright colours with his arms crossed on his chest holding a sceptre and whip, was not actually Ramses II’s original coffin.
Inscriptions on the sarcophagus’ sides detail how his body was moved three times from 1070 BC, after his tomb in Luxor’s Valley of the Kings was raided by grave-robbers. Its final resting place was discovered almost three millenia later in 1881, just as it too was being pillaged.

7,Azerbaijan expels four staffers of Iranian embassy,BAKU: Azerbaijan’s foreign ministry on Thursday announced the expulsion of four employees of Iran’s embassy ...,"BAKU: Azerbaijan’s foreign ministry on Thursday announced the expulsion of four employees of Iran’s embassy after months of diplomatic tensions between Baku and Tehran.
The news came hours after Baku said it arrested six men, who it said were linked to Iranian secret services and were plotting a coup in the Caspian nation.
Relations between the neighbours have long been strained, with Azerbaijan being a close ally of Iran’s historical rival Turkiye.
The foreign ministry in Baku said on Thursday it “summoned” Iran’s ambassador and told him that “four employees of the Iranian embassy were declared persona non grata” with 48 hours to leave the country.
It said they were carrying out activities “incompatible with diplomatic status” but did not provide further details.
“During the meeting, strong dissatisfaction was expressed to the Iranian Ambassador due to the recent provocative actions demonstrated by his country,” the ministry added.
Earlier in the day, Baku said it arrested six Azerbaijani nationals, who were “recruited by Iranian secret services to destabilise the situation in the country”.
It announced the arrests in a joint statement by the interior ministry, state security service and prosecutor-general’s office.
It said the group was plotting to “set up a ‘resistance squad’ aimed at establishing a Sharia state in Azerbaijan through armed unrest and violent overthrow of Azerbaijan’s constitutional order”.
It accused them of being “engaged in a pro-Iranian propaganda of religious radicalism, fulfilling orders from abroad to undermine Azerbaijan’s tradition of tolerance”.

8,Pope washes feet of young prisoners,"VATICAN CITY: Pope Francis, who often champions poor and marginalised people, celebrated the traditional Holy...","VATICAN CITY: Pope Francis, who often champions poor and marginalised people, celebrated the traditional Holy Thursday Mass by washing the feet of 12 young inmates in a juvenile detention centre in Rome.
The Argentine Jesuit, who was hospitalised last week for bronchitis, spent Thursday afternoon at the Casal del Marmo detention centre in the north of the Italian capital.
It was the second time he visited the facility, performing the same rite in 2013 soon after being elected pontiff.
Leaning on a cane, Pope Francis stood before each of the 12 inmates — including two women — to wash their feet before bowing down to kiss them. In return, some of the inmates kissed the hand of the smiling pope, while others exchanged a few words with him.
“I hope I can make it because I can’t walk very well,” the 86-year-old pope joked during a short impromptu homily, referring to his knee pain that has forced him to rely on a wheelchair.
The pope spent three nights in the hospital last week after complaining of breathing issues and was treated for bronchitis.
Among the group of inmates were young people from Senegal, Romania, Croatia and Russia, according to Vatican Media, which broadcast the event live.

9,Taliban move spokesman’s office to Kandahar,Information ministry does not elaborate on the reason for the move but it suggests more prominence for those officials based in Kandahar.,"KABUL: The main spokesman for Afghanis­tan’s Taliban administration will move his office from the capital to the city of Kandahar, the information ministry said, a sign of the growing importance of the region that is home to its supreme leader.
The province of Kandahar is the historical birthplace of the Taliban movement.
Supreme leader Haibatullah Akhundzada lives there and rarely makes public visits to Kabul, about 450 km to the north, where national government offices, the cabinet and the acting prime minister are based.
“Zabihullah Mujahid and Samangani are both transferred to Kandahar,” said Abdul Maten Qanee, a spokesperson for the information ministry, referring to Innamullah Samangani, a deputy spokesman.
It is one of the first known instances of an official in a senior role in the Taliban administration shifting their office from the capital.
The information ministry did not elaborate on the reason for the move but it suggests more prominence for those officials based in Kandahar. 
Major decisions, such as restricting the access of girls and women to highschool and university and stopping most female NGO staff from working.

10,Biden report on Afghan pullout lays blame at Trump’s door,"“The departing Trump administration had left the Biden administration with a date for withdrawal, but no plan for executing it,"" the report summary says.","WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden’s administration on Thursday released a summary of after-action reports on the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, saying “there were no signs that more time, more funds or more Americans” could have fundamentally changed the trajectory.
In a 12-page declassified summary of the report sent to Congress, the White House insisted that President Joe Biden’s administration had done everything it could.
It blamed a deal struck previously between Donald Trump’s administration and the Taliban for putting the incoming Biden government in an impossible position and it said that no intelligence agency had predicted such a catastrophic collapse of Afghan government forces.
“The departing Trump administration had left the Biden administration with a date for withdrawal, but no plan for executing it. And after four years of neglect — and in some cases deliberate degradation — crucial systems, offices, and agency functions that would be necessary for a safe and orderly departure were in disrepair,” the document said.
“After more than 20 years, more than $2 trillion dollars, and standing up an Afghan army of 300,000 soldiers, the speed and ease with which the Taliban took control of Afghanistan suggests that there was no scenario — except a permanent and significantly expanded US military presence — that would have changed the trajectory,” it said.
The report does fault overly optimistic intelligence community assessments about the Afghan army’s willingness to fight, and says Biden followed military commanders’ recommendations for the pacing of the drawdown of US forces.
“America is on a stronger strategic footing more capable to support Ukraine and to meet our security commitments around the world, as well as the competition with China, because it is not fighting a ground war in Afghanistan,” John Kirby, the National Security Council spokesman, said on Thursday.
The pullout, ending on Aug 30, 2021, shocked Americans and US allies as the Taliban swept aside Western-trained Afghan forces within weeks, forcing the last US troops to mount a desperate evacuation from Kabul’s airport.
