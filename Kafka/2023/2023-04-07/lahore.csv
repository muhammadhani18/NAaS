0,More Covid deaths in Lahore necessitate slew of steps to curb virus spread,Eight people test positive during 48 hours in city.,"LAHORE: Two Covid-related deaths in the city have necessitated taking a slew of steps to avert the onset of the sixth wave of the virus.  
Both the deaths of Covid patients occurred in a private hospital of Defence Housing Authority (DHA).  
According to the official figures, so far six patients, including a five-year-old minor boy, tested positive for Covid, have died during the last two weeks in Lahore. Of them, four deaths took place in DHA and Johar Town, raising an alarm for the residents of posh areas of the city.
Other than two deaths, eight more people tested positive for the virus during the last 48 hours in Lahore and they were isolated in the hospitals due to the breathing problems and low oxygen saturation level.

Eight people test positive during 48 hours in city

Of them, two children were also shifted to the Children’s Hospital, Lahore, with short breathing problems showing the virus was targeting the kids.
The resurgence of the Covid-19 has alarmed the health authorities when they were informed by the hospitals that they have begun to receive patients in serious condition.
An official said the health authorities seemed to be ‘unmoved’ to the threat of new wave of the virus which is evident from the fact that nothing has been done as follow-up to the new positive cases of Covid which in the past had played havoc in Punjab, particularly, in Lahore, Rawalpindi, Faisalabad, Multan, Gujranwala etc.
He said after reported fresh Covid deaths, the health department neither dispatched teams for the contact tracing in the areas where the patients were living, nor they formed teams to investigate the new variant of the Covid-19, if any, surfaced in Lahore which was causing instant deaths of the patients.
In the past, the official said, massive exercise was done on reporting of each Covid-related death or new positive case of the virus in any part of the city or other parts of the province.  
He said the health department used to send teams [to] homes for sampling and vaccination besides declaring the areas high risk for Covid.
Similarly, many relevant government departments used to be activated to create mass level awareness to follow the Covid guidelines strictly in crowded markets, schools, offices, parks and other such places.  
He said Eidul Fitr is approaching fast and a special campaign must be launched to ensure preventive measures in the congregations and other gatherings but nothing has been done despite the fact that the Coronavirus was spreading slowly and gradually in Lahore during the last two weeks.  
Quoting some public health experts, he said the Covid situation is getting from bad to worse in India as 5,000 cases are being reported daily these days there.  
Similarly, he said, the virus is also resurging in China and the travelling from both the countries in Pakistan through borders is another major challenge.
About the figures, the official said Punjab has so far reported total 525,110 positive cases of the virus besides 13,622 deaths since the virus hit the province.
A majority of these cases were reported in Lahore, Rawalpindi, Faisalabad, Multan, and Gujranwala, he said and added the resurgence of the same virus in the provincial capital has posed a serious threat of new wave of the virus.

4,Expat children of late jurist: Court suspends district govt orders on property dispute,Judge directs the counsel for the parties to submit their written arguments by May 9.,"LAHORE: In light of a Supreme Court judgement protecting the rights of the overseas Pakistanis, the Lahore High Court has suspended two orders of the district government concerning a property dispute among overseas children of renowned jurist Dr Farooq Hassan.
After the death of Dr Hassan, her daughters based in the United States came to Pakistan to transfer his property at Temple Road, Lahore, but their younger brother filed a ‘false’ application to Punjab Overseas Commission in which the assistant commissioner passed the impugned orders sealing the property.
A counsel for Mehreen Farooq Hassan and other petitioners submitted that the matter is purely of civil nature which cannot be resolved by an executive body in light of the law developed by the courts from time to time.
He explained that civil litigation is already pending adjudication before the competent forum of law, therefore, the district government have no jurisdiction to deal with the matter. He argued that the petitioners are overseas Pakistanis whose valuable rights over the property in question are involved and the court has already strengthened the rights of overseas Pakistanis in its various judgments.
The counsel said if interim relief is not granted then valuable property rights of the petitioners will be badly infringed.
A counsel for the respondent brother contended that the issue relates to a property on which the respondent is also claiming ownership rights. He said the respondent is also an overseas Pakistani and has approached the concerned authorities, including the Overseas Pakistani Commission, but without any success.
He admitted the fact of pendency of civil litigation before the competent court of law and sought some time to place on record certain necessary documents to clarify the position of his client with regard to the property in question.
Justice Jawad Hassan observed that rights of both the parties over the property in question are involved for which civil litigation is already pending and also there are clear-cut verdicts of this court as well as the Supreme Court, protecting rights of overseas Pakistanis.  
Therefore, the judge suspended the impugned orders till the next date of hearing which was adjourned till May 9. The judge also directed the counsel for the parties to submit their written arguments.

6,Rain-ridden farmers selling watermelon at throwaway prices,Profit margins for Sahiwal farmers have halved due to wet weather conditions.,"SAHIWAL: The ongoing torrential rains and last week’s hailstorms damaged  watermelon crop, causing heavy losses to the local farmers, forcing  them to immediately sell their crops at throwaway prices.
The local fruit  markets are not accepting the watermelon as the last two days’ rain  further affected the crop. On Wednesday night again, the watermelon  farmers of Pakpattan, Sahiwal and Okara took the brunt of more heavy  rain and thunderstorm.
Furthermore, the low temperature in April  and cloudy weather conditions are not suitable for watermelon as they stunt its growth. Such weather conditions are also not suitable for sale  and purchase of watermelon, the fruit of hot summers along with melon.
 

SAHIWAL: A watermelon field is flooded after Wednesday’s rain. — Dawn

After  the recent rains, the watermelon farmers decided to take their produce  to the Islamabad market for better rates instead of waiting for another  spell of rain or hailstorm and complete destruction of their crop.
Zohaib  Abbas, a resident of Chak 91/6-R, tehsil Sahiwal, is a young farmer who  opted for six-month-long watermelon crop instead of traditional crops  of maiz, rice and wheat, for his eight acres agricultural piece of land.  He followed the foresight of other fellow farmers who, in view of the  conditions in 2022, predicted that watermelon would give more profit  than traditional crops in 2023.

Profit margins for Sahiwal farmers have halved due to wet weather conditions

“A 300 maund (12,000kg)  watermelon truck was sold in the local market between Rs700,000 to  Rs800,000 giving straight away profit margin from Rs300,000 to  Rs400,000 per truck to the farmers,” says Zohaib.
He says he  took the bold decision and decided to sow six months of watermelon by  compromising three crops’ traditional pattern.
“In view of all  calculations, I sowed watermelon in November 2022. The crop was expected  to be ready for harvesting in March or April and I was sure it will be  sold in the surrounding fruit markets of the Sahiwal division at least  at the previous rates.”
The surrounding closest fruit markets  are located at Okara, Arifwala, Pakapattan, Chichawatni and Sahiwal  city. The other reason for his opting for the watermelon was the  transportation cost from his farm to the above local markets which is  not more than Rs8,000 to Rs9,000 per truck.
“My watermelon crop  had grown well. I invested Rs150,000 including the cost of seed,  fertilizer, pesticides, labour, in six months crop. It was  sure the produce would be 450 to 500 maunds from one acre. My total cost  over one acre watermelon sowing was around Rs175,000 which meant I  invested around Rs1.45m.”
Zohaib says the crop was grown well and  the watermelon was getting to its maximum size without any damage in  the last five months. He was hoping to get more than 12 truckloads of  watermelon having a weight of 300 maund (12,000kg) each.
“By  keeping in view previous year’s rate calculation, I was sure to sell  watermelon crop from Rs8m to Rs8.4m in the local market.”
But  things started changing because of unexpected rainfall since the first  week of March along with two hailstorms. The continuous rain spells  greatly damaged the watermelon crop while the low temperature during the  last three weeks added fuel to the fire. Watermelon needs heat to have  full growth and ripen in March and April.
By seeing the weather  conditions, Zohaib decided to dispose of his watermelon crop. But this  time around, he would get two to three trucks of the crop instead of the  expected 13 to 15 trucks.
The other problem that watermelon  farmers like Zohaib are facing is that there is no chance of selling  crops in the local market as the people don’t like eating watermelon in  rainy and cloudy weather or temperate conditions.
During the last two days, the rain further damaged Zohaib’s dream crop and investment.
“Some  of my friends suggested me to take watermelon to Islamabad as the  market in federal capital had a better rate for it. Lahore was not  feasible. Hence, I hired labourers, paid them Rs20,000, filled truck with  300 maund watermelon coming out of four acres and moved to Islamabad by  hired a truck at Rs. 85,000.
Zohaib was assured by commission agents  that his truck will be sold at Rs 400,000 in the Islamabad fruit market.  Yesterday Zohaib rushed to Islamabad on public transport via Lahore  while his watermelon truck is coming behind via Faisalabad. But the  irony of the fact is his 300 maund truck came out from four acres land.  Hence instead of getting 13-15 trucks the ongoing rain has spoiled his  crops. He will get just two to three trucks from his eight acres land.
“I  paid Rs20,000 to the labour to pick and load watermelons on trucks from flooded fields. The transportation from Sahiwal to Islamabad  cost me Rs85,000. The market agents will take an eight percent  commission on the total sales. This means, if my truckload is sold at  Rs400,000, I have to pay Rs32,000 commission,” Zohaib says. He  travelled to Islamabad and sold his truckload at just Rs350,000. He  plans to dispose of his reaming four acres of watermelon unless the  temperature goes up.
“Otherwise, I am not sure to get Rs700,000 against my Rs1.4m investment in the watermelon crop,” he laments.

Speaking at an iftar dinner here on Thursday, information secretary Shehzad Saeed Cheema said the PPP was ready to contest the polls, but the court verdict should be given by a full court of the apex court.
He said questions would be raised on the verdicts ignoring the majority of judges in the apex court as well as the parliament.  
He said the PPP had always challenged dictatorship, unlike other parties.
Neelam Jabbar, Nayab Jan, Faiza Malik and Chaudhry Sajjad were also present.
Mr Cheema said the political crisis had spread all around paralysing the masses psychologically. In such a situation, he said, the PPP demands that state institutions work within their constitutional domains.  
He said the party was averting polls as it had so far finalised tickets for all seats except in three divisions of Punjab.  
Mr Sajjad said the incumbent government was not violating the Constitution rather it had rejected the decision of three people.
