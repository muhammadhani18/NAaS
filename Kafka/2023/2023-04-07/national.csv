0,"Army chief vows to defend Pakistan’s sovereignty, territorial integrity",Gen Munir appreciates officers for “maintaining remarkable operational preparedness and high state of morale”.,"MUZAFFARABAD: Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Gen Asim Munir on Thursday renewed the determination of his institution for the defence of Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity against all kinds of threats and continuity of support to the just cause of Kashmiris struggling for their right to self-determination.
“Pakistan Army will defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Pakistan against all kinds of threat and is determined to support [the] just cause of Kashmiris and seeks resolution of [the issue of] Jammu and Kashmir in accordance with the United Nations resolutions,” the army chief said during his visit to forward areas along the Line of Control (LoC) in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).
It was his second visit to the heavily-militarised dividing line in the disputed Himalayan region of Jammu and Kashmir that has long been the scene of skirmishes and artillery duels with India.
The 740-kilometre-long LoC had long witnessed exchange of fire between the rival troops until Nov 2003, when the nuclear armed South Asian neighbours had agreed in a landmark decision to silence their guns across the dividing line.
Barring isolated incidents of violations, the agreement held for over a decade. But, afterwards, particularly after 2016, ceasefire violations became almost an ord­er of the day, causing frequent los­ses to civilian lives and properties.
In a welcome move in February 2021, Islamabad and New Delhi recommitted themselves to revive the spirit of the Nov 2003 understanding and ever since the LoC has been tranquil. Nevertheless, both sides are observing a high state of vigil, without any tangible cut in troop deployment.
According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the military’s media affairs wing, Gen Munir appreciated officers and men for “maintaining continued vigil, remarkable operational preparedness and high state of morale”
after he was given a detailed briefing on the situation along the LoC as well as the operational preparedness of the deployed formations.
In his interaction with officers and troops, Gen Munir emphasised upon them to extend all-out support to the local population, remain steadfast and discharge duties with utmost sincerity and devotion.
Earlier, on arrival at the LoC, the army chief was received by Rawalpindi Corps Commander Lt Gen Shahid Imtiaz.

1,No balloting for Haj this year: Dar,The decision is taken as the nu­­mber of applications recei­ved for Haj was far less than the seats available.,"ISLAMABAD: No ball­o­­ting for Haj will be conducted this year as the nu­­mber of applications recei­ved for Haj was far less than the seats available.
Finance Minister Ishaq Dar on Thursday annou­n­ced that all Haj applications under the governm­ent scheme would be acc­epted without balloting.
In a brief address at the state-run electronic media along with Min­is­ter for Religious Affairs Mufti Abdul Shakoor, Mr Dar said as many as 72,869 applications had been received under the government’s regular scheme against a quota of 44,190.
 






The finance ministry plan­ned to accept all ap­­plications of intending pilgrims, he said, adding that the extra foreign exchange reserves for Haj pilgrims would be provided with the support of the State Bank of Pakistan.
He asked the intending pilgrims to pray for the progress and prosperity of the country.
As per the Haj quota distribution, the government had allocated aro­u­­nd 45,000 seats under the sponsorship scheme.
Under this scheme, the applicants were to pay Haj dues in dollars, but only around 6,000 applications were received by the government under this scheme and around 10,000 seats remained vacant due to limited interest shown by the people.

2,"Imran’s bail extended till April 18, exempted from appearance",IHC judge says the court will not extend any benefit to the ex-PM which it cannot give to a common litigant under the law.,"ISLAMABAD: A division bench of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Thursday extended the pre-arrest interim bail of former prime minister Imran Khan in eight different cases till April 18 and exempted him from personal appearance as well.
The bench consisted of Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb. 
At the outset of the proceedings, the counsel for Mr Khan filed an application seeking his exemption from personal appearance. He argued that since Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was scheduled to attend a ceremony on the premises of the IHC, the PTI chief be exempted from attending the proceedings. 
He further said that since the PTI chief would appear before the Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) in Islamabad after Eid  holidays, the IHC should put off further hearings on the bail matter after Ramazan. The counsel said that since the former prime minister was facing “threats to his life”, he should be exempted from attending court hearings. 
Justice Farooq said the court would not extend any benefit to Mr Khan which it cannot give to a common litigant under the law. The IHC chief justice observed that personal appearance was mandatory for any accused during criminal proceedings. 
Security protocol 
Chief Justice Farooq asked the federal government to provide a copy of the rules framed for the security protocol for former prime ministers. He was hearing a petition filed over remarks made by Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah against Mr Khan. 
Additional Attorney General Muna­war Iqbal Duggal told the court that the government had notified the security protocol for former prime ministers. 
According to him, an assessment committee determines the security arrangements for ex-prime ministers.
A representative of the interior ministry told the court that no notification to provide security to Mr Khan had been issued so far. 
He said it was obligatory upon the federal government to provide security to former prime ministers in the federal capital while the provincial govern-ments were responsible for their security within their jurisdiction.

3,PTI up in arms as Gandapur arrested from D.I. Khan,Gandapur alleged that the police raided his house and those of his associates “without arrest warrants”.,"DERA ISMAIL KHAN: Former federal minister and PTI central leader Ali Amin Gandapur was arrested after hours-long drama on Thursday evening outside the premises of the Peshawar High Court’s (PHC) Dera Ismail Khan bench.
A heavy police contingent headed by Dist­r­ict Police Officer (DPO) Abdur Rauf Qaisarani besieged the PHC building, where Mr Gandapur remained for several hours along with his supporting lawyers and associates.
Finally, Mr Gandapur came out to surrender and was taken into custody and transported in a prison van to an undisclosed location.
As he already obtained transit bail in multiple cases registered against him in Islam­abad, Punjab and Dera, it was not immediately clear in which case he has been arrested.
 






The DPO and other police officers remained tight-lipped and refused to offer any information to the media persons about the case details.
Besides, it wasn’t immediately clear whether the PTI leader would be kept in D.I. Khan or shifted to another city within or outside Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
PTI chief Imran Khan condemned Mr Gandapur’s arrest, regretting that a “complete law of the jungle prevails” in the country.
“PDM and handlers have a one-point agenda — that is to go after PTI workers and leadership,” Mr Khan tweeted. “It was decided pre-emptively to arrest Ali Amin Gandapur despite bail. But they will still be decimated in the elections InshaAllah.”
Earlier on Thursday, Mr Gandapur visited the sessions court to get pre-arrest bail in cases registered in D.I. Khan.
From there, along with his supporting lawyers, he went to the high court, where he had an iftar dinner while the police officials waited for him outside.
Even after the court’s official time had ended, Mr Gandapur remained there with his supporters and so it the police force, awaiting his exit from the court’s premises.
Mr Gandapur’s lawyer, Ghulam Moham­mad Sapal, said that his client had already been granted transit and protective bails in all known cases registered against him in different parts of the country.
He said the PHC’s D.I. Khan bench had granted the PTI leader protective bail on March 22 in a case registered in Bhakkar on the charges of firing at a police checkpoint.
He said that they had appeared in the sessions court to get pre-arrest bail in a case, adding that when they came out of the courtroom, the doors of the session court were closed and the police were there to arrest Mr Gandapur.
Mr Sapal said he immediately submitted an application in the high court’s Dera bench against the police action, requesting that the police should disclose which and how many cases had been registered against Mr Gandapur. He said only the DPO could answer this question, as he was the one who gave Mr Gandapur’s arrest order.
Before his arrest, Mr Gandapur told the media that the sessions court had granted him protective bail in all the pending cases, but the police were bent on arresting him “without any justification”.
“Imran Khan is fighting the nation’s war and the rulers are not tolerating this move. Government institutions want to harass me as I stand with Imran Khan,” he said.
He alleged that the police had raided his house and those of his associates “without arrest warrants”.
“I have faith in courts. That’s why I am appearing in the cases,” he said.
In a statement issued on Thursday night, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan condemned the arrest, saying that it was a deplorable act, particularly when the Lahore High Court has recently struck down this colonial sedition law.

5,IBA-Sukkur teacher killed over ‘honour’ enmity,SSP Kandhkot says police are conducting raids to apprehend the suspected killers of Dr Ajmal Sawand.,"SUKKUR: Shooters suspected to be from the Sundrani clan gunned down a prominent teacher associated with the Institute of Business Administration, because of an ongoing enmity over “honour”, the police said on Thursday.
Dr Mohammad Ajmal Sawand was on his way back to Sukkur from his Shawli village when attackers holed up in the woods along the road opened indiscriminate fire at his car in the Shalo area of Kandhkot, killing him on the spot.
Giving details of dispute, SSP Kandhkot Irfan Ali Samo told Dawn that two groups of Sundrani and Sawand clans were at loggerheads since 2022 due to a clash that erupted between them on a matter of “honour”.
 






According to sources, the honour dispute involved a girl from the Sundrani clan and a man from the Sawand community. The man was murdered in September after being declared ‘karo’ while the fate of the girl, declared ‘kari’, remains unclear.
A woman and four men belonging to the Sundrani clan lost their lives in the clash that happened last year, the SSP said.
Soon after that last year’s clash, the group belonging to the Sawand clan abandoned their homes and fled the Shawli village, in an apparent move to escape reprisal, said the officer.
The SSP said that police had cordoned off the area and were raiding various places to apprehend the suspected killers of Dr Ajmal Sawand.
Scores of armed people belonging to the Sawand community and locals rushed to the spot where the ambush took place and shifted the professor’s body to the taluka hospital. The body was handed over to the family after a post-mortem examination.
The funeral prayer was held in the evening in Society Area, Sukkur. Teachers, students, government officials and people from all walks of life attended Prof Sawand’s last rites.
IBA Vice Chancellor Asif Sheikh said Dr Sawand, who did his PhD from Paris Descartes Univer­sity, had been working for the institute for the last eight years. He said Mr Sawand was a distingui­shed scholar in the field of computer science and made significant contributions to the institute through his research work.

7,Altaf files appeal in UK properties case,"Says if his appeal is not admitted, he will approach the court of appeal.","LONDON: Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) chief Altaf Hussain on Thursday appealed to British Home Secretary Suella Braverman to take notice of the outcome of the London properties case, dubbing it a “travesty of justice”.  
“I am aware that over here the British government doesn’t interfere in courts, but they must take note as this decision has implications for the justice system,” Mr Hussain said.  
At a press conference held at MQM’s International Secretariat here in Edgware, the MQM supremo said the establishment is used to applying a “minus formula” on political parties, and is known to create groups and break parties.  
He said the properties in London were accumulated in trust for MQM over time, after he went into self-exile in London in the 1990s, and that they were purchased through the donations of party supporters all over the world. He said the family members of party workers still use some of those properties.  
He said he has “no other choice but to appeal before the same judge”, and that if his appeal is not admitted, he will approach the court of appeal.
