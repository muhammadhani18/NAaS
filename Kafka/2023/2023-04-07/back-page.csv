0,"Loyalty to state, govt must be distinguished: LHC",Issues Justice Shahid Karim's detailed judgement against offence of sedition.,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has ruled that loyalty to the state has to be distinguished from loyalty to the government whose offices are being occupied by a political party as not everyone will have doctrinal affinity with a ruling party and, therefore, must be free to express feelings of disaffection towards its policies.
“Why should a citizen or a member of the press be charged with sedition for expressing hatred, contempt or disaffection towards a federal or provincial government?” Justice Shahid Karim poses a query in his 48-page detailed judgement against the offence of sedition under Section 124-A of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) 1860.
Through a short order issued on March 30, the judge had allowed a public interest petition and struck down the Section 124-A for being repugnant to the fundamental rights of the citizens protected in the Constitution.

Issues detailed judgement against offence of sedition

Advocate Abuzar Salman Niazi had argued the petition filed by a citizen, Haroon Farooq.
Giving reasons in his detailed verdict, Justice Karim observed: “As human beings we are all susceptible to showing such emotions at some point or the other and to curb them is to make robots out of the citizens of Pakistan.”
The judge maintained that the people of this country are the masters and the holders of offices of the government are the public servants. He said there are three key words used in the Section 124-A — contempt, hatred and disaffection.
The judge explained that at a given time and in a particular case, strong feelings of disapproval may go unnoticed yet in another case and under different circumstances, lesser feelings of disapproval would be enough to attract the offence.
“In the ultimate analysis the decision to prosecute depends on who wields the authority,” he added.
The judge observed that “disinfection” is absence of affection or goodwill and it is inconceivable that such a mild sentiment will attract offence. He said there is virtually no affection amongst the political opponents and so anything they utter will attract Section 124-A in its present form.
Taken in its present form, the Section 124-A demands allegiance and loyalty by all opposition parties, their members, by the citizens and members of the press towards the federal or provincial governments of the day, Justice Karim observed.
He pointed out that disloyalty and feelings of enmity have also been included in the expression of disaffection. This means that any political opponents or a citizen holding loyalty to a different political group will be committing an offence by doing so.
The judge said a citizen will, by necessary implication, be disloyal to the federal or provincial government in power and “this is antithetical to the very concept of democracy and constitutionalism”.
He said at any particular moment, nearly half of the population will be guilty of the offence of seditious libel.
Justice Karim further observed that the offence of sedition could also be used against the press, its editors, etc, as it infringes the right of a free press to publish freely what is necessary to do so in order to inform the public which has a right to know and be informed in order to make a more informed decision regarding political matters.
“The existence of free press therefore is an essential element in a constitutional democracy and rule of law,” he ruled. He said the offence of sedition in Section 124-A travels beyond the limitation placed by Article 19 of the Constitution regarding role of press and its freedom, which must not be abridged on the misplaced notion that the government of the day can suppress political speech at will.
Justice Karim declared that if Section 124-A was allowed to stand in its present form, the media and the press would also be caught by its mischief and contrary to its role of informing the general public regarding issues of a political nature will be shackled by its ability to do so by the provisions of the impugned section, which would pose a constant threat to a free press to write freely and to dispense information without any fear of prosecution.

1,Treating property’s value as income ‘beyond federal powers’: LHC,LHC rules excluding some people under Section 7E of income tax ordinance is ‘discriminatory’.,"LAHORE: In a significant development, the Lahore High Court (LHC) has declared the tax on deemed income on immovable properties under Section 7E of the Income Tax Ordinance 2001 as ultra vires to the Constitution — meaning it exceeded its scope and went beyond its authority — and ruled that treating the market value of the immovable property as income is beyond the competence of federal legislator.
In a 50-page judgement, Justice Shahid Jamil Khan also ruled that excluding certain people — for instance, martyrs and their depen­dents and former servicemen — under 7E(2d) of the ordinance is discriminatory, offending Article 25 of the Constitution that says, “All citizens are equal before the law and are entitled to equal protection of the law.”
The judgement examined the federal legislature’s competence to levy income tax on immovable property, invoking fiction of law by using the phrase, “A person shall be treated to have derived, as income chargeable to tax”, on capital assets owned by a resident person.
This presumption is enforced by inserting Section 7E in Chapter 2 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, through Finance Act, 2022.

LHC rules excluding some people under Section 7E of income tax ordinance is ‘discriminatory’

In the judgement, Justice Khan allowed more than 1,000 petitions by the taxpayers challenging the legislative competence of the federal government to levy the tax and the vires of Section 7E.
The judge observed that the event or incidence of all kinds of taxation, direct or indirect, is to be decided by the legislature through enactment, influenced by political, economic and social factors, as well as international agreements and treaties.
He said taxes on a person or property are generally direct taxes, and tax on transactions is indirect, for it goes with the transaction and falls where the transaction terminates.
The judge observed that the state’s power to tax is the incident of sovereignty exercised through legislative discretion, which could not be curtailed on the grounds of being harsh or unreasonable.
“Since Federal Legislature is competent to fix a maximum limit of possessing or controlling property and can levy tax, driving competence from Entry 50 [of the Fourth Schedule], to achieve this goal, therefore, it has implicit power to control and curb ill-gotten assets as well,” he wrote.
“Accumulation of wealth through unfair means can be checked and criminalised through taxing provisions along with amendments to corresponding provisions of other relevant laws,” he added.
However, Justice Khan said that excluding people under clauses (i), (iii) and (iv) of Section 7E(2)(d) of the ordinance was discriminatory.
The clause gave exemption to a shaheed (martyr) or dependents of a shaheed belonging to Pakistan Armed Forces; a person or dependents of the person who dies while in the service of Pakistan armed forces or federal or provincial government; a war-wounded person while in service of Pakistan armed forces or federal or provincial government; and an ex-serviceman and serving personnel of armed forces or ex-employees or serving personnel of federal and provincial governments, being original allottees of the capital asset duly certified by the allotment authority.
The judge ruled that this clause is highly discriminatory for those who purchase property from their savings but were never allotted any asset, including immovable property, during their service.
He said while excluding certain persons, the legislature ignored the persons, who inherited the immovable property but are not capable of paying capital value tax, particularly when the tax is on the person and not the property.
“This omission makes the levy expropriatory and confiscatory for those who might have to sell the asset to be taxed, for paying the tax,” he said.
The judge said the curative legislation is expected to bring the provisions of Section 7E within the spirit of taxing the capital value of assets and to harmonise it with other provisions of the income tax ordinance.
The petitioners were represented by Salman Akram Raja, Saqib Jillani, Ahmad Qayyum and other lawyers.

2,"Tehran, Riyadh look to cement ‘security, stability’","BEIJING: Top diplomats from Middle East rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia met in Beijing on Thursday, resuming diplomatic...","BEIJING: Top diplomats from Middle East rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia met in Beijing on Thursday, resuming diplomatic relations and pledging to work together to bring “security and stability” to their turbulent region.
In a joint statement released after talks between Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and Saudi counterpart Prince Faisal bin Farhan, the two sides vowed to continue to work together to improve ties.
The meeting came after a surprise China-brokered deal in March put Tehran and Riyadh on a path to restore relations that had been severed seven years ago when protesters in Iran attacked Saudi diplomatic missions.
“The two sides emphasised the importance of following up on the implementation of the Beijing Agreement and its activation in a way that expands mutual trust and the fields of cooperation and helps create security, stability and prosperity in the region,” Thursday’s joint statement said.
Chinese Foreign Mini­ster Qin Gang “witnessed the signing of a joint statement between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and the two countries announced the resumption of diplomatic relations with immediate effect”, the ministry said.
The shock rapprochement between mainly Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest oil exporter, and Shiite-majority Iran, strongly at odds with Western governments over its nuclear activities, has the potential to reshape relations across a region characterised by turbulence for decades.
The two sides “negotiated and exchanged opinions with the emphasis on the official resumption of bilateral relations and the executive steps towards the reopening of the embassies and consulates of the two countries”, Iran’s foreign ministry said.
Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson hailed the meeting, adding that the ministers “expressed their gratitude to China for its contribution to the promotion of dialogue”.

3,"PAC orders inquiry into breach of army chief, family’s personal data",Body seeks criminal case against Nadra officials involved in the matter.,"ISLAMABAD: The parliament’s Public Accounts Committee has sought a criminal case against Nadra officers who allegedly breached the data and accessed personal information of the army chief’s family.
The meeting on Thursday, chaired by MNA Noor Alam Khan, expressed serious concerns over media reports about the breach.
Those involved in this data theft should be behind bars, Mr Khan said, while adding that Military intelligence and ISI should be made part of the investigation in this matter. “It should be determined how the family’s personal information was stolen.”
The committee also summoned the Nadra chairman who was unable to attend the meeting due to his other engagements. This agitated Mr Khan who said the news was all over the media and he also saw a vlog in which two journalists discussed the issue.

Body seeks criminal case against Nadra officials involved in the matter

In a vlog earlier this week, two journalists, Azaz Syed and Umar Cheema claimed that in October 2022, the personal data and travel records of COAS Asim Munir’s family were allegedly accessed by Nadra officers in a bid to stop his appointment as the army chief.
The COAS was then serving as a lieutenant general, in line to be appointed to the top post.
 


In a statement three days ago, Nadra confirmed that the family’s personal information was accessed and stolen. The statement added that an investigation was ongoing to identify the officials involved in the breach.
The PAC meeting also took up the issue of the Capital Development Authority (CDA) audit. Mr Khan said the practice of giving plots to officials should be discontinued and inquired how many plots were given to judges, prime ministers, presidents, MNAs, senators bureaucrats and military officials.
The meeting also ordered a special audit of Islamabad Police’s welfare fund while discussing and reviewing audit objections related to the Ministry of Interior for the year 2021-22.
The matter of militant attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was also discussed in the meeting. Mr Khan said the attacks have increased in his constituency and miscreants were attacking with rocket launchers.“The government has failed to enforce its writ. Somebody needs to tell the KP police chief that rocket launchers are being used in Peshawar and no one seems to be bothered by it.”

4,UK king backs probe into monarchy’s slavery links,LONDON: Britain’s King Charles III is supporting research into the historical links between the monarchy and the...,"LONDON: Britain’s King Charles III is supporting research into the historical links between the monarchy and the transatlantic slave trade, Buckingham Palace said on Thursday.
A month ahead of his coronation, the palace said that academics will gain greater access to royal archives, and that Charles takes the issue “profoundly seriously”.
Charles’s 17th century predecessor King James II was the largest investor in the Royal African Comp­any, which became a brutal pioneer of the transatlantic slave trade.
Last year, Charles told a meeting of Commonwealth leaders that in order to “unlock the power of our common future, we must also acknowledge the wrongs which have shaped our past”. But there was no apology from the then-heir to the throne for the royal family’s involvement in the transportation and selling of people for profit.
James II, deposed in 1688, was not the only one of Charles’s forebears who was complicit in the slave trade.

5,Barkhan bodies were those of Granaz’s sons: DNA report,Autopsy has now revealed that the female body was not that of Granaz.,"QUETTA: The bodies retrieved from a well in Balochistan’s Barkhan area were those of Granaz Bibi’s sons, according to a DNA report submitted to the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD).
Three bodies, including that of a female, were found near the village of Sardar Abdul Rehman Khetran, a sitting minister in the Balochistan government, earlier this year. Police initially believed that the three bodies were those of Granaz Bibi and her two sons.
But an autopsy has now revealed that the female body was not that of Granaz, police surgeon Dr Ayesha Fiaz said in her report.
Instead, she added, it was the body of a 17-year-old girl whose face and neck were burned by acid to render her beyond recognition.
Granaz was, in fact, later found alive by law enforcement personnel in Kohlu, which is close to Barkhan district, after the arrest of Sardar Abdul Rehman Khetran. The three bodies were handed over to the Marri tribe after post-mortem in Quetta’s Civil Hospital.
Samples from the three bodies and Granaz Bibi were sent to the forensic laboratory in Lahore for DNA test. The identity of the female body remains unascertained so far.
The discovery of three bodies near Sardar Khetran’s ancestral village had sent a wave of shock and outrage through the region. Sit-ins lasting a couple of weeks drew the nation’s attention to illegal prisons allegedly run by tribal chiefs.
Meanwhile, the authorities have beefed up security for provincial minister Sardar Abdul Rehman Khetran after reports emerged that the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan had put his name on its hit list.
The Superintendent of Police in Barkhan issued a threat alert saying that the TTP was planning to attack Sardar Khetran.

6,Barrage of rockets targets Israel after Al Aqsa clashes,Pakistan condemns attacks on the holy site; US ‘concerned’ by scenes of violence.,"FASSUTA: A barrage of rockets was fired from Lebanon at Israel on the Jewish Passover holiday on Thursday, in the largest escalation along the fro­ntier since Israel and Hezbollah fought a 34-day war in 2006.
The rocket fire came just days after Israeli police drew widespread condemnation and warnings of retaliation from around the region for clashing with Palestinians inside Al Aqsa mosque.
Pakistan strongly condemned the recent Israeli attacks on Al Aqsa mosque. The National Assembly passed a resolution stating that the attacks on women and children are a gross violation of human rights. It said the attacks have hurt the sentiments of Muslims around the world, urging the international community, inc­lu­ding human rights organisations, to break silence on this violence.
State Department spokesperson Vedant Patel said the US is “concerned” by the scenes of violence out of Jerusalem, adding that the administration is in regular touch with Israeli partners and the Palestinian authority. Patel said he did not have a specific engagement between US and Israeli officials to talk about the Al Aqsa raid.
Israel blamed Palestinians groups for the rockets fired from Lebanon, an army spokesperson said. “We know for sure it’s Palestinian fire, it’s hard to say, it could be Hamas it could be Islamic Jihad, we are still trying to finalise but it wasn’t Hezbollah,” an army spokesperson said.
Earlier, Israel’s army said it had “identified 34 rockets that were fired from Lebanese territory into Israeli territory” and that 25 were intercepted by Israeli air defences.
“Five rockets landed in Israeli territory,” added the army statement that followed the attack, which was not immediately claimed by any group.

Anwar Iqbal in Washington adds: The UN Security Council convened an emergency session on Thursday to discuss recent Israeli violence against Palestinian worshippers in Al Aqsa mosque this week.
The closed door meeting was called by the UAE, the Arab League’s representative on the top UN panel, and China, a permanent member of the council.
The United States has expressed ‘extreme concern’ over Israeli-Palestinian tensions.
The raids have drawn heavy criticism from various leaders and organisations across the world.
A UN statement noted that Thursday was the seventh day that the Council has met to discuss the situation in the Middle East. Ordinarily, the Council meets once a month under this agenda item.
The statement indicated that council members sought an update from UN representative for the ME on the ongoing tensions at Haram Al Sharif.
According to the Israeli police, “dozens of law-breaking and masked juveniles smuggled fireworks, clubs and stones into the mosque and violently barricaded themselves inside,” forcing the police to act.
The UN also mentioned the Israeli policy’s stance, claiming that “stones were thrown and multiple firecrackers were set off inside the mosque,” and they entered the mosque to force them out.
The UN report also mentioned witness accounts cited by Al Jazeera say that the Israeli police “beat worshippers with batons and used tear gas and sound bombs to force them out of the prayer halls”.
