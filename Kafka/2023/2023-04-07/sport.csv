0,"‘Tennis missed a chance to ban Russians, Belarusians’",LONDON: Women’s world number one Iga Swiatek says tennis authorities missed an opportunity to ban Russian and...,"LONDON: Women’s world number one Iga Swiatek says tennis authorities missed an opportunity to ban Russian and Belarusian players outright after Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, but the moment has passed to do so now, she told the BBC.
The 21-year-old Pole has been a staunch supporter of her Ukrainian rivals criticising the WTA for not doing enough to support them.
Unlike other sports which imposed an outright ban following the invasion in February 2022, tennis officials permitted those from Russia and Belarus to continue playing, but as neutral athletes.
They were allowed to play three of the four Grand Slam tournaments, with Wimbledon the exception.
Authorities punished Wimbledon organisers by not awarding the tournament ranking points, but Russian and Belarusian players will be able to compete this year after the ban was lifted.
Both countries were also barred from team events like the Davis Cup, in which Russia were the defending champions.
“I heard that after World War Two, German players were not allowed as well as Japanese and Italian, and I feel like this kind of thing would show the Russian government that maybe it’s not worth it,” Swiatek told the BBC.
“I know it’s a small thing because we are just athletes, a little piece in the world but I feel like sport is pretty important and sport has always been used in propaganda.
“This is something that was considered at the beginning, tennis didn’t really go that way, but now it would be pretty unfair for Russian and Belarusian players to do that because this decision was supposed to be made a year ago.”
Swiatek, who won her second French Open title in 2022 and added the US Open crown, said both the WTA and ATP had shown a  “lack of leadership” following the invasion, and as a result tennis was in a  “chaotic place”.
“I feel like tennis, from the beginning, could do a bit better in showing everybody that tennis players are against the war,” she said.
“I feel they could do more to make that point and tell their views, and help us cope a bit better in the locker room because the atmosphere there is pretty tense.”
Last week, Ukrainian tennis player Lesia Tsurenko slammed Belarus’s Australian Open champion Aryna Sabalenka for claiming she had never felt so much hate in the locker room.
“I think this is another game they are starting, now they are the victims, we are not,” Tsurenko said.
Swiatek says she has a certain amount of sympathy for the Russians and Belarusians.
“It’s not their fault they have a passport like that,” she said.
“I did shake hands, for example, with Daria Kasatkina — she openly said that she’s against the war at the beginning and it would be her dream for the war to finish.
“I really respect that because I feel it’s brave for Russian athletes to say that because their situation is pretty complicated and sometimes it’s hard for them to speak out loud about it.”

Blas’s masterpiece gave Antoine Kombouare’s side a well-deserved victory against a Lyon team who looked out of sorts three days after beating Paris St Germain in Ligue 1.
Nantes, whose Cup triumph last season was their first major trophy since  winning the league in 2001, have a golden chance of a successful  defence.
Nantes will meet either Ligue 2 side Annecy or Toulouse, who face each late other on Thursday, in the Stade de France showdown on April 29.
They will be looking to claim their fifth title in the competition.
While Lyon enjoyed the majority of possession at the Stade de la Beaujoire, it was Nantes who threatened the most, managing three shots on target out of four attempts in an otherwise quiet opening half.
Blas put the hosts ahead 12 minutes into the second half with a volley on the turn to reward Nantes for their dominance.
The Canaries continued to press Lyon, who had their only shot on target four minutes from time when Bradley Barcola’s atte­mpt was parried away by Alban Lafont.

2,Barcelona stunned as Benzema hat-trick sends Real into Copa final,"“We’re hurt today, yes. It will be hard to sleep, more so as the big Barca fan that I am,” Xavi tells reporters.","BARCELONA: Karim Benzema struck a hat-trick as Real Madrid thrashed arch-rivals and league leaders Barcelona 4-0 to reach the Copa del Rey final in stunning fashion on Wednesday.
Barca, bidding for a fourth successive Clasico victory this season, looked set for the final having edged a 1-0 win in the first leg of the semi-final in Madrid last month.
But after dominating the early stages of the second leg they fell apart in unlikely fashion to lose 4-1 on aggregate with Benzema becoming the first Real player to score a hat-trick in a Clasico at the Nou Camp since Ferenc Puskas in 1963.
Vinicius Jr gave Real the lead in first-half stoppage time following a lightning counter-attack and the semi-final was turned on its head when Benzema stroked a shot into the corner five minutes into the second half from a Luka Modric pass.
Eight minutes later Vinicius was fouled in the area and Benzema thumped his penalty past Marc-Andre ter Stegen.
With jeers echoing around the Nou Camp, Barcelona tried to respond but it was Real who looked the more likely to add to their tally with Benzema unstoppable.
In the 80th minute, he was again set up by Vinicius to complete his second hat-trick in a matter of days having also hit a treble in the 6-0 destruction of Real Valladolid.
Real will fancy their chances of winning the trophy for a 20th time when they face Osasuna in the final after they beat Athletic Bilbao 2-1 on aggregate on Tuesday.
“It was a complete match. If you don’t make it complete, you can’t win 0-4 here,” Ancelotti said.
“In the first half we had difficulties but the first goal changes the dynamics of the whole match.
“It’s a game in which personality and experience is a very important aspect. We mixed the energy of Rodrygo, Valverde and Camavinga with the experience of Vini, Modric, Kroos. They played a spectacular game.”
After suffering at the hands of Barcelona this season, it was a spectacular riposte by Ancelotti’s side as Real beat Barca by at least a four-goal margin for the first time since 1995.
Real are a distant second behind Barca in La Liga having lost 2-1 to their bitter rival last month. But while the title may be gone, they regained bragging rights in style.
There was no hint of what was to come on Wednesday as Barcelona looked in the mood to kill the tie with Thibaut Courtois thwarting the hosts on a number of occasions.
It was from one Courtois save to deny Robert Lewandowski that the tie turned in an instant.
Real broke forward at pace and Vinicius exchanged passes with Benzema before his shot crept over the line despite the efforts of defender Ronald Araujo to keep it out.
Five minutes after the break Modric glided in from the right and rolled a pass to Benzema to send a precise finish into the corner. Xavi’s Barcelona were in tatters minutes later when Vinicius was fouled and Benzema exacted punishment.
Tempers flared with players from both sides getting involved in skirmishes but Benzema had the last laugh to complete a magical night for Real and one Barca will want to forget.
“We’re hurt today, yes. It will be hard to sleep, more so as the big Barca fan that I am,” Xavi told reporters.
“I told the players (this could happen), we had chances but went in at 1-0.
It’s a shame because we competed well in the first half and that was our moment. “In the second Madrid were better, sincerely, they were better physically, they pressed us high. There are no excuses.”

Fiorentina were on the front foot from the word go and Cabral put them in front 20 minutes into the game with a towering header, after he was brilliantly set up by defender Cristiano Biraghi.
Fiorentina were awarded a penalty for a handball by Emanuel Aiwu, who got sent off, and Gonzalez doubled their lead in the 75th minute with a precise shot from the spot, which the Argentina international sent into the bottom left corner.
The game reflected the 27-point gap between the teams in the Serie A standings, with Fiorentina enjoying the lion’s share of the possession while bottom side Cremonese only managed a shot on target in the second half.
Cremonese, who are playing their second Italian Cup semi-final and first since 1986-87, eliminated AS Roma in the quarter-finals and Napoli in last 16.
The second-leg games will be played on April 26 and 27.

4,Warner at ‘mercy of selection’ for Ashes: Bailey,"Bailey says ""there’s a number of differences"" between India and England teams when asked why Warner is in frame for WTC final but not Ashes.","MELBOURNE: Australia opener David Warner is in the frame for the World Test Championship final against India but selectors’ boss George Bailey declined to back him as an automatic inclusion for the Ashes squad.
Selectors will pick a wider squad in about two weeks for the WTC decider at The Oval from June 7-11 and for the first two Tests of the Ashes series, which starts on June 16 in Birmingham.
Apart from a defiant 200 against South Africa in December, left-hander Warner has struggled for runs in recent Tests, making a total of 26 in three innings in the recent tour of India before returning home injured.
Despite that, head coach and selector Andrew McDonald said last month Warner was in Australia’s plans for the WTC final.
Warner was included in Cricket Australia’s list of 24 nationally contracted players on Thursday but Bailey stopped short of saying it was an endorsement for the Ashes.
“I think Dave, like any player is, is at the mercy of selection,” Bailey told reporters. “The Ashes is a huge series and we’ll be looking to pick our best team.
“We’re going to have to have our best team playing incredibly well to challenge England over there, the way they’re playing at the moment.”
Asked why Warner would not be picked in an Ashes squad if he were to play in English conditions during the WTC final, Bailey said he endorsed McDonald’s point that England were a different team to India.
“I support Andrew’s comments on that around David,” he said. “I think there’s a number of differences (between the teams). But we’re a couple of weeks away from announcing that squad.”
Warner averaged 9.50 in the 2019 Ashes in England, the worst ever by an opener to play 10 innings in a series. Travis Head replaced him at the top of the order in India and batted superbly in the last two Tests but selectors said his promotion was a short-term fix.
Opener Marcus Harris was a surprise inclusion in the list of contracted players, having played the last of his 14 Tests against England in January 2022.

Leipzig, desperate to end their recent losing streak that has seen them drop to fifth place in the league, pressed high from the start and carved out chance after chance against a dazed Dortmund team.
The visitors were unable to stop the waves of early Leipzig attacks or mount any offensive challenge of their own.
With a total of two shots on goal and both coming in second-half stoppage time, Dortmund were no match for Leipzig’s power, with the hosts managing 20 shots.
The hosts’ dominance paid off after 22 minutes when Germany forward Werner, who had earlier gone close, tapped in to give Leipzig a well-deserved lead.
Dortmund briefly tried to come back in the second half but they were lucky not to concede a second goal when Konrad Laimer broke clear in the 78th but failed to beat keeper Gregor Kobel in a one-on-one.
Even the introduction of Anthony Modeste, a third Dortmund striker, in the 85th minute did not help Edin Terzic’s team get the equaliser, with Leipzig keeper Janis Blaswich making a superb stoppage-time save.
Instead it was Leipzig who scored again on the break with Willi Orban sealing their victory.
Dortmund have now won only one of their last five matches in all competitions, including a Champions League Round of 16 loss to Chelsea, and have dropped to second place in the Bundesliga, two points behind Bayern, with eight games left.

The victory was a perfect response following a disappointing 2-0 defeat by Newcastle on Sunday and lifted the Red Devils to 53 points, three ahead of fifth-placed Tottenham Hotspur and level with the Magpies in third.
United started brightly, forcing a series of corners and free kicks as Brentford pulled their outfield players behind the ball to try to close down space, and when the breakthrough came in the 27th minute it was from another set-piece.
A Brentford clearance from a corner only made it as far winger Antony on the edge of the box. He lofted it towards the head of Marcel Sabitzer, and Rashford met the Austrian’s bouncing knockdown with a sumptuous half-volley that gave David Raya no chance to register his 28th goal of the season.
David De Gea almost gave Brentford a lifeline early in the second half when his loose attempt at a clearance cannoned into the onrushing Ivan Toney, but luckily for the United keeper the ball bounced to safety.
Brentford poured forward in the closing stages, but the closest they came to scoring was an audacious attempt at a chip from Toney that drifted harmlessly over the bar as the home side held on.Meanwhile, a fourth consecutive win edged Newcastle closer to the Champions League for the first time in 20 years.
Callum Wilson and Joelinton each scored twice for the Magpies, who remain above United on goal difference.Wilson  was restored to the starting line-up by Newcastle boss Eddie Howe in place of Alexander Isak  and rewarded his manager’s trust by heading home the opener after just  six minutes.
Joelinton doubled the Magpies lead inside 13 minutes  as the Brazilian latched onto Fabian Schar’s ball over the top and  coolly rounded Lukasz Fabianski before slotting into an empty net.
Kurt Zouma’s header just before half-time briefly gave West Ham hope.
But  within seconds of the second-half kick off, Nayef Aguerd was  dispossessed inside his own box by Jacob Murphy, who squared for Wilson  to have a tap in.
Another West Ham gift allowed Isak to make it  four as Fabianski cleared the ball into the Swede’s path before  Joeli­nton delivered the final blow.
David Moyes looked on aghast  at his side’s defending it could the final nail in the coffin for the  Scot as he faces becoming the 13th Premier League manager sacked this  season.
Defeat leaves the Hammers still out of the relegation zone only on goal difference.

7,Tucker’s debut hundred leads Ireland fightback against BD,"DHAKA: Debutant Lorcan Tucker became only the second Irishman to hit a Test century, ably assisted by Andy...","DHAKA: Debutant Lorcan Tucker became only the second Irishman to hit a Test century, ably assisted by Andy McBrine’s unbeaten 71, to lead a tenacious fightback against Bangladesh in Dhaka on Thursday.
Ireland reached 286-8 at stumps on the third day to lead the hosts by 131 runs after resuming on a precarious 27-4 in the one-off Test.
Tucker made 108 off 162 balls before falling to the bowling of Ebadot Hossain, with Shoriful Islam taking the catch at extra cover.
The wicket-keeper/batter hit 14 fours and a six and was brilliantly assisted by Harry Tector and McBrine in partnerships of 72 and 111 to put the pressure back on Bangladesh.
“It is obviously pretty special. It wasn’t something that I thought would happen today,” Tucker said.
“We were under a lot of pressure. We tried to take it ball-by-ball and bat for as long as we could. It was very special to get a personal reward.
“The team is also in a great position. We are looking forward to tomorrow,” he said.
Tector resumed from overnight for a 28-run partnership with Peter Moor before left-arm pacer Shoriful gave the hosts their first breakthrough of the day.
Moor was gone for 16 but Tector and Tucker staved off further damage with their stand.
Tector departed after he was found leg before wicket off Taijul Islam, but his 56 made him the first Irish cricketer to hit half-centuries in both innings of a Test match.
Tucker brought up his century with a cover drive for four off left-arm spinner Taijul, raising his bat after hugging McBrine.
Mark Adair was next to bat, accompanying McBrine in a 31-run stand bef­ore he was rem­oved by Taijul, the most successful Bang­la­desh bow­ler of the innings with 4-86.
“No one said Test cricket’s gonna be easy,” said Bangladesh bowling coach Allan Donald.
“I thought they grinded out the day beautifully and yes, once again, one massive tick to Ireland. They fought hard today.”
Kevin O’Brien is the only other Irishman to hit a Test century, scoring 118 against Pakistan during Ireland’s 2018 maiden Test in Dublin.
Ireland have lost all three of their previous Tests since becoming a full member of the International Cricket Council in 2017.

8,DP World Tour wins legal battle against LIV Golf players,LONDON: The DP World Tour has won its legal battle to be able to suspend and fine LIV Golf players who featured in...,"LONDON: The DP World Tour has won its legal battle to be able to suspend and fine LIV Golf players who featured in conflicting events without permission after the independent UK-based panel of Sports Resolutions found in its favour on Thursday.
Members of the DP World Tour, also known as the European Tour, who played in Saudi-backed LIV Golf’s ope­ning tournament last June sought a  “conflicting event” exemption but the request was denied and they received three-event bans and fines.
Ian Poulter, Adrian Ota­egui and Justin Har­ding appealed against the decision and the punishments were put on hold pending an appeal, which allowed LIV players to continue competing on the DP World Tour without penalty.
The number of appellants increased to 16, but Sergio Garcia, Charl Schw­artzel, Branden Grace and Otaegui withdrew before the five-day Sports Resolutions hearing took place in February.
The appeal panel on Thursday said the sanctioned players  “committed serious breaches” of the code of behaviour of the DP World Tour’s regulations by playing in LIV events despite their release requ­ests having been refused.
The decision could have huge implications for Lee Westwood, Poulter and Garcia, who may face bans from the Ryder Cup.
“The appeals were dismissed and each of the Appellants were ordered to pay the fine of 100,000 pounds ($124,540.00) originally imposed by [the DP World Tour],” it added.
The panel found that DP World Tour Chief Exe­cutive Keith Pelley  “acted entirely reasonably in refusing relea­ses” and that the regulations  “cannot be said to go beyond what is necessary and proportionate to the (DP World Tour’s) continued operation as a professional golf tour”.
Pelley welcomed the decision.
“We are delighted that the panel recognised we have a responsibility to our full membership to do this and also determined that the process we followed was fair and proportionate,” he said. “In deciding the level of these sanctions last June, we were simply administering the regulations which were created by our members and which each of them signed up to.”
Matthew Schwartz, counsel to LIV Golf, said the procedural opinion of DP World Tour’s arbitration body had failed to reasonably address why  “competitive forces must be upheld”.
“By punishing players for playing golf, the DPWT is seeking to unreasonably control players and it is the sport and fans that suffer. There are no winners.” The PGA Tour, in a decision released moments after play in the LIV Golf inaugural event last June, suspended members who played in the event and said anyone else who makes the jump will face the same fate.

Former Pakistan fast bowler Saleem Jaffar, currently the side’s bowling coach, meanwhile, was named the chair of the Women’s Selection Committee.
Nida fills up the slot which was vacated by former skipper Bismah Maroof last month and faces a host of upcoming assignments. In an 11-month period from August 2023 to July 2024, Pakistan are scheduled to play five bilateral series, including 15 ICC Women’s Championship One-day Internationals. 
In addition to the 50-over matches, Pakistan will play as many as 17 T20Is. These ODIs and T20Is will lead to the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup in Bangladesh and the 50-over World Cup in India, which will be held in 2024 and 2025 respectively.
“The appointments have been made in light of the PCB’s (Pakistan Cricket Board) vision and strategy to invest further into women’s cricket and keeping in mind the upcoming international assignments, including hosting South Africa and tours to Bangladesh and New Zealand for the ICC Women’s Championship 2022-25 fixtures,” read a statement from the board.
The 36-year-old Nida is a veteran of 130 T20Is and 99 ODIs and boasts the record as the leading wicket-taker in T20I cricket with 126 victims to her name. She aims to help Pakistan break into and cement their place in the upper half of the Women’s Championship “before slowly working our way into the top-three.” 
“The upcoming season of women’s cricket is going to be a tough one,” Nida said in a statement. “But we are fortunate to have some young exciting talent in our pool of players, which I am confident will significantly improve during the course and also help the side to produce strong performances. 
“As a captain, my objective remains to inspire and mentor these young players to become quality cricketers.”
Coles’ reappointment, meanwhile, is significantly driven by his working relationship with the PCB’s interim Management Committee’s chairman Najam Sethi . The New Zealander worked with Sethi during his time as the Pakistan women’s team head coach from 2017-2019.
Under Coles, Pakistan finished fifth in the 2017-2020 Women’s Championship cycle, which paved way for the side to feature in the 2022 Women’s World Cup. During Coles tenure, Nida, Bismah and Javeria Khan established themselves as big names on the international stage.
Coles’ coaching staff will include Mohtashim Rasheed (fielding coach), Taufeeq Umar (batting coach) and Saleem. 
“I am grateful to the PCB for giving me yet another opportunity to work with the talented Pakistan women’s team,” said Coles. 
“It has been a privilege to work with such a talented group of players and I look forward to the exciting times ahead as we aim to improve our previous performances and achievements.   
“We have a lot of potential in the team, and I look forward to helping the players to give their best and achieve success on the international stage.”

10,Rizki allowed as Olympic qualifiers have no binding qualification requirements for coaches,Former Pakistan assistant coach Nasir Ismail posts on social media that it was a “dark day for Pakistan’s AFC A-license coaches”.,"KARACHI: Football coaches across Pakistan had tuned in to the livestream of the 2024 Paris Olympics qualifying tournament match between the national women’s team and the Philippines on Wednesday. As much as the whole exercise was to watch the side in action, it was more to see who was on the bench as head coach.
The Pakistan Football Federa­tion Normalisation Committee had tried to be discreet about Adeel Rizki’s presence with the team as its gaffer in Tajikistan. That worst-kept secret was out when Rizki appe­ared at the press conference on Tuesday alongside the head coaches of the other three teams in Group ‘E’.
Rizki’s appointment as head coach last year, coinciding with the national women’s team ending its eight-year international isolation by appearing at the SAFF Women’s Championship, was fiercely criticised.
With Rizki not having the requisite qualifications — he holds a UEFA B-License when regulations of the Asian Football Con­federation ask for a Pro-License holder to be head coach of the national teams — many felt the appointment was due to his personal links with NC chairman Haroon Malik.
The AFC had been unclear on what regulations it was applying for coaches at the Olympic qualifiers and a glimpse of Adeel in Pakistan’s technical area in an eventual 4-0 defeat to the Philippines in their group opener sent the country’s coaching community into meltdown.
Former Pakistan assistant coach Nasir Ismail posted on social media that it was a “dark day for Pakistan’s AFC A-license coaches”.
The AFC broke its silence on Thursday, telling Dawn that the “Women’s Olympic Football Tournament Paris 2024 falls under the umbrella of FIFA, and the AFC follows the regulations and requirements set by FIFA.”
While the tournament at the Games in Paris next year falls completely in FIFA’s ambit, the qualifiers are organised in association with the continental bodies.
The global football body did not issue an official statement but Dawn understands that Rizki has been allowed to be the head coach as there are no specific coaching qualification requirements in place for the first round of qualifiers, which will see group winners advance to the next stage.
Rizki will now set up his charges for a clash against Hong Kong on Saturday. Hong Kong ran out 3-0 winners over hosts Tajikistan in the other group game on Wednesday.

11,Build-up to World Cup clouded by  India-Pakistan relations,"NEW DELHI: Six months out from the likely start of the Cricket World Cup in India, the match schedule for the...","NEW DELHI: Six months out from the likely start of the Cricket World Cup in India, the match schedule for the tournament is still under wraps as geopolitics cloud the buildup to the showpiece event.
The delay is in stark contrast to the 2019 event, when the dates and venues for the tournament in England and Wales were announced more than a year out in keeping with usual practice for major sporting events.
The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has previously co-hosted three ODI World Cups and organising the 10-team event in October-November should present no major difficulties for the world’s richest board.
However, soured political relations between India and Pakistan have complicated matters and cricket finds itself caught in the geopolitical crossfire between the feuding neighbours, who play each other only in multi-team events.
India have ruled out travelling to Pakistan for the Asia Cup in September and are likely to play their matc­hes at a neutral venue after organisers agreed on a ‘hyb­rid’ model — a move that looks likely to prompt a tit-for-tat response.
The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) denied media reports that it had made a similar demand at the ICC board meetings in Dubai last month but in a statement last week said it may push for the hybrid model “at the proper ICC forum at the right time”.
Should Pakistan agree to travel to India, the BCCI would have to secure visa clearance from the Indian government.
A source with direct knowledge of the deliberations told Reuters that moving matches out of India had not even been discussed and the fixtures would be announced in “due course”.
Cricket news website cricinfo.com has reported that the BCCI has yet to obtain a tax exemption for the tournament from the Indian government, which is part of the hosting agreement it signed with the ICC.
Should it fail to obtain the exemption the BCCI has said the amount could be deducted from its share of the ICC’s central revenue pool.
BCCI Secretary Jay Shah was not immediately available to clarify matters surrounding the schedule but, in an ICC statement revealing the tournament’s brand identity on Satur­day, promised to deliver a “memorable event”. 
“We cannot wait until Oct­o­ber to see world class cricket on show in the pinnacle event of the one-day game and for India to host an incredible spectacle,” Shah said.

12,Williamson set to miss World Cup after knee injury,"Williamson’s absence would be a major blow for the Black Caps, who have never won the World Cup but finished runners-up in past two tournaments.","WELLINGTON: New Zea­land captain Kane Williamson looks set to miss the one-day World Cup in India later this year after rupturing a knee ligament, it was announced on Thursday.
The star batsman needs surgery after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee while fielding for Gujarat Titans in the Indian Premier League, New Zealand Cricket say.
Black Caps coach Gary Stead said it was “unlikely” the 32-year-old would be ready to play in the ODI World Cup, which starts in October.
Williamson’s absence would be a major blow for the Black Caps, who have never won the World Cup but finished runners-up in the past two tournaments.
 






“Naturally it’s disappointing to get such an injury, but my focus now is on having the surgery and starting rehab,” Williamson said in a statement.
“It’s going to take some time but I’ll be doing everything I can to get back on the field as soon as possible.”
Williamson jarred his knee attempting a catch in the opening game of the IPL last Friday, hobbling off the field with the help of two physios.
Williamson’s batting helped New Zealand to the final of both the 2015 World Cup in Australia and the 2019 edition, where they lost to hosts England in a dramatic Super Over.
The right-hander, who has scored 6,554 ODI runs at an average of just under 48, stood down from the Test captaincy last year but remained skipper in the shorter formats.
“It’s a huge spanner in the works for us,” said Stead. “We haven’t given up hope that he might be right, but at this stage it looks unlikely.
“Our first thoughts are with Kane, it’s a tough time for him. It’s not an injury that you’d expect, it’s come out of the blue, and it obviously hits you hard at the time.”
Organisers have yet to anno­unce firm dates for the World Cup but it is expected to get underway in early October with the major nations, including New Zealand, starting their campaigns towards the end of the month.
“I look forward to doing what I can to support Gary and the team over the next few months,” Williamson added.

AUGUSTA: Five-time Masters champion Tiger Woods got his round under way at Augusta National on Thursday as the 87th edition of the tournament started in warm conditions.
Woods found the fairway with a 289-yard drive from the first tee and went on to par the par-4 hole, which has provided him with some tricky moments in the past.
Birdies were in short supply among the early groups who took to the course after former winners Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player and Tom Watson provided the traditional ceremonial launch to the year’s first major tournament.
Temperatures were rising throughout the morning towards the expected high of 87 degrees F and the skies were overcast. Conditions were dry although rain is forecast for later in the week and could impact the schedule.
American Kevin Na withdrew due to illness after playing the first nine holes at 4-over par 40 at Augusta National.World number one Scottie Scheffler is looking to become just the fourth player to win back-to-back Masters.
The American world number one is the bookmaker’s favourite to slip into the famous green jacket when the four rounds are complete on Sunday evening.
Scheffler has been a model of consistency over the past 14 months, which has seen him win six PGA Tour titles, most recently at the Players Championship in March.
Only Nicklaus, Nick Faldo and Woods have achieved successive victories in the Masters.
Last year’s runner-up, Northern Irishman Rory McIlroy, is hoping to finally complete his career Grand Slam with a long-awaited Masters triumph.
McIlroy has been a leading supporter of the PGA Tour, for whom a nightmare scenario would be the sight of a LIV rebel celebrating in the green jacket — not an entirely fanciful notion.
Australian Cameron Smith, the reigning British Open champion, tied for third at Augusta last year, while fellow LIV Golf player Brooks Koepka has won four majors and Dustin Johnson, who won LIV’s first season, triumphed in Augusta three years ago.
The PGA Tour has a much deeper list of contenders with world number three Jon Rahm of Spain, 2015 winner Jordan Spieth and two-time major winner Justin Thomas among those in with a chance.
