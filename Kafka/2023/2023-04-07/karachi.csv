Mr Sheikh, through his lawyer, moved an application under Section 265-K (power of court to acquit accused at any stage) of the criminal procedure code seeking his acquittal from the case.
After hearing arguments from both sides, an ATC judge, who was conducting the proceedings in the judicial complex inside the central prison, allowed the application and exonerated the applicant.
According to the prosecution, Mr Sheikh allegedly facilitated and instigated his aide, Shahzada Faheem Laghari, to open fire on Anti-Encroachment Cell’s Assistant Director Abdul Waleed and his team during an operation to remove unauthorised structures in Gulshan-i-Maymar in May last year.
It stated that the opposition leader had extended threats of dire consequences to the assistant director.
A case was registered under Sections 109 (abetment), 324 (attempted murder), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 506-B (criminal intimidation) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code at the Gulshan-i-Maymar police station against Mr Sheikh.
Meanwhile, the court has adjourned hearing of another case pertaining to violence during the by-election on PS-88 against him to May 19 due to absence of investigating officer of the case.

1,"Constitution provides for zero-loadshedding of gas in Sindh, CM tells federal govt","Says worst-ever cuts have piled miseries on domestic consumers, badly hit industrial sector","KARACHI: Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah has told the federal government that the persisting gas shortage in Sindh had not only badly affected the industrial sector, but its loadshedding, even during Ramazan, is also piling miseries on domestic consumers in the province, which produces over 62pc of the country’s gas. 
In a meeting with Federal Minister of State for Petroleum Musadik Malik on Thursday, he said that the total gas production of Pakistan stood at 3,358.21 MMCFD of which Sindh contributed/produced 62 to 63 per cent gas or 2,100-2,200 MMCFD, adding that the total demand in the province was 1,600-1,700 MMCFD.  
Mr Shah said that the province was being supplied 1,400-1,500 MMCFD for all consumers though the gas surplus production from Sindh still stood at 600-700 MMCFD.  
He regretted that Sindh was facing an acute gas shortage. The worst-ever loadshedding by the Sui Southern Gas Company has made people’s life miserable, especially in the holy fasting month, as no gas is being supplied before Sehri and Iftar in major cities such as Karachi and Hyderabad. 

Says worst-ever cuts have piled miseries on domestic consumers, badly hit industrial sector

Unavailability of the natural gas has forced domestic consumers to either use wood or expensive LPG cylinders for cooking. 
Mr Shah also pointed out that the provincial government had approved 1,000 village gasification schemes which had been pending with SSGC since 2010-11.  
The federal state minister informed the chief minister that the total gas production in the country had been recorded at 3,200 MMCFD of which 200 MMCFD was consumed by the compressors operating in the field. “Out of the remaining 3,000 MMCFD, 1,400 MMCFD goes to the power and fertiliser sectors, and 1,600 MMCFD is supplied through pipes to the distribution companies,” he maintained. 
The chief minister said that we would have to revisit our distribution policy so that the gas-producing province could get its maximum share. Mr Malik agreed to Mr Shah’s proposal and said that a committee was constituted to revisit the policy, frame proposals and discuss them in the next meeting.  
Another issue the CM discussed with the visiting delegation, led by Musadik Malik, was the Weighted Average Cost of Gas (WACOG) policy under which the imported LNG and local gas are pooled in the same energy box, and then a tariff is imposed.  
Mr Shah said that the policy was unconstitutional and would further burden consumers in Sindh and slow down the growth of economic activities.  
He said that WACOG was not viable as long as Sindh had surplus gas. “Sindh’s preference to use gas in relation to other provinces is protected by Article 158 of the Constitution,” he said, and added that there should be zero loadshedding in the province as per the spirit of the Constitution. 
Meeting with WB team 
A delegation of the World Bank, headed by its country director, called on Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah at CM House. 
It was attended by provincial ministers and officials concerned. The meeting was informed that 20 projects of the World Bank were ongoing at a cost of US$3.5 billion. It also discussed the Karachi Mobility Project. 
The CM told the WB team that the tender for the repair of Jam Sadiq Bridge and construction of a new bridge had been published. 
He said that that the project for construction of houses for flood victims was in its final stage and consultants had been hired for the project. 
The CM said that money would soon be released to the flood victims for the reconstruction of their destroyed houses. 
Transport Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon told the meeting buses for the BRT Yellow Line would be procured and run under public-private partnership (PPP) mode. 
He said that consultants had been hired to design the 10-km corridor of the BRT Yellow Line in the Phase-1 of the project.

2,Progress made in multimillion theft at house of Wasim’s mother in Karachi,South-SSP says the theft was allegedly committed by a maid employed by Wasim Akhter’s mother about a month back.,"KARACHI: Police on Thursday claimed to have made some progress in the incident of theft at the residence of former city mayor Wasim Akhter’s mother in DHA.

3,"SHC CJ resents police, administration apathy over 18 deaths in Keamari","Bench irked by only sealing of factories, disappointed over SSP’s progress report.","KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Thursday expressed is dissatisfaction over the investigation being conducted by police into the 18 deaths due to ‘toxic emissions’ in a Keamari neighbourhood.
A two-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Ahmed Ali M. Shaikh also deplored that no action was taken against the illegally established factories in residential areas apart from sealing them.
The bench directed the authorities concerned to file a comprehensive statement till April 10 about the recommendations of a medical board and about the action taken against the factories operating in the residential areas concerned.
The bench further expressed its disappointment over the progress report filed by the senior superintendent of police (investigation) Keamari.

Bench irked by only sealing of factories, disappointed over SSP’s progress report

When the chief justice asked the authorities about the action taken against the factories operating illegally in the areas in question, the advocate general of Sindh and the assistant commissioner concerned said that such industrial units had been sealed.
The chief justice expressed his resentment over such statement and remarked that 18 people had lost their lives but the administration had only sealed such factories.
The bench remarked that the investigating officer could de-seal such industrial units anytime against a bribe.
The bench in its order said that the AG Sindh had sought time for filing a comprehensive report with regard to the constitution of a medical board, its recommendation and action taken against the factories said to have been illegally established in the residential areas concerned.
In February, the SHC had directed the provincial police officer to register FIRs for each victim and conduct proper investigation into the deaths as well as to remove incompetent officials and depute a senior police officer to probe such cases.
It had also expressed its serious dismay over the inaction by the police and local administration for not conducting autopsy of the deceased and reluctance of the police officers concerned in registering cases.
Earlier, on Jan 31, the registrar of SHC had placed a report, including the news published in different newspapers, before the chief justice about the deaths and the chief justice had converted the report to a constitutional petition.
Petitions had also been filed in 2020 regarding an identical matter as around 15 people had died due to suspected leakage of toxic gas in Keamari in February 2020.

4,Elephant Noor Jehan’s condition improves after treatment,Four Paws experts warn poor care may lead to her death,"KARACHI: As the ailing elephant, Noor Jehan, showed signs of improvement a day after she went through risky and complex medical procedures, fears and concerns over her survival remained a subject of discussion at the zoo on Thursday.
The 17-year-old female elephant can now walk, though with difficulty, while the swelling on her genital area and hind limbs has reduced.
Speaking to Dawn, members of Four Paws — the international animal welfare group currently treating the 17-year-old elephant — described the coming three weeks as crucial for her survival.
“Noor Jehan is much better today. Her head is up and so I think chances of her recovery are getting higher and higher,” Dr Aamir Khalil leading the team said.
While expressing his optimism, Dr Khalil was quick to warn that the elephant would die if the treatment protocol recommended by the vets’ team was not duly followed in the coming weeks.

Four Paws experts warn poor care may lead to her death

“Noor Jehan should be seen as an intensive care patient. She is young and can live for several years provided she gets the required medication and physical therapy,” he said.
According to him, apart from medication, what’s important is to rebuild her muscles for which she should be given a healthy diet, a lot of space to move around and an enclosure suiting her needs.
“Right now, Noor Jehan isn’t physically fit to be shifted to the Safari Park, which needs to be modified to make space for both Noor Jehan and Madhubala, the other female zoo elephant.
“Hence, we have recommended (to the zoo staff) measures on how the existing elephant enclosure could be modified and enriched to suit animal requirements.”
The Four Paws team, which includes Dr Marina Ivanova, Dr Frank Göritz, Prof Thomas Hildebrandt, Mathias Otto and Pia Einheimler, is on its fourth visit to the Karachi zoo. In August last year, the team performed major tusk surgeries on both zoo elephants.
In 2021, the team submitted a detailed report to the Sindh High Court, recommending a series of steps on elephants’ welfare, which was approached by a group of citizens worried over animal plight.
‘Depression can kill the elephant’
Prof Thomas Hildebrandt, a senior vet associated with Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in Berlin, Germany, said Noor Jehan’s abnormal foot position and swelling on the genital area, creating a lot of pain for her, were caused by a large hematoma — a pool of mostly clotted blood, usually caused by a broken blood vessel damaged during surgery or an injury — in her pelvic area. “The hematoma might be the result of a fight between the two animals. This clotted blood slowly resolves, causing edema (swelling caused by too much fluid trapped in the body’s tissues) in the reproductive organs,” he explained.
Explaining why Noor Jehan and Madhubala are kept separated, Prof Hildebrandt said they were together in the morning but were later separated when they had a fight.
“We believe Noor Jehan’s disease has come from a fight. Elephants are known to have a hierarchical social structure and this is established by fights. Even the females fight a lot but the fights are not that severe as they fight in open lands. But, if you fight in a small place (like the zoo enclosure), this could be dangerous.”
According to him, there could be two real severe scenarios that can kill Noor Jehan, if she wasn’t given the recommended treatment protocol.
“The first one is compression of the rectum in the pelvic area that can be the beginning of a full occlusion of the rectum passage, causing her death. The second one is complete blockage of her urinary passage. In the latter case, an emergency surgery is required to release the urine to save the animal.”
About her prospects of recovery, Prof Hildebrandt said there should be a significant improvement within the next three weeks, if the recommended treatment protocol was followed.
Rebuilding of the muscle structure and full recovery, he pointed out, might take about six months.  
“Elephants are intelligent animals and they know when they die and then they give up. Studies have shown that an elephant might not be so severely sick but it can die from depression and sadness. Today, there was a spark in Noor Jehan’s lifeless eyes. We must not let her lose that.”
Having done their job successfully, some members of the Four Paws’ team are flying back home tomorrow (Friday) while the rest will stay for another day.
Meanwhile, the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) has relieved Khalid Hashmi from his post of senior director, zoo, safari and recreation.
“The services of Mr Khalid Hashmi, BS-19 officer, presently working as Senior Director, Zoo, Safari and Recreation, KMC, is no longer required in Karachi Metropolitan Corporation. Hence, he is relieved from his post and directed to report to the Local Government and HTP Department, Government of Sindh,” says a notification signed by municipal commissioner Syed Shujaat Hussain.

6,PPP to revolutionise healthcare system in  country if given public mandate: Bilawal,KARACHI: Pakistan Peoples Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Thursday pledged that his party would...,"KARACHI: Pakistan Peoples Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Thursday pledged that his party would revolutionise public healthcare system to provide ‘world-class free medical treatment in a dignified manner’ to people across Pakistan if given a public mandate in the upcoming general elections.
In a statement on World Health Day, he said that bringing health facilities to the doorsteps of the people is the manifesto of his party, and the Sindh government has developed world-class health institutions as a bright example for other governments. He said public health had always been one of the top priorities of his party.
“After creation of Pakistan, most hospitals and health centres were established in the country for the first time during the tenure of Quaid-i-Awam Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto,” the statement quoted him as saying. 
“The initiative of Lady Health Volunteers, taken by Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, was a revolutionary development and the backbone of our public healthcare system in the country. The initiative of anti-polio campaign to save the nation’s children from becoming crippled is also an unforgettable gift of Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto to our present and future generations.”
The PPP chairman said that the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD) and its satellite network, Sindh Institute of Urology and Transplantation (SIUT), Pir Abdul Qadir Shah Jilani Institute of Medical Sciences, Gambat, and the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) and its CyberKnife technology unit for cancer treatment are the gifts of the PPP government to the people of the entire country, besides Sindh.
Since 2008, the PPP government, he said, has built more than 500 small and large healthcare centres and hospitals across Sindh. The foundation stone of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (ZABICVD), the world’s largest free cardiology hospital with 1,200 beds, is also a ‘reflection of our commitment’.
“If people gave the mandate to the PPP in the upcoming general elections, the party will spread the network of institutions like NICVD, SIUT and Gambat Institute across the country, so that people should have access to world-class free medical treatment in a dignified manner,” he added.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari also paid tribute to the doctors, nurses, lady health workers and other health professionals who worked day and night to save the lives of their countrymen during the coronavirus outbreak. The medical staff who sacrificed their own lives while treating the patients during the pandemic deserved a special mention in our prayers, he added.

7,GDA asks govt to call general elections,"KARACHI: Welcoming the Supreme Court decision for holding elections in Punjab on May 14, the Grand Democratic...","KARACHI: Welcoming the Supreme Court decision for holding elections in Punjab on May 14, the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) has suggested the government to call general election simultaneously as it is the only way forward to bring the country out of multiple crises.
Speaking at a press conference at the Functional House the other day, GDA general secretary Dr Safdar Abbasi also warned the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) that any move against the judiciary would lead to further instability, constitutional crisis and uncertainty in every segment of the society.
“It’s so unfortunate that the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) have never learnt from history,” he said, adding: “They have a history of attacking judiciary and harassing judges, and today we are witnessing this again. It’s not any judge or leader which calls for elections within 90 days, but the Constitution of Pakistan which requires voting within 90 days and its violation is a crime.”
He continued: “If you don’t want elections only in two provincial assemblies, go for general elections, dissolve the National Assembly and assemblies of other two provinces.”
He accused the PPP of ‘hypocrisy’ as the coalition partner in the Centre vowed to side with the democracy and law, but being the ruling party in Sindh, it violates every law to maintain its writ through force and power. He referred to the local government elections in rural Sindh as “most rigged” where the ruling PPP harassed its opponents and used government machinery to register a ‘fake win’.
Flanked by Syed Zain Shah and Hasnain Mirza, the GDA leader alleged: “The PPP government and its corrupt ministers have misappropriated some Rs25 billion dedicated for the flood victims. And even after more than six months of the floods, the survivors are still waiting for any financial assistance or rehabilitation programme.”
To a question about any dialogue of a formal alliance with the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), Mr Abbasi said that the two sides had not made any formal contact saying that the democratic politics always kept channels of talks open with everyone.
“The past experiments of political alliances failed badly,” he said. “The people of Sindh are becoming sick of PPP and undue support it’s getting from the establishment for the past more than 15 years. The political landscape of Sindh would change sooner or later.”

9,"Two ‘missing’ PTI social media activists  returned home, SHC told",Petitioner states whereabouts of third activist Fahad Jamal still not known,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court was informed on Thursday that two missing social media activists of the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf had returned safely to their homes.
Last week, three petitions were filed in the SHC seeking whereabouts of Mohammad Arshad Siddiqui, head of the PTI’s social media team Karachi, and two social media activists — Fahad Jamal Siddiqui and Mudassir Rehman — and the court had issued notices to respondents for Thursday.
When a two-judge bench headed by Justice Naimatullah Phulpoto took up the petitions for hearing on Thursday, the counsel for the petitioners informed the court that Mr Siddiqui and Mr Rehman had reached their homes.
The bench ruled that both the petitions seeking their recovery had become infructuous and disposed of accordingly.

Petitioner states whereabouts of third activist Fahad Jamal still not known

About the third petition seeking recovery of Fahad, the Aziz Bhatti SHO appeared before the bench and undertook that as soon as the petitioner appeared before him at the police station he would record her statement and lodge an FIR if a cognizable offence was made out.
He said he would investigate the case in accordance with law.
The petitioner submitted that Fahad was picked up from his house located within the remit of the Aziz Bhatti police station on the night between March 27 and March 28.
The same bench had also issued notices to the respondents a few days ago on yet another identical petition seeking whereabouts of the fourth member of PTI’s social media team.
On March 31, Mohammad Salman Khan had gone to the Karachi Press Club to attend a protest of the PTI. He went missing after attending the demonstration.

They were speaking at a seminar on “Basic human rights and our responsibilities” held at Indus School under the aegis of Knowledge Centre here on Thursday. 
Iqbal Detho, chairman of Sindh Human Rights Commission, said that the constitution guaranteed equal rights for all sections of population without any discrimination based on creed, colour or caste. 
“We have to formulate new policies or change the existing ones to ensure provision of rights to life, liberty, dignity, health, expression, water, food, pure air and shelter, which are fundamental rights and all people should get equally and easily,” he said.
He said that Islam is a religion of peace and it demanded justice for all. Other religions of the world also urged their believers to adopt the path of peace, he said. 
He said that bullying at schools, streets and at any other place was illegal. The schools’ syllabus should include teaching of human rights so as to sensitise youth to the importance of their rights and empower them, he said.
He said the human rights emanated from religion, political struggles, philosophers and constitutional developments. Education in human rights was key component of the commission which would be incorporated in syllabus and curriculum of schools, colleges and universities, he said.
Ayoub Khoso, prominent TV, film actor and member of the commission, said that social media was a very important tool to make people aware of human rights. If used positively social media helped one have his or her rights respected by all, he said. 
He said that everyone should know about his and others’ basic rights in society. Man and woman were equal before law which did not tolerate violation of rights of any section of the population, he said.
Prof Mukhtiar Ahmed Samo, founder of Knowledge Centre, said that the societies where violation of human rights was in practice did not attain peace and prosperity. It was the need of the hour that all policies formulated for providing human rights were implemented, he said.
Mr Detho along with MPA Ms Farhat Simin and Mr Khoso later visited district prison and correctional facility and conducted a detailed inspection of the state of living conditions of inmates and inquired about issues of their representation in courts.
Representatives of Legal Aid Society and Pakistan Legal United Society also accompanied the SHRC chairman and his team, who identified inmates in need of legal assistance. 
The chairman expressed satisfaction at jail affairs and expressed surprise that 70 per cent of UTPs were indicted under narcotics laws. The commission would thoroughly probe the issue to learn why majority of the people were being charged with keeping illicit drugs, he said.

They said that cooperation would have to be extended to the youth in value chain and entrepreneurship for the prosperity of Sindh and Pakistan and for changing the life style of people.
They were speaking at a seminar on the ‘Business Opportunities and Role of Youth” organised at the Sindh Agriculture University (SAU) Tandojam on Thursday. 
Speaking on the occasion, SAU Vice Chancellor Dr Fateh Mari said the youth should be encouraged for business activities as per their educational background in the larger interest of Pakistan’s economy and prosperity. 
He said institutions should come forward and put an end to the sense of self deprivation prevailing among the young people and an advantage should be taken of their abilities. 
The VC said they should be trained for their business ideas, considering market demands, and universities could play the role of a bridge in that regard.
Prof Bhawani Shankar Chaudhry said business opportunities were available across the world for the youth in the light of their competence and abilities. The youth should only be encouraged in that regard, he added. 
He stated that the Higher Education Commission (HEC) and universities needed to cooperate with the youth for choosing their career. Thousands of students were being provided scholarships and training so that they could change their own life, he added.
Dr Prem Sagar said that many international celebrities had achieved success in life through businesses and got some position. He said that it was also incumbent upon the SAU students to develop products depending on market demand and then sale them. It would benefit them financially and somehow lead to food security, he observed.
Dr Shankar presented a gift of his books to the SAU vice chancellor. Present on the occasion were Dr Ismail Kumbhar, Dr Aijaz Ali Khuharo Dr Ghayasuddin Shah Rashdi and Dr Altaf Siyal.

The protesters placed dead body of deceased Chanesar Khosa aka Dado Khosa outside the press club to record protest before attacking the police station. 
The jail administration claimed that the under trial prisoner Chanesar Khosa was rushed to Mirpurkhas Civil Hospital after his condition suddenly deteriorated. He died during treatment, said the jail officials.
