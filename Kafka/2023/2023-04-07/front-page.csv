• JUI-F rules out talks with Imran
• PTI describes ‘dangerous’ move as an attempt to influence court
ISLAMABAD: Through an unprecedented resolution, the National Assembly on Thursday not only “rejected” the April 4 verdict of the Supreme Court’s three-judge bench to hold elections in Punjab on May 14, but also “made it binding on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and federal cabinet not to implement it”, as allies in the ruling coalition assured their full support to Mr Sharif in the ongoing standoff with judiciary.
Through the resolution, read out by Khalid Magsi of the Balochistan Awami Party and passed by the assembly with a majority vote, the lawmakers termed the verdict “unlawful and unconstitutional” and expressed “serious concerns over the court’s unwarranted interference in the political matters”, asking the judiciary to refrain from it.
PM Shehbaz, who briefly attended the proceedings, left the house shortly after the passage of the resolution, which was opposed by two members of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) — Mohsin Leghari and Mahmood Baqi Moulvi.
Resolution
“This House rejects the minority decision of the three-member bench and binds the prime minister and the cabinet not to implement the unconstitutional and unlawful decision,” says the resolution which was the second such resolution passed by the NA against the judiciary in the last nine days.
Referring to the March 28 resolution, it said the house had supported the majority decision of the four SC judges in the suo motu case and the court had been urged to implement it and avoid undue interference in political and administrative affairs.
“Most of the circles also demanded the formation of a full court, but it was not approved and the viewpoint of other political parties, except one, was not heard,” says the resolution.
The resolution supported the decision of the three-member SC bench under Justice Qazi Faez Isa which called for not setting the cases filed under Article 184(3) for hearing till the decisions on the full court meeting.
The lawmakers said they “viewed with deep concern the move to stop its implementation through the executive circular” and by “hastily fixing the same judicial decision for hearing before another controversial bench and giving a quick decision on it in a few minutes,” terming this step “unacceptable”.
“This House expresses serious concern over the misinterpretation of Article 63-A of the Constitution as well as its rewriting by the judgement of the SC and demands review on it by the full court,” says the resolution.
PTI’s viewpoint
Taking the floor, Mr Leghari of PTI said treasury members were committing “collective contempt”, adding that treading the “dangerous path will not have good consequences”.
The MNA from Rajanpur protested against Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf for giving him the floor after the passage of the resolution, terming the act a violation of rules and traditions which allowed opponents of a resolution to express their viewpoint before putting it for a vote.
Mr Leghari alleged that the government was trying to pressurise the judiciary and constantly interfering in judicial matters.
“Do you want a war between judiciary and parliament?” he asked. Quoting from the Constitution and the assembly rules, he said members could not discuss sub judice matters.
When the speaker responded that they could hold a debate on the court’s decisions, the PTI legislator pointed out that the treasury members had been targeting the judiciary even before the announcement of the verdict.
‘War with judiciary’
Though the speaker had objected to the use of word “war” by Mr Leghari, Communications Minister and Jamiat UIema-i-Islam (JUI-F) member Asad Mehmood in his speech stated that the “judiciary had been on a war with the PML-N since 2014” when the PTI had staged a sit-in at D-Chowk against the then government under Nawaz Sharif.
Stating that the verdict showed that the judges were only interested to see elections in Punjab, the JUI-F leader said: “I want to say this to PML-N. You are the first target of this war. The war has been initiated against you [the PML-N].”
“This is a long war,” he said. Assuring his fullest support to Mr Sharif, he added: “We are not in any case ready to give our powers to the SC. We are not ready to give powers of PM and the Election Commission of Pakistan to the SC.”
No to dialogue
Responding to renewed offer by some PTI leaders for a dialogue, Mr Mehmood declared that his party would never sit on the table with Imran Khan who, he said, was a “criminal”.
“I want to say it categorically that we will not sit with Imran Khan for talks and to finalise a date for the elections. He is a criminal and should be tried under Article 6. This is the stance of my party. The judges had themselves declared that he [Imran] had violated the Constitution and today they [judges] have fallen in love with him,” said Mr Mehmood while referring to the judges’ advice that politicians should sit together.
He said they were getting messages asking them to hold talks with Mr Khan or “face similar verdicts,” stating that they would not talk to the person “who had committed crimes against Pakistan”.
“Such decisions will have to be reversed. The SC has started this dispute. This is a long battle which will continue till the victory of the Constitution and democracy,” he added.
Stating that the whole parliament was ready to face “contempt”, the JUI-F leader alleged that some judges had themselves committed the contempt of court against their own judges and they should be tried for it.
Sabir Qaimkhani of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) asked Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial to constitute a full bench, instead of forming “benches of like-minded judges”. Expressing concern over the alleged misuse of suo motu powers, he informed the house that former chief justices Iftikhar Chaudhry and Saqib Nisar took 79 and 49 suo motu notices, respectively, during their tenures.
Adviser to PM Qamar Zaman Kaira was of the view that chaos and uncertainty prevailing across the country were perpetrated under a well-designed plan and did not occur accidentally. While sharing his experience of witnessing the court’s proceedings, Mr Kaira claimed that the judges did not provide an opportunity to speak to the lawyers representing the government parties who remained present in the court for six days. He was of the view that the court should have first taken the notice of the dissolution of the Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa assemblies as the chief ministers did not have unconditional powers to dissolve the legislature.
Giving examples from history, Mr Kaira said the courts had restored the provincial assembly of Balochistan when it was dissolved by the then chief minister Zafarullah Jamali in 1988 and again in 1993, it had restored the Punjab Assembly which had been dissolved by ex-chief minister Manzoor Wattoo.
Constitutional court
Mr Kaira called for establishing a constitutional court in line with the Charter of Democracy signed between PPP and PML-N in 2006, saying that judges who reached the apex courts after only hearing the civil and criminal cases were unable to make decisions on constitutional matters.
It was the third consecutive day when the speaker allowed the members to deliver lengthy speeches on points of order, under which members can only point out violation of rules and seek the chair’s ruling.

1,Resolution ‘worthless’ sans two-thirds majority: Fawad,Accuses Maryam of ‘laying a trap’ for PM Shehbaz.,"• Accuses Maryam of ‘laying a trap’ for PM Shehbaz
• PTI seeks minutes of April 5 cabinet meeting
• Qaiser says willing to consider amendment to condone delay in polls beyond 90 days
LAHORE: PTI has termed “worthless” the National Ass­embly’s resolution, rejec­ting the Supreme Court’s decision on elections in Punjab, saying that any such move required a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament.
The party has also set in motion a plan to disqualify ministers who signed the declaration to defy the SC verdict in the April 5 cabinet huddle and sought the minutes of that meeting.
Addressing a news conference on Thursday, PTI Senior Vice President Fawad Chaudhry said the National Assembly has 372 members, but only 42 signed the resolution. He said the “ridiculous resolution” was worthless as a two-thirds majority was needed in lower and upper houses to turn down a Supreme Court judgement.
The statement comes on the heels of an offer of sorts, made by former NA speaker Asad Qaiser, where he expre­ssed his party’s willingness to consider a constitutional amendment for adjustments to the election schedule bey­ond the 90-day requirement.
On Thursday, Mr Chau­dhry said federal ministers, who passed a similar proclamation in the federal cabinet, had violated Articles 204, 190 and 2A of the Constitution.
However, he added, most federal cabinet members, including Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Sherry Rehman had retracted their assent to the official statement.
“The PDM wants to tell the nation that it can continue its rule by force even after the ruling of the Supreme Court,” he said, as he cautioned Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif that Maryam Nawaz Sharif was “laying a trap his for disqualification as Asif Ali Zardari had trapped former PM Yousaf Raza Gillani”.
“After the disqualification of Shehbaz Sharif, Maryam Nawaz will reclaim the party,” he commented and suggested PM Sharif be cognisant of the situation.
Referring to the Supreme Court’s decision, the PTI leader said the Constitution mandated elections to Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa assemblies within 90 days and the caretaker governments in Punjab and KP would also cease to exist on April 22 and April 28, respectively.
He also expressed his disagreement over the apex court’s decision to take elections to May 14 — beyond the limit of 90 days.
Mr Chaudhry urged the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to consult the Supreme Court for the appointment of new caretaker governments after 90 days.
“The caretaker ministers would be liable to Article 6 proceedings, if they signed any cheque, or issued administrative order or attended the office after 90 days tenure,” he said.
PTI writes to cabinet secretary
A day after the PTI said it’d seek disqualification of cabinet members revolting against the SC verdict, the party wrote a letter to the Cabinet Division secretary demanding the list of ministers who signed the proclamation to reject the order in the April 5 cabinet meeting.
After getting the minutes, the party will contact the ECP to disqualify the cabinet members, who attended the meeting, under Article 63-A as cabinet members allegedly violated Article 2A of the Constitution which is about the sovereignty of the state.
The letter, written by PTI’s Central Information Secretary Farrukh Habib, stated that the meeting, chaired by PM Shehbaz, rejected the decision of the Supreme Court given by a three-member bench headed by Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandia.
Seeking the minutes of the meeting, the letter cited Article 19-A of the Constitution which grants every citizen a right to access information in matters of public importance.
Asad Qaiser’s offer
Speaking to Adil Shahzeb of DawnNews, Mr Qaiser had emphasised that it was the responsibility of the government to officially make a move for talks and the prime minister must announce that they want to hold talks.
“We want the government to sit together [for talks on elections] and we are also ready for a constitutional amendment, if for one time, the [polls] can be extended beyond 90 days. What more flexibility can we offer?” he said.
“Then we will sit and settle the matters together — this is the need of the hour that political leaders talk things out,” he said, during an interview on Wednesday.
He cautioned the government that its decision to flout Supreme Court’s orders on the Punjab poll date would be unconstitutional and indicative of a government that is only focused on its own interests, further eroding its popularity and paving the way for its “political demise”.
The PTI leader emphasised the importance of adhering to law with regard to the election date. He argued that even a small fluctuation in the poll date must be done in accordance with law to ensure that the election is conducted in a manner that is fair and just, and free from any objections.

2,PTI petitions apex court for KP poll date,Petition says it is the responsibility of the federal and provincial govts to arrange funds for holding elections on a priority basis.,"ISLAMABAD: Enco­ur­a­ged by the top court’s judgement regarding the Punjab Assembly elections, the PTI on Thursday approached the Supreme Court to seek elections in the province within the 90-day period.
On April 4, the Supreme Court allowed the petitioner to approach any forum as deemed appropriate for seeking relief for the conduct of elections in KP since the matter was not adjudicated upon.
The court, however, had fixed May 14 as the date for the Punjab Assembly elections after quashing the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) notification that fixed Oct 8 as the election date.
As a consequence, the fresh joint petition was moved by PTI Secretary General Asad Umar, former KP Assembly speaker Mushtaq Ahmad Ghani, former KP chief minister Mahmood Khan and a number of former cabinet members through their counsel Barrister Syed Ali Zafar and Gohar Khan. The ECP, ministries of interior, law and finance, the KP governor, and the chief secretary were made respondents in the petition.
The petition challenged the poll day announcement by the governor on Oct 8, stating the entire exercise was contrary to the clear mandate of the Constitution and thus amounted to depriving the petitioners and citizens of their fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 17 to participate in elections.
The petition emphasised that the reasons given by the governor and the ECP regarding the unavailability of finances and the non-conducive law and order situation in the country to hold elections was legally flawed and a disingenuous excuse to delay the elections.
It added if such a power was given to the governor or the ECP on the pretext of the law and order situation then that would mean elections could be delayed indefinitely and forever, which was not warranted.
“What is the assurance that the security situation in the country will improve by the arbitrary date of Oct 8 as fixed by the governor,” the petition wondered, fearing that the postponement of the provincial elections by six months would further deteriorate the security situation.
“Under Articles 148 (3) and 220 of the Constitution as well as Section 50 of the Elections Act 2017, it is the responsibility of the federal, provincial governments and all executive authorities…to ensure that elections are held in 90 days regardless of any prevailing law and order situation,” it added.
According to the petition, it was the responsibility of the federal and provincial governments to arrange funds for holding the elections on a priority basis to the exclusion of all other matters.
In fact, the government was also obligated to provide the necessary security for polls, the petition maintained.
“If law and order can be made an excuse for delaying election then such a precedent would become a legal mandate for caretaker governments…to extend their period and tenure by insisting that they are unable to provide the security…, the petition said.
Moreover, the excuse of law and order would mean that the Constitution can always be held in abeyance on this ground every time the elections are due, the petition added.

3,Irsa confirms 37pc water shortage for Kharif,"Decides to continue with a three-tier formula for distributing water shares among the provinces, as currently in practice.","ISLAMABAD: Months after unprecedented floods, Pakistan is set to face about 37 per cent water shortage during the ongoing Kharif cropping season, the water regulator has confirmed.
This could be potentia­lly damaging for key cash crops like cotton, whose output has already slum­ped to multi-decade lows.
As a result, a meeting of the advisory committee of the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) on Thursday decided with a consensus to continue with a three-tier formula for distributing water shares among the provinces, as currently in practice.
The meeting — presided over by Asjad Imtiaz Ali, Irsa’s chairman and federal member — concluded that Punjab and Sindh would face a 27pc water shortage in the early Kharif and 10pc in the late Kharif season.
The water regulator, however, could not bridge differences between the two large provinces over the conveyance losses. As a result, the meeting set up a committee led by Irsa’s member for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa “to determine actual system conveyance losses to resolve the issue”, the regulator said in a statement.
“Whatever the recommendations on actual system losses determination to be devised by the said committee, based on actual discharge measurements, would be applicable to the system losses,” it said.
The meeting was attended by representatives of the four provinces, and members of Irsa and the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda).
Sources said the water availability criteria were finalised based on Wapda’s revised Tarbela 5 operational constraints, as the authority agreed to provide water releases below 1,432 feet conservation level and operate some of its power plants under Tunnel 3.
As a result, it was agreed with a consensus that the irrigation water shortage in the Indus zone would be 37pc in early Kharif and 15pc in late Kharif. The shortage in the Jhelum-Chenab would be 10pc in early Kharif and negligible in late Kharif.
In Pakistan, the cropping season usually lasts from April to September. Rice, sugar cane, cotton, maize and mash are some of the key crops.
The meeting noted total river flows at rim stations at about 95.32 million acre-feet (MAF) and total system losses at 13.96m acre-feet.
Total water availability would thus stand at 70m acre-feet for the entire season, including 14.58m acre-feet in early Kharif and 55.42m acre-feet in late Kharif.
However, after allowing 7.26m acre-feet of mandatory discharges for downstream Kotri for environmental commitments, the total water availability at canal heads for distribution among the provinces would be just 62.74m acre-feet.
Balochistan and KP remain exempt from a cut in their water share because of their infrastructure constraints.
Two major stakeholders — Sindh and Punjab — have stuck to their guns on water conveyance losses — the quantum of available water that remains unaccounted for and lost to theft, leakage, evaporation or absorbed by soil or canals and could not reach farmlands.
Punjab estimated conveyance losses at 7-8pc against Sindh’s estimates of 35pc and 40pc between the Chashma and Kotri barrages.
The sources said Sindh recorded its position for removing the exemption of water cuts from Balochistan and KP and water distribution under Para 2 of the 1991 water apportionment accord.
However, it agreed with other provincial members and the chairman that Irsa could not change distribution practices currently in place.

4,NSC meeting called today to ‘revisit’ militancy threat,"Source claims that the option of ""imposing an emergency"" may also be discussed in the meeting due to current circumstances.","ISLAMABAD: As a deadlock with the opposition and the top court over the issue of elections in May lingers on, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has summoned a meeting of the National Security Committee (NSC) on Friday (today) in an apparent bid to seek the support of the military leadership for a delay in polls on the pretext of security concerns.
Though there was no official word about the meeting of the committee that acts as the “principal decision-making body on national security matters”, sources confirmed to Dawn that the meeting chaired by PM Sharif would take place on Friday.
It will be attended by Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza, heads of the air force and the navy, and federal ministers for defence, finance, and information.
Insiders said that the federal government would once again ask the top brass for a briefing on potential threats from militants in case elections were held in Punjab on May 14 as per the Supreme Court’s order.

Imran says govt attempting to ‘pit armed forces directly’ against judiciary, people

A source said the military authorities had given a detailed briefing to the government that terrorist outfits have regrouped in tribal districts bordering Afghanistan due to which conditions were not conducive for electioneering.
Another source claimed that the option of “imposing an emergency” in the country could also be discussed in the meeting in light of the current circumstances. The emergency can be declared under Article 232 — which pertains to the proclamation of emergency on account of war and internal disturbance — of the Constitution for the maximum period of one year. However, a resolution passed by parliament is necessary to declare the emergency.
It may be noted that the incumbent government had also summoned an NSC meeting in April last year to rebut the ‘foreign conspiracy narrative’ peddled by PTI chief Imran Khan following his ouster from power as a result of the no-trust vote.
‘Pitting military against judiciary’
Meanwhile, Mr Khan criticised the government for summoning the NSC meeting and claimed that the government would “try and use security as [a] pretext for postponement of elections”. “This will pit armed forces directly against not just judiciary but also the nation,” the former premier said, echoing the same apprehensions he had expressed during his address on Wednesday.
“They brought in an unconstitutional bill on SC and an NA resolution against [the] judiciary,” the PTI chief said, adding that the PDM government wanted to run away from elections at any cost.
Separately, PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry hoped that the National Security Committee would also let PM Sharif realise that the state institutions were standing tall to protect the Constitution. “The NSC proclamation tomorrow [Friday] will decide, which institution is standing with whom,” the PTI spokesperson replied to a question.
In response to another question about the army chief’s statement that Pakistan’s issues could be resolved through consensus, Mr Chaudhry said, “We are waiting for how the army chief’s statement will practically be taken forward.”
