1,Reduction in quota mars distribution of free flour in Khyber,"Tehsil chairman says they received 145 bags less than the daily quota of 245 for Landi Kotal on Wednesday, which was further reduced to 64 next day.","KHYBER: The process of the distribution of free flour among deserving family has been badly affected in Khyber owing to a sudden reduction in the quota of the commodity and problems in internet service in parts of the tribal district.
The reduction in quota of free flour has invited the ire of local government representatives. Tehsil chairmen of Landi Kotal, Bara and Jamrud, however, contended that per day quota of the free flour had been reduced since Tuesday when the district administration boosted off a success in distribution of the commodity.
Shah Khalid Shinwari, Landi Kotal tehsil chairman, told Dawn that they received 145 bags less than the daily quota of 245 for Landi Kotal on Wednesday and on Thursday the quota was further reduced to 64 bags only which resulted in deprivation of hundreds of the deserving families of getting free flour.
He said that in Landi Kotal only 20 to 25 per cent of the registered families so far received their share of three bags of flour weighing 10kg each.

Admin claims process has slowed down as it is ahead of target

He alleged that the provincial food department also unlawfully ‘doled out’ 6,500 bags of subsidised flour from the share of Landi Kotal to an influential family of Jamrud for private distribution as charity in Ramazan.
Mr Shinwari also alleged that the food department already reduced the quota of subsidised flour from 3,300 to 2,500 and sometimes 2,000 bags which the authorised local flour dealers resented at various forums but to no avail so far.
The free flour distribution in Jamrud was first marred by differences over the award of distribution rights between tehsil chairman and assistant commissioner.
Sources in Jamrud told Dawn that the tehsil chairman wanted his complete authority over the free flour distribution, having a list of 40 dealers of his choice while the assistant commissioner had his own list of distributors.
The row over award of distribution rights affected the free flour distribution in Jamrud for at least one week. The matter was later resolved through efforts of some intermediaries.
In Bara, sources said that apart from reduction in quota since Wednesday, problems in net connectivity in upper parts of the region and Tirah deprived a sizeable number of deserving families of their share of free flour.
Sources in upper Bara said that the distribution process was hampered by frequent disconnection of internet service that multiplied their miseries as they had come from long distance to get flour.
In Tirah, some people complained that flour distributors sought money from them by saying that they had paid additional amount for transportation of flour bags to remote parts of the valley.
The district administration on Tuesday claimed to have achieved 60 per cent of its target in distributing free flour among the families registered under the Benazir Income Support Programme, numbering 168,000.
A statement issued from Khyber House said that so far 301,950 bags were distributed among 100,955 families at 193 distribution centres.
Mohammad Anas, a spokesperson for the district administration, told Dawn that the flour quota was reduced as they were quite ahead of the target.
He said that Khyber would be provided with its full share of free flour allocated for the month of Ramazan but the process was slowed down due to an organised and speedy distribution of the commodity in most parts of the district.
He dispelled the impression that the process was either marred by favouritism or shortage of flour. “Khyber achieved the distinction of going ahead of its target due to a planned mechanism and thus the quota was reduced not because of shortage of flour but to ease the pressure of distribution,” he added.

WARNED: The Young Teachers Association’s Lower Dir chapter on Thursday warned that the teachers would boycott classes and lock schools if the post of the district education officer (male) was not filled within a week.
The warning was issued during a meeting at the DEO’s office.
Provincial president of the association Attaur Rehman, who in the chair, said important matters of schoolteachers, clerks and Class IV employees had been pending with the DEO’s office for more than two months.
He said the department hadn’t given the additional charge of that office to any of its officers.

Also, the All Government Employees Grand Alliance’s Lower Dir chapter demanded the immediate filling of the vacancy and threatened street protests on the matter.
NON-PAYMENT OF SALARY: The employees of Pakistan Post on Thursday complained that dozens of postmasters in the district had not been paid salary for the last 10 months.

They demanded the intervention of the postmaster general of Pakistan for the immediate release of pending salaries.

5,Expert for alternative system to help cancer patients in Afghanistan,"Dr Aasim says, “A significant proportion of the patients, who access these facilities, are Afghans or Pakistani Pashto-speaking people from KP.""","PESHAWAR: An expert has called for development of alternative support system to help cancer patients in Afghanistan where decades-long conflict has shattered healthcare infrastructure.
Addressing an Iftar dinner on Wednesday night, Dr Mohammed Aasim Yusuf, chief medical officer of Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, said that policymakers needed to develop and support alternative systems and structures to provide post-conflict domestic and cross-border cancer care to patients in Afghanistan.
He said that a total of 113,384 cancer patients were registered with SKMCH&RC for treatment between December 1995 and June 2022. Among those patients, 7,468 (6.6 per cent) were Afghan nationals, he added.
“Afghanistan has been facing long conflict, which has degraded its health infrastructure due to which Afghans seek cancer treatment in Pakistan’s tertiary care cancer institutions,” said Dr Aasim.

Dr Aasim says conflict has shattered healthcare infrastructure in the neighbouring country

He said that a total of 6,370 Afghan patients had undergone cancer care since 1995 including 57 per cent male. Thirty per cent of those patients belonged to Kabul and Nangarhar provinces of Afghanistan and 56pc of them came to the hospital with stage three or four of the disease, he said.
“About 34pc of adult patients have achieved a complete response to treatment, but more than half of all patients have since been lost to follow-up. Children generally have better outcomes, with 43pc showing a complete response to treatment,” he said.
Dr Aasim said that the journey for those cancer patients remained long and difficult and the inability to ensure follow-up in so many remains frustrating for both patients and providers.
 
 

Following the invasion of Afghanistan by the former USSR in 1979, millions of people from Afghanistan crossed the border to seek refuge in Pakistan, which hosted more than 3.3 million people.
He said that SKMCH & RC was set up in Lahore in 1994 and the intake mechanism for cancer patients was based on a diagnosis of the disease without regard to financial status, ethnicity or nationality of a patient.
He said that nearly 30pc of all patients, who were checked by doctors in Lahore belonged Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, bordering Afghanistan. He added that recognising the need for a specialised tertiary care cancer hospital in KP, a second SKMCH&RC was established in Peshawar in 2015.
Dr Aasim said that an estimated 180,000 new cancer patients diagnosed each year in Pakistan. “A significant proportion of the patients, who access these facilities, are Afghans or Pakistani Pashto-speaking people from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” he added.
He said that they could not treat all the cancer patients, who visited SKMCH&RC so the patients were accepted on the basis of diagnosis and stage of the disease.
“The intention is to accept those patients, who are most likely curable. Nonetheless, once patients are accepted for treatment, they are eligible for all treatments available even when their disease progresses, regardless of their ability to pay and irrespective of their nationality or ethnicity,” he added.

TREES: The elders of Swat and Shangla districts have said that trees on privately owned lands are cut with the government’s permission, but some elements have launched propaganda against them on social media.

“The government plants trees on our lands for which we have to wait for 40 years. We also take care and look after these trees and whenever the height of a tree reaches 22 inches, it is our legal right to cut and sell it to earn livelihood,” they said, adding that they could only cut the trees after the approval of patwari and forest officer.
“We have provided land to the forest department and it is our right to get royalty, but now we have learnt that the government is taking away this royalty from us. If the government wants to take the royalty from us then it should also remove the trees from our lands too,” they said.

9,Workers call for increase in minimum wage,SWABI: Leaders of government employees on Thursday demanded an increase in the minimum wage in proportion to...,"SWABI: Leaders of government employees on Thursday demanded an increase in the minimum wage in proportion to inflation rate.
The demand was made during a meeting of All Pakistan United Irrigation Employees Federation (APUIEF), All Teachers Association (ATA) and Local Govt Employees Federation (LGEF) here.
The participants hailed the Punjab government’s move to take the minimum monthly salary of workers in the province from Rs25,000 to Rs32,000 and said the KP government should follow suit.
APUIEF provincial president Abid Husain said the minimum wage hike in line with high inflation would offset the impact of the skyrocketing prices of essential commodities to the relief of workers.
He also complained about the government’s “failure” to implement labour laws and said it had led to exploitation of workers by their employers.
“Though a Rs7,000 increase in the minimum wage won’t be enough amid record inflation,it will be better than no relief,” he said.
ATA district general secretary Ijaz Ali demanded effective enforcement of labour laws and strict punishment for their violators.
Former provincial president of the LGEF Niaz Ali Khan said the labour department should register all workers and protect their rights.
HELD: The police on Wednesday arrested two robbers and seized Rs600,000 stolen cash.

10,Peshawar High Court strikes down transfer of KP’s tax cases to Islamabad,"Accepts pleas of industries, firms against FBR order for change of jurisdiction.","PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court on Thursday declared illegal the order of the Federal Board of Revenue for the transfer of taxation-related matters of around 360 industrial units and companies of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa from the Regional Tax Office in Peshawar to the Large Taxpayer Unit (LTU) in Islamabad.
A bench consisting of Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim and Justice Syed M. Attique Shah accepted 66 identical petitions filed by the Alpha Pipe Industries, Peshawar Electric Supply Company and other industries and commercial entities against the Aug 5, 2020, order by the FBR chief (IR-Formation) for shifting the jurisdiction for petitioners over income tax, sales tax, federal excise and other related matters from Peshawar RTO to Islamabad LTU.
The detailed judgement will be issued later.
Respondents in the petition were the federal government through the revenue secretary, FBR through its chairman, Peshawar RTO through its chief commissioner, and FBR chief (IR-Formation), Islamabad.

Accepts pleas of industries, firms against FBR order for change of jurisdiction

Several lawyers appeared for the petitioners and they included Ishaq Ali Qazi, Qazi Ghulam Dastagir, Ishtiaq Ahmad, Sheeraz Butt, Barrister Amirullah Khan and others.
The counsel said the FBR chief (IR-Formation) had issued the impugned jurisdiction order on Aug 5, 2020, declaring that it will take effect on Aug 10 the same year.
They said the order in question revised the jurisdictions of the chief commissioner and commissioner (Inland Revenue) and assigned the jurisdiction of different industrial units registered in KP to the LTU commissioner.
The lawyers said the jurisdictions related to income tax, sales tax and federal excise of a large number of industries, including that of the petitioners, were transferred to the LTU and after Aug 10, their cases for the purpose of assessment and refunds would be processed there instead of Peshawar RTO.
They said the FBR order didn’t provide reasons for the move.
The lawyers said the order was a discrimination against KP industries as the industries or units of the same nature functioning in other parts of the country were assessed in their respective RTOs.
They said neither the representatives of the Sarhad Chamber of Commerce and Industries nor their clients were given an opportunity of hearing on the matter.
The lawyers argued that the Sales Tax Act clearly gave the right of selecting jurisdiction to taxpayers.
They said many units operated in the sector throughout the country and if matters of only a few units were shifted to the LTU, it would be a broad discrimination.
The counsel said the government and tax collection authority were meant to facilitate taxpayers instead of creating obstacles in the smooth running of their business activities.
They contended that the FBR order didn’t explain for what purpose and on what basis their clients’ jurisdiction was changed from Peshawar RTO to Islamabad LTU.
The lawyers said if the placement of industry was necessary in the LTU, then the FBR should establish that unit in Peshawar for the industries of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa instead of transferring the matters of their clients to another LTU far away from their native business places.
Sheeraz Butt said he had filed a petition on behalf of Pesco.
He said while Pesco was a distribution company of KP, its tax matters had also been transferred to LTU, which was an injustice to it.
In Sept 2020, a bench headed by the then PHC chief justice, Waqar Ahmad Seth, had also accepted some of those petitions and pronounced a short order.
However, the detailed judgement wasn’t released as the chief justice first went down with coronavirus and then died in Nov 2020.
The bench was then tasked with hearing the petitions afresh.

They said according to the rules, the candidates who got 40 per cent marks were eligible for the posts.
“We had prepared ourselves for the test and spent our precious time and money but we were ignored despite obtaining the required marks,” they complained. They claimed that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police Rules No. 1934 had been amended and passed by the law department, under which even those who scored less than 40 per cent marks were also eligible for recruitment in public sector departments.
They said in the light of the amendment in the police rules all the eligible candidates should be called for interview as early as possible.

13,"KP police deny bullets pierced bulletproof vests, helmets of Kohat policemen in attack","Lab director says personnel were martyred as ""bullets hit those parts of their bodies, which were not covered by bulletproof jackets and helmets"".","PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) police on Thursday denied media reports, which claimed that two policemen were martyred in a Kohat attack on April 3 after the bullets fired by militants pierced through bulletproof vests and helmets worn by the personnel.
“Our [police] personnel embraced martyrdom after the bullets hit those parts of their bodies, which were not covered by bulletproof jackets and helmets. The attackers fired 48 bullets and only two of them hit helmets and jackets,” Forensic Science Laboratory director Waqar Ahmad told reporters here.
He said that the bullets left small marks on suicide vests but didn’t enter them, suggesting those jackets were not penetrable by bullets.
Police personnel Ayaz and Qasim lost their lives in the April 3 militant attack on the Bannu Road in Mirozai area of Kohat.
The policemen were on their way to the Abu Bakar and Hamza mosques to perform security duty for taraveeh prayers.
Soon after the attack, head of the Mohammad Riaz Shaheed police station Islamuddin claimed that the bullets fired by militants had pierced through bulletproof jackets and helmets of the martyred police personnel.
The lab director said that the bullets fired by militants didn’t go through suicide vests and helmets and were instead blocked.
He added that the militants used 30-calibre and 9mm pistols and sub-machine guns in the Kohat attack against police personnel.
Deputy Inspector General (International Accountability) of the provincial police Mohammad Suleman, who was also in attendance, said that the bulletproof jackets and helmets worn by policemen were manufactured 8-10 years ago but they’re still “effective.”
“A committee was formed to check the effectiveness of bulletproof jackets and helmets seized at the site of the militant attack. It found no bullet hole in them,” he said.
The DIG said that the police department was purchasing new equipment, including bulletproof helmets and jackets, which would be effective for three years.
He also said that all suicide jackets and helmets were properly tested before being distributed to the police personnel.
On Tuesday, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police chief Akhtar Hayat Khan Gandapur formed a two-member committee to probe the militant attack.
A notification issued by the Central Police Office here said that a fact-finding committee comprising DSP (logistics) at the CPO Sanaullah and sub-inspector Safdar Khan would look into the attack and submit its report within a week.
It added that the committee would visit the place of crime, ascertain the kind of weapons used to kill police personnel, and examine the helmets and jackets issued to the deceased.
According to it, the panel will check what “security gadgets” the two police personnel received from the department for permanent and temporary use.
