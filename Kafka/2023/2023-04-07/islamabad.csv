0,"Lawmakers come down hard on CDA, term it hub of corruption",Demand to outsource maintenance of parliament lodges referred to NA body.,"ISLAMABAD: Parliamentarians on Thursday came down hard on Capital Development Authority (CDA), terming it a white elephant and hub of corruption, which has failed to provide relief to the citizens and lawmakers alike. 
During the question hour in the National Assembly, lawmakers criticised the CDA for its failure in completion of construction work in the parliament lodges in the stipulated time and poor cleanliness arrangements. One MNA said the civic agency also failed to develop sector E-12, which was launched over three decades ago and where plots were purchased by people. 
“Can I ask if the grandson in his life will be able to get the plot in E-12 which was procured by his grandfather three decades ago,” asked MNA Mahreen Razzaq Bhutto. 
At the outset, MNA Shagufta Jumani raised the issue of poor maintenance of government buildings in Islamabad. To this, a number of other lawmakers raised their voice against the CDA. 

Demand to outsource maintenance of parliament lodges referred to NA body

Taking part in the debate, MNA Sheikh Rohale Asghar said that instead of discussing other issues related to the CDA, the house first should look into the affairs of parliament lodges, where lawmakers are residing. He said that the CDA had failed to ensure proper cleanliness arrangements in the lodges. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Murtaza Javed Abbasi, who was responding the questions on behalf of the interior minister, acknowledged that there were several issues in the lodges. He said a new block, which was supposed to be completed in 2014 by CDA, could not be completed till date. Mr Abbasi said there is a need to outsource maintenance and operations of the lodges for better results. 
He said the CDA is a white elephant and a mafia. Meanwhile, Education Minister Rana Tanveer Hussain said that the lodges were in a poor condition and government officials concerned did not bother to receive calls from lawmakers.MNA Tahira Aurangzeb took up the issue of two dysfunctional water filtration plants in sector G-8 and I-18. She was assured by Mr Abbasi said that both the plants would be made functional by Friday. Similarly, Shagufta Jumani said that there is also an issue of water shortage in the lodges. 
Opposition leaders Raja Riaz and Mohammad Abubakar also raised their voice against the CDA. While MNA Aliya Kamran said there is also a need to look into the issue of air conditioners in the lodges, as apparently, old carpets had been purchased for it. 
Speaker Raja Pervez Ashraf referred the issue related to outsourcing the operation of the lodges to a sub-committee of the finance committee. He sent the issue of incomplete building of the lodges to the Privilege Committee of the house. It may be mentioned here that there is a group of CDA officers and officials who have been serving in the lodges and the PM Office for years. An official of the CDA said posting record of CDA officials should be kept in view as why a group of officers always wanted to be posted in the lodges.“This issue warrants a proper inquiry. I personally know several officers enjoying their posting at the lodges for long. They get themselves posted out for a break and then manage to get posted in the lodges again,” said the official.

2,Islamabad notifies rules for Hindu Marriage Act,"Relevant UCs in Islamabad will register a ""Maharaj"" or ""Pundit"" to solemnise marriages, say one of the rules.","ISLAMABAD: In a key development, the Islamabad administration has notified the rules for Hindu Marriage Act 2017 more than five years after its passage, allowing the members of the minority community to solemnise their marriage in line with established rituals.
The notification titled ‘Islamabad Capital Territory Hindu Marriage Rules 2023’ will pave way for the implementation of the marriage act passed in 2017 in Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan as well.
An official of the ICT administration informed Dawn that the notification has been forwarded to all union councils of the federal territory for implementation.
As per the rules, relevant UCs in Islamabad will register a ‘Maharaj’ to solemnise marriages: the requirement for being a ‘Pundit’ or ‘Maharaj’ is that the person has to be a Hindu male with adequate knowledge of Hinduism.
However, ‘Maharaj’ will be appointed after the submission of a character certificate from the local police as well as with the written approval of at least 10 members of the Hindu community.
Similar to the case of the “registered nikah-khawan” for Muslims, respective UCs will issue “Shaadi Pert” (marriage certificate) to ‘Maharaj’ who would be registered with the relevant UC. All marriages would be registered at union councils as well.
According to the rules, a ‘Maharaj’ appointed under the marriage act would not take any money for officiating the marriage except for the fees mandated by the government. In case of the demise of a ‘Maharaj’ or cancellation of his licence, the marriage record kept by him would be submitted to the relevant UCs, which would be subsequently handed over to his successor.
Section 7 of the rules deals with cases related to the termination of marriages and remarriages. These rules also allow Hindus living in Islamabad to approach courts under the West Pakistan Family Courts Act 1964 in case of marriage disputes.
‘Major step’
Mehfooz Piracha, district attorney for ICT who drafted the rules, told Dawn that the notification “is a major step” towards ensuring the rights of the minority community. He added that now Punjab, Balochistan, and KP can also adopt these rules.
“Politically and technically, it is easy for provinces to adopt the laws enacted in Islamabad rather than formulating new legislation for each jurisdiction,” Mr Piracha claimed.
The “key effort” for the approval of Hindu marriage rules has been made by a group called ‘National Lobbying Delegation for Minority Rights’ (NLD).
Jai Parkash, an NLD member, said that a large number of Hindus were permanently settled in Islamabad, and it was “essential” that the ICT administration implement this law retrospectively to benefit the local community.
It may be mentioned here that the Hindu community in Islamabad has grown significantly over the past decade due to migrations from Sindh, Balochistan, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa owing to security concerns.

3,Prime minister lays foundation stone for lawyers’ complex,"Facility will accommodate 3,500 lawyers.","ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Mohammad Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday laid the foundation stone for the Lawyers’ Complex in the capital, that would accommodate 3,500 lawyers.
PM Sharif laid the foundation stone of the complex. The ceremony was organised by the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA).
The lawyers’ complex was an old demand of the lawyer community. Since its establishment in 1960, there is no proper building for the district judiciary while lawyers had constructed their chambers mostly on encroached land.
Former chief justice of Islamabad High Court (IHC) Athar Minallah, during the hearing of a petition, had issued directions to the federal government for construction of the complex.

Facility will accommodate 3,500 lawyers

Speaking on the occasion, PM Sharif once again demanded review of Supreme Court’s decision on Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly elections by the full court.
He said that the Supreme Court should review its decision in a full court.
He said that the decision of the full court will be accepted by all, adding that personal interests must be put aside to protect the future of Pakistan and its future generations.
Minister for Law and Justice, Azam Nazir Tarar, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah and office bearers of Pakistan Bar Council, Islamabad Bar Council, and Islamabad High Court Bar Association participated in the ceremony.
The PM said that lawyers have experienced extreme difficulties to establish rule of law and have made sacrifices for restoration of the judiciary.
He said that the SC has re-written Article 63-A which deals with disqualification of lawmakers adding that the government’s appeal against the said order was still pending adjudication.
PM Sharif demanded a full court for hearing of provincial assembly elections which might comprise all judges of the apex court.
The PM laid the foundation stone of the lawyers’ complex. He said construction of the complex will cost Rs1.8 billion, adding that a sports complex will also be constructed. 
Speaking on the occasion, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah Khan said that polls in Punjab and KP assemblies during the next month would deepen the crisis.
He said that whoever would win in Punjab will be able to manipulate general elections.
He told the legal fraternity that the prime minister ordered Capital Development Authority (CDA) to arrange funds for the lawyers’ complex.
He said that the first phase of the project would be completed by CDA from its own resources.
According to him, the project will be completed in 12 months. Under this project, chambers will be provided to more than 3,500 lawyers. In the first phase, there will be 852 chambers, a consultation hall, library and other facilities.
Mr Tarar, in his speech, pointed out division within the Supreme Court, adding that this is the reason the government wants hearing of the elections case by a full court.
He termed construction of the lawyers’ complex “historic” adding that PM Sharif allocated an amount of Rs500 million for bar councils in the 2022 budget.

Earlier, briefing the prime minister, IT Board Director General, Dr Khalid Rafiq said the user-friendly portal would enable the public to directly access the prime minister.
He informed the premier that the complaint portal and online applications had been developed by the IT Board itself, without putting any burden on the state exchequer, to enable people of all areas to register their grievances from home.
The complaints could also be filed to departments concerned through the portals, Mr Rafiq said.

8,80pc disagree with ECP’s decision to postpone Punjab polls: Pattan survey,Findings show 95pc PTI respondents and 33pc PDM supporters against poll delay,"ISLAMABAD: Nearly 80 per cent of respondents in an opinion poll, conducted by Pattan, disagreed with the order of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to postpone the election for the Punjab Assembly to October 8. 
However, there appeared a huge disagreement based on political affiliation. For instance, 95pc of pro-PTI respondents and only 23pc of PDM supporters disagreed with the ECP decision. 
Moreover, the survey respondents were asked to share their views regarding who in their view was primarily responsible for causing the ongoing crisis. About 80pc of the respondents believed the PDM (45pc), establishment (21pc), and both (4pc) were basically responsible for creating the crisis. 
As many as 80pc of the respondents opined that free distribution of wheat flour was not going to provide any political benefit to the incumbent government in the next general election. 

Findings show 95pc PTI respondents and 33pc PDM supporters against poll delay

“Interestingly, 52pc of the respondents who said they would vote for PDM in the next general election also believed that free distribution of wheat flour was not going to provide any benefit to the PDM parties while 88pc of pro-PTI respondents carried this view. The respondents were also requested to enlist problems they have been facing currently. One-fourth of them mentioned poor governance and corrupt elite, while 45pc said unemployment, high inflation and insecurity,” according to the findings. 
Since the country has been facing political and economic crises simultaneously, it was considered important to seek public perception on the relationship between politics and economics or political economy of the crisis. About two-third of the respondents thought both were two sides of the same coin. 
“It appears 70pc of the respondents were likely to vote for PTI if elections are held today, while 25pc to PDM and Pakistan People’s Party. The findings appear to corroborate trends of some other opinion polls held in recent weeks,” it stated. 
Pattan in collaboration with Coalition38 conducted the survey from March 29 to April 5. The questionnaire was sent to 5,120 voters who were randomly registered as respondents. In total, 1,974 recipients of the questionnaire sent back the survey questionnaire. The incomplete survey forms were excluded from the analysis.It is worth mentioning that civil society had earlier rejected order of the Election Commission to postpone the general election to the Punjab Assembly.It is worth mentioning here that civil society organisations had earlier rejected the ECP to postpone the election in Punjab.They had claimed that the decision would add to the existing polarisation and deepen the multi-faceted turmoil to a dangerous level. 
“We the civil society activists strongly condemn the decision of the ECP as it has not only violated the order of the Supreme Court but also section 58 of the Elections Act 2017 which clearly states that ECP must ‘inform the President about any alteration in the election programme,” Pattan and other organisations had claimed.

He was responding on behalf of the minister for interior to a calling attention notice moved by Nuzhat Pathan, Asiya Azeem and Wajiha Qamar regarding problems being faced by passengers of the metro bus service due to the non-functional escalators and other faults. 
He said that all equipment needed in installation of escalators had been made available through import. 
“The escalators will be functional within a few days,” he added.

He said the Metro Bus Service administration had been asked to speed up the work so people would get the benefit from this facility. 
In a supplementary question, Nuzhat Pathan pointed out that the passengers had to purchase separate tickets if they travel from Rawalpindi to Islamabad and back.
