0,ECP postpones local govt by-polls in 26 districts of Sindh,Decision taken on request of contesting parties; polling to be now held on May 7.,"KARACHI: The Election Commission of Pakistan on Monday postponed the by-elections scheduled to be held on April 18 in over 90 union committees/councils in 26 districts of Sindh, including 11 in Karachi division, due to Ramazan.
The polling will now be held on May 7.
The ECP stated that the decision to postpone the polls was taken on the requests of contesting parties.
According to a notification, “By taking into consideration the requests made by various political parties regarding extension of poll date due to last Ashra of Holy Month of Ramazan and in exercise of powers under Article 219(3) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan read with Sections-58 and 229 of the Elections Act, 2017 and all other powers enabling it in that behalf, the Election Commission of Pakistan is pleased to postpone the Local Government Bye-Elections of first and second phases in 26 districts of Sindh Province to the extent of poll date. The poll shall now be held on 7th May, 2023 (Sunday) instead of 18th April, 2023.”
Earlier on March 17, the ECP had issued the schedule of by-elections on as many as 93 UCs in 26 districts, including 11 in Karachi division.
However, the Pakistan Peoples Party-led Sindh government had demanded the ECP hold mayoral elections before holding by-election on remaining UCs where elections could not be held due to the death of candidates.
The Sindh government had sent a letter to the ECP last month pointing out that its decision to hold by-elections on the vacant LG seats appeared to be not in consonance with the Constitution as it impeded the elections of the heads of the local government institutions.
It was the demand of the provincial government that the ECP proceed with the elections to seats reserved for women, minorities, peasants, youths and transgenders and thereafter, hold elections of the mayors, deputy mayors, chairmen and vice chairmen at the earliest.

1,"Amid PTI boycott, PA demands national, provincial elections at same time",PPP resolution says only parliament can amend Constitution and judges can’t insert words into it,"KARACHI: Amid a boycott by lawmakers belonging to the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, the Sindh Assembly adopted a resolution on Monday demanding that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) hold polls for the national and all provincial assemblies in the country at the same time.
Carrying placards inscribed with slogans in favour of Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial and his portraits, the PTI members rose and gathered in front of the speaker’s rostrum and chanted slogans declaring it an act against judiciary.
However, Pakistan Peoples Party’s Ghanwar Ali Khan Isran moved the resolution that was also supported by the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), which still sits on the opposition benches.
The resolution reads: “The Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan is the supreme document and it is the duty of every institution to uphold the Constitution.”

PPP resolution says only parliament can amend Constitution and judges can’t insert words into it

It was said in the resolution that recently a controversy had arisen due to a decision regarding the holding of elections in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. “Four Hon’ble Judges have dismissed the suo motu while three Hon’ble Judges have issued directions to the Election Commission of Pakistan (for holding polls). It is a settled principle of law that decisions taken by minority cannot prevail over the view of majority. It is in the interest of the sanctity that is to the judiciary in our Constitution that the view of the majority should prevail,” it added.
The resolution read that it was only the parliament which could amend the Constitution and the judges through interpretation could not insert words into it or rewrite the same. 
“That the spirit of the 18th Constitutional amendment for the purposes of free and fair elections was to empower the Election Commission of Pakistan and have caretaker governments at the time of general elections. Therefore, to ensure free and fair elections, it is imperative that elections for the national and provincial assemblies take place at the same time,” the resolution read.
Speaking on the resolution, MQM-P lawmaker Khawaja Izharul Hasan said that the resolution was not against the judges, but it was for the impartiality of the Supreme Court.
He said the elections for the national and all provincial assemblies in the country should be held on the same day.
The MQM-P MPA said that the controversy arose from the observations and the decision of three judges.
He asked as to where was the PTI when Bani Gala residence of former prime minister Imran Khan was regularised, but Nasla Tower was ordered to be demolished.
Information Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said that the country had to be run under the Constitution. “Whoever follows the Constitution will be respected,” he added.
He said that the judiciary must not take such decision that would shake the foundations of the country. “Should we remain silent if such decisions are taken?” he raised a question.
Golden Jubilee of 1973 Constitution
Earlier, Health Minister Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho moved a resolution to pay tribute to the authors of 1973 Constitution on its golden jubilee on Monday.
The resolution said the Constitution of Pakistan was passed by the National Assembly on April 10, 1973, and has since served as the supreme law of the land for the past 50 years.
It paid rich tributes to the founding members of Pakistan and those National Assembly members who passed the constitution 1973.
“This house demands the government of Pakistan to take all necessary steps to promote public awareness and understanding of the Constitution of Pakistan, and to ensure its effective implementation across the country,” it read.
The resolution also called upon all political parties, civil society and other stakeholders to join hands in upholding and defending the Constitution Pakistan, and to work together towards a stronger, more prosperous and democratic country.
Discussing the resolution on the floor, the PPP lawmakers and provincial ministers vehemently criticised the three-member Supreme Court bench led by the chief justice. They accused the bench of working as a facilitator to former prime minister Imran Khan.
Labour Minister Saeed Ghani said that according to Article 68, conduct of judges could be discussed in the assembly, but it was only applicable when the judges followed their code of conduct.
“Now the judges are breaching their code of conduct, though they took oath to follow it,” he added.
The provincial minister said that CJP Bandial heard many cases and disqualified some leaders for lifetime, but when he heard Imran Khan’s disqualification, he termed it a ‘black law’.
“The judges should not violate the law after falling in love with one political party. If they want to fall in love with the political party, they should contest elections on the party’s ticket,” he added.
Opposition leader Haleem Adil Sheikh said the ECP was bound to hold elections within 90 days as per the Constitution. 
He said that the caretaker set-up could not prevail more than three months. 
Later, Speaker Agha Siraj Durrani prorogued the house.

Without providing any details regarding the incident, Sohrab Goth SHO Wilayat Shah said that Sabir died in the incident. The body and the wounded man were shifted to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital.
Earlier in the day, a factory worker was shot dead by armed robbers over resistance in Shah Latif Town.

Man’s killing in Shah Latif Town sparks protest as residents block National Highway for vehicular traffic

The police said 45-year-old Shahid Lakhair was shot at and wounded when he offered resistance near Jogi Mor in Shah Latif Town. He was shifted to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre where he died during treatment in the evening.
He was the resident of a housing society off the National Highway.
The incident enraged his relatives and local residents who blocked the main National Highway, carrying the body of the victim in protest against the alleged failure of police to control crime. 
The protest led to a prolonged traffic jam on the main artery, according to the police and witnesses.
After blocking the road, the protesters chanted slogans against the police and deman­ded arrest of the killers. They said Shahid had left home to go to the factory when armed pillion riders tried to rob him. As he put up resistance, the robbers shot and killed him. The heirs complained that the police were not cooperating with them for the arrest of the killers.
A traffic police spokesperson said that as the highway was blocked, traffic was diverted onto alternate routes/roads from Manzil Pump and Mehran Link.
The protesters dispersed peacefully when police assured them that the killers would be arrested soon.
In Baldia Town, a man was shot at and wounded by armed muggers when he put up resistance.
The Madina Colony police said that the wounded man, identified as Jamil Rehman, 40, was shifted to the Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi for treatment.

4,Minister accuses Sindh police of failing to stop kidnapping of girls,Says law enforcers do not bother to pursue such cases.,"

Minister Shehla Raza speaks at the press conference on Monday.—PPI

 
KARACHI: In a strong reaction to ‘incompetence’ of police authorities, Minister for Women Development Syeda Shehla Raza said on Monday Sindh police had failed to check organised gangs from upcountry who “kidnap” young girls or “take them away” on different pretexts and then blackmail their families for money for their safe return.
Addressing a press conference along with families of two such girls, aged 12 and 13, who had been missing for the past couple of months, the minister said that after making efforts for the girls’ recovery, their families were now receiving video and text messages from suspects in Punjab demanding money for their safety and return.
She regretted that the Sindh police were always found to be least bothered to pursue investigations into such cases and the law-enforcement agencies in Punjab never cooperated with the families of these victims.
“There are organised gangs which are targeting young girls in Sindh towns and cities,” she said. “It’s a racket run by large number of different gangs. They target the girls through different mediums of social media where young boys engage the girls to win their trust. In some cases, these gangs, approach the victims’ families with marriage proposals for their male members and then take away girls,” she claimed.

Says law enforcers do not bother to pursue such cases

Referring to the case of a 12-year-old girl, the minister said she developed friendship with a boy through online gaming. The two came closer and she was now missing for the past more than two months after she had left her home, taking away all valuables, cash and property documents with her, she said.
“After having searched her everywhere, the family started receiving calls from the girl in distress, seeking their help and money for returning home. The poor family somehow arranged the amount and made the payment but the girl has not returned yet,” said Ms Raza.
She also cited the case of another 13-year-old girl, who had been missing for the past many months and despite having searched her in different parts of the country her family was still clueless about her. The family was approached over phone with a marriage proposal for the girl but the family refused on grounds that she was too young to get married, she said.
“A day after that, the girl went missing from home. The family contacted caller on the same phone number and was told that the girl was leaving the city on a bus from Sohrab Goth. They mounted a desperate search but in vain. When they contacted again, they were told that the girl was in Rawalpindi and then in Lahore,” she said.
Since then, the family had been running from pillar to post but the girl was not found, the minister said and added: “And now the family had started receiving video messages suggesting torture on the girl and making demands for money for her life and safety.”
The minister wondered how the police in Sindh failed to check such activities going on for the past many years and did not bother to go after the criminals who were freely moving from one area to the other, making phone calls and taking away girls.
She said unlike Sindh where girls were not allowed to get married before turning 18, these gangs were also exploiting laws in the Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces, where marriage of a girl before 18 was allowed.
“I have a meeting scheduled with the Sindh police chief and we are also approaching the Sindh High Court. I hope the police authorities and the other institutions will play their role to stop this menace,” she added.

6,Health experts raise concerns over growing TB cases in country,KARACHI: Experts at a seminar held on Monday expressed concern over the growing number of tuberculosis (TB) cases in...,"KARACHI: Experts at a seminar held on Monday expressed concern over the growing number of tuberculosis (TB) cases in the country, stating that a major barrier in tackling the challenge was a lack of public awareness about the disease and the places to seek care from.
The event was organised by the Stop TB Partnership Pakistan in collaboration with the Centres for Disease Control (CDC), Sindh, and Pfizer Pakistan.
Leading stakeholders, including members of non-profit organisations (NPO), TB survivors and members of academia attended the event.
Dr Sharaf Ali Shah of the Stop TB Pakistan updated the audience on the current situation of TB in Pakistan.
He informed the audience that, according to estimates, 611,000 people fell ill due to TB in Pakistan in 2021, whereas 48,000 HIV-negative and 2,100 HIV-positive people died due to TB in the country. Only 55 per cent of the cases, however, were notified, he added.
Highlighting the reasons for low TB case notification, he said these factors included poor understanding of TB and its symptoms (lack of awareness), poor knowledge about where to seek care, misconceptions about anti-TB drugs, a lack of availability of drugs at public sector health facilities, the cost of transportation that poor patients had to bear, and the loss of their daily wages.
Throwing light on HIV-TB co-infection, Dr Afshan Isani, provincial TB adviser at CDC-Sindh, said that tuberculosis and HIV were both infections that facilitated each other.
“HIV-infected persons are at increased risk of acquiring TB, and the management of TB HIV co-infected cases is more challenging. The number of new HIV cases is increasing every year. In 2022, about 30,000 new HIV cases were registered in the country,” she said.
Dr Salim Kazmi, senior technical adviser at the CDC, said globally, a lot was being done to implement the strategy that aimed to end TB. Some recent developments included reducing the duration of treatment in certain cases to four months and for drug-resistant TB to six months.
Sharing his thoughts, Dr Karam Shah of Stop TB Pakistan said that there was an urgent need to engage policymakers at the district, provincial, and federal levels to promote political commitment so that TB was declared a health priority and adequate funds were allocated.
He highlighted that according to the latest WHO Global Tuberculosis Report 2022, the total available funding for TB in Pakistan in 2021 was $47 million, out of which domestic funding was only eight per cent of total funding and 92pc of total funding came from international donors (mainly through the Global Fund to fight against AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria).
“Besides low allocation of domestic funds, timely release of funds without cuts and proper utilisation of allocated funds are common issues. Total dependence on international funding raises serious concerns about the sustainability of TB control services,” he said.
The event included an interactive discussion comprising four panellists — Prof Iftekhar Ahmed and Dr Saifullah from Dow University of Health Sciences (DUHS); Dr Rumina and Prof Nisar Rao from Aga Khan University (AKU); and Dr Nausheen Ahmed from the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical College (JPMC).
The experts stressed the need to update the medical curriculum regarding TB.
Prof D.S Akram, a senior paediatrician, commented that the diagnosis of TB in children was more complex, requiring better testing tools. Unfortunately, about 12pc of our TB patients were children, he said.
Profs Shahna Urooj and Rafique Khanani stressed the need for the widespread availability of rapid diagnostic tools.
Country manager of Pfizer Pakistan S.M. Wajeeh said the growing number of tuberculosis cases in Pakistan signified the urgency for interventions at multiple levels.
“The campaign Humara Azam TB Khatam aims to educate the masses about TB symptoms and its prevention while clearing the misconceptions associated with it,” he said.

Dr Sawand was an assistant professor at the Institute of Business Administration (IBA), Sukkur.
Teachers wore black armbands, held rallies and meetings at universities to voice their anger over the incident, demanding action against the culprits.
In a statement, Dr Fahad Nazir Khoso and Dr Baqir Ali Zardari of the Fapuasa-Sindh expressed deep concern over the murder, describing the incident as a great tragedy. 
“The killing of a teacher is like killing a generation. It’s a huge loss to the education sector. Dr Sawand was a dedicated teacher and his contribution towards education in Sindh is invaluable,” Dr Khoso said.
On behalf of the association, he demanded immediate arrest of the killers. “He was killed due to an ongoing rivalry between two communities. We condemn this heinous act and demand that the Sindh government take immediate action against the culprits involved in this tragic incident.”
At Sindh Madressatul Islam University in Karachi, teachers participated in a protest meeting in large numbers where they demanded that the government improve law and order in the province and take action against the tribal chieftains and feudal lords who were involved in the murder.
The association urged the chief justice of Pakistan and chief justice of the Sindh High Court and law enforcement agencies to take notice of the tribal disputes creating unrest in society.
“Dr Sawand was a highly qualified young man with a PhD from France. He was serving the young generation of his own land but the murderers having tribal mindset martyred him,” Sindh Madressatul Islam University’s Teachers Association president Asif Hussain Samo said in a statement.
He regretted the collective failure of the state in protecting the best minds of the nation. “What message are we giving to the world that we are unable to protect our best minds? This speaks volumes of our governance and society by large.”
Recalling his interactions with Dr Sawand, Mr Samo said, “Once he had said that if we have to go to other countries instead of serving our young nation, then why have we received education from abroad?”
In its statement, Shah Abdul Latif University’s Teachers Association (SALUTA) condemned the murder and government’s failure in protecting citizen’s lives.
“Dr Sawand’s murder has shocked the academic community and SALUTA stands in solidarity with his family and friends. We demand that the government take immediate action and arrest the perpetrators and bring them to justice,” the statement said.

to the SSP. 
Sources disclosed on Monday that the office of the Inspector General of Police issued the notification to Shikarpur SSP retired captain Faizan Ahmed on April 5 directing him to explain his position over the appointment ASIs, head constables and even constables as SHOs.  
The notification raised questions over the performance of the officer as SSP Shikarpur since October 2022 and said it was marred by violation of rules and regulations with impunity.

11,"HMC, traffic management board differ  over charged parking sites",Board cuts the number of points from 63 to 19,"HYDERABAD: The District Traffic Management Board on Monday reduced number of points for charged parking from 63 to only 19 following objections by administration officials and decided that henceforward Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (HMC) would allow charged parking only after the approval of the board. 
The board took the decision after the HMC started claiming parking fees from residents at several places in the city. The board is led by Fuad Ghaffar Soomro, deputy commissioner Hyderabad. 
HMC administrator Mohammad Farooq and municipal commissioner were informed on April 7 about the board’s decisions and urged the board to send list of charged parking sites sent by HMC’s municipal corporation to Hyderabad DIG Pir Mohammad Shah for his final opinion on March 10. 
DIG constituted a committee comprising SSP Amjad Ahmed Shaikh, SP traffic Dawoodur Rehman and board’s honourary secretary Javed Iqbal which submitted its report to DIG after taking input from traffic police’s section officers. 

Board cuts the number of points from 63 to 19

According to the April 7 letter, the chairman informed HMC administrator that the DIG held a meeting to discuss the list of charged parking. The meeting took some decisions regarding charged parking. 
According to minutes of the meeting dated March 30, it was resolved that the streets or roads that had been widened in the middle or at their end points should be bifurcated for creating parking spaces.  
It decided that wider points of the streets or roads should be allowed for parking and all those points which were clogged or smaller ones should not be used for parking. 
The board’s chairman informed the administrator that all those points that had been exempted from parking had been clearly mentioned in the letter in a separate column. In view of the DIG’s meeting and subsequent minutes, the chairman was allowing parking space with certain conditions. 
According to the board chairman, vehicles would be parked on the left side of the road within the line and parking staff would use reflecting jackets and HMC or contractor’s staff would be responsible for parking vehicles in an orderly manner. 
The chairman said that no pushcarts would be allowed behind the parked vehicles to ensure smooth flow of traffic and parking staff would make sure it was followed. The staff could call anti-encroachment staff as well for assistance, he said. 
He informed the administrator that HMC’s anti-encroachment cell staff would remove all soft encroachments on and around the roads because the new parking and encroachment had obstructed flow of traffic. 
The administrator was informed that the contractor would be directed to comply with the conditions. If any obstruction was witnessed in the flow of traffic on notified spaces or routes the chairman could de-notify the spots. 
After the HMC allowed around 63 points for charged parking the matter was taken up in the board meeting that reduced to just 19 following objections by administration officials at different levels. HMC had explained its position but it was not accepted.  
HMC had sent a list of 60 charged parking points including spaces outside wedding halls but the board’s chairman had directed HMC administrator to deploy HMC’s traffic warden along with traffic police for checking violation of one way route, wrong parking, lining of pushcarts on shoulder of the road.

In a statement issued here on
Monday SAI president Nawab Zubair Talpur said that the growers did not hoard the grain. They were selling wheat to buyers in open market for better returns compared with food department’s rate, he said.  
He maintained that the food officials who had failed to check smuggling of wheat had now turned to farmers’ own wheat and confiscated it. It was highly condemnable and this practice must stop now, he said.  
He questioned Indus River System Authority’s (Irsa) declaration of 37pc shortage figure in kharif season and said Irsa had calculated water figures on the basis of the three-tier formula which was questioned by Sindh government. He said Sindh government had expressed reservation over this formula. 
He said that application of the three-tier formula would undermine Sindh’s crops. 
Due to incompetence of irrigation department and corruption farmers were bearing losses in crops, he said. 
He said that lining of canals was not done during annual closure of canals. Work was under way on many canals thus crops were not getting water, he said, adding due to the ongoing work water was not being supplied for last one and a half months with the result that sugar cane crop, orchards and cotton were facing damage.

13,Missing Larkana girl’s father faces allegation of her murder,Suspect disowns his 'confessional statement' filed by police in court.,"LARKANA: The man who, according to police, confessed to have killed his eight-year-old daughter by throwing her into Indus river, was on Monday remanded in police custody for three days.
Naveed Khuhawar was produced before the fifth civil judge and judicial magistrate of Larkana with his alleged confessional statement. However, the suspect claimed that police extracted the statement by subjecting him to torture in custody.
Khuhawar had been holding protests regularly since October 12 after reporting the disappearance of his daughter, Naveela, 8, after she had left her home in Daya Street of Allahabad mohalla.
The police had registered an FIR at the Allahabad police station against unknown suspects and had been continuing their probe as well as search for the missing girl, but could not find any clue. On a petition filed by the aggrieved father, the chief justice of Sindh High Court on March 22 sought a report from the Larkana SSP and the investigation officer of the case regarding progress of the investigation.

Suspect disowns his ‘confessional statement’ filed by police in court

During the process, police investigators extensively interrogated the complainant, Naveed Khuhawar, and detained him. On Sunday (April 9), the investigators came out with the claim that the complainant himself had thrown his daughter into the river and had been staging the drama of her disappearance to save himself from being arrested and prosecuted.
According to police sources, when he was interrogated, Khuhawar confessed to having committed the crime.
Larkana SSP Dr Mohammed Imran Khan on Sunday said that Khuhawar had reported his daughter Naveela’s disappearance to the police on October 12. He said he (the SSP), during the course of investigation, constituted a committee headed by the Civil Lines DSP, with the SHOs of the Allahabad and Rehmatpur police stations being its other members, to hold a thorough probe into the FIR (No. 25/2022) registered on behalf of state under Section 364 PPC.
The Larkana police also issued a press release on Sunday revealing contents of Khuhawar’s alleged confessional statement recorded during his custody. It claimed: “Naveed Khuhawar confessed to have committed the crime. Later, to save himself he concocted a story that his daughter had gone missing”.
Citing the confessional statement, the police claimed that Khuhawar threw Naveela into River Indus from the Larkana-Khairpur bridge. They quoted him as stating that Naveela was born to his first wife, who left him along with their son, Mohammad Hassan, over certain disagreements and a tense relationship. His second wife was unhappy over his decision to keep Naveela with him at their home and this dispute was poisoning the couple’s relationship. In order to resolve the issue, Khuhawar finally decided to get rid of Naveela, the police mentioned in his alleged confessional statement.
The police investigators had so far failed to locate Naveela or recover her body.
Meanwhile, Khuhawar’s counsel Advocate Abdul Rauf Korai, speaking to Dawn on Monday said that Naveed Khuhawar, recording his statement before the civil judge earlier in the day, refuted the police claim about his confessional statement.
He stated that the police extracted his confessional statement by subjecting him to torture in custody, the counsel said.
Khuhawar would be produced again in the court on April 13, he added.
