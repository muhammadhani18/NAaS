0,"Biden teases 2024 re-election bid, again","""I plan on running now but we’re not prepared to announce it yet,"" says Biden.","WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden did everything on Monday to look and sound like someone running for re-election — but again insisted he has no official announcement to make.
The 80-year-old Democrat has delayed an expected campaign launch for months, while teasing repeatedly that his intention is to run.
Hosting hundreds of members of the public at a festive Easter event — the White House Easter Egg Roll — Biden once more delivered his almost-but-not-quite confirmation.
“I plan on running now but we’re not prepared to announce it yet,” Biden said in a brief interview with NBC News on the South Lawn, accompanied by his wife First Lady Jill Biden.
Biden noted he intended to attend numerous more egg rolls, a traditional event where children race to push coloured eggs over the grass. He only has one more Easter left in his first term ahead of the 2024 election.
“I plan on at least three or four more Easter Egg Rolls,” he said. “Maybe five…, maybe six, what the hell — I don’t know.” If Biden’s statement left a little wiggle room, his candidate-style crowd dive did not.
Biden has often appeared most comfortable away from the stiff formalities of the presidency. Hugging children and taking cell phones from multiple people in the Easter crowd for selfies, he gave a good impression of a president gearing up for the campaign.
Already the oldest president in US history, Biden would be 86 years old by the time he completed a second term.
His refusal so far to formally declare has left any would-be replacements from the Democratic party waiting quietly in the wings. However, if he does declare, he would not face serious challenges from his own party.
On the Republican side, the current frontrunner is former president Donald Trump whom Biden defeated in 2020.

1,Ukraine plays down reports it amended military plan after US leaks,Ukrainian official says the Russians are destroying buildings and positions in Bakhmut in what he calls “scorched earth” tactics.,"KYIV: Russian forces pressed attacks on frontline cities in eastern Ukraine on Monday, while Ukrainian officials played down a report that Kyiv had had to amend some military plans ahead of a counteroffensive due to a leak of classified US documents.
The Russians were pounding Ukrainian positions around besieged Bakhmut in the eastern Donetsk region and other cities and towns with air strikes and artillery barrages, Kyiv said.
The commander of Ukraine’s ground forces said the Russians were destroying buildings and positions in Bakhmut in what he called “scorched earth” tactics.
Russia’s assault on Bakhmut, a small city on the edge of a chunk of Russian-controlled territory in Donetsk, has for months been the focus of the biggest battle of the war, now in its second year.
The Ukrainian military said on Sunday fighting was heaviest along the western approaches to Bakhmut — a regional transport and logistics hub prior to the war. Russian forces were also targeting the city of Avdiivka, it said.
As the battles ground on, US media outlet CNN reported that Ukraine had been forced to amend some of its military plans ahead of an anticipated counter-offensive due to a leak of classified US documents. It cited a source close to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.
US officials are trying to find the source of the leak of dozens of secret documents detailing an array of topics, including information on the Ukraine conflict, in which the United States has supplied Kyiv with huge amounts of weapons and other support and led international condemnation of Moscow’s invasion.
Asked about the CNN report, Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak said Kyiv’s strategic plans remained unchanged but that specific tactical plans were always subject to change.
The secretary of the National Security and Defence Council, Oleksiy Danilov, said: “We are working on our own plans... The opinion of people who have nothing to do with this do not interest us... The circle of people who possess information is extremely restricted.” Ukrainian officials said on Friday, the documents contained fictitious information and looked like a Russian disinformation campaign.
Some national security experts and US officials say they suspect the leaker could be American, given the breadth of topics covered by the documents, but they do not rule out pro-Russian actors.
Hot on the eastern front
A Ukrainian counteroffensive has long been expected after months of attritional warfare in the east. A Russian winter offensive failed to make much progress and its troops have got bogged down in a series of battles where any advances are incremental and come at a huge cost. The Ukrainian defenders have also taken heavy casualties.
On Monday, Ukrainian ground forces commander Colonel General Oleksandr Syrskyi said the defence of Bakhmut continued. “The situation is difficult but controllable,” he said, quoted by Ukraine’s Media Military Centre.
Moscow is sending in special forces and airborne assault units to help their attack as members of Russia’s private mercenary Wagner group are now exhausted, Syrskyi said. Wagner mercenaries have spearheaded the Russian assault on Bakhmut which has left it largely in ruins.

2,"China practises ‘blockade of  Taiwan’, ends war games",Beijing says US warship ‘illegally intruded’ in South China Sea.,"PINGTAN: China decla­r­ed it had “successfully completed” three days of war games around Taiwan on Monday, capping a show of force that saw it simulate targeted strikes and practise a blockade of the self-ruled island.
Beijing’s exercises were a response to Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen’s meeting with US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy last week, an encounter it had warned would provoke strong countermeasures.
After three days of exercises, the Chinese military said it had “successfully completed” tasks related to its “Joint Sword” drills.
The exercise “comprehensively tested the integrated joint combat ability of multiple military branches under actual combat conditions”, the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) Eastern Command said in a statement.

Beijing says US warship ‘illegally intruded’ in South China Sea

The statement said troops were “ready for battle and can fight at any time, and will resolutely smash any form of ‘Taiwan independence’ separatism and foreign interference attempts”.
The war games saw Beijing simulate targeted strikes on Taiwan and encirclement of the island, including “sealing” it off, and a state media report said dozens of planes had practised an “aerial blockade”.
One of China’s two aircraft carriers — the Shandong — also “participated in today’s exercise”, the military said.
US ship deployed
The United States, which had repeatedly called for China to show restraint, on Monday sent the USS Milius guided-missile destroyer through contested parts of the South China Sea.
“This freedom of navigation operation upheld the rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea,” the US Navy said in a statement.
It added that the vessel had passed near the Spratly Islands — an archipelago claimed by China, Taiwan, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei. It is about 1,300 kilometres from Taiwan.
The deployment of the Milius immediately triggered a condemnation from China, which said the vessel had “illegally intruded” into its territorial waters.
Separately, Beijing warned on Monday that Taiwanese independence and cross-strait peace were “mutually exclusive”, blaming Taipei and unnamed “foreign forces” supporting it for the tensions.
After the drills ended, Taiwan’s foreign ministry condemned China for undermining “peace and stability” in the region.
The island’s Ministry of Defence said it had detec­ted 12 Chinese warships and 91 aircraft around the island on Monday.In the course of the exercises, J15 fighter jets from China’s Shandong aircraft carrier were deployed, and were among 54 aircraft that had crossed the median line, it added.
Close Chinese ally Russia defended the drills, with a Kremlin spokesperson saying Beijing had a “sovereign right” to respond to what Moscow called “provocative acts”.
‘On Beigan island, part of Taiwan’s Matsu archipelago that is within sight of China’s mainland, 60-year-old chef Lin Ke-qiang said that he did not want war.
“We, common people, just want to live peaceful and stable lives,” Lin said, adding that Taiwan’s military was no match for China’s.
“If any war happens, now that their missiles are so advanced, there’s no way our side could resist. This side will be levelled to the ground.” China and Taiwan split at the end of a civil war in 1949. China views the democratic island as part of its territory and has vowed to take it one day.

3,"Cleric, three others held in Bangladesh for stoning woman over affair","“I can’t express in language what they did to me,” says the victim.","DHAKA: A cleric and three village elders were arrested in Bangladesh on charges they ordered a woman to be caned and stoned after she was accus­ed of an extra-marital affair, police said on Monday.
Police said Hamida Sul­tana was “caned 82 strokes” and  “stoned 80 times” with small brick pieces after an imam issued a fatwa punishing her last week.
Sultana said she was “a victim of terrible injustice”.
“I can’t express in language what they did to me,” the 30-year-old said.
Bangladesh has a secular legal system and applying Sharia in criminal cases is illegal.
The fatwa triggered an outcry, with feminist gro­ups and rights activists stag­ing protests to demand the perpetrators’ prosecution.
“They acted like mediaeval people,” Fauzia Moslem, the president of the country’s largest woman’s group, said.
Police inspector Zakir Hossain said officers arrested four people, including the imam of the mosque in Habiganj, in the northeast, after Sultana filed a criminal case on April 7 against 17 people.

4,China’s SenseTime unveils new AI-powered products and chatbot,HONG KONG: China’s SenseTime unveiled on Monday a slew of new artificial intelligence-powered products including a...,"HONG KONG: China’s SenseTime unveiled on Monday a slew of new artificial intelligence-powered products including a chatbot and image generator, joining a global race ignited by the popularity of OpenAI’s ChatGPT.
Xu Li, CEO and co-founder of one of China’s largest AI firms, showed a live demonstration of the chatbot they called “SenseChat” writing an email and telling a story about a cat catching a fish when prompted by questions, as well as scripting computer codes.
The products were based off the latest version of the company’s SenseNova big model, which they have been developing over the past five years, SenseTime’s other co-founder Wang Xiaogang said. Big models are typically trained on massive datasets using powerful hardware.
Global interest in AI technology has soared since the debut in late 2022 of ChatGPT, a popular chat bot developed by US company OpenAI which uses generative AI technology that learns from past data to create new text, images or computer code. Some governments are weighing the merits of AI, including risks such as privacy and copyright infringement.
“We have been focusing on developing our big models. In addition to our powerful AI infrastructure... SenseTime has also developed the ability to deploy big models across our product line,” said SenseTime’s co-founder Wang Xiaogang, adding that SenseChat contained more than 100 billion parameters.
The company, which has been sanctioned by the US, did not provide detailed plans for a product roll out, but said attendees could try out the products.
In addition to SenseChat, the company also showcased an image generator, a digital avatar creation platform and a pair of complementary 3D modelling tools at the event. These applications are meant to work in tandem to help SenseTime’s clients to quickly create video in which the presenter, the environment and the products are all generated by AI in real time.
“We can generate a digital scene for a livestreaming room. The product creation and interactive content are all generated by AI, and the livestreaming room runs non-stop 24 hours a day,” Xu said. “In fact, you may not even be able to tell whether it is a real person doing the broadcasting at night.” Shares in SenseTime, which is best known for its computer vision technology, soared last week after the company began sending out invitations for the event. The Hong Kong market, where the company trades, was shut for a public holiday on Monday.
A number of Chinese companies have been working on their own versions, including Chinese search engine giant Baidu which saw its shares plunge and then rebound after it unveiled its Ernie Bot last month. Ernie Bot is now open to a limited number of public testers.
In 2019, the United States put SenseTime on a trade blacklist after accusing it of developing facial recognition programmes that facilitate Beijing’s surveillance of ethnic Uyghurs in its Xinjiang region.
SenseTime said at the time that it strongly opposed the US ban and would work with relevant authorities to resolve the situation.
Chinese tech companies are rushing to launch their answers to OpenAI’s ChatGPT with Alibaba Group expected to launch its Tongyi Qianwen AI chatbot on Tuesday.

5,News presenter generated with AI appears in Kuwait,A top media representative says the move is a test of AI’s potential to offer “new and innovative content”.,"KUWAIT CITY: A Kuwaiti media outlet has unveiled a virtual news presenter generated using artificial intelligence, with plans for it to read online bulletins.
“Fedha” appeared on the Twitter account of the Kuwait News website as an image of a woman, her light-coloured hair uncovered, wearing a black jacket and white T-shirt.
“I’m Fedha, the first presenter in Kuwait who works with artificial intelligence at Kuwait News. What kind of news do you prefer? Let’s hear your opinions,” she said in classical Arabic.
 






The site is affiliated with the Kuwait Times, founded in 1961 as the Gulf region’s first English-language daily.
Abdullah Boftain, deputy editor in chief for both outlets, said the move is a test of AI’s potential to offer “new and innovative content”.
In future Fedha could adopt the Kuwaiti accent and present news bulletins on the site’s Twitter account, which has 1.2 million followers, he said.
“Fedha is a popular, old Kuwaiti name that refers to silver, the metal. We always imagine robots to be silver and metallic in colour, so we combined the two,” Boftain said.
The presenter’s blonde hair and light-coloured eyes reflect the oil-rich country’s diverse population of Kuwaitis and expatriates, according to Boftain.
“Fedha represents everyone,” he said.
Her initial 13-second video generated a flood of reactions on social media, including from journalists.

6,Macron takes  flak for remarks over Taiwan,PARIS: French President Emmanuel Macron has caused a stir by saying Europe has no interest in accelerating the...,"PARIS: French President Emmanuel Macron has caused a stir by saying Europe has no interest in accelerating the conflict in Taiwan and should become a  “third pole” independent of both Washington and Beijing.
Political actors on both sides of the Atlantic criticised the president’s position as being too accommodating of China, just as it carries out military drills around Taiwan. 
In an interview with French newspaper Les Echos and Politico during his three-day visit to China last week, Macron said  “the worst thing would be to think that we Europeans must become followers on this topic and adapt to the American rhythm or a Chinese overreaction.” 
China views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory and has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control. Taiwan’s govern­ment strongly objects to China’s claims.
German MP for the Bundestag’s foreign committee Norbert Roettgen said in a tweet that Macron had  “managed to turn his China trip into a PR coup for Xi and a foreign policy disaster for Europe.” 
He added that the French president was  “increasingly isolating himself in Europe.”  In a video posted on Twitter, US senator Marco Rubio drew parallels with the conflict in Ukraine — on which Macron hopes to enlist the help of China.
If Europe doesn’t  “pick sides between the US and China over Taiwan, then maybe we shouldn’t be picking sides either [on Ukraine],” the Republican senator said.
Pascal Confavreux, spokesperson for the French embassy in the United States, said that Macron’s comments had been overinterpreted. “The US is our ally with whom we share our values,” he said on Twitter. The Elysee did not respond to requests for comment.

7,Italian coast guard battles to save thousands of migrants at sea,"ROME: Italy’s coast guard said it was trying on Monday to rescue 1,200 more migrants aboard two boats on the...","ROME: Italy’s coast guard said it was trying on Monday to rescue 1,200 more migrants aboard two boats on the Mediter­ranean Sea after saving about 2,000 already over the weekend.
The rescue of about 800 migrants aboard an overloaded fishing boat was on­going, the coast guard said. The boat was located in Italian waters more than 120 miles southeast of Syracuse, in Sicily.
The operation — involving three patrol boats and a merchant ship, all coordinated by the “Nave Peluso” coast guard boat — was described as “complex” due to the overcrowding.
A second fishing vessel carrying 400 migrants and also in Italian waters had been intercepted by the coast guard ship “Diciotti” 170 miles southeast of Capo Passero, at the southernmost tip of Sicily.
Two merchant vessels were assisting in that rescue, the coast guard said.
Alarm Phone, a hotline used by migrants in distress, said on Twitter on Monday that the people onboard were “in panic”.
Alarm Phone tweeted on Sunday that, according to a woman onboard, the boat that had set off from Libya was missing its captain, and several people onboard needed medical care, including a child, a pregnant woman and a disabled person.
Three people in distress had jumped overboard and one fell unconscious, it wrote.
The coast guard said that besides the ongoing operations about 2,000 people had been saved since Friday in “a large number of rescues”.
Thousands of migrants have landed on Italy’s shores, especially the island of Lampedusa, in recent days after making the dangerous journey aboard flimsy vessels from North Africa.
On Sunday, German aid group ResQship said at least two migrants had died and about 20 others were missing after their vessel sank overnight Saturday to Sunday after leaving Tunisia.

8,"West Bank violence kills Palestinian teen, British-Israeli mother",JERICHO: The Israeli-Palestinian conflict on Monday claimed the lives of a Palestinian teenager and a ...,"JERICHO: The Israeli-Palestinian conflict on Monday claimed the lives of a Palestinian teenager and a British-Israeli mother who succumbed to injuries from a West Bank gun attack that earlier killed her two daughters.
Tensions have flared into bloodshed since last week, with heavy clashes, shootings, rocket strikes and a car-ramming attack marring a period when the Ramazan coincides with the Jewish Passover and Christian Easter.
And on Monday several ministers from Israel’s hard-right government joined a protest march by Jewish settlers, held under tight security in the north of the occupied West Bank.
In the latest West Bank shooting, Israeli forces killed a Palestinian teenager and wounded two other people, the Palestinian health ministry said, during what the army described as a raid to arrest a “terror suspect”.
Mohammed Fayez Balhan, 15, died after being shot “with live occupation (Israeli) bullets in the head, chest and abdomen”, the ministry said, having earlier reported that two others were injured by Israeli bullets.
The Israeli army confirmed its forces were operating in the Aqabat Jaber camp, the site of previous deadly Israeli raids this year, near Jericho, where soldiers were seeking “to apprehend a terror suspect”.
The army said troops responded with live fire after “suspects opened fire toward (soldiers), hurled explosive devices and Molotov cocktails”. They added that a suspect was taken in by security forces.
Violence erupted when the army entered the camp and surrounded several houses, according to Palestinian news agency Wafa. A Palestinian security official said that five individuals were arrested during the raid.
Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, said it mourned the “young martyr” Balhan and praised those “who are standing up to this arrogant enemy”.
British-Israeli mother dies
The operation came as a Jerusalem hospital confirmed that a British-Israeli woman, Lucy (Leah) Dee, had died after being seriously injured in a shooting attack on Friday in the West Bank that killed her two daughters, aged 16 and 20.
Their car came under fire in the Jordan Valley, where Jericho is also located. The families were residents of Efrat, an illegal Jewish settlement in the West Bank.
British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly tweeted: “There can be no justification for the murder of Leah and her two daughters, Maia and Rina.” “We will continue to work with the Israeli authorities to end this senseless violence,” he added.
Thousands of Jewish settlers live in Israeli-approved settlements there which are considered illegal under international law.
Hundreds of Israelis marched on Monday in the north of the West Bank, pushing for state approval of an Israeli settler outpost.
Several government ministers — including Israel’s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir — appeared at the march to Eviatar, whose residents agreed to leave in 2021 while officials examined their case.

9,Turkiye launches its first aircraft carrier,"“This vessel will allow us to conduct military and humanitarian operations in every corner of the world, when needed,” says Erdogan.","ANKARA: Turkiye launched its first aircraft carrier on Monday, aiming to extend its drone capabilities from land-based to naval operations amid increased regional tensions as war rages in Ukraine on the other side of the Black Sea.
The TCG Anadolu can handle only light aircraft, chiefly helicopters and jets that can take off from shorter runways. It is 232 metres long and 32 meters wide, and can carry some 1,400 personnel — one battalion of soldiers — combat vehicles and support units to operate overseas.
“This vessel will allow us to conduct military and humanitarian operations in every corner of the world, when needed,” President Tayyip Erdogan said at the launch ceremony in Istanbul.
“We see this vessel as a symbol that will consolidate Turkiye’s regional leadership position,” he said.
The amphibious assault ship was built in Istanbul’s Sedef Shipyard by a Turkish-Spanish consortium, based on the design of Spanish light aircraft carrier Juan Carlos I. Ankara’s original plan was to deploy F-35 B-model fighter jets, which can take off from shorter runways, on its largest warship.
But its plans had to change after the United States removed Turkiye, a Nato ally, from its F-35 program over Ankara’s purchase of Russian S-400 defence systems in 2019. Turkiye then 
converted TCG Anadolu into a drone carrier.

More than 24 hours after an explosion at the building, where residents repor­ted a strong smell of gas, dozens of civil defence staff and sniffer dogs were working through the de­bris, where a fire still smouldered.
Housing Minister Olivier Klein said at the scene earlier on Monday that four bodies had been found. But a few hours later, the emergency services announced that rescue workers had found the body of a fifth victim.
The deputy mayor of the Mediterranean port city, Yannick Ohanessian, had said rescue workers still hoped to find survivors.
The fire under the rubble has made it hard for the dogs to detect more victims or survivors.

11,China criticises Indian minister’s visit to Arunachal Pradesh,BEIJING: China firmly opposes a visit by India’s home minister to Arunachal Pradesh and views his activities in ...,"BEIJING: China firmly opposes a visit by India’s home minister to Arunachal Pradesh and views his activities in the area as violating Beijing’s territorial sovereignty, a foreign ministry spokesperson told a news briefing on Monday.
China has renamed some places in what India regards as its eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, which China claims as part of its territory.
“Zangnan is China’s territory,” spokesperson Wang Wenbin said in response to a question on the visit by Indian Home Minister Amit Shah. 
“The Indian official’s visit to Zangnan violates China’s territorial sovereignty, and is not conducive to the peace and tranquillity of the border situation.”  
Zangnan is the Chinese name for Arunachal Pradesh. 
China and India have had several skirmishes over the disputed border and clashes in mountainous regions in recent years have seriously strained ties. 
Uplift scheme
Amit Shah visited Arunachal Pradesh to launch a 48 billion rupee ($585 million) development scheme he said would add to the security of the unmarked border.
He said the programme, which will cover nearly 3,000 villages in four states and one federally administered territory on the Chinese frontier, was aimed at helping reverse migration out of border areas.
Arunachal Pradesh has become a new flashpoint between New Delhi and Beijing, whose relations have been strained since bloody clashes between their armies elsewhere in the western Himalayas in 2020 in which 24 soldiers were killed.
In December last year, troops from the two sides engaged in scuffles in the state’s Tawang sector, and last week India rejected the renaming by China of 11 places, including five mountains, in Arunachal Pradesh.
A map released last week showed the 11 places renamed by China as being within “Zangnan”, or southern Tibet in Chinese, with Arunachal Pradesh included in southern Tibet.
Shah, a close confidant of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and considered the second most powerful leader in the government, said Indians in the hinterland were able to sleep in peace because of the “bravery and sacrifices” of the troops on the border.
“They have ensured that no one can eye our borders,” Shah told a public meeting in Kibithoo, a border village in the Anjaw district of Arunachal Pradesh, one of India’s last inhabited settlements just miles from the Chinese frontier.
“Today we proudly say, gone are the days when anyone could encroach on our territory,” Shah said, without naming China.

12,Biden’s ancestral Irish hometown prepares for president’s visit,BALLINA: The picturesque town of Ballina on the banks of the River Moy in northwest Ireland hums with activity ahead...,"BALLINA: The picturesque town of Ballina on the banks of the River Moy in northwest Ireland hums with activity ahead of a visit by its celebrated descendant Joe Biden this week.
The US president is due to arrive in the north County Mayo town on Friday to address thousands in the place from which his family hailed before emigrating to Pennsylvania in the 19th century.
It will be one of the last stops on a tour of Ireland and Northern Ireland taking in Belfast, Dublin and other locations from the proudly Irish-American president’s family history.
Biden’s relatives still remain in the area and Joe Blewitt, the president’s third cousin, has been juggling requests from the international press while doing his job as a plumber.
“It’s emotional, it’s a very proud day for our family and for Ireland,” Blewitt, 43, said of the upcoming trip.  “Ballina’s very special to him.” Biden invited the Blewitt family to his inauguration, which they were unable to make because of the Covid pandemic. But they were in attendance last month at St Patrick’s Day celebrations at the White House.
“It’s very special, of course, and very hard to describe it, to know the president of the United States,” Blewitt added.
“He’s just like ourselves. He has a sense of power off him but he’s just an ordinary fella.”
Outside Harrison’s bar in the centre of Ballina, proprietor Derek Leonard hangs red, white and blue bunting atop a ladder and drapes his pub’s windows with the US stars and stripes in anticipation of the presidential visit.
“People are buzzing and they’re washing and they’re painting... it’s great to see it,” the landlord said.
Inside the bar, a picture of Leonard with Biden when he visited as vice president in 2016 hangs in pride of place. The US leader had vowed to return to Ballina when he became president.
Leonard, who said with authority that his ancestors would have rubbed shoulders with Biden’s in the town, commissioned a five-metre-high (16-foot-high) mural of the president when he won the 2020 presidential election.
The bar owner said it would be a  “great honour” to meet Biden again as president if he visits the mural.
The street in the centre of town where Biden’s great-great-great-grandfather Edward Blewitt lived and where the mural stands is festooned with US flags, posters and banners. Inside the Ballina Costume Company, Jane Crean dutifully sews American flags for Biden’s arrival.
She explained she had taken the announcement of the trip in stride because with a French festival planned over the summer, she already had some red, white and blue bunting prepared.
‘Full circle’
“Everybody’s in party mode,” the costume shop owner explained. “This will put Ballina on the map...it’ll showcase Ballina, which is fantastic and it will bring visitors to it.” In one sports shop window selling Gaelic football shirts, the mannequins have been dressed in American football jerseys. One placard tells Biden:  “The kettle is on Joe, come on home”.
Ernie Caffrey, a former Irish senator and owner of a gallery and gift shop, believes his premises stands on the site of Biden’s ancestral home.
The 86-year-old said two local historians have proved that an old brick wall behind his shop, showing the clear outline of a fireplace, formed part of Edward Blewitt’s cottage.
“We’re standing beside what remains of the original Blewitt’s cottage,” he added.
“It’s kind of a miracle that it’s still here because the whole town has changed in 200 years — every square inch was built on except this one.” Speaking near St Muredach’s Cathedral, where Biden will make an address Friday, Mark Duffy, the leader of Ballina’s municipal council, said the president’s story resonated with people in Ireland and Irish-Americans. “Irish people left here during famine and during oppression,” he said.
“That has come full circle now with a son of Ballina, an ancestor of Ballina, becoming US president and sitting in the Oval Office. So it’s a beautiful story.”
