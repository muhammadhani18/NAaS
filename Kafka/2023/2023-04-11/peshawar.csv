0,Enforcement of Constitution must for progress: ANP,PESHAWAR: Awami National Party president Asfandyar Wali Khan has said that the only way for progress and development...,"PESHAWAR: Awami National Party president Asfandyar Wali Khan has said that the only way for progress and development of the country is implementation of Constitution.
In a statement here on Monday, he recalled the role of Abdul Wali Khan as opposition leader in National Assembly in the unanimous approval of 1973 Constitution, saying that it would always be remembered in the country’s history.
He said that as an opposition leader, Wali Khan fought for the rights of smaller provinces as per Constitution but some people did not regarded his services. He said that the year 1973 was the most difficult time in the country’s history but even then the ANP chief and other politicians managed to pass the Constitution.
Mr Khan said the members of constitutional committee including Mir Ghaus Bakhsh Bizenjo and Amirzada Khan worked day and night and made it possible to give the unanimous Constitution to the nation. Unfortunately, those who drafted and approved the Constitution of Pakistan were later labelled as traitors and their parties were banned on malafide basis.
The ANP chef said that those, who conspired against democracy, violated the constitution and weakened parliament, were responsible for the current uncertain situation. He said that it was also unfortunate that during the past 50 years the Constitution remained suspended but no action was taken against those, who violated the law. He said that some political parties also supported the violators of the Constitution.
“Democratic values will continue to weaken in the country as long as the Constitution and parliament are not given their due status. On the occasion of the golden jubilee of the Constitution, we must pledge to give this book a top priority on everything,” he said.

3,"Two ‘auto thieves’, passerby killed in Swabi encounter",SWABI: Two alleged auto thieves and a passerby were killed during an encounter between car lifters and the police at...,"SWABI: Two alleged auto thieves and a passerby were killed during an encounter between car lifters and the police at the Jehangira Bridge here on Monday, district police officer Najamul Hussain said.
He told mediapersons that the auto thieves belonging to the notorious Najibullah car-lifters group were going towards Peshawar on the Islamabad-Peshawar Motorway in two cars.

4,Peshawar teaching hospitals receive fewer patients in Ramazan,Doctor says most people want to undergo procedures after Eid,"PESHAWAR: The number of patients at medical teaching institutions in the provincial capital has been decreasing due to Ramazan and upcoming Eidul Fitr.
Doctors say that inflow of patients has gone down almost by 50 per cent as most people want to keep fasting and seek treatment after Eidul Fitr.
According to them, the patients have to wait for longer period to undergo surgeries in normal days because of load of people but there is continuous decline since the start of Ramazan at teaching hospitals like previous years during which the hospitals wore a deserted look.
“With the approaching Eid, most of the wards would get empty soon except the intensive care units where the seriously-ill patients have no option but to stay in hospitals to continue their lifesaving treatment,” a senior physician at one of the tertiary care hospitals told Dawn.

Doctor says most people want to undergo procedures after Eid

The patients having ear, nose and throat (ENT), eye and skin problems decide against operations despite advice by the doctors to be able to keep fasting and undergo surgeries after Eid while those requiring emergency procedures have to stay in hospitals to continue their treatment.
Mohammad Asim, the spokespersons for the province’s biggest heath facility Lady Reading Hospital, confirmed that the number of outdoor patients (OPD) patients registered reduction and would further decline as Eidul Fitr approached.
“In normal situation, we receive more than 4,000 patients but in Ramazan the number has come down to 2,500 on average per day,” he said.
However, he said that there was a slight drop in the number of admitted patients because the 1700-bed LRH had got more specialties that were extremely overburdened with patients. Therefore, the patients did not miss their date of operations at the hospital, he added.
“We have more than 1,300 admitted patients at any given time. However, during Eidul Fitr only critically-ill patients will remain in the hospital,” said Mr Asim.
An assistant professor at the surgical ward of Khyber Teaching Hospital said that situation with regard to influx of patients in Ramazan was more or the less the same. “Before Ramazan, we didn’t have empty beds to admit patients and only chronically-sick ones were hospitalised the same day while the cold patients were given dates for admission,” he added.
He said that they often discussed in wards as to where the patients disappeared in Ramazan. “This happens every year as patients prefer to get major treatment after Ramazan so that couldn’t miss fasting,” he added.
The doctor said that even the number of patients seeking free healthcare services at private hospitals on Sehat Card Plus fell by 70 per cent. “Commonly, we have to give waiting time to patients to undergo operations and other procedures due to rush but in Ramazan people stay away from hospitals to be able to keep fasting and come after Eidul Fitr,” he said.
He said that soon after Eidul Fitr, they witnessed huge rush of patients due to which hospitals ran out of beds and people had to wait for painfully longer periods.
“In most of the hospitals, the accident and emergency departments never get closed as they receive seriously-ill patients while most of the wards remain without patients,” said the doctor.

HEARING: The Peshawar High Court’s Dera Division Bench on Monday took up a plea, seeking court’s directives to an anti-terrorism court to directly nominate PTI leader Ali Amin Gandapur and his brother, Umar Amin in the murder case of former provincial law minister Sardar Israrullah Gandapur.

Waheed Anjum Advocate appeared on behalf of the petitioner.

They added that the prison administration, in order to address the issue once and for all, decided to send members of one group to the Mardan Central Prison and the other’s to the Kohat District Jail.
KP Inspector General of Prisons Irfan Mehsud told Dawn that as jail officials began separating those prisoners and asked them to board prison vans, the latter offered resistance and rioted.

IG (prisons) says situation under control

He said the regular police force was called to help prison police to quell the disturbance.
“The police fired tear gas shells [at rioters] and immediately contained the situation. Now, everything is under control,” he said.
The prisons chief said hardcore criminals would be shifted to Mardan and Kohat jails “as soon as possible.”
A report prepared by authorities on the incident, a copy of which is available with Dawn, read, “An untoward situation took place inside the Peshawar Central Prison and went out of control at 15:30 hours in 4-Ghat cells and the administrator promptly responded into it by calling to the guards as well as Police’s Quick Response Force and then situation remained under control at 16:30 hours.”

13,Tirah tribesmen protest ‘armed intrusion’ of peace committee,Say they will not allow anyone to disturb hard-earned peace in the area.,"KHYBER: The residents of Tirah took serious exception to ‘unauthorised intrusion’ of an armed group from Bazaar-Zakhakhel area into the valley to spread fear among them with open display of lethal weapons.
Scores of Tirah residents, who were holding white flags, held a protest demonstration at Lar-Bagh Malakdinkhel Markaz, the valley’s main business centre. They also chanted slogans against the law enforcement agencies for their failure to stop armed men from entering the local market and roaming around in different parts of the valley.
Speakers in the protest demonstration questioned as to how scores of armed men managed to enter Tirah while locals could not carry even a knife while passing through various checkposts.
They said that they would not allow anyone to disturb the hard earned peace of Tirah at any cost no matter how powerful those people were.

Say they will not allow anyone to disturb hard-earned peace in the area

A group of the protesting tribal elders later met with the local security officials and convey to them their serious reservations about the entry of armed men belonging to a so-called peace committee from Bazaar-Zakhakhel area into the valley.
A local elder, who was present on the occasion, told Dawn that the security officials termed the ‘incident’ a misunderstanding as they too were conveyed a message that the Bazaar-Zakhakhel peace committee activists would come to Tirah without arms.
The elders, who wished not to be named, said that security officials promised that the matter would be discussed at ‘high’ level and would ensure that no such incident took place again.
Earlier, on Monday evening, video clips of heavily armed Bazaar-Zakhakhel peace committee volunteers went viral on social media that invited immediate anger and resentment of Tirah and Bara residents.
At first sight, local residents mistook the armed men as Taliban while a local resident, filming their ‘parade’ at Lar-Bagh Markaz and speaking in the back ground, said that Taliban had once again entered Tirah.
Sources in Tirah told Dawn by telephone that more than 24 armed men affiliated with the so-called Bazaar-Zakhakhel peace committee had come to Tirah to settle an issue related to narcotics trade.
They said that the armed men had not informed local elders about their visit to the valley, which was a violation of the local customs and traditions.
Haji Sher Mohammad, president of Tirah Tajir Union, too was not happy with the open display of sophisticated weapons by the Zakhakhel armed men at local market place. He said that the unlawful action had both angered and disappointed locals in general and traders in particular.
He said that such brazen display of weapons by an armed group could again disturb the peace of the valley while their trade would also be affected as Eidul Fitr was approaching.
He said that people of Tirah reserved the right to question the ability of the law enforcement agencies for their failure to check the unauthorised movement of such armed groups.
The so-called Bazaar-Zakhakhel peace committee is a splinter group of banned Lashkar-i-Islam, which was considered a sign of terror in Khyber from 2005 to 2012.
The group dissociated itself from LI around 2007-8 after developing differences with its chief Mangal Bagh and named itself as Tauheedul Islam. The two rival groups then fought some fierce battles against each other, which claimed lives of more than 100 people from both sides.
Tauheedul Islam later struck a deal with the security forces and transformed its self into a peace committee while taking control of the important and lucrative trade route passing through Bazaar-Zakhakhel tribal region. The group is still instrumental in controlling the entire area and outsiders cannot enter the region without its permission.
