Cengiz Under forced a good save from Lorient goalkeeper Vito Mannone in the first half but Marseille struggled to create chances as their eight-match winning run away from home ended.
“It’s disappointing. The match was within our grasp but we were a bit lacking when it mattered most,” Marseille midfielder Matteo Guendouzi told Prime Video.
Former Marseille striker Bamba Dieng went close to scoring against his old club but was denied by Pau Lopez on the hour as Igor Tudor’s side dropped two points behind second-placed Lens.
“There’s no pressure, there’s still a lot of matches,” said Guendouzi.
Marseille also missed the chance to further distance themselves from Monaco, who were held 2-2 at Nantes earlier in the day.
Axel Disasi lashed Monaco ahead on 21 minutes and Eliot Matazo got his team’s second when Nantes goalkeeper Alban Lafont flapped at a corner and the ball trickled in off the Belgian midfielder.
But Egypt international Mostafa Mohamed headed Nantes back into the game midway through the second half before fellow substitute Ludovic Blas nodded in an equaliser at the far post.
Lyon bounced back from their stinging midweek loss at Nantes in the French Cup semi-finals as they came from behind to beat Rennes 3-1.
Laurent Blanc’s side trailed against Rennes as Amine Gouiri struck against his former club, but Lyon recovered in the second half to win a game after going behind for the first time this season.
Corentin Tolisso curled in a sublime long-range shot to haul Lyon level and Alexandre Lacazette’s 18th goal this term soon put the hosts in front.
Young forward Bradley Barcola completed the turnaround with 12 minutes to go, netting for the third time in four games to help Lyon stay in sight of a place in the Europa Conference League.Auxerre dragged themselves out of the bottom four with a 3-0 win at Ajaccio, whose coach Olivier Pantaloni said afterwards his team were all but doomed to relegation.
Folarin Balogun’s stoppage-time penalty — his 18th league goal of the campaign — salvaged a 1-1 draw for Reims against Brest.
Toulouse won 2-1 at Montpellier and Clermont pushed Troyes closer to the drop with a 2-0 away victory.

1,Ronaldo angered by blow to  Al-Nassr  title hopes,"Al-Nassr, who won the title for the last time in 2019, will play a crucial game next week against Al-Hilal.","AL-MAJMAAH: Al-Nassr suffered a huge blow to their hopes of winning the Saudi Professional League after a goalless draw with lowly Al-Fayha, and Cristiano Ronaldo left the pitch in anger after a frustrating performance on Sunday.
Leaders Al-Ittihad did not waste the opportunity to widen the gap with Al-Nassr to three points with the last seven games remaining, with a victory 2-1 against Al-Wehda. Al-Ittihad had an advantage also in a head-to-head result with Al-Nassr.
Ronaldo, 38, who joined Al-Nassr in January in a contract estimated by media to be worth more than 200 million euros ($218 million), hit a ball into the hands of goalkeeper Vladimir Stojkovic, who kissed the ball in the 68th minute.
Stojkovic seemed to cast a spell on the ball as the Portugal captain fired twice over the bar in the space of six minutes, and Brazilian Anderson Tali­sca, the league’s top scorer, was ineffective also.

Ronaldo appeared furious while leaving the pitch after his goal tally stopped at 11 goals in 10 league games, and he took off the captain armband and left it in his hand.
Al-Nassr coach Rudi Garcia was not satisfied with the performance, nor the result.
“The result is definitely bad and we are not happy,” the French coach told the Saudi Sports Company (SSC) through a translator.
“I don’t feel satisfied with the players’ performance. I asked them to play at the same level as the last game [in the 5-0 victory against Al-Adalah], but this didn’t happen”.
Al-Nassr, who won the title for the last time in 2019, will play a crucial game next week against Al-Hilal, the defending cha­m­pion and fourth in the standings, which may deter­mine the race for the title.
“There are seven games left, we will try to recover, and we realise that its not easy after we lost two points, but everything is possible.”
Al-Fayha posted on Twitter an edited image of their captain Sami Al-Khaibari sitting in front of Ronaldo at a chess table, reflecting a famous advertisement featuring rivals Lionel Messi and Cristiano.
The image captioned  “checkmate”, drew more than 1.9 million views, compared to fewer than 100,000 views for other page posts.

2,Arsenal show Premier League title strain under Anfield spotlight,Arsenal will be hoping that squandering a two-goal lead against Liverpool on Sunday does not end up costing them the title.,"LIVERPOOL: After a run of seven consecutive league wins, Arsenal finally buckled under the pressure applied by Manchester City. 
With eight games to go as they try and close in on a first Premier League trophy since 2004, Arsenal will be hoping that squandering a two-goal lead against Liverpool on Sunday does not end up costing them the title. 
Through most of the first half, the league leaders turned Liverpool inside out with the ruthless precision they have shown for most of the season and appeared to be cruising towards a crucial win when Gabriel Martinelli and Gabriel Jesus put them 2-0 up inside half an hour. 
However, they conceded just before the break and unravelled after halftime to draw 2-2 as the Reds, who have still only lost one league game at home despite a season of struggle, came roaring back in a thrilling clash. 
The game shifted momentum after a scuffle between Granit Xhaka and Trent Alexander-Arnold that riled up the already raucous crowd. 
Arsenal lost their discipline and Salah capitalised with a goal just before halftime. With Liver­pool pressing, Roberto Firmino headed in an 87th-minute equaliser bringing the delirious crowd to their feet. 
Arsenal were grateful in the end to goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale for leaving Merseyside with even a point as he produced a highlights reel of spectacular saves late on to deny Mohamed Salah, Darwin Nunez and Ibrahima Konate. 
Arsenal faced 19 shots inside the box, the most they have faced since records began for this statistic in 2003-04, with Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp left at a loss to explain how his side did not complete a comeback win. 
“You need your goalkeeper in title races, you need magic moments from your keeper, and Aaron was there for us, just like Alisson has been for Liverpool so many times,” manager Mikel Arteta said. 
“But we look at ourselves in mirror and could have done better with some big chances. We missed that ruthlessness to take the game. It’s probably a fair result. The big lesson is place the way we did in the first half.” 
At a stadium where Arsenal have still not won in the league since their manager was patrolling the midfield in 2012, the two points dropped could yet prove the difference in the title race. 
Arsenal remain six points clear, but have played a game more than City, who are hitting top form at the right time. 
In contrast to Arteta’s novices when it comes to the title run-in, Pep Guardiola’s men are battle-tested after lifting the trophy four times in the last five years. 
Despite a six-point deficit, City now know that if they win their remaining nine games they will almost certainly retain the title. 
LINESMAN STOOD DOWN AFTER ROBERTSON ELBOW INCIDENT 
Meanwhile, the assistant referee who allegedly elbowed Liverpool’s Andy Robertson at halftime during their explosive draw against Arsenal will not be appointed for matches in the future until an investigation is complete, the referee’s body said on Monday. 
Liverpool full back Robertson was seen remonstrating with the official, Constantine Hatzidakis, at halftime and video replays appeared to show him brushing off the Scotland international and catching him with his elbow. 
Robertson gesticulated that he had been hit by Hatzidakis while the irate Scotland captain was led away by team-mates, only to receive a yellow card in the aftermath of the bizarre incident. 
“PGMOL will not be appointing Constantine Hatzidakis to fixtures in any of the competition it serves whilst the FA investigates the incident involving the assistant referee and Liverpool defender Andrew Robertson at Anfield,” it said in a statement.

3,Djokovic returns to Tour seeking strong start to clay swing,"“I’ve done more training on clay, which is positive if you think about the clay season,” says Djokovic.","MONACO: Novak Djokovic said he hopes to hit the ground running at Monte Carlo having begun preparations for the clay season early after the world number one was forced to skip tournaments in the United States last month.
Djokovic, 35, who is unvaccinated against Covid-19, was unable to enter the country after unsuccessfully applying to the US government for special permission to play at Indian Wells and Miami.
The Australian Open champion last competed in early March when he lost in the Dubai semi-finals and said his enforced absence from the Tour helped him focus on Monte Carlo, where he lost in the second round last year.
“I’ve done more training on clay, which is positive if you think about the clay season,” said Djokovic, the 2013 and 2015 champion who meets Mackenzie McDonald or a qualifier first.
“I’ve not had much success in Monte Carlo in the past two seasons. I haven’t played great tennis here, so I’m hoping this year I can start the clay season better than previous years and build my form.”
With Rafa Nadal skipping Monte Carlo due to injury, Djokovic will also look to build momentum ahead of the French Open where the Serbian will target a 23rd Grand Slam to go ahead of the Spaniard.
Djokovic, who trains at Monaco, said home comforts could prove helpful is his quest for a record-extending 39th Masters 1000 crown at Monte Carlo.
“It’s a club I know well. Quite a few top players reside in Monaco and use this club as a training base, Djokovic said. “The club transforms incredibly during the weeks of the tournament but it’s a great feeling to sleep in your own bed.”
In first round action on Sunday, 10th seed Hubert Hurkacz rallied to beat Laslo Djere 6-7(5), 7-6(5), 7-6(5) while Nicolas Jarry stunned 15th seed Borna Coric 6-2, 6-3.

4,Hoffenheim beat Schalke in relegation battle for third straight win,BERLIN: Hoffenheim battled past Schalke 2-0 on Sunday to make it three league wins in a row and move away from the...,"BERLIN: Hoffenheim battled past Schalke 2-0 on Sunday to make it three league wins in a row and move away from the relegation zone, leaving the Royal Blues in last place in the Bundesliga.
The hosts bagged the three points with a Schalke own goal in the first half and a twice-taken second half penalty to move up to 14th place on 28 points.
Schalke’s first away defeat in the league since January meant they dropped back down to last place on 21 points with seven matches remaining.
They had got off to a flying start and hit the crossbar after 37 seconds of play before Hoffen­heim responded with a double chance of their own a little later.
The hosts took the lead after Angelino cut the ball back in the box and Schalke’s Alex Kral deflected it into his own goal in the 22nd minute.
The Royal Blues, however, almost bounced back two minutes later with Maya Yoshida hitting the woodwork again.
Hoffenheim doubled their lead in the 70th minute with Ihlas Bebou beating Ralf Faehrmann on his second attempt from the penalty spot after the Schalke keeper had saved his first effort but was ruled to have moved off his line too early.
Earlier, Stuttgart’s resurgence under new coach Sebastian Hoeness  continued with a 3-2 win at Bochum to move up from last place in the  table to 16th, leapfrogging Schalke and Hertha.
Goals from Hiroki  Ito, Serhou Guirassy and Josha Vagnoman took Stuttgart to victory, their  second win since Hoeness was appointed manager on Tuesday, including a DFB Pokal quarter-final victory over Nuremberg.Meanwhile, goals from Nathan Ngoumou and Marcus Thuram earned Borussia  Moenchen­gladbach a 2-0 home win over Wolfsburg, dampening the visitors’  hopes of European football next season.
Gladbach’s first win in  six matches ended Wolfsburg’s five-match unbeaten run, leaving the  visitors four points behind the European places.
Wolfsburg  dominated early but it was Gladbach who would open the scoring, Ngoumou  finishing off a team move well against the run of play.
With 34  minutes gone, Ngoumou latched onto a cutback from France striker Thuram  and blasted past Wolfsburg ‘keeper Koen Casteels for the opener.
Gladbach  doubled their lead midway through the second half, Ngoumou turning  provider this time, linking with Alassane Plea who found Thuram in the  box.
Thuram headed in for his 13th goal of the season, taking him  three behind leader Niclas Fuell­krug atop the Bundesliga scoring charts.
Despite the win, Gladbach remain mired in mid-table in former Norwich City manager Daniel Farke’s first season in charge.

5,Atletico win at Rayo Vallecano to close in on second-placed Real,BARCELONA: First-half goals from Nahuel Molina and Mario Hermoso earned Atletico Madrid a 2-1 win at Rayo Vallecano...,"BARCELONA: First-half goals from Nahuel Molina and Mario Hermoso earned Atletico Madrid a 2-1 win at Rayo Vallecano on Sunday to secure their fifth successive win and move within two points of second-placed Real Madrid in La Liga.
A superb 12-match unbeaten league run has powered Atletico to a 57-point tally to close the gap on their city rivals, who virtually kissed their title chances goodbye after losing to Villarreal on Saturday.
Molina opened the scoring in the 22nd minute after a fast breakaway where Alvaro Morata set up the World Cup-winning Argentina right back for his first goal since joining the club in the close season from Italian side Udinese.
Hermoso doubled the lead a couple of minutes later with a header from a corner, capitalising on a poor clearance by Rayo goalkeeper Stole Dimitrievski.The hosts were a man down after defender Florian Lejeune was sent off early in the second half, but left back Fran Garcia restored some hope by pulling one back in the 85th minute with a brilliant long-range low shot.
Atletico host relegation-threatened Almeria next Saturday while Rayo, ninth on 37 points, take on Osasuna on Friday.
Earlier, nine-man Real Betis fell to a shock home defeat by Cadiz, leaving Manuel Pelle­grini’s side sixth in La Liga.
After  Villarreal’s win on Saturday they leapfrogged Betis, who could not go  back ahead of Quique Setien’s side as they stumbled in an Andalucian  derby.
Betis playmaker Sergio Cana­les made his comeback after  being given a reprieve from a four-game ban by court order, but it only  lasted 38 minutes.
The Spaniard was sent off for pulling down Ruben Sobrino and stopping the Cadiz forward from running through on goal.
Ruben  Alcaraz sent Cadiz ahead with a penalty and they doubled their lead  when Theo Bongonda broke away and unselfishly teed up Chris Ramos to tap  home his first goal for the club.
Betis were soon reduced to nine  men on a miserable afternoon for the hosts as Aitor Ruibal twice swung  his elbow at Fali and was dismissed.
Elsewhere, Vedat Muriqi hit a brace, including a stoppage-time penalty, to  rescue Real Mallorca a 3-3 draw at Real Valladolid.

6,Sethi backs Babar Azam as captain for now,"""We should support Babar and not make matters controversial in the interests of the national team,"" says PCB boss.","LAHORE: Pakistan Cricket Board’s interim management committee chairman Najam Sethi attempted to diffuse the prevailing discussion over Babar Azam’s all-format captaincy of the national team on Monday, stating on social media that the “status quo will remain intact” for now.
It effectively means that the sword remains hanging over Babar with Sethi stating that a final decision will be “subject to the success or failure of status quo” and that any controversy over the matter should be avoided.
Despite widespread rumours that he would be relieved of captaincy duties from one of the formats, Babar is now set to lead Pakistan in the five-match Twenty20 series at home against New Zealand which starts this week.
A five-match One-day International series against the Black Caps follows after the T20s, the result of which — according to Sethi’s statement on Twitter — could decide who leads Pakistan at the World Cup later this year.
“For months media and cricketing circles have been discussing pros and cons of retaining Babar Azam as captain in all formats of the game,” tweeted Sethi. “Since this decision is ultimately Chairman’s, I have sought views of Selection Committees headed by Shahid Afridi and now Haroon Rashid.
 






“Both Committees thought matter merited discussion but both later came to the conclusion that the status quo should be retained. I have subsequently publicly stated this position. In the final analysis my decision will be subject to the success or failure of the status quo.
“I will also be guided by what the Selectors and Director Cricket Ops and Head Coach have to say going forward. I expect they will be in the best position to advise me. Therefore we should support Babar and not make matters controversial in the interests of the national team.”
Dawn has learnt that there is a lobby in the PCB which is wishing to have a separate T20 captain for Pakistan and Sethi’s tweets came after he had stated in an interview on Sunday that the interim selection committee led by Afridi, appointed after the management committee took control of PCB affairs, wanted to replace Babar as Pakistan captain.
After Sethi’s tweets, Afridi also took to social media to state he hadn’t suggested the PCB to replace Babar.
 






“I spoke with Mr Najam Sethi who was kind enough to confirm he was not referring to me while commenting about Babar Azam’s captaincy. This has put the matter to bed,” Afridi tweeted on Monday, adding that he wished the best to Babar and the side for the New Zealand series.

7,Bayern boss Tuchel threatens City’s CL dream once more,"MANCHESTER: Manchester City and Pep Guardiola have a Champions League score to settle against Thomas Tuchel, when ...","MANCHESTER: Manchester City and Pep Guardiola have a Champions League score to settle against Thomas Tuchel, when the newly-appointed Bayern Munich boss visits the Etihad in Tuesday’s quarter-final, first leg.  
Tuchel emerged victorious as Chelsea manager in City’s first, and so far only, run to the Champions League final in 2021.  
That was also the closest Guardiola has come in 10 tries during spells at Barcelona, Bayern and City to land his third European Cup as a coach.  
Chelsea’s 1-0 win in front of largely empty Estadio do Dragao in Porto due to coronavirus restrictions two years ago was a case of the apprentice outshining the master.  
As a young coach Tuchel studied and admired Guardiola’s dominant Barcelona side that won 14 trophies in four years from 2008 to 2012, including two Champions League titles.  
Their paths then crossed during Guardiola’s three years in charge at Bayern, while Tuchel was coach of Mainz and then Borussia Dortmund.  
Two football obsessives, the pair even talked long into the night at a Munich bar in 2014, using glasses and salt and pepper shakers to mimic formations.  
Guardiola has tended to have the upper hand in clashes between the two. Three Chelsea wins in the space of six weeks towards the end of the 2020/21 season are Tuchel’s only victories in 10 meetings between the two to Guardiola’s six.  
But he won the most important one and his Champions League pedigree played a large part in Bayern’s swoop to secure his services and sack Julian Nagelsmann in a shock move last month.  
Tuchel also took Paris St Germain to their maiden final in Europe’s premier club competition in 2020 and took eventual winners Real Madrid to extra-time in the quarter-finals last year despite Chelsea being thrust into crisis by sanctions imposed on then owner Roman Abramovich.  
The 49-year-old now has the challenge of succeeding where Guardiola failed in leading Bayern back to Champions League glory.  
But the weight of expectation falls much more heavily on the City boss. In his seventh season in Manchester, Guardiola is in the running for his fifth Premier League title. Yet the failure to get over the line in Europe remains a blot on his copybook.  
When asked how much he wanted to win the Champions League title with City, Guardiola on Monday told reporters “a lot”.  
“We want to try. It is an honour to be here against an elite club in Bayern Munich. We will not take it for granted. We have to play two games. Starting tomorrow,” he added.  
“The question has been coming every single season. We try every single season. Teams you face are also good too and want to win too. My dream is to live it again. We want to try but that doesn’t mean we are going to win.”  
Guardiola is also relishing the chance to pit his wits against Tuchel.  
“[The 2021 final] was a tight game but we forget it and we try again,” Guardiola said. “Sometimes you win when you deserve to, sometimes you lose. I don’t live in the past. It’s part of the game.  
“It would have been difficult with Julian Nagelsmann and also will be difficult against Tuchel. I don’t pay that much attention, more attention on what I do with my team.”   
Tuchel’s tenure started with an impressive 4-2 win over Bundesliga title rivals Dortmund despite having only a few days to prepare but two games against Freiburg have increased the scrutiny on him. In both the 2-1 German Cup loss on Tuesday and 1-0 Bundesliga win on Saturday, Bayern lacked a cutting edge in attack.  
And if Bayern don’t play to their best against City, unflattering comparisons will be made with Nagelsmann’s assured win over Paris St Germain in the last 16 just weeks ago.  
While City can boast of the goal hunger of their top striker Erling Haaland, Bayern’s strikers seem stuck in a crisis when it comes to efficiency up front and forward Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting — their top scorer this season — will miss the first leg with a knee injury. 
“We know we have to deliver a perfect game, but games in the Champions League start from zero for both,” Tuchel said ahead of the first leg. “Efficiency is coming back to us, I am sure about that.” 
BENFICA, INTER LOOK TO REBOUND 
In Tuesday’s other tie, Inter Milan and Benfica clash with both sides looking to rebound from recent setbacks. Inter haven’t won in more than a month while Benfica are coming off a tough loss to their biggest rivals.  
The first leg is in Lisbon’s Stadium of Light, where on Friday Benfica lost 2-1 to Porto in the Portuguese top flight to dent their almost perfect season in which they have opened up a seven-point lead at the top of the table.  
On the same day, Inter were held by Salernitana to a 1-1 draw in Serie A to extend their winless run to six matches in a difficult stretch in all competitions.  
The Italians are hoping to turn their fortunes turned around in the Champions League so they can reach the last four for the first time since winning the title in 2010.  
Benfica are hoping the loss against Porto was a one-off and they can stay on track to make it past the quarter-finals for the first time since losing the final to Inter’s city rivals AC Milan in 1990. 
“Losing is part of football,” Benfica coach Roger Schmidt said on Monday. “But we had won a lot before that, and we learn from the victories and the losses. My team put that loss to Porto in the past very quickly.”

9,Rahm channels idol Ballesteros to win Masters,"AUGUSTA: Rock-steady Jon Rahm, channeling Spanish great Seve Ballesteros on his late hero’s birthday, survived a...","AUGUSTA: Rock-steady Jon Rahm, channeling Spanish great Seve Ballesteros on his late hero’s birthday, survived a marathon day and scored an emotional Masters win at Augusta National on Sunday, denying LIV Golf a watershed victory. 
Rahm, who started the day four off the lead, rallied behind a final round three-under 69 for a winning total of 12-under 276 and a decisive four-shot victory over LIV standard bearers Brooks Koepka and evergreen Phil Mickelson. 
The win was Rahm’s fourth this season, earning him a second career major to go along with his 2021 US Open title. 
He also reclaims the number one world ranking from defending champion Scottie Scheffler. 
“Never thought I was going to cry by winning a golf tournament, but I got very close on that 18th hole,” said Rahm, who becomes the fourth Spaniard to win the Masters after Ballesteros — who died of brain cancer in 2011 at age 54, Jose Maria Olazabal and Sergio Garcia. “A lot of pride, I am really proud of myself and what I did.” 
Koepka, who sat atop the leaderboard for three rounds, simply could not get in gear at the end, labouring to a three-over 75. 
Winner of three Green Jackets, 52-year-old Mickelson turned back the clock and carded the round of the day with a sensational seven-under 65 — the lowest Masters round ever for a player over 50 — to join Koepka on eight-under 280. 
Two former-Masters champions in Jordan Spieth (66) and Patrick Reed (68), along with Russell Henley (70), finished one shot further adrift in a tie for fourth. 
Coming on what would have been Ballesteros’ 66th birthday and the 40th anniversary of the Spanish talisman’s second of two Green Jacket wins, Rahm soaked up a rousing ovation as he walked up the 18th fairway with a four-stroke cushion. 
Fighting to keep his composure, the 28-year-old sealed victory with a 4-foot par putt, capping a marathon day of golf that started at sunrise and finished in the Georgia twilight. 
“History of the game is a big part of why I play and one of the reasons why I play, and Seve being one of them,” said Rahm. “For me to get it done on the 40th anniversary of his win, his birthday, on Easter Sunday, it’s incredibly meaningful. 
“To finish it off the way I did — a Seve par, it was in a testament to him, and I know he was pulling for me today. This one was for Seve. He was up there helping, and help he did.” 
Olazabal greeted Rahm with an emotional embrace just off the 18th green moments after the triumph was complete. 
“He said he hopes it’s the first of many more,” Rahm said. “We both mentioned something about Seve, and if he had given us 10 more seconds, I think we would have both ended up crying.” 
Rahm’s methodical precision shotmaking down the bogey-free back nine delivered the triumph, a contrast to his emotional mood after the victory. 
“I might have looked calm, but I was definitely nervous out there,” Rahm said. “I never panicked. I felt comfortable with my game. I never got frustrated. I never felt like anything was out of control. But there was tension out there.” 
After two days of play interrupted by lashing rain and ferocious winds that toppled trees, the field of 53 returned to the water-logged course on Sunday to complete the third round. 
Koepka, who led Rahm by four shots overnight, was ahead by two at the end of the round. 
LIV Tour tournaments are contested over 54 holes and if the action in Augusta had ended after the conclusion of the third round, Koepka would have been slipping into a Green Jacket. 
Unfortunately for Koe­pka, the majors require 72 holes to find a winner. 
By the time the two men reached the turn of the fourth round, the Spaniard now in front by two had taken charge. 
With Koepka going 22 holes without a birdie, Rahm delivered the knockout blow with back-to-back birdies at 13 and 14 to go five up with four to play. 
“Some days you have it, some days you don’t, and today wasn’t one of those,” Koepka said. “Tried to give it a run there at the end, but just wasn’t good enough.” 
While Koepka and Mickelson could not deliver victory, LIV Golf will still look at the Masters as a major success after putting three players in the top five. 
Critics of LIV Golf have branded the Saudi-backed venture as uncompetitive and little more than a sportwashing enterprise by a country eager to polish its human rights record. 
While a Green Jacket would not have put an end to the human rights questions it would have given the breakaway circuit some of the credibility and legitimacy it craves. 
“This tournament isn’t about what tour you play from,” said Mickelson. “There’s players from all over, all over the world on many different tours, and you’re bringing the best players to play against each other in the majors. That’s what it’s all about.”
