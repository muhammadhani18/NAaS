0,Govt seeks parliamentary approval for poll expenses,"Dar tables money bill in NA, Senate; claims country has averted bankruptcy","ISLAMABAD: The government on Monday tabled a money bill in both houses of parliament seeking the allocation of funds to conduct elections in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in line with the Supreme Court’s order directing polls in Punjab on May 14.
The bill, titled ‘Charge Sums for General Election (Provincial Assemblies of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) Act 2023’, was introduced by Finance Minister Ishaq Dar first in the National Assembly and then in the Senate under Article 81(e) of the Constitution, following a meeting of the cabinet, chaired by PM Shehbaz Sharif.
Presenting the three-page bill, the finance minister also delivered a speech in the National Assembly in which he, as usual, lashed out at the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government’s economic policies. Mr Dar claimed the country had successfully averted bankruptcy and now it was on its way to stability and development.
As per the Constitution, the Senate has no role in the passage of a money bill and is only required to give recommendations within 14 days. 

Dar tables money bill in NA, Senate; claims country has averted bankruptcy

These recommendations, however, are not binding upon the National Assembly. 
While passing the IMF-dictated supplementary finance bill in February, Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani had directed the house finance committee to come up with its recommendations within two days. 
However, this time, the Senate chairman has asked the committee to finalise the recommendations by April 14 (Friday).
On April 4, a three-judge bench of the SC had ordered the Election Commission of Pakistan to hold elections for the Punjab Assembly on May 14 and directed the federal government to release Rs21 billion to the ECP for the elections of the assemblies of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. 
The court had set April 10 as the deadline for the release of the amount, asking the ECP to report back to it, in case it did not receive the funds.
Federal Consolidated Fund 
Constitutional and legal experts see the government’s move to introduce the bill on the last day of the SC-set deadline as an effort to further delay the election process as the passage of the bill could take at least two weeks if the government follows the law in letter and spirit. According to them, if this bill is rejected by parliament it will be the first occasion in history that a money bill will not get parliament’s nod.
Article 81 of the Constitution, titled “Expenditure charged upon Federal Consolidated Fund”, explains the funds for which the federal government needs approval from parliament before spending them under the heads not mentioned in the finance bill, generally known as the federal budget.
Article 81(e), under which the bill has been moved, however, reads as “any other sums declared by the Constitution or by Act of [Parliament] to be so charged.”
Though under the Constitution and rules, it is incumbent upon the government to seek prior approval of the funds to be spent under “consolidated funds”, there has been a tradition that the governments seek approval for such allocations at the time of passage of the federal budget with retrospective effect.
On April 2, perhaps in anticipation of the SC verdict, the Ministry of Finance had notified that “no authority” could make or incur or commit any expenditure or create a liability against the Federal Consolidated Fund or Public Account of the federation unless it was properly authorised in the budget through a fiscal and parliamentary process.
The statement of objects and reasons attached to the bill states that the SC has directed the federal government to release Rs21bn to the ECP to hold elections in Punjab and KP “without general election of the National Assembly and provincial assemblies of Balochistan and Sindh”.
It stated that in order to ensure general elections in Punjab and KP, “it is necessary to make a law under paragraph (e) of Article 81 of the Constitution for release of sums as a charged expenditure upon the Federal Consolidated Fund”.

1,Petition seeking polls in KP hits snag,"SC office says respondents were not ‘properly’ informed, cites other procedural lapses.","ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court office on Monday returned a PTI-instituted petition seeking ele­ctions to the Khyber Pakhtun­khwa Assembly within the stipulated period of 90 days by citing reasons that respondents in the case were not informed “properly” about reasons for filing of the petition. 
On April 6, PTI secretary general Asad Umar, along with the assembly’s ex-Speaker, had moved the top court to seek polls within the 90-day period. 
The petition challenged the KP governor’s March 24 announcement as well as the ECP’s March 27 notification declaring Oct 8 as the date for elections. 
Through its April 4 judgement of fixing May 14 as the new date for elections, the apex court had allowed PTI to approach any forum as deemed appropriate for seeking relief since the matter was not adjudicated upon. 

SC office says respondents were not ‘properly’ informed, cites other procedural lapses

But the SC’s assistant registrar returned the petition by citing procedural lapses, for example the petitioner has not affixed court fee along with the plea and added some illegible pages while some other pages contained overwriting or cutting.
One of the grounds mentioned in the registrar’s objection is that the notice issued to the respondents was not properly drawn as it was not mentioned therein that for what purpose the petition was being filed nor copy of the petition was provided to the respondents. 
The Election Commission, minis­t­ries of interior, law and finance, and the governor and the chief secret­a­­ry of KP were mentioned as respondents.
The petition regretted that announcement of Oct 8 for polls was an exercise contrary to the mandate of Constitution and thus amounts to depriving the petitioners and all citizens of the province of their fundamental right to contest and participate in the elections. 
The petition emphasised that reasons given by the governor and ECP regarding unavailability of funds or law and order situation to conduct the polls being not conducive were legally flawed and a disingenuous excuse to delay the exercise since such reasons were not recognised in the Constitution. 
Giving power to the governor or ECP to delay the elections on the pretext of law and order situation would mean that elections could be delayed indefinitely and forever, which was not warranted. 
What is the assurance that security situation will improve by the arbitrary date of Oct 8, the petition wondered, fearing the postponement of elections by six months would only worsen the security situation.
The petition emphasised that maintaining law and order was the responsibility of federal and provincial governments and there could be no excuse for them to say that they could not provide required security for the date of elections or prior to it nor could the ECP rely on such a pretext to delay the election. 
Under Articles 148(3) and 220 as well as Section 50 of the Elections Act 2017, it is the responsibility of federal and provincial governments as well as all executive authorities, including the caretaker government in KP, to ensure that elections are held in 90 days regardless of any law and order situation. In fact, it is their obligation to provide the necessary security and ensure law and order, the petition maintained. 
If law and order can be made an excuse for delaying the elections then such a precedent would become a legal mandate for a caretaker government to continue to extend its tenure by insisting that it is unable to provide security for maintaining law and order for the elections and thereby continue to indefinitely extend its tenure, the petition said. 
Moreover, the so-called excuse for law and order would mean that the Constitution can always be held in abeyance on this ground every time the elections are due. 
The Constitution also does not recognise financial constraint as the reason to delay the election, the petition emphasised, adding that polls were at the core of the Constitution and fundamental to democracy without which the constitutional machinery cannot work.

2,LHC asks govt to submit Toshakhana record from 1947 to 2001,LAHORE: The Lahore High Court directed the federal government on Monday to submit the record of Toshakhana articles...,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court directed the federal government on Monday to submit the record of Toshakhana articles from 1947 to 2001, along with details of the gift-giving foreign dignitaries and countries. 
A two-judge bench, comprising Just­ice Shahid Bilal Hassan and Justice Muhammad Raza Qureshi, was hearing an intra-court appeal (ICA) filed by the government challenging a decision by a single bench that asked it to relea­­se the source of gifts from 1990 to 2023. 
At the outset, Assistant Attorney General Nasar Ahmad stated the single bench was seized with a writ petition seeking an order to declassify all information with regard to Toshakha­­na gifts recei­ved by Pakistani dignitaries and government officials from foreign states.
However, he added, the federal cabinet decided, during the petition’s pendency, to declassify the Toshakhana record from 2002 to 2023, but without disclosing the source of gifts. 
He said it was decided to keep the source secret because the federal government believed it would have an adverse effect on the country’s relations with other nations. 
Justice Qureshi asked the law officer whether the receivers of gifts declared them in their tax documents. 
Justice Hassan obser­ved that even jud­ges were bound to declare the gifts rec­e­ived in official capacity. “The representatives of the state are bound to disclose their official gifts,” the judge added. 
Record not authenticated 
The law officer said the government was not trying to hide the Toshakhana record from 1990 to 2001. The record in question was not complete and cannot be verified or authenticated as no supporting files, record or evidence for this period was available, he added. 
According to the law officer, the government was not in a position to disclose records which it cannot authenticate.
The bench, however, observed that complete and verified record was supposed to be in possession of the government. Without naming Gulf states, the government lawyer said the rulers of a particular region give costly gifts and disclosing their identities could harm the country’s foreign policy. 
Advocate Azhar Siddique, who favoured release of the record, said the government was left with no option but to release the Toshakhana details. Justice Hassan obser­ved that big guns were yet to be caught. 
The bench directed the government to submit the record from 1947 to 2001, observing that a decision would be made after hearing all sides. 
The bench issued noti­ces on the government’s appeal and adjourned the hearing to April 17. 
On March 22, Justice Asim Hafeez had ordered the federal government to release complete record of the Toshakhana articles from 1990 to 2001, along with details of the gift-giving foreign dignitaries and countries. 
The judge had observed that nothing about Toshakhana gifts can be hidden from the nation.

3,BA passes resolution on polls,QUETTA: The Balochis­tan Assembly has passed a resolution to hold elections to the National and provincial...,"QUETTA: The Balochis­tan Assembly has passed a resolution to hold elections to the National and provincial assemblies simultaneously.
The resolution was adopted on Monday in a session held under the chairmanship of Speaker Jan Muhammad Jamali.
Provincial Minister for Home and Tribal Affairs Mir Ziaullah Langove presented the resolution. He said the country was going through an economic crisis and holding multiple elections in this situation would further weaken the economy.
The resolution further said that the Constitution was a supreme document and every institution must uphold it under Article 184.
Mr Langove added that a national census was ongoing whose results were yet to be published. Holding elections without census results wouldn’t be in the national interest, he told the house.

4,"PTI asks govt to follow, not just celebrate Constitution",PTI's Ali Nawaz Awan says his party will continue its efforts to hold the elections at the earliest.,"ISLAMABAD: On the 50th anniversary of the 1973 Constitution, a PTI leader has urged the government to follow the Constitution by holding elections to two provincial assemblies within 90 days rather than celebrating it.
The PTI leader also criticised the PPP, saying the party whose founder Zulfi­qar Ali Bhutto was one of the key characters behind the framing of the Consti­tution has become a “rubber stamp” for validating unconstitutional steps.
Talking to Dawn, PTI le­­a­der Ali Nawaz Awan said the parliament passed a bill to curtail the powers of the chief justice and also approved a resolution for simultaneous polls across the country.
“If simultaneous elections can be held by a resolution why parliament passed a bill regarding the chief justice’s power and if a bill had to be passed, it means that the resolution means nothing,” he said.
Mr Awan added that if the PML-N and PPP were sincere with the Constitu­tion, they should hold the elections to Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as­­s­emblies in 90 days as mentioned in the Consti­tution.
“Otherwise they should shelve the Constitution as it has lost its sanctity.”
Replying to a question, the PTI leader said his party will continue its efforts to hold the elections at the earliest.
“The government is well aware the PTI will clean sweep the elections so it has been misinterpreting the Constitution to avoid elections,” he said.
The PTI leader also criticised the PPP, which is one of the allied parties in the federal ruling coalition.
The PPP should be the custodian of the Constitution since it was “gifted” by its founder. “But unfortunately it was acting like a rubber stamp.”
Another PTI leader, Shireen Mazari, criticised the presence of Justice Qazi Faez Isa in the event held to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Consti­tution on Monday.
 






“At National Constitu­tion Convention! Seated between [Asif Zardari] & [Ishaq] Dar! A picture speaks louder than words! I guess this is what PDM wanted to show since Raja [Pervaiz Ashraf] decides seating! It’s all abt signalling,” she tweeted, while sharing a picture from the event.

5,Imran urges IHC to throw out ‘politically motivated’ mutiny case,Petition says the govt is now dragging Imran Khan into frivolous cases to blackmail him.,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chief Imran Khan on Monday filed a petition asking the Islamabad High Court (IHC) to quash the mutiny case regis-tered against him at Ramna police station.
Separately, the former prime minister demanded an inquiry into the death of a police officer on whose complaint a case was registered for assassination attempt on his life.
IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq will conduct hearing on Tuesday (today) on the administrative objections raised by the regis-trar office on Mr Khan’s plea seeking to quash the FIR registered against him for allegedly inciting mutiny.
The petition, filed by the PTI chief’s legal team, contended that the incumbent government had lodged the case against Mr Khan for political reasons and to tarnish his reputation.
According to the petition, the government has failed to find an iota of corruption against Mr Khan and therefore, it is now dragging him into frivolous cases to blackmail him.
The petition urged the court to quash the FIR.
Meanwhile, the PTI chairman through a tweet demanded a probe into the death of the cop who was complainant in the case of an assassination attempt on his life in Wazirabad.
 






Sub-Inspector Amir Shehzad Bhadar, who was SHO of Sadar police station in Wazirabad, was home in his native village Bhadar on Sunday when his condition deteriorated.
He was taken to the Kharian Combined Military Hospital, but was pronounced dead on arrival.
“We demand a proper inquiry into the sudden death of SHO Amir Shehzad of a heart attack. He had registered the FIR of Wazirabad assassination attempt on me & was a critical witness in unearthing the conspirators behind this assassination plot being inquired into by the JIT,” Mr Khan tweeted.
“The JIT record has also been tampered with. It is equally important to recall the mysterious circumstances surrounding the death of FIA investigator Dr Rizwan as well as the deaths of Maqsood Chaprassi & all other witnesses in Shehbaz Sharif’s money laundering case,” the PTI leader wrote.

6,Simultaneous polls endorsed by Senate resolution,PTI's Dr Shehzad Waseem laments that the resolution was passed “secretly in no time” when the PTI was on a token walkout.,"ISLAMABAD: In the absence of senators belonging to the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), the Senate on Monday passed a resolution endorsing general elections of all provincial assemblies and the National Assembly simultaneously.
The house passed the resolution, which was not on the order of the day, soon after the PTI staged a token walkout from the house over the rejection of its resolution to revive the previous government’s Ehsaas Rashan Riayat Programme.
However, soon after coming to know about the development, the PTI members returned to the floor only to protest against the passage of the resolution.
At first, Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani termed the resolution “unanimous” but later he counted one vote against it after Jamaat-i-Ismali (JI) Senator Mushtaq Ahmed objected that he opposed the resolution.
“This House is of the opinion that, according to the spirit of Article 218 [of the Constitution], the general elections to all the assemblies must be held simultaneously on time under caretaker set-ups under Article 224 with a view to bring true political and economic stability to the country,” read the resolution moved by National Party Senator Tahir Bizenjo.
The resolution signed by the lawmakers of all coalition parties further said that holding separate elections to Punjab assembly will inevitably influence the outcome of general elections as the province was the largest federating unit with more than 50 per cent of the total seats  in the of lower house of the parliament.
“As such, it will trample upon the smaller provinces’ role in the Federation.”
After the house passed the resolution, JI Senator Ahmed opposed the move and said the draft has not been shared with the opposition.
Leader of the Opposition Dr Shahzad Waseem made a hard-hitting speech on the passage of the resolution, saying that a crime “has been committed on the floor of the house which is unprecedented in the parliamentary history.”
He said that resolution was passed “secretly in no time” when the PTI was on a token walkout.
Tearing down a copy of the agenda, he said that the treasury has stabled in the back of the opposition and demanded that the resolution should be put to vote again. The chair ruled that the house has already passed the resolution.

7,"Unregulated weapons trade threat to peace, warns Pakistan","""The causes of war are even more important to address than the instruments of war,"" says Pakistani envoy at UN.","UNITED NATIONS: Pakistan warned the international community on Monday that unregulated sale of weapons and military equipment was a threat to world peace. 
Speaking at a UN Security Council meeting on the need to regulate weapon sales, Pakistani representative Ambassa­dor Aamir Khan said that ultra-nationalist and hegemonic policies of some states had further complicated the situation. 
In a 2020 report to the Security Council, UN Under-Secretary-General Izumi Nakamits said the spread of almost one billion small arms and light weapons remained a major global threat. From 2010 to 2015, they contributed to some 200,000 deaths every year. 
Ms Nakamits, who is also the United Nations High Represen­tative for Disarmament, briefed the council on Monday as well. 
In a similar report, Amnesty International highlighted another key issue: reckless production, and stockpiling of weapons. The report noted that 80 per cent of the world’s weapons exports were from six countries — China, France, Germany, Russia, the UK and the United States. 
“In most cases, peace and security is threatened by the ultra-nationalist and hegemonic policies of some states, particularly those that are turbocharged by the extremist ideologies,” Ambassador Khan said. 
“These states seek to build up conventional and nuclear weapons capabilities … to threatened neighbors, impose regional hegemony, and promote great power aspirations. They also indulge in behavior that seeks to oppress their minorities, and also crush requests for self-determination.” 
Such states were emboldened by lack of global accountability and generous supply of advanced weapons and technologies from multiple sources, Ambassador Khan added. 
The Pakistani envoy said that the causes of war were even more important to address than the instruments of war. “To deal with the growing and unacceptable human cost that these weapons inflict, particularly in situations of foreign occupation and suppression of the right to self-determination, a comprehensive and integrated approach is required,” he added. 
Ambassador Khan identified illicit trade, brokering, diversion, lax regulations, and weak management of weapons stockpiles as the main factors for the easy availability of weapons. 
“Every day, innocent people, including women and children, fall victim to the murderous designs of terrorists, criminals and insurgents using these weapons,” he said. “Peacekeepers, police, and security forces bear the brunt of this in the line of duty.” 
Agreeing with the general spirit of the debate, the Pakistani envoy noted that these were major enablers of criminal violence and conflict. The nexus between organised crime, drug trafficking and the illegal arms trade adds a layer of complexity to a daunting challenge, he said. 
The UN Programme of Action, the International Tracing Instrument and the Firearms Protocol provide a normative framework to address the use, regulation, and impact of these arms. All States need to intensify efforts to fully implement these mechanisms.
