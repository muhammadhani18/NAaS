0,Remittances fall to $20.5bn,The country loses $2.5bn in the first nine months of FY23 due to an artificial exchange rate cap.,"KARACHI: Due to the Ramazan factor, the remittances sent by overseas Pakistani workers grew 27.4 per cent month-on-month in March, but the country lost $2.5 billion in the first nine months of FY23 due to an artificial exchange rate cap.
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) reported on Monday that remittances rose to $2.5bn in March against $1.9bn in February. However, the inflows dipped 10.71pc when compared with the $2.8bn the country received in March last year.
Bankers and currency dealers were expecting higher remittances as overseas Pakistanis used to remit more in the holy month for their families and also for charity purposes including Zakat. Currency dealers said remittances usually increase in the range of 15 to 20pc during the fasting month.
“With the cumulative inflow of $20.5bn during the first nine months of FY23, the remittances recorded a decline of $2.491bn when compared with $23.018bn remitted during the same period last year,” the central bank data showed.

Inflows witnessed 27pc growth in March due to Ramazan factor

However, the most significant part of the data was a 10.8pc or $2.5bn decline in remittances during the July-March period of the current fiscal year, while the country’s economic managers are struggling to revive the $7bn International Monetary Fund programme for securing the release of $1.1bn tranche.
The government has met all the prior conditions, but IMF is still not ready to release the tranche. The Fund now wants written assurances from friendly countries for financing Pakistan’s external debt repayment gap for FY23.
On Thursday, Minister of State for Finance & Revenue Dr Aisha Ghaus Pasha announced that Saudi Arabia had conveyed its commitment to the IMF for its bilateral financial support to Pakistan.
She hoped similar assurances from the UAE or some other source would help reach a staff-level agreement (SLA) with the Fund which would unlock multilateral disbursements.
The currency experts had been warning the government to remove the unreal dollar cap as the grey market was offering Rs30-40 per dollar higher prices than the interbank and open markets rates. The financial market believes this wide rate gap encouraged the diversion of $2.5bn remittances to illegal channels.
The government finally uncapped the exchange rate at the end of January which appreciated the dollar abnormally high against PKR but the inflows of both the remittances and export proceeds increased substantially since then.
The highest decline in remittances was noted from Saudi Arabia as it fell by $918m (15.7pc) to $4.910bn during the July-March period against $5.828bn in the same period last fiscal year.
Except for the United States, the remittances from all destinations declined during the period under review. The inflows from the US increased by 3.2pc to $2.28bn.
Overseas Pakistanis based in UAE and UK remitted $3.604bn and $3.053bn, posting a decline of 16pc and 4.4pc respectively. Despite a decline of 9.5pc, Pakistan received $2.417bn from GCC countries.
The inflows from the EU countries declined by 6.9pc to $2.334bn but the inflows during the last 5 years have been increasing from EU countries.

1,SHC grants stay against Tri-Star Power takeover,Says the status quo be maintained with respect to the attempt by a Turkish investor to buy more than 51pc shares and control of Tri-Star Power.,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court has ordered that the status quo be maintained with respect to the attempt by a Turkish investor to buy more than 51 per cent shares and control of Tri-Star Power Ltd, a publicly listed electricity producer.
The power producer said on Monday the court order follows the suit it filed for a permanent injunction against Aykut Calikusu — a high net-worth individual from Turkey with core expertise in e-commerce and the sale of locally sourced products in the Gulf — on the grounds that he was acting “in concert with others” and was “illegally accumulating” shareholding while indulging in share price manipulation.
Tri-Star Power generates and distributes electricity on a rental basis to customers belonging to the same industrial group through a 10-megawatt plant installed on the premises of Image Pakistan in SITE, Karachi.
A person involved in the transaction from the side of the potential buyer alleged the company’s management was “stonewalling” the takeover attempt in violation of the regulations.
The Turkish investor formally approached the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) on March 20 against the target company for not providing the “relevant and material information” required for due diligence.
In a subsequent correspondence, seen by Dawn, the apex regulator told the local power company on April 4 to “ensure meticulous compliance” with the takeover regulations and provide the potential acquirer with material information for due diligence.
Dawn tried to reach out to the management of Tri-Star Power, but there was no response on the company’s official phone number.
The Turkish investor issued its intention to buy majority shares of Tri-Star Power on March 9. Within a week, the target company alleged that the potential acquirer was causing “undue movement” in the share price.
The power producer said its share price witnessed an increase of 531pc in eight months, which reflected the “manipulation by the acquirer either directly or indirectly through the persons acting in concert”.
It said the share price saw a “continuous declining trend” after the public announcement of intention. “The proposed acquirer is not a shareholder of the target company. He is a Turkish citizen… and does not even have an account with CDC (Central Depository Company),” it added.
The company further alleged that the acquirer has neither the means nor the net worth to undertake such a transaction and is “merely acting as a frontman on behalf of others in order to bypass the regulations”.
The actual power production by the power plant is undeterminable because it generates electricity on demand. Before July 1, 2021, the company charged its electricity buyer on a per-unit basis.

2,Debt crunch  looms for weaker economies,WASHINGTON: A combination of sticky high interest rates and lacklustre global growth could push a number of emerging...,"WASHINGTON: A combination of sticky high interest rates and lacklustre global growth could push a number of emerging economies that are facing soaring refinancing needs into debt difficulties next year.  
Many weaker economies navigated the fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine with financing aid from multilateral and bilateral lenders. 
But repayments on emerging markets’ high-yield international bonds will total $30 billion in 2024, a steep increase compared to the $8.4bn left for the remainder of this year. This adds a layer of complexity to more vulnerable countries if some issuers can’t refinance their debt soon.  
“A more prolonged period without market access would be of more concern for the lower-rated tiers of the emerging markets sovereign universe,” said James Wilson, EM sovereign strategist for ING.  
How to mitigate the threat of severe debt distress for more vulnerable emerging economies will be a key topic in Washington, where policy makers and asset managers are meeting for the World Bank/IMF Spring Meetings this week.  
Tapping international debt markets hasn’t been a problem across the board for emerging economies. Sovereign issuance has hit a record high so far this year, although that bond sale bonanza has been driven by higher rated sovereigns.  
Meanwhile, countries such as Tunisia, Kenya and Pakistan “would need to find alternative sources of financing if the market doesn’t re-open for them,” said Thys Louw, portfolio manager for the emerging markets hard currency debt strategy at Ninety One, in London.  
Investors are concerned over refinancing risks for Kenya’s $2 billion bond maturing in June 2024, said Merveille Paja, EEMEA sovereign credit strategist for BofA.  
“The market expects more solutions to be delivered, either the IMF’s resilience and sustainability trust or $1 billion external issuance or syndication loan,” Paja said.  
The resilience and sustainability trust, approved a year ago, is a lending facility for climate and pandemic preparedness for low-income and some middle-income nations.  
Tunisia’s debt crunch comes even earlier than Kenya’s: a 500-million-euro overseas bond matures in October and another 850m euros are due in February. Ratings agency Fitch sees a default as a “real possibility” for the CCC rated country.  
The nation reached in October a staff-level agreement for a $1.9bn bailout with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), though Tunisia’s President Kais Saied recently gave his clearest rejection yet of the terms of the stalled programme.  
Ethiopia, which is currently negotiating a financing programme with the IMF, has a $1bn eurobond issue coming due in 2024. Investors are already offering to extend maturities.  
Sri Lanka, Zambia and Ghana have already defaulted on their overseas debt and are working towards debt reworks with creditors, albeit slowly. Bahrain has limited reserves and large refinancing needs, but “strong support from peers such as Saudi Arabia mitigates some of this risk”, according to an ING report.  
Global risks 
“In Tunisia and Pakistan, the finalisation of the IMF programme will be an important step to avoiding a default as that would unlock bilateral and multilateral financing,” added Louw.  
Pakistan’s refinancing needs for 2024 stand at 12 per cent of its international reserves.  
The JPMorgan’s emerging markets bond index (EMBI) for high yield debt is at 900 basis points over US Treasuries, and has largely remained over 800bps since the beginning of last year.  
“The spread movements during the pandemic were massive, but retreated very quickly. The Russia conflict and then the Fed hiking cycle led to higher spreads for a much longer period,” said Gregory Smith, emerging markets fund manager at London-based M&G Investment.

3,Trade and industry warn of unsustainable financial burden,FPCCI president says  the private sector in Pakistan is under enormous distress and its investments have dried up consistently.,"KARACHI: The export-oriented businesses of Pakistan are unlikely to sustain the burden of additional billions of rupees amid the withdrawal of subsidised electricity, restricted imports, all-time high-interest rates, and the rupee’s devaluation against the US dollar.
President Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), Irfan Iqbal Sheikh said the private sector in Pakistan is under enormous distress and its investments have dried up consistently.
He said businessmen’s confidence in the government policies and its handling of the IMF programme has come to a standstill, adding that the businessmen have never witnessed such inconveniences in doing business in the history of Pakistan.
He asked the government what steps would be taken after the resumption of the IMF programme to stabilise the economy and how and when the government would take the business community into confidence on these steps.
Mr Iqbal said increasing the revenue collection target from Rs7,004bn to Rs8,709bn on the directives of IMF would further tax the already taxed people instead of simplifying the taxation system, which would then affect businessmen’s profitability and decrease the employment opportunities.
Meanwhile, Businessmen Group (BMG) chairman Zubair Motiwala and SITE Association of Industry president Riaz Uddin on Monday condemned the government for withdrawing the subsidised electricity tariff of Rs19.99 from March 1 for the export-oriented sectors on the directives of IMF.
“Unfortunately, this abrupt tariff hike is also backed by National Electric Power Regulatory Authority. The Regionally Competitive Energy Tariff (RCET) has almost doubled depending on the export sector,” they said while jointly addressing a very large gathering of affected SMEs situated in the SITE area.
Nepra on March 10 endorsed the decision of the federal government to withdraw subsidised rate of electricity for the export-oriented industry, rendering Pakistan’s exports uncompetitive on the world markets.
They said that this act of the government is detrimental to exporters as most of the affected SMEs are indirect exporters and are closely weaved into the entire supply chain of exporting industries.
Mr Motiwala further said that in such difficult times when the nation is in dire need of fetching foreign exchange, this anti-competition move would further plague the local exporting industries, resulting in a further drop of exports which stood at $32bn in 2021-22 and are expected to go down to $27bn-28bn during FY23.
The gathering of more than 150 factory owners, employing more than 100,000 workers unanimously demanded the resumption of RCET in line with the earlier decision of the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) back in October 2022.
Mr Riaz Uddin said the future course of action would be decided after Eidul Fitr.
The government is not realising the gravity of the situation regarding raw material shortage due to import restrictions, which has already rendered the closure of many industries, he added.
The SITE chief said the confidence of foreign buyers has shaken as they’re looking towards other countries amid Pakistani suppliers’ inability to ensure timely shipments.

4,Dollar makes gain against rupee,Depressed market sentiment is another key reason for the day-to-day depreciation.,"KARACHI: The US dollar appreciated by Rs2.44 to Rs287.09 against the rupee in the interbank market on Monday.
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) reported the dollar settled at Rs287.07 while the exchange companies quoted the closing price at Rs289.10 for the interbank market.
The market remained normal with continued stress for importers to open letters of credit. However, the fluctuations in the exchange rate were due to news about the IMF -- sometimes positive and sometimes negative. Currency dealers in interbank and open markets hardly trust the government statements that the IMF is about to release the $1.1 billion tranche.
Depressed market sentiment is another key reason for the day-to-day depreciation. The local currency has lost 54pc of its value against the US dollar since the start of FY23, sharply squeezing purchasing power of consumers amid unprecedented inflation of 35.4pc.
The open market reported the dollar price at Rs289.10 compared to Rs286.50 the previous day.
