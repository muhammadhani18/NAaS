0,ECP seeks changes to elections law to save ‘eroding writ’,"CEC asks NA speaker, Senate chairman to end president’s role in setting poll date; blames ""judicial overbearing"" for hampering commission’s work.","ISLAMABAD: Raising alarm over judicial overbearing diluting its writ, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has proposed legislation to do away with president’s role in determining date for general polls.
Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja has written letters to National Assembly Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf and Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani, proposing amendments to Sections 57 (1) and 58 of the Elections Act, 2017, sources told Dawn.
Letters on similar lines, signed by ECP Secretary Omar Hamid Khan, were also sent to the principal secretary to the prime minister and secretary for parliamentary affairs.
Under the proposed amendments, the ECP wants its power back to announce and alter election schedule at any stage without any intervention by a third party.
 
 

“Section 11 of the original (peoples’ representation) Act of 1976 empowered the Commission to announce poll date unilaterally without any trace of intervention by a third party. The Section was amended through Ordinance No. 11 of 1985 (12.1.1985) with the sole object to create the role of the President to hold the elections at the whims of one man,” say the identical letters, seen by Dawn.

“The role of the president to appoint a date for poll in case of dissolution of the National Assembly on the advice of the prime minister or the dissolution of the National Assembly on expiry of the term, is not supported by any constitutional provision,” one of the letters points out.
Amendment to Section 11 of ROPA 1976 introduced in 1985 was subsequently replicated in Section 57 of the Elections Act, 2017. Therefore, Section 57(1) of the Act to the extent of role of the president to announce poll date is against the spirit of the constitution and ultra vires of proviso of Article 222, as it has abridged and taken away the ECP powers mandated under Article 218(3) and 219. It said supplanting the amendments resulted in dilution of the authority of the constitutional mandate vested in the ECP on account of Article 218(3).
It mentions that the Supreme Court, while interpreting Article 224(2), held that the conduct of general elections within 90 days was a constitutional imperative.
“It is settled and trite law that Constitution shall be read as a whole document for harmonious interpretation and no provision should be read in isolation, lest it may result in redundancy of some other important provision of the Constitution. However, due weightage has not been given to another constitutional imperative provided in Article 218(3) which, if not implemented in letter and spirit, may result in abnegation of the standards set under it,” it says.
The CEC said conduct of election was dependent upon the necessary arrangements to be made by the ECP to ensure that the standards of honesty, justness, fairness provided in Article 218(3) are met.
ECP writ
The CEC noted the March 1 and April 5 judgements divested the ECP of its constitutional powers to determine as to whether conducive environment in fact and circumstances, existed for the conduct of elections in a given time, to meet the standards mentioned in Article 218(3) in letter and spirit.
He argued that the writ of the ECP had systematically been challenged on several occasions. “In practice, ECP’s authority has been eroded,” he remarked.
He cited the examples of the case involving mysterious disappearance of 20 presiding officers during Daska by-polls in February 2021 and the contempt proceedings initiated by the ECP against PTI leaders and suspension of its orders by high courts, effectively binding ECP’s hands in the face of brazen attacks. The ECP writ was compromised severely, he added.
Currently, when Punjab elections were around the corner and civil servants have been appointed as district returning officers, returning officers and assistant returning officers, why they would look up to the ECP in such circumstances, the CEC wondered.
“There are many other such incidents of judicial overbearing, which have diluted the writ of the ECP. In such a situation where the ECP writ has been time and again perceptibly compromised, the question arises whether the ECP can perform its bedrock duty to conduct free, fair, and transparent elections to the best of its ability in the given environment.”

1,$163m okayed to support Haj pilgrims via regular scheme,Applicants of the sponsorship scheme are required to deposit their full Haj dues in US dollars.,"ISLAMABAD: The Economic Cooperation Committee (ECC) of the cabinet on Monday approved a $163 million additional foreign exchange financing requirement for the transfer of 28,679 intending pilgrims to the regular scheme from the sponsorship one.
As such, the ECC meeting, presided over by Finance Minister Ishaq Dar, “decided that all received applications under regular haj scheme i.e. 72,869 shall be declared successful without balloting”, according to an official statement.
The ECC was given a rundown by the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony on arrangements and modalities for the Haj Scheme-2023. It said Saudi Arabia had allocated a Haj quota of 179,210 pilgrims and the cabinet had decided on March 9 to distribute this between government and private Haj schemes at a 50:50 ratio, and 50pc quota of each scheme shall be filled through sponsorship for which Haj dues were required to be remitted in US dollars from abroad.
The sponsorship scheme of 89,605 was expected to secure $194m out of the total required $284m. Thus, the ECC and the cabinet approved last month that the finance division will provide the remaining $90m foreign exchange cover for Haj-2023.
Accordingly, applications for both regular and sponsorship schemes were invited on March 16 with the deadline of March 31. The regular scheme attracted 72,869 applications against the quota allocation for 44,190 seats. The last date for the sponsorship scheme was extended till April 7, and the religious affairs ministry expected just up to 8,000 applications against 44,190 seats.
At the time of submission of the Haj Policy-2023 to the ECC and the cabinet, it was assumed that the sponsorship scheme will be fully utilised and will secure $194m. Applicants of the sponsorship scheme are required to deposit their full Haj dues in US dollars out of which airfare and service charges are paid in Pak rupees.
In this way, the sponsorship scheme was expected to secure foreign exchange cover for the regular scheme also to a large extent.
In the changed situation, the ministries of religious affairs and finance decided that the remaining quota of the sponsorship scheme be shifted to the regular scheme and thereby all the applicants i.e. 72,869 (against 44,190 seats) be declared successful without balloting. Resultantly, 28,679 seats of the sponsorship scheme are required to be utilised through the regular scheme.
Therefore, the foreign exchange required to cover the regular scheme increased to $213m of which $50m had already been disbursed, hence the approval for $163m additional foreign exchange cover.
The meeting also noted that the unutilised government Haj quota after the diversion of 28,679 applications into the regular scheme and collection of the sponsorship scheme will be either given to the private scheme or returned to Saudi Arabia, and in both cases, it will not generate additional demand for foreign exchange, the meeting was told.

2,Bank worker shoots dead 4 colleagues in Kentucky,KENTUCKY: A bank employee armed with a rifle shot dead four colleagues and wounded nine other people at his bank on...,"KENTUCKY: A bank employee armed with a rifle shot dead four colleagues and wounded nine other people at his bank on Monday while livestreaming the attack in downtown Louisville, Kentucky, city officials said.
The shooter was fatally shot at the scene, the Louisville Metro Police Department said, but it was unclear whether from police gunfire or a self-inflicted wound.
The department identified the shooter as Connor Stu­rgeon, 23, who joined the downtown branch of Old National Bank as a full-time employee last year.
Police said they responded within minutes to reports of an attacker at about 8:30am (1230 GMT) at the bank office near Slugger Field baseball stadium. Officers fired at the shooter, who was armed with a rifle, police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel told reporters. The attacker broadcast live video of his attack over the internet, she said.
Police identified the dead as Joshua Barrick, 40; Thomas Elliot, 63; Juliana Farmer, 45; and James Tutt, 64. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, on the verge of tears, said during a news briefing that he knew some of the victims, including Elliot, a senior vice president at the bank.
Imam stabbed
An imam was stabbed during Fajr prayers at a mosque in Paterson, New Jersey, according to local officials. The imam, however, is now in a stable condition and under treatment at a hospital.
Omar Mosque spokesperson Abdul Hamdan told CNN that the suspect, who was unknown to congregants prior to the Sunday’s incident, was performing prayers and “lunged forward with a knife and stabbed Imam Sayed Elnakib multiple times — at least twice”.
The suspect attempted to flee from the mosque, but congregants “were able to apprehend him and hold him” until police arrived and arrested him, he said.

3,US hunts for source of classified intel leak,"WASHINGTON: Classified documents that appeared online, with details ranging from Ukraine’s air defenses to...","WASHINGTON: Classified documents that appeared online, with details ranging from Ukraine’s air defenses to Israel’s Mossad spy agency, have US officials scrambling to identify the leak’s source, with some experts saying it could be an American.
Officials say the breadth of topics addressed in the documents, which touch on the war in Ukraine, China, the Middle East and Africa, suggest they may have been leaked by an American rather than an ally.
“The focus now is on this being a US leak, as many of the documents were only in US hands,” Michael Mulroy, a former senior Pentagon official, told Reuters.
US officials said the investigation is in its early stages and those running it have not ruled out the possibility that pro-Russian elements were behind the leak, which is seen as one of the most serious security breaches since more than 700,000 documents, videos and diplomatic cables appeared on the WikiLeaks website in 2013.
In response, the Kremlin said on Monday that there was a general tendency to always blame Russia for everything when asked about accusations that Moscow may have been behind a leak of US intelligence documents about a number of countries, including Ukraine .
When asked about allegations that Russia may have been responsible, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters: “I cannot comment on this in any way. You and I know that there is in fact a tendency to always blame everything on Russia. It is, in general, a disease.”
Asked about the idea that Washington had spied on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Peskov, who called the leaks “quite interesting”, said that could not be ruled out. “But the fact that the United States has been spying on various heads of state, especially in European capitals, for a long time now, has come up repeatedly, causing various scandalous situations,” he said.
Following disclosure of the leak, Reuters has reviewed more than 50 documents labeled “Secret” and “Top Secret” that first appeared last month on social media websites, beginning with Discord and 4Chan. While some of the documents were posted weeks ago, their existence was first reported on Friday by the New York Times.
Reuters has not independently verified the authenticity of the documents. Some giving battlefield casualty estimates from Ukraine appeared to have been altered to minimize Russian losses. It is not clear why at least one is marked unclassified but includes top secret information. Some documents are marked “NOFORN,” meaning they cannot be released to foreign nationals.
Two US officials told Reuters on Sunday that they have not ruled out that the documents may have been doctored to mislead investigators as to their origin or to disseminate false information that may harm US security interests.
The White House referred questions to the Pentagon, which said in a statement on Sunday it was reviewing the validity of the photographed documents.

4,"Google stops lending apps from accessing contacts, photos","“We are introducing additional requirements for personal loan apps targeting users in Pakistan,” says Google.","ISLAMABAD: Google has restricted personal loan apps from accessing contacts or photos of their users in Pakistan.
In its April 2023 policy update, the platform mandated the apps in Pakistan to submit country-specific licensing documents to prove their ability to provide personal loans.
Google said it was updating the “Personal Loans Policy” to stop the apps from accessing users’ contacts or photos. “We are introducing additional requirements for personal loan apps targeting users in Pakistan,” Google said in a statement.
Pakistan is the sixth country after India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Nigeria and Kenya, for which Google has introduced additional requirements for digital lending apps.
Pakistan has been included in the policy update by Google after a series of meetings with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) — the regulator of the corporate sector.
The SECP has received several complaints against registered as well as non-registered lending apps, indulging in exploitative and coercive practices, including blackmailing their customers. The SECP has also taken steps against non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) that have launched their digital apps, restricting each NBFC to publish only one lending app.
Responding to the query over the steps taken by the SECP against illegal and unregistered lending apps, a senior commission official said three lenders have already furnished their Cyber Security Audit Reports, along with certificates issued by PTA-approved audit firms, signifying their commitment to safeguarding customer’s data.
The official added that apart from the policy framework, consultations have been held with Google, Apple, mobile wallet and telecom service providers to take down apps operating from outside Pakistan.
Digital lending platforms have witnessed a spurt of growth in recent years. Currently, there are around 10 licensed NBFCs and only three digital lending apps, while around 30-40 unlicensed apps are operating from outside Pakistan.

5,Ruling reserved on move to withdraw plea against Justice Isa,Curative review petition argues April 2021 SC majority decision shut doors of judicial accountability.,"ISLAMABAD: Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial on Monday reserved during a chamber hearing his ruling on federal government’s request to withdraw the curative review petition that the PTI government had moved before the Supreme Court against Justice Qazi Faez Isa.
In his docket, the CJP had a set of 12 different applications concerning the curative review, pending before the SC.
Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan, after attending the chamber hearing, told reporters that the CJP had reserved ruling on the matter. He explained that the previous government on July 8, 2021, had instituted a chamber appeal after the registrar office returned the curative review plea in Justice Isa’s case.
The former PTI government had pleaded before the SC that its April 26, 2021 majority judgement in the Justice Isa review case should not be left in the field for allegedly being unjust. The SC on April 26, 2021 by a majority of six to four overturned its 2020 decision to order investigation by tax authorities into the properties of Justice Isa’s children and wife.

Curative review petition argues April 2021 SC majority decision shut doors of judicial accountability

The curative appeal was moved on behalf of President Dr Arif Alvi, former prime minister Imran Khan, former law minister Dr Farogh Naseem and law secretary.
After the chamber hearing, the AGP told reporters that the coalition government in its application informed the SC that it was not interested in pursuing the chamber appeal instituted by the previous government. If the CJP accepted the application, the registrar’s objection to the PTI government’s curative review plea against Justice Isa would sustain.
 
 

Last month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had decided not to pursue the curative review and to withdraw the same from the SC.
Similarly, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar had made a public statement suggesting taking back the curative review petition, which his predecessor Dr Farogh Naseem had moved against Justice Isa.
When asked about his arguments, the AGP told the reporters that he contended before the CJP that neither any law nor the constitution of Pakistan envisaged any remedy to the aggrieved party after final judgement and dismissal of review petition under the curative review. He explained this concept was devised in India through a (Rupa Ashok Hurra case) judgement in 2002 after which the Indian Supreme Court made amendments to its rules to provide relief under curative review.
However, in Pakistan, the then CJP Saqib Nisar had ruled in the judges’ pension case that if a court judgement was per incuriam or given without due regard of the law then the SC could correct the same through another review petition.
According to the curative review plea, moved by the PTI government, the April 26 majority judgement of the top court had closed the doors of judicial accountability in general and the accountability of Justice Isa in particular regarding the information which had emerged and placed on record. The curative review plea stated the April 26 majority decision was against the principles of judicial independence and fundamental rights.
It diluted the standards of judicial accountability rather a shield was provided to judges to evade accountability, the appeal argued. The decision also failed to emphasise that the assets and finances of close relatives of public servants, officials, judges, qazis, etc, such as their spouses and dependent children were also required to be explained, it further argued.

6,"Reference filed in SJC against CJP, three SC judges","Complaint alleges judicial misconduct on part of CJP Bandial, Justice Akhtar, Justice Naqvi and Justice Ahsan.","ISLAMABAD: Sardar Salman Ahmad Dogar, a lawyer, moved a reference on Monday before the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) against the chief justice of Pakistan and three other judges of the Supreme Court.
The complaint alleged judicial misconduct on the part of Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial, Justice Ijazul Ahsan, Justice Munib Akhtar, and Justice Syed Mazahar Ali Naqvi. The complainant based his reference on alleged violation of the Code of Conduct for judges of the superior judiciary issued by the SJC on Sept 2, 2009.
 
 

The complainant alleged that the four judges were in violation of Articles III, IV, V, VI and IX of the code of conduct. These relate to keeping a judge’s conduct on all occasions, official and private, free from impropriety; enshrining the rule against bias and conflict of interest, either direct or indirect; ensuring that justice is not only done, but is also seen to be done; counselling against engaging in public controversy, least of all on a political question; employing the influence of a judge’s position to gain undue advantage, whether immediate or future, and maintenance of harmony within his own court, as well as among all courts and for integrity of the institution of justice.
The complainant alleged that the CJP was engaged in “arbitrary elevation” of judges to the Supreme Court in violation of the seniority principle.
He proposed an alternative composition of SJC to investigate this judicial reference as, according to him, no judge can be part of a bench which is hearing a reference against himself. The complainant has sought removal of the four judges from their offices by the president after an inquiry by the SJC.
The inquiry should be made on grounds of alleged misconduct, as purported by the complainant. Since the Supreme Judicial Council is the only forum that can inquire into the conduct of judges of the superior judiciary, its jurisdiction has been invoked in this case.
