3,"ECP, Punjab caretaker govt served notices on ‘blanket powers’",LHC's Justice Anwaar Hussain directs law officer to seek instructions from respondents and submit their replies by next hearing.,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Monday issued notices to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and the caretaker government of Punjab on a petition of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) challenging ‘blanket’ powers of the latter to make transfers and postings of the officers in the province.
Justice Anwaar Hussain heard the petition of the PTI and directed a law officer to seek instructions from the respondents and submit their replies by the next hearing.
The petition was filed by PTI senior vice president Fawad Chaudhry.
His counsel Mobeenuddin Qazi argued that large-scale transfers/postings by the caretaker government were being mechanically approved by the ECP without checking them in view of the provisions of Section 230 of the Elections Act 2017. He said the transfer orders, in several cases, had been issued by the caretaker government without even bothering to obtain prior approval of the ECP. 
The illegal exercise is going on despite the fact that in several cases, the high court has suspended such unwarranted transfer orders, the petition adds.
The counsel asked the court to set aside the impugned notification of the ECP issued on March 10 whereby it had granted the blanket permission to the caretaker government to transfer, post and appoint officers in the province without seeking a prior approval of the commission.
BY-ELECTION: The LHC issued notices on the petitions by two PTI leaders to stay the by-election being held in two constituencies of the National Assembly in Punjab.
Former federal ministers Farrukh Habib and retired Brig Ijaz Shah challenged the by-polls in NA-108 of Faisalabad and NA-118 of Nankana Sahib through two separate petitions.
The petitioners’ counsel, Azhar Siddique, argued before the court that the by-polls could not be held in a constituency if there was less than 120 days in the conduct of general election of the National Assembly. He asked the court to restrain the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) from holding the by-poll in the two constituencies since less than 120 days were left in the upcoming general election.
Justice Shahid Karim issued notices to the ECP for submission of its replies to the petitions by April 12.

4,Lahore court displeased with absence of Buzdar in NAB case,"Zartaj Gul, ex-CM skip appearance before ACE.","LAHORE: An accountability court on Monday expressed its displeasure over the absence of former chief minister Usman Buzdar in hearing of his interim pre-arrest bail in an inquiry of illegal assets and misuse of authority by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB).
Neither Buzdar nor his counsel appeared before the court as Presiding Judge Sajjad Sheikh resumed hearing on the bail petition.
However, an associate of the counsel told the court that Buzdar tested positive for Covid-19.
Questioning the veracity of the lawyer’s claim, the judge said former chief minister Buzdar submitted a medical certificate of a hospital of Dera Ghazi Khan which he had himself inaugurated.

Zartaj Gul, ex-CM skip appearance before ACE

The judge observed that the same report of Covid-19 was submitted at the last hearing.
He hinted at constituting a medical board to examine the health of Buzdar.
A prosecutor told the court that the former chief minister had not so far answered a questionnaire issued by the NAB.
With a last warning, the judge allowed an application of Buzdar for one-time exemption from personal appearance and extended his pre-arrest bail till April 24.
In his bail petition, Buzdar through his counsel submitted that the NAB with a mala fide intention and in connivance with the incumbent federal government had been politically victimising him. He said all the allegations against him were baseless.
Meanwhile, former federal minister Zartaj Gul and former chief minister Usman Buzdar did not appear before the Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) on Monday in different corruption probes and sought more time to record their statements.
According to the ACE, Zartaj Gul has been accused of taking commission in the development works of her constituency.
“Zartaj Gul and her husband Humayun Akhund used to take 10 per cent commission on providing funds for development schemes,” it said and also sought records of Community Development Programme schemes.  
Ms Gul requested the ACE through her counsel to appear before it on coming Thursday.
Buzdar is accused of constructing a 50km long road from Bharathi to Khar Buzdar in Taunsa at a cost of Rs700 million. 
“Mr Buzdar committed corruption with the alleged connivance of highway department officers and contractors,” it said.  
Buzdar’slawyer told the ACE that his client had Covid and he would appear after recovery.

Mr Azhar told reporters that election expenditures to the tune of Rs20 billion were just 0.001 per cent of the current fiscal expenditures of the federal and provincial governments in the country.
He said this Rs20 billion in expenditures could be reflected in the charged expenditures or the Election Commission of Pakistan expenses under Article 81-C.  
“No voting in parliament is required for the grant of funds under both heads,” he added.
Mr Azhar said the Constitution is linked to democracy. “As the PDM coalition partners’ previous tactics have failed, this tactic to attempt to delay elections would fail too,” he said, adding he believed that general elections in Punjab would be held on May 14.  
He said the incumbent rulers were busy protecting the autonomy of the two families while conspiring against the Constitution. He said the rulers were also making state institutions like the judiciary, ECP, FIA and NAB controversial.

6,Security agency officer booked for ‘harassing’ woman,The suspect was driving an online cab.,"LAHORE: Toba Tek Singh police have registered a case against a junior officer of a national security agency for harassing a woman passenger after he was handed over to them by the National Highway and Motorway Police (NH&MP).
According to police, a software engineer by profession, the complainant woman had booked a ride from Lahore to Multan through an online service on Sunday night at 11pm.
The driver of the online cab, who picked her up from the given location in the Punjab Cooperative Housing Society, Lahore, turned out to be a junior officer of a national security agency, the police said.
Faisalabad Regional Police Officer (RPO) Dr Mohammad Abid confirmed  to Dawn about the incident and that the cab driver was a junior officer of a national  security agency.

The suspect was driving online cab

The RPO said Toba Tek Singh police have lodged a  First Information Report (FIR) against the cab driver on the complaint of  the woman.
According to the written complaint submitted by the woman, after picking her from Lahore the driver took the Lahore-Islamabad Motorway without informing her.
She said that after covering some distance, the driver asked her to drive the cab as he was not feeling well.
However, when she accepted his request and began to drive, he started making her video without her permission, she added.
She said on reaching Bhera, she realised that they were on way to Islamabad and not Multan.
On her protest, however, the driver turned the car back to Lahore.
She alleged that during the journey, the driver made two harassment attempts – one in a rest
area on the Lahore-Islamabad motorway and another at a deserted patch on the Lahore-Multan motorway, but she turned him away on both occasions by offering resistance.
Following the two harassment attempts, she said that she called on motorway police emergency
helpline 130.
On her call, she said, a team of motorway police reached the spot and during inquiries the driver disclosed that he was an officer of a national security agency from Sialkot. However, she said the NH&MP officials took the driver into custody and handed him over to the Toba Tek Singh police.
The NH&MP officials confirmed the complainant’s account, saying they  responded to her emergency call at 7:45am and took the  suspect into custody near TT Singh interchange.
A police official, seeking anonymity, said it was yet to be investigated that despite being a security agency officer, why the suspect was working as an online cab driver and traveled all the way from Sialkot to Lahore to pick the complainant.

7,HRW criticises high-handedness of Ruda for evicting farmers,LAHORE: Human Rights Watch (HRW) has criticised the government for forcibly evicting thousands of farmers near ...,"LAHORE: Human Rights Watch (HRW) has criticised the government for forcibly evicting thousands of farmers near Lahore for a massive infrastructure project called the Ravi Riverfront Urban Development Project and urged the authorities to enforce environmental protections and reform colonial-era laws that grant the government broad powers to acquire land for private as well as public use.
The Ravi Riverfront Urban Development Project was begun in August 2020 by then-prime minister, Imran Khan, who claimed it would address Lahore’s many problems—pollution, sewage, water, housing, and employment—while reviving its “lost glory.” The Rs5 trillion government project, covering more than 100,000 acres along the Ravi River in Punjab province, is among the largest infrastructure projects in Pakistan. 
“The Punjab provincial authorities have harassed and threatened area farmers to deprive them of their homes and livelihoods,” said Patricia Gossman, associate Asia director at Human Rights Watch, in a statement on Monday.
“The authorities need to ensure that government projects minimize displacement and loss of income, but also minimize environmental harm and flooding risks.”
To advance the project, the government has acted on behalf of private developers to acquire the necessary property, 85 percent of which is agricultural land occupied by nearly one million farmers, labourers, and business owners. 
The international rights body says affected farmers who have challenged the legality of the land seizures have faced intimidation and criminal charges brought by the Ravi Urban Development Authority (Ruda), provincial authorities, and project developers, even as these legal challenges remain pending in court.
Environmental groups have raised concerns that the project’s proposed changes to the flow of the Ravi River could significantly increase the risks of flooding. Pakistan’s Sindh province experienced catastrophic floods in mid-2022. 
“Between February 1 and March 1, 2023, Human Rights Watch spoke to 14 farmers who said they had been evicted or threatened with eviction in Lahore since August 2020, as well as 8 lawyers, environmental rights activists, and journalists,” said Gossman. 
Since 2020, according to her, the authorities have criminally charged more than 100 farmers with resisting or refusing to hand over the land they occupied. Accounts by farmers along with corroborating photos and video show evidence of intimidation, harassment, and use of force to evict farmers. The exact number of people affected or forcibly evicted has been difficult to determine, including by groups representing farmers.
In January 2022, the Lahore High Court ruled that the Ravi River project was unconstitutional. The court said that it violated domestic laws concerning the forcible acquisition of land, the process for compensating those displaced, and the project’s environmental impact assessment. The following month, the Supreme Court partially overruled the Lahore High Court decision and allowed the government to continue development only on the land it had already acquired and for which it had paid compensation.
Farmers and activists have alleged that despite the Supreme Court ruling, the authority has continued to seize land. In November 2022, they petitioned the High Court to have the Supreme Court’s decision enforced. 
In October 2022, the authority filed criminal cases against at least nine farmers, claiming that they resisted handing over lands and houses that the government had legally acquired. The farmers have challenged this, saying that they had not consented to the acquisition and had received no compensation from the government.
One farmer told the HRW that his family had lived on the land for three generations, and the government was not only forcibly evicting them but also refusing to pay adequate compensation.

8,Anti-dengue steps ordered across Punjab,LAHORE: The Cabinet Committee on Dengue Control on Monday directed the authorities concerned to improve the ...,"LAHORE: The Cabinet Committee on Dengue Control on Monday directed the authorities concerned to improve the mechanism of monitoring, reporting and surveillance of dengue larvae and cases. 
The direction came at a meeting of the committee attended by provincial health ministers Dr Jamal Nasir, Dr Javed Akram, Chief Secretary Zahid Akhtar Zaman, additional chief secretary and secretaries of various departments.
According to reports emerging from the state-run healthcare facilities, private hospitals and  family physicians, the viral fever cases are increasing in the city as a  large number of patients were complaining of high-grade fever with flu  and cough.
Some doctors claim that dengue is revisiting the provincial metropolis due to the change in weather, while others stressed the need for differentiating between the cases of dengue fever and viral infections by observing symptoms among the patients.
Dr Mohammad Arif, a family physician running a clinic in Shadbagh, says he was being visited by seven to nine patients daily complaining of fever, flu and cough. Some of them also complain of severe body ache and joint pain, he says, adding that around three out of 10 patients are  diagnosed with dengue.
During the cabinet committee meeting, Dr Jamal Nasir said an effective system should be devised, instead of traditional methods, to control dengue and the existing resources of hospitals should be used for anti-dengue activities. He directed that special attention be paid to terminating dengue larvae in parks and open places. 
Dr Javed Akram said that for the complete elimination of dengue, there was a need to work on scientific lines and raise public awareness through community mobilisation. 
Reassigning the responsibilities to the departments in connection with dengue control, the chief secretary ordered the officers to ensure implementation of the guidelines regarding dengue. He said meetings of dengue emergency response committees should be held regularly in the districts.

The judge directed the office to fix the petition for hearing before his court on April 12. The registrar office questioned the locus standi of the petitioner to agitate the matter.
Justice Chattah asked the petitioner’s counsel how he was aggrieved in the matter.
Advocate Muhammad Afaq said his client was a voter of the country and had a right to file the petition.
The judge reserved the verdict on the maintainability of the petition, which he announced later in the day and ordered the office to fix hearing of the petition.
Petitioner Mohammad Junaid submitted that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had disqualified the former prime minister and de-seated him from NA-95, Mianwali, on a corruption charge. 
He said the office-bearers of a political party must meet the standards provided in Articles 62 and 63 of the Constitution as per the provisions of the Representation of Peoples Act, 1976 and the Political Parties Order, 2002. However, he stated, Mr Khan was violating the laws by continuing to hold the chairman`s office of the PTI, which was registered with the ECP.
The petitioner also referred to the case wherein the Supreme Court restrained former prime minister Nawaz Sharif from heading the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) following his disqualification under Articles 62 and 63.
The petitioner asked the high court to order the ECP to remove Mr Khan as PTI chairman and issue a direction for the nomination of a new party head.

He said Shehbaz was getting direct instructions from the government’s “godfather” in London.
He said the Parliament could not refuse to provide funds to the Election Commission and those doing so would be charged with contempt of court.
Mr Elahi was speaking to party leaders including Chaudhry Zulfiqar Ghumman, Chaudhry Waseem Ramay, Abdullah Yousuf Warraich, Shujahat Nawaz Ajnala, Meher Kashif, Mirza Aziz Beg, Mazhar Rawn and Mirza Shams Baig here on Monday.
The PTI central president said the entire nation was standing with the chief justice of Pakistan to uphold the supremacy of the Constitution.  
Mr Elahi said Nawaz Sharif’s desire to “humiliate” the judiciary would never be fulfilled.  
He said the irony of the situation was that the 50th anniversary of the Constitution was being celebrated and the same Constitution was being disgraced. He said since the PPP claimed to be the architect of the Constitution, the party leaders should refrain from participating in, what he called the conspiracy to violate the Constitution.
He said the nation had been humiliated under the one-year rule of Shehbaz Sharif.  
“The lesson from last year is that Shehbaz Sharif and Pakistan cannot go together anymore,” he commented and added that those who brought Shehbaz into power were also regretting.
Mr Elahi said the wheel of the economy had come to a grinding halt as the credibility of the current government before international financial institutions was zero.  
He said inflation had reached a record level of 35 percent, one million youths had left the country after being disappointed in a year.  
He regretted that people were dying in queues for flour and added the PDM government had given nothing to the people, but inflation, chaos, anarchy, destruction, despair and hopelessness.

13,Fuel theft from tankers on M-5 ‘rule of the road’,RAHIM YAR KHAN: Theft of fuel and wheat during their transportation in connivance with tanker and trailer drivers has been going,"

-Dawn

 
RAHIM YAR KHAN: Theft of fuel and wheat during their transportation in connivance with tanker and trailer drivers has been going on for the last few months in the area between Taranda Muhammad Pannah and Kashmore interchanges on the Sukkur-Multan Motorway (M-5). 
The footage of the theft of petrol from a tanker parked on the M-5 near Zahirpir went viral on social media the other day, showing four persons shifting petrol to a nearby shop. 
According to the sources in the National Highway Authority (NHA), the practice of theft was happening near the service areas or rest areas where the tankers and trailers stop.  
The sources said the drivers, who are employees of petroleum and goods companies, connive with petrol/diesel sellers and grocery shopkeepers just along the fence of the motorway. There are many small illegal petrol agencies and grocery shops on the dirt roads used by the farmers along the boundary of M-5 on both sides of it.  
The drivers stop their vehicles in front of these shops, transfer petrol and diesel from the company tankers into plastic drums and sell it to the shopkeepers at lower rates. When these tankers reach their destinations, they mix the fuel with soap to increase its quantity and make up for the missing fuel.  
Similarly, some trailer and truck drivers of private goods companies, with the conspiracy of shopkeepers, steal wheat bags from the trailers and trucks and sell them also at cheaper rates. Later, the loss of the theft of wheat from trailers and trucks is compensated by the insurance companies as the transported products are insured. 
The practice had been in progress for many years on the national highway but it emerged on the M-5 in the last few months, sources said. They added that shopkeepers belonging to villages in the Zahirpir area are allegedly very active in the theft.  
National Highway Authority (NHA) spokesperson Sohail Aftab told Dawn that it’s the duty of the National Highway and Motorway Police (NHMP) to take measures for the motorway safety. 
He said the NHA would take up the matter with the authorities to monitor the illegal practices along the motorway with the coordination of the NHMP but added that the local law enforcement institutions would have to take steps for the elimination of thieves outside the boundary of the motorway.  
NHMP public relations officer Nasir Sial told this correspondent that the NHMP was imposing fines on the heavy vehicles parked on the motorway without any reason while it attended all the vehicles with technical faults to facilitate them. He added that it was the duty of the district police to control crime on the premises outside the motorways.

Police handed over the body to the deceased’s family.  
ROBBERS: Phoolnagar police lodged a case against three unidentified suspects in police uniform who took away cash, mobile phones and goats worth about Rs1 million at gunpoint from two shepherds near village Saharankay. 
According to shepherd Muhammad Akram, he and another shepherd Rehmat Ali were grazing their goats in the fields on March 28 when three men in police uniform reached there in a vehicle with a green registration number plate.  
The uniformed men asked the shepherds about suspects they were looking for who had stolen goats from a house and raped a woman.  
The men in uniform started beating the shepherds, snatched cash and mobile phones from them at gunpoint and loaded four of their expensive goats in the vehicle. They drove away while hurling threats of dire consequences.  
Police lodged a case after a delay of about two weeks.  
A few weeks back, 11 robbers in police uniforms deprived various motorists, including the families of ASI Sabir Dogar and retired SI Mushtaq Bhatti, of cash, gold and other valuables, in the limits of Saddar Phoolnagar Police Station.  
Police lodged a case but failed to identify or arrest any of the suspects.  
In a separate incident in the limits of Saddar Phoolnagar Police Station, unidentified suspects kidnapped the son of an official of a sensitive agency.  
Police lodged a case on the complaint of Sajjad Ali that his 15-year-old son Talha was kidnapped by unidentified kidnappers on Friday.  
PROTEST: Dozens of villagers staged a protest demonstration against the police over their failure to control robberies and blocked Sudhana-Raiwind road in the area of Raja Jang Police Station.  
The protest was triggered by a robbery in which two masked robbers had intercepted one Ali near village Sudhana and took away his new motorcycle and Rs20,000 at gunpoint.  
The protesters dispersed on the assurance of SHO Irshad Ahmed that action would be taken to control robberies.

The situation has caused great concerns and worries among farmers, who fear they will suffer significant financial losses.
According to reports, this year watermelon was cultivated on 8,500 acres, and melons on 1,500 acres in Mamukanjan. The downy disease has severely impacted both crops due to the recent heavy rains, which have also delayed the picking of the watermelon crop. As a result of this delay, watermelons are starting to explode while lying in the fields.
Farmers stated that they spend Rs150,000 per acre on cultivation costs, and if the situation persists, they would have to bear a loss of at least Rs100,000 per acre.  
Mamukanjan is a significant market in Punjab for watermelons and melons, and farmers usually earn from Rs500,000 to Rs700,000 per acre. However, this year, due to the crisis and disease outbreak in watermelons and melons, they are likely to suffer a great financial loss.
ACCIDENTS: A fatal accident occurred in the Jhang’s Chiniot Road area, where a head-on collision between two motorcycles and a truck also ran over them after the collision.
The accident resulted in the death of motorcyclist Allah Ditta, and injuries to Bahadur Khan and Shahzad Javed.  The injured were shifted to the Jhang District Headquarters Hospital.
In another incident on Mianchannu Road, Musa Virk, two motorcycles collided, leading to the death of a motorcyclist identified as Arsalan Ahmad, while his father, Muhammad Bashir, who was travelling as a pillion rider, and the other motorcycle rider, Muzammal, received injuries. They were admitted to the Khanewal DHQ hospital.
