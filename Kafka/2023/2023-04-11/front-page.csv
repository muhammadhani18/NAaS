0,Pillars of state pledge to uphold body of law,Justice Isa's presence at the NA convention next to Asif Ali Zardari caused a stir on social media.,"• April 10 declared ‘national day’ during convention marking 50 years of 1973 Constitution
• PTI asked to sit with govt to find solutions to prevailing issues, without prior conditions
• Justice Isa reaffirms judiciary’s support for legal canon
ISLAMABAD: All three pillars of the state — the executive, legislature, and judiciary — on Monday vowed to safeguard the Constitution, at an event held to celebrate 50 years of the Constitution at Parliament House, which was also addressed by Justice Qazi Faez Isa.
At the Golden Jubilee Convention of the 1973 Constitution, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and three other lawmakers presented four resolutions, declaring April 10 as a national day and the old hall of the National Assembly, where the Constitution was passed, as national heritage.
Although the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) did not take part in the convention, speakers invited the party to sit with the government for a dialogue to find solutions to prevalent problems — particularly economic meltdown and political chaos.

Some former legislators also attended the convention, including former Sindh chief minister Qaim Ali Shah, who was seen sitting next to PM Shehbaz. Some of the guests, however, seemed to take little interest in the speeches and were busy taking pictures with their mobile phones inside the NA hall.
‘SC stands by Constitution’
The presence of Justice Qazi Faez Isa at the event was quite significant, with his speech becoming the highlight of the convention.
A source told Dawn that all judges of the apex court, including Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial, were invited to the function, but Justice Isa said he was there to represent the entire Supreme Court. “The Supreme Court and I stand by the Constitution,” he said while speaking on the occasion.
The second senior-most judge of the apex court also distanced himself from the political remarks made during the ceremony and said: “I came here thinking that there would be a discussion on the role of Constitution during the event, instead of politics.”
In addition to Justice Isa, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) leaders Asif Ali Zardari and Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari were given a chance to “deliver lengthy speeches” on the occasion.
Other politicians did not get a chance to speak but JUI-F leader Maulana Asad Mehmood managed to squeeze in a speech after he was asked by Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf to offer prayers at the end of the function.
The presence of Justice Isa raised many an eyebrow, with a number of people on social media questioning the judge’s decision to attend the event and sit next to Mr Zardari.
The National Assembly Secretariat, however, issued a statement rejecting the impression that the event was a parliamentary meeting. The NA spokesperson said vice chancellors, lawyers, doctors, women, and senior parliamentarians were invited to attend the function to celebrate the Constitution.
“In order to ensure the participation of representatives of three organs of the state i.e. legislature, executive, and judiciary were also invited,” the statement added.
‘Collective wisdom’
Speaking at the start of the convention, PM Shehbaz recalled that a year ago, coalition parties formed their government through a constitutional process. He said the coalition government took on the challenges through collective wisdom to steer the country out of tough conditions, for the sake of the nation.
The premier said though the allied parties would go into elections on their respective manifestoes, they were united in their mission to save the country.
Speaking on the occasion, Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari termed PTI Chairman Imran Khan a “Frankenstein” and said he was imposed on the country as a part of a “ten-year doctrine chalked up by his facilitators”.
“Under the doctrine, Imran was to be made prime minister for ten years and chief justice and army chief were also to be appointed for a decade,” he said. The plan was to have a “selected PM, a selected chief justice, and a selected chief of army staff to impose a selected martial law,” he claimed.
In a reference to the no-trust vote against Mr Khan, the PPP chairperson said, “For the first time in the country’s history, a selected puppet was sent home not with the aid of the judiciary or the establishment, but through a no-confidence motion.”
PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari urged political forces, including the PTI, to sit together to initiate a dialogue and asserted that Imran Khan will have to come to the prime minister for talks.
“We cannot afford chaos. We can request the PM for a dialogue with the opposition, but they have to come to him as he is the prime minister,” said the former president.
The head of the government is the “only valid authority” to spearhead a dialogue, he said, adding, “One cannot walk into a dialogue with pre-conditions.”
Resolutions
A resolution presented by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif declared April 10 as National Constitution Day. Another resolution presented by Finance Minister Ishaq Dar declared the old hall of the National Assembly where the Constitution was passed as a national heritage site.
The resolution presented by Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb was aimed at incorporating fundamental aspects of the Constitution in the education curriculum, whereas the fourth resolution presented by Senator Raza Rabbani paid tribute to the framers of the Constitution and the entire National Assembly of 1973 and highlighted those who had abrogated the Constitution.

QUETTA: At least four people were killed and 21 others injured in two attacks targeting the police in Quetta on Monday.
In the first attack, a blast took place in a busy market, killing four people and injuring 18.
According to police, the target of the attack was SP Investigation Naseer Shah of Quetta police whose vehicle was parked at the Kandahari Bazaar. The SP was not in the vehicle at the time of the attack.
Unidentified men left an explosive-laden motorcycle behind the vehicle parked in front of the Bukhari Currency Exchange Centre.
A few minutes later, a powerful explosion ripped through the market, killing two constables, part of the SP’s security detail, and two passersby.

The deceased and the injured were moved to Civil Hospital. Hospital officials confirmed receiving four bodies and 18 injured, three of whom were critical.
The heavy explosion also damaged four vehicles and several motorcycles, while the windows of nearby shops and buildings were also shattered.
Quetta’s SSP Operations Zohaib Mohsin Baloch said around five kilograms of explosive was used for the blast which appeared to be detonated with the help of a remote control.
The four victims were identified as Shamim Abbasi, Mohammad Shoaib, Hakmitullah and 12-year-old Kalsoom Bibi.
The banned Baloch Liberation Army has claimed responsibility for the attack.
The second attack took place on Munir Mengal Road in Quetta’s Sar­iab area, leaving three people wounded.
Officials said the target was the Station House Officer of Sariab police station who was patrolling the area. He survived the attack.
The bomb, planted on the roadside, went off near the vehicle carrying SHO Ehsanullah Marwat and the police party.
The attack left the vehicle badly damaged while the injured were moved to Civil Hospital.
Condemnations
The prime minister Balochistan chief minister, governor and home minister condemned the attack.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also prayed for the deceased while extending his condolences to their families, APP reported.
He directed officials to provide medical facilities to the injured and sought a report about the attack from the authorities.
Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Abdul Quddus Bizenjo also expressed his grief over the loss of lives.
The chief minister sought a report from the inspector general of police on the incident and security measures in the city.
“Those who shed the blood of innocent people in the holy month of Ramazan do not deserve to be called human beings,” he said while redirecting to beef up security measures in the city. Balochistan Governor Malik Abdul Wali Khan Kakar instructed the law enforcement agencies to utilise all available resources to arrest the culprits.

2,"China asked to speed up work on ML-1, KCR","Besides ML-1 and KCR, two hydropower projects are also on hold for various reasons, particularly financial limitations.","ISLAMABAD: Pakis­tan on Monday asked China to expedite the process for implementation of the first phase of $10 billion Mainline-1 (ML-1) — the 1,872km railway track along with associated facilities from Karachi to Peshawar — and $2bn Karachi Circular Railway (KCR) as agreed between the leadership of the two nations in November.
Pakistan “requested strong support of National Development and Reforms Commission (NDRC) and other relevant Chinese government institutions to advance implementation of important projects like ML-1, KCR and key energy projects in line with the leadership consensus,” said a statement issued by the ministry of planning and development after a bilateral meeting on China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).
Besides ML-1 and KCR, two hydropower projects, including 1,124MW Koh­ala Hydropower Project, had been on hold for various reasons, particularly financial limitations and insurance challenges.
During Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s visit to Beijing on Nov 1, 2022, the Chinese political leadership agreed to fast-track processing for ML-1 by immediately triggering their respective teams. It was agreed at the time to arrange bidding for the project by December and negotiations for financing terms and conditions should follow after the selection of the bidder.
However, the agreed progress could not be achieved as power sector dues increased despite creation of a revolving fund to meet at least the requirements of financial institutions.
After Mr Sharif’s return, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar said KCR was also discussed at those meetings and the project would soon be in the implementation phase.
Pakistan’s troubles with IMF, however, followed soon afterwards and payables to Chinese Independent Power Producers went beyond Rs350bn.
ML-1 also could not attract financing commitments from the Chinese institutions, leading these delays to get parallel funding offers from the Asian Development Bank that was previously interested in providing loans for the mega project but had been elbowed out on the Chinese insistence.
In January, Planning and Development Secretary Zafar Ali Shah said that a $2.7bn loan request had been placed with China for upgradation of the first phase of ML-1 that spread mostly in Sindh and partially in Punjab where the track was damaged by last year’s super floods. The ground level of the track has to be increased with redesigning.
At a subsequent media briefing, Mr Shah said ADB had again offered to finance the ML-1 even though the government was pursuing a part of the project with China.
Earlier, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal confirmed that the country had declined ADB’s offer as China wanted to fund the project single-handedly. “China strongly argued that two-sourced financing would create problems and the project would suffer,” Mr Iqbal had said at a presser in 2017.
Pakistan, during Mr Iqbal’s visit to China last week, again took up the matter with Li Chunlin, Vice Chairman of China’s NDRC.
At a follow-up progress review meeting on Monday, the two sides discussed important CPEC projects and minutes of the 11th JCC meeting.
Chief Economist and CPEC Project Director Nadeem Javaid and his Chinese counterpart Pan Jiang, Director General of NDRC’s National Cooperation Department, co-chaired the meeting attended by representatives of ministries of planning, energy, industry, communication, agriculture, interior, science & technology and information technology & telecom and board of investment.
The two sides expressed satisfaction on the smooth implementation of various CPEC projects and agreed that all pending issues will be resolved amicably in the spirit of traditional cooperation, mutual understanding, complete trust and brotherhood.
“Both sides expressed satisfaction on progress made in the four priority special economic zones (SEZs) namely Rashakai, Allama Iqbal Industrial City, Dhabeji and Bostan SEZs and agreed to further expedite the progress so as to attract relocation of high quality industries,” said the statement.
The meeting appreciated the signing of Framework Agreement for Industrial Cooperation and both sides committed to holding bi-annual meetings to review the implementation of framework.
It may be noted that 2023 marks the decade of CPEC and the strong partnership between Pakistan and China.

3,"At 90pc, census data shows ‘dip’ in Karachi’s population","Karachi's population currently stands at 13.4m, which is 15.94pc less than the number — 16.02m — after 90pc of 2017 census was completed, source says.","KARACHI: With almost 90 per cent of the census exe­rcise completed in Kar­a­chi, the city’s final population is expected to cause fresh disputes as data shows a dip of 15pc, compared to the tally six years ago.
The exercise, which was supposed to be completed on Monday, was extended for a second time as enumerators were still scrambling to reach many households.
The population of the Karachi metropolis rema­i­ned the biggest bone of contention that emerged out of the 2017 census. Political parties, particularly MQM-P and JI, claimed that the final count of the city’s residents was less than the actual number.
These disputes have led to the exercise being repeated within six years.
So far, more than 2.64m households have been counted in the city, making the completion of 89.93pc of the exercise, a source with knowledge of census data told Dawn.
At this point, the population of Karachi stands at 13,471,136, the source said, adding that this was 15.94pc less than the number — 16,024,894 — after 89.93pc of the 2017 census was completed. The final count stood at around 16.05m.
With a little over 10pc of the population left to be counted, things “don’t appear to be promising if we talk about the possibility of an increase in Karachi’s population,” the source told Dawn.
 
 

None of Karachi’s seven districts — East, West, South, Central, Korangi, Keamari and Malir — registered an increase in population during the last five years.
Karachi East was the biggest district in terms of decline in the population with 25pc. Around 85pc of the enumeration has been completed in the district. A similar trend was witnessed in the South district with a negative difference of 19.70pc after the registration of its 92.64pc households.
The recorded population of Korangi district dipped more than one per cent compared to the 2017 census, Keamari 17pc, Central 11.84pc, West 9.68pc and Malir 6.61pc.
However, the chief census commissioner of the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) said despite the completion of almost 90pc of the exercise, the data shouldn’t be relied upon to estimate the final count.
“There are still more than 10pc uncounted households [in Karachi]. So, the number so far cannot be relied upon to guess the final count,” said Dr Naeemuz Zafar who is heading the entire exercise. “There are several areas that include high-rise residential settlements where the enumerators have not yet reached,” he added.
The final number can be determined only after the exercise is finally completed, Mr Zafar said.
Due to the delay in data gathering, the deadline for the fieldwork was extended on Monday for five days till April 14. Earlier, the date was extended to April 10 from its first official deadline of April 4.
Dr Zafar said with the deadline extended, the teams will make an “all-out effort” to reach every single person.
Concerns
The chief census commissioner expressed reservations over the role of district administration and outlined challenges faced by his team in major urban centres.
He accused that the lack of interest shown by assistant commissioners was affecting the exercise and its outcome.
“We are facing serious challenges in major urban centres like Karachi and Lahore,” said Dr Zafar.
“Unfortunately, the ACs are not doing their jobs properly. They aren’t found in the fields. They aren’t properly deploying enumerators or monitoring their jobs.”
He added that the PBS has written several times to provincial governments over these issues.
The field staff also cite several challenges which they fear would ultimately reflect in the final results of the multi-billion rupee national exercise.
They claimed “a few but major flaws” in the software designed for the country’s first digital census along with technical management of the entire exercise.
Another issue raised by the enumerators was the lack of faith shown by citizens in the exercise.
“People don’t want to share their data or family details even with the government,” said a senior official, adding that this phenomenon has never been witnessed before.
“We have reports from villages, towns and urban centres where people straightaway refused to give details to our teams.“It is either that people were indifferent to the importance of this expansive exercise or they have lost faith in the government or of its institutions, the official added.

4,Returned bill passed by joint sitting of parliament,"Draft law seeking to restructure CJP’s powers sees minor amendments; minister says bill will fix rules framed during ""dictator’s tenure"".","ISLAMABAD: The government on Monday took another defiant step against the Supreme Court, when a joint session of parliament adopted — albeit with some amendments — a bill seeking to curtail the powers of the chief justice of Pakistan, amid a noisy protest from PTI lawmakers.
The bill, which was passed earlier by both houses but returned by President Arif Alvi a couple of days ago, was moved in the joint sitting by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, as PTI lawmakers from the upper house chanted slogans decrying the move.
As per the Constitution, the bill will be sent to the president once again for his assent, and if he does not sign it within ten days, assent will be deemed to have been granted.
According to the fresh legislation, a three-member bench consisting of the chief justice and the two senior-most judges of the apex court will decide whether or not to take up a matter suo motu. Previously, this was solely the prerogative of the chief justice.

Draft law seeking to restructure CJP’s powers sees minor amendments; minister says bill will fix rules framed during ‘dictator’s tenure’

The law also states that every cause, matter, or appeal before the apex court would be heard and disposed of by a bench, constituted by a committee made up of the chief justice and the two senior-most judges.
The legislation also includes the right to file an appeal within 30 days of the judgement in a suo motu case and that any case involving constitutional interpretation will not have a bench of fewer than five judges.
The bill would allow former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and other parliamentarians disqualified by the Supreme Court under suo motu powers (such as Jahangir Tareen) to appeal their disqualification within 30 days of the law’s enactment.
Speaking during the joint sitting, Mr Tarar rejected the impression that the judiciary’s powers were being abridged under the bill.
“We have increased their powers and brought transparency to the affairs of the Supreme Court through this bill,” he remarked.
He said the Supreme Court rules were framed during a dictator’s tenure, but now this law would remove the imp­re­ssion of an ‘imperial court’ and end the ‘one-man show’ in the apex court.
He also advised President Arif Alvi to act as the head of the state, rather than behaving as the worker of a political party.
An amendment in the bill moved by Jamaat-i-Islami Senator Mushtaq Hussain was rejected by the house, however minor amendments suggested by PML-N Senator Shaza Fatima Khawaja were okayed.
Expressing his views in the house, Senator Mushtaq Ahmad said the bill’s intentions were good to the extent that it seeks to bring to an end the judiciary’s intervention in the affairs of the parliament, but said parliament should also move to stop the military establishment’s intervention.
He also said he was a strong opponent of person-specific and retrospective legislation.
Later, the house also adopted two identical resolutions, calling for the simultaneous conduct of general polls to the national and all the four provincial assemblies.
