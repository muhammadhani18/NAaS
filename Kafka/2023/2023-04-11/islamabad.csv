0,"Bonfires, smoking banned in Margalla Hills","The order shall come into force with immediate effect and remain in force for two months, says notification.","ISLAMABAD: The capital administration on Monday imposed a ban on barbecues, smoking, bonfires, burning, littering and carrying flammable items along with tree cutting in Margalla Hills National Park as the fire season has started.
The Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB), Ministry of Climate Change, had approached the capital administration seeking the ban in the national park.
In a letter addressed to the capital administration, the board said that in the fire season (April to July), the danger of forest fires loomed over the national park. The flora and fauna of the park should be protected from forest fires by better preparedness, it added.
The board with its limited resources prepares a fire protection plan and requests other organisations such as civic agencies for their contribution in protection from forest fires, the letter added.
The administration was requested to prohibit BBQs, smoking, bonfires, burning and littering of garbage, plastic, carrying flammable items such as lighters, charcoal, matchstick, bottles of petrol and kerosene and tree cutting in the national park.
In response, the administration issued a notification. The notification said: “It has come to knowledge that BBQs, smoking, bonfires, burning and littering of garbage, littering of plastic, carrying flammable items such as lighters, charcoal, matchsticks, bottles of petrol/kerosene and tree cutting is leading to loss of habitat, polluting water and clearing or breaking up of land for other purposes in the Margalla Hills National Park, which constitute violations of the Islamabad Wildlife (Protection, Preservation, Conservation and Management) Ordinance 1979.”
The order shall come into force with immediate effect and remain in force for two months, it added.

1,AJK superior courts summon Ilyas today,MUZAFFARABAD: The superior courts of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) on Monday separately served notices on Prime...,"MUZAFFARABAD: The superior courts of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) on Monday separately served notices on Prime Minister Sardar Tanveer Ilyas to explain his position with regard to his “derogatory remarks about superior judiciary in his speeches at public meetings.”
The notices, served through his principal secretary, asked Mr Ilyas to separately appear before the High Court and the Supreme Court on Tuesday.
“It is noted that for the last few months the PM has been targeting the superior judiciary in public meetings and speeches. He has used highly derogatory and indecent language while threatening the judges of the superior courts,” read the order by the apex court.
At a function in Islamabad on Saturday, Mr Ilyas had indirectly blamed the judiciary for affecting the functioning of his government and interfering in the domain of the executive through grant of stay orders. 
He had particularly referred to a $15m Saudi funded education sector project, saying it had been in a limbo because the court had issued a stay order on it. Similarly, he had also taken strong exception to the “de-sealing by the courts of tobacco factories involved in tax evasion to the tune of billions of rupees.”
Producing the clipping of the premier’s speech in its order, the apex court said that the matter was discussed at a meeting of the judges’ council “in view of its seriousness” and it was unanimously decided “it could not be overlooked because the dignity and authority of the courts was on stake and nobody could be allowed to undermine it.”
“However, […] before issuing contempt notice we are intended to ask the Prime Minister to appear in person and explain his position on the referred news,” it added.
The High Court order had almost identical observations.
“Prime Minister Tanveer Ilyas has directly threatened the superior judiciary and the language of his speech at a public meeting is highly derogatory, improper and indecently worded,” the order said.
Not only the latest statement, but his “previous track record from several months is [also] objectionable, unbecoming and improper,” it added.
The order said the judges’ council of the High Court had unanimously decided not to leave the mater unattended “simply by shutting eye from contemptuous and derogatory statement of the person who is at the helm of affairs.”
“By showing magnanimity and judicial restraint, we have opted, in the beginning of the proceedings, to serve a notice on the prime minister to personally appear before the full court to explain his position.”
Immediately it was not clear that whether the PM would appear before the courts or not.
In Islamabad, when Mr Ilyas was questioned by some reporters about the notices, he maintained that he had just highlighted that stay orders had been affecting the projects of public utility.
“This does not amount to contempt [of courts].”

Water level in Rawal Lake reduced during last month due to less rains in the region. Even though rain lashed the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad, less water arrived in the lake from catchment areas.
Rawal Dam Superintendent Engineer Arsalan Ahmed told Dawn that there would be no shortage of water for the next five months while the coming monsoon will improve the water situation for city areas.
He said that water level in Rawal Lake was 1,744 feet while spillways were opened when the water level increased to 1,752 feet, adding that water storage was better and supply will continue towards Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) without any hurdle.
Rawal Dam is supplying 28 million gallons daily (MGD) of water to Rawalpindi city and Cantonment areas through Rawal Filtration plant after cleaning it. At present, the daily requirement of water in the garrison city is 60 MGD but the agency provides 54 MGD and there was shortage of six MGD.
There are three main sources of water for Rawalpindi city - Rawal Dam which provides 28 MGD, Khanpur Dam which provides six MGD and the remaining water is supplied through 420 tubewells. So Rawal Dam remains to be a major source of water.
As many as 61 union councils of Rawalpindi are supplied water from Rawal Dam. Pakistan Army, Pakistan Railways and other military organisations also rely on water from the dam.
Wasa spokesman Mohammad Umer Farooq said the agency was getting water from the Rawal lake as per routine and there was no shortage. However, he said that the agency was working on getting more water from Rawal Lake after starting its new project for reconstruction of its old line soon.
On the other hand, as per the Met Office, there will be no rain in the coming days.
“The day temperature will rise further in the coming days as there is no chance of rain during the next one week,” said an official of the department.
He said continental air is prevailing over most parts of the country. He said dry weather was expected in most parts of the country and it will remain hot in central/southern parts during day time. However, light rain-wind thunderstorm is expected at isolated places in northeastern Balochistan.
In the twin cities, the maximum temperature was recorded at 33C which is likely rise further in the next 24 hours.

Protesters said mismanagement and financial irregularities put thousands of students’ future at stake. 
KIU is the only public-sector university in the region, where more than 10,000 local students are enrolled. A large number of KIU students gathered outside the university vice chancellor’s office in the main campus.
The students held placards, some of which stated, ‘Anti Education Policies not Accepted’. They were chanting slogans against the vice chancellor and university administration.
Ali Kawish, a student of the engineering department told Dawn that the university administration increased semester fee by 20pc in this semester.
He said on the university’s website, the semester fee has been fixed at Rs32,000 while on vouchers, the fee is fixed at Rs50,000.
He said in public-sector universities in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab, students of the engineering department pay semester fees that are less than that in KIU.
Ali said that only one permanent teacher is available in the engineering department while two teachers have been hired as visiting teachers.
He said the laboratory has not been established in the department for students and the conditions of class rooms are also dilapidated.
Alamdar Hussain, one of the organisers of the protest, said the university administration failed to provide facilities to students. There are numerous issues faced by students.
Shakeel Ahmed, another student said it is amazing that the university increases fees continously but does not provide basic facilities.
Protesters said that financial grants from the Higher Education Commission (HEC), the GB government and international organisations are provided to the university.
They said how and where the funds are being utilised no one can know.
Sania Essa, a protester, said that many international organisations provided funds for scholarships however deserved students still do not get them.
They said the university is marred by financial irregularities and mismanagement. They asked the prime minister of Pakistan to intervene in the situation and play a role to provide justice to thousands of students.
Later, the university management held negotiations with protesters and told them that the cut in financial grant from HEC causes increase of fees.
The university management assured protesters that their demands would be fulfilled.

7,Pindi authorities told to improve dengue monitoring,RAWALPINDI: The Punjab Cabinet Committee on Dengue Control on Monday directed the district authorities to improve ...,"RAWALPINDI: The Punjab Cabinet Committee on Dengue Control on Monday directed the district authorities to improve the mechanism of monitoring, reporting, and surveillance of dengue, as the commissioner separately confirmed two cases of dengue virus reported in the district.
The direction came during a meeting of the committee attended by provincial ministers Dr Jamal Nasir, Dr Javed Akram, Azfar Ali, Mansoor Qadir, the chief secretary, and secretaries of various departments.
Dr Jamal Nasir said that an effective system should be devised instead of traditional methods to control dengue and the existing resources of hospitals should be used for anti-dengue activities. He directed that special attention should be paid to getting rid of dengue larvae in parks and other open places.
Dr Javed Akram said that for the complete elimination of dengue, there was a need to work along the scientific lines and raise awareness among people through community mobilisation.
The meeting decided to establish paraplegic centers in five cities for the rehabilitation of people suffering from traumatic spinal cord injury.
The chief secretary also issued instructions to the deputy commissioners regarding the prevention of smog. He said that special measures should be taken to prevent air pollution at construction sites. He added that only kilns with zigzag technology would be allowed to operate.
Meanwhile, Rawalpindi Commissioner Liaquat Ali Chattha said that about 400 vacant plots have been identified in the Rawalpindi district, whose owners have been instructed to build boundary walls around the plots. He said that rainwater accumulates in the garbage dumped in the plots which lead to the breeding of dengue larvae. He said that plots that will not be cleaned and fenced would be marked ‘red’.
He expressed these views while addressing the participants of the anti-dengue meeting at the Commissioner’s office. The commissioner directed the Rawalpindi Metropolitan Corporation to finalise the SOPs regarding building materials as soon as possible. He further said that public involvement in anti-dengue activities was important because lack of cleanliness was the main cause of dengue breeding.
Mr Chatha said two confirmed cases of dengue have been reported in the district so far. In graveyards and parks, where wild bushes grow, there is a risk of water accumulation, so emphasis should be placed on surveillance in these areas, he said and directed that immediate disposal of solid waste should be ensured.
He directed that the teams appointed for dengue surveillance should try to control the growth of dengue larvae by checking graveyards and other places on a daily basis. “Teams must share their live location during their field visit and there should be no fake activity,” he added.

8,PTI faces ‘mutiny’ in Taxila over PP-20 ticket,"TAXILA: Differences between Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leadership in Taxila once again came under the spotlight,...","TAXILA: Differences between Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leadership in Taxila once again came under the spotlight, as several party leaders who contested the elections for the councillor last year publicly expressed their reservations against ex-MPA Taimoor Masood after he was shortlisted as PP-20 (Wah) candidate for the upcoming polls.
Soon after the 2018 elections, the PTI chapter in the region split into two groups – one was led by former minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan whereas Mr Masood headed the second. The differences took an ugly turn last year when supporters of both sides attacked each other on November 9 during an anti-government protest drive. Three persons were injured and the former sports minister, Taimoor Masood, was nominated in the case.
In a press conference at a local hotel on Monday, seven members of the PTI – who contested local government elections – announced that they would rebel if the party decided to award a ticket to Mr Masood, who was shortlisted for the provincial assembly candidature alongside Malik Azmat Mehmood.
According to the PTI leaders, they would support other candidates in the upcoming election if a ticket was awarded to Mr Masood since he was “responsible for their defeat” in the local government polls last year. They alleged that the former minister launched his own candidates in the local bodies elections which split the party votes, paving way for the PML-N to win the election.
They claimed that the popularity graph of the PTI candidate was at the “lowest ebb” due to the poor policies of the former MPA and his decision to ignore the “diehard workers” of the party. They alleged that Mr Masood violated party discipline and launched his own candidates against the party candidates which led to their defeat in seven constituencies of Wah.
“The decision may not affect the award of party ticket, but it would definitely affect the election result,” said Raja Tariq Mehmood in response to a question.
Azhar Mehmood Malik, while answering a question, said PP-20 comprised 10 constituencies and the former MPA did not enjoy support in at least seven constituencies.
According to the party sources, this rebellion against the former sports minister was allegedly staged by Malik Azmat Mehmood who was launched by Ghulam Sarwar Khan, former aviation minister. Mr Mehmood is also shortlisted for PP-20 (Wah) ticket after party chief Imran Khan carried out his interview to review his credibility to contest and win the upcoming elections, as per the PTI website.
Meanwhile, the defiance is also evident from the fact that the PTI’s local women wing took out a rally against inflation on Sunday in which the name and pictures of Ghulam Sarwar Khan were missing – proof of tug of war between the local party leadership.
According to political observer Saeed Ahmed Siddiqui, the divisions between the local leadership of the party would cause a serious dent in the party which would prove beneficial for the PML-N nominee during the polls.

9,"‘Over 600,000 people contracted TB in last two years in Pakistan’",Provincial adviser says HIV-infected persons at increased risk of acquiring TB.,"ISLAMABAD: As many as 611,000 people have fallen ill due to tuberculosis (TB) in Pakistan over the past two years whereas 48,000 HIV-negative and 2,100 HIV-positive people died due to TB in the country but only 55pc of the cases were notified.
Vice chair of Stop TB Pakistan Dr Sharaf Ali Shah said this while speaking to participants of a seminar held on Monday.
According to a statement released on Monday, the event was organised by Stop TB Partnership Pakistan in collaboration with the Centres for Disease Control (CDC) and Pfizer Pakistan.
Highlighting the reasons for low TB case notification, Dr Shah said that poor understanding of TB and its symptoms (lack of awareness), poor knowledge about where to seek care and misconceptions around anti-TB drug availability at public sector health facilities, cost of transportation and loss of daily wages were some of the main factors.
It is worth mentioning that every year, Stop TB Partnership and its partners unite to raise public awareness of the devastating health, social and economic impacts of TB and call for an end to the epidemic.

Provincial adviser says HIV-infected persons at increased risk of acquiring TB

Throwing light on HIV TB co-infection, Dr Afshan Isani, provincial TB adviser CDC Sindh, said that tuberculosis and HIV, both infections facilitate each other.
“HIV-infected persons are at increased risk of acquiring TB and management of TB HIV co-infected cases is more challenging. The number of new HIV cases is increasing every year. In 2022, about 30,000 new HIV cases were registered in the country,” she said.
Dr Salim Kazmi, senior technical adviser CDC, said that globally a lot is being done to implement the strategy that aims to end TB. Some recent developments include reducing the duration of treatment for sensitive TB in certain cases to four months and for drug-resistant TB to six months.
It is worth mentioning that multi drug resistant (MDR) TB is the one which grows when patients stop taking medicines without completion of course. The virus becomes so strong that the cost of treatment increases tenfold.
Dr Karam Shah, senior adviser, Stop TB Pakistan said that there was an urgent need to engage policymakers at district, provincial and federal levels to promote political commitment, to declare TB as a health priority and to allocate adequate domestic funding.
He added that different strategies could be used, including a parliamentary caucus and involvement of electronic, print, and social media.
He highlighted that according to the latest World Health Organisation (WHO) Global Tuberculosis Report 2022, total available funding for TB in Pakistan in 2021 was $47 million, out of which domestic funding was only 8pc while 92pc of the total funding came through international donors (mainly through Global Fund to Fight against AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria).
“Besides low allocation of domestic funds, timely release of funds without cuts and proper utilisation of allocated funds are common issues. Total dependence on international funding raises serious concerns about the sustainability of TB control services,” he said.

Mr Gandapur, a former federal minister, was arrested in Dera Ismail Khan on Thursday nightand remanded sent to the city’s central jail for six days.
An FIR registered against Mr Gandapur mentioned an audio leak in which he could be heard purportedlyusing derogatory language against the federal coalition. The case was registered on April 8 at Islamabad’s Golra police station under Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act.
The PTI leader was produced before ATC Judge Raja Jawad Abbas Hassan on Monday. The investigation officer sought his custody for conducting his voice matching test from the Punjab Forensic Science Laboratory.
Advocate Babar Awan argued before the court that the FIR was registered against the PTI leader on September 29 last year. He termed the arrest of Gandapur mala fide.
The court, on the request of Advocate Awan, sought details of cases registered against Mr Gandapur in Islamabad. The prosecution informed the judge that the PTI leader was facing 18 cases in the federal capital.
The court handed over his custody to the police for one day and directed them to produce him on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, a division bench of the IHC comprising Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb and Justice Arbab Mohammad Tahir sustained the objections of the registrar office on the maintainability of a petition filed seeking post-arrest protective bail in the first information report (FIR) registered with the Bhakkar police.
Advocate Sher Afzal Khan Marwat, the counsel for Mr Gandapur, argued before the court that the Dera Ismail Khan police had initially arrested his client who was later handed over to the Islamabad police in a case registered against him at the Golra police station.
He argued that Mr Gandapur was facing various FIRs for a single offence. The bench maintained the office’s objection that the under custody suspect cannot seek protective bail, and dismissed the petition.
The IHC single-member bench, comprising Justice Arbab Mohammad Tahir, also dismissed another petition of Mr Gandapur seeking post-arrest protective bail in an FIR registered with Lahore police.
The registrar office had raised a similar objection on the petition which was sustained by the court.
