            "Text": "The third and crucial phase of the upcoming general elections concluded on Wednesday as an election tribunal concluded the hearing of appeals against the rejection of nomination papers for seven national and 14 provincial assembly seats in Rawalpindi.\nIn a surprising development, the nomination papers of prominent Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leaders were approved, stipulating the political bigwigs into the election arena.\nThe nomination papers of former ministers and assembly members were initially rejected by returning officers, but the latest development has caused a significant political stir as these candidates re-entered the election arena.\nA total of 165 appeals were filed for national and provincial seats in Rawalpindi district, along with two national and four provincial seats in Mianwali. Among them, 103 appeals were approved, 56 were rejected, and six were withdrawn.\nThe appellate tribunal operating under the jurisdiction of the Lahore High Court\u2019s Rawalpindi Bench, consisting of Justice Mirza Waqas Rauf and Justice Chaudhary Abdul Aziz, issued verdicts on all filed appeals.\nAccepted appeals declared several candidates eligible for the upcoming election, including former interior minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, former Punjab speaker Sabtain Khan, deputy speaker Wasiq Qayyum Abbasi, former law minister Basharat Raja, former minister Raja Rashid Hafeez, former federal minister Ijazul Haq, Major Tahir Sadiq, Naz Sadiq, Iman Sadiq, Zulfi Bukhari, Ijaz Khan Jazi, Murtaza Satti, Major Latasab Sati, Ayaz Amir, Umair Khan Niazi, Fozia Behram, Colonel Ajmal Sabir, Seemabia Tahir, and Raja Nasir.\nRead\u00a0Tribunal gives clean chit to Sharif family to contest polls\nHowever, key figures such as former premier Imran Khan, former Punjab chief minister Pervaiz Elahi, former minister Fawad Chaudhary, Hiba Chaudhry, Hafiz Ammar Yasir, Arif Abbasi, and former prime minister Yusuf Raza Gilani\u2019s media advisor Mian Khurram Rasool had their appeals rejected, barring them from the election.\nCandidates whose appeals were rejected plan to challenge the election tribunal's decision in the Lahore High Court Larger Bench on Thursday.\nThe larger bench is expected to resolve all appeals within three days. The election tribunals forwarded the list of approved appeals to relevant returning officers on Wednesday, and a new list will be issued on Thursday, incorporating the approved names.\nIslamabad tribunal\nSeparately, an Islamabad appellate tribunal decided on 70 cases and approved 65 candidates\u2019 appeals against the rulings of returning officers.\nTribunal Judge Arbab Muhammad Tahir rejected two appeals against the approval of the nomination papers of a transgender candidate. Meanwhile, the judge rejected an appeal of a candidate against the rejection of his nomination papers on grounds of dual nationality. The appeals of all PTI candidates including Shoaib Shaheen, Niaz Ullah Niazi, and Zafarullah Shah were approved.\nIn the aftermath of these legal victories, PTI\u2019s prospects for the upcoming general elections in the region are bolstered.\nAs the election season unfolds, the party\u2019s focus on addressing internal discrepancies and presenting a united front becomes paramount.\n"

            "Text": "The ironing machine is an essential household item which serves as a basic necessity in every home. However, Sher Muhammad of Patiala still runs his business by taking it upon himself to iron people\u2019s clothes with his hand-crafted coal-powered iron at a nominal fee.\nIt can be said that iron plays an important role in shaping people\u2019s personality and surely, no one prefers to leave the house wearing clothes lined with creases. However, ironing can be a time-consuming task that may prove a challenge, especially in the case of smoothing out clothes fashioned from different kinds of fabric.\nThis is where Sher Muhammad comes in. A 75-year-old man from Patiala near Saidpuri Gate \u2013 the densest area of Rawalpindi \u2013 makes both ends meet by using a charcoal iron to provide ironing services to locals of the area and has been doing so for the past 70 years.\nTalking to The Express Tribune, Sher Muhammad said \u201cOur forefathers belong to Patiala, and we used to live in Saidpuri Gate before Pakistan was founded.\u201d\nHe says before the creation of Pakistan, Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims were living happily in one neighbourhood. \u201cWhen the movement for Pakistan started, the desire for a separate homeland arose in our hearts. I participated in the movement,\u201d he elaborated while sharing his life story.\nSher Muhammad explained that in the earlier days Kartarpura, Saidpuri Gate, Bhapara Bazaar, Haripur, and Bagh Sardaran were areas within old Rawalpindi that had central status. In these areas, resided the famous traders.\nRead\u00a0PPP rebukes PML-N claiming credit for Thar coal power project\nHindu and Sikh traders mostly wore white clothes and shawls and warm woollen clothes in the winter, while women used to wear silk, banarsi and cotton sarees. He said, \u201cWhen I started my service, I used to iron shalwar kameez for one rupee.\u201d\nMy iron was made of a block of iron worth Rs200, he said adding that irons like these are no longer manufactured and coal has also become expensive. \u201cNow I charge Rs100 to iron a pair of shalwar kameez. I iron the clothes of twenty-five houses in the neighbourhood and I have raised my children with the help of this iron,\u201d he exclaimed.\nSher Muhammad has three children. His eldest son has died, while two of his children work hard to run the household. His children are the ones who pay the ironing store\u2019s rent which costs Rs5,000 per month.\nIn the past, clothes were ironed on special occasions such as Eid or other festivals. However, people are now in the habit of regularly ironing clothes and they prefer to use an ironing machine made of iron. The main reason for this is that the weight of a machine made of iron helps press and smooth out fabric so that it gives the cloth a sheen of its own.\n"

Later, the issue was resolved with the intervention of senior officers and a case was registered. The affected traders demanded the Punjab chief minister take notice of the incident.\nA traders, Daniyal, informed the Jatli police team over the phone that the incident occurred when over 40 traders were on their way to the Lahore cattle market via the Peshawar Motorway in public transport. \nHowever, due to fog near the Balkasar Interchange, the Motorway police diverted the bus from the motorway towards the Sohawa, Chakwal GT Road.\nThe report stated that as soon as the bus covered some distance, seven robbers with pistols and a Kalashnikov in a car signalled to stop the bus. \nAs the robbers got into the vehicle, they asked the bus driver to keep moving, took all the cattle traders hostage at gunpoint, thrashed and beat them up and robbed them of their money.\nRead\u00a0Gang involved in heist busted\nThe affected traders said that they had reported the incident to Rescue 15, on which a preliminary report was lodged at the Jatli police station, Rawalpindi.
