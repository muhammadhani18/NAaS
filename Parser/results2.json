The flora and fauna of the park should be protected from forest fires by better preparedness, it added.\nThe board with its limited resources prepares a fire protection plan and requests other organisations such as civic agencies for their contribution in protection from forest fires, the letter added.\nThe administration was requested to prohibit BBQs, smoking, bonfires, burning and littering of garbage, plastic, carrying flammable items such as lighters, charcoal, matchstick, bottles of petrol and kerosene and tree cutting in the national park.\nIn response, the administration issued a notification. The notification said: \u201cIt has come to knowledge that BBQs, smoking, bonfires, burning and littering of garbage, littering of plastic, carrying flammable items such as lighters, charcoal, matchsticks, bottles of petrol/kerosene and tree cutting is leading to loss of habitat, polluting water and clearing or breaking up of land for other purposes in the Margalla Hills National Park, which constitute violations of the Islamabad Wildlife (Protection, Preservation, Conservation and Management) Ordinance 1979.\u201d\nThe order shall come into force with immediate effect and remain in force for two months, it added. \n"

He has used highly derogatory and indecent language while threatening the judges of the superior courts,\u201d read the order by the apex court.\nAt a function in Islamabad on Saturday, Mr Ilyas had indirectly blamed the judiciary for affecting the functioning of his government and interfering in the domain of the executive through grant of stay orders. \nHe had particularly referred to a $15m Saudi funded education sector project, saying it had been in a limbo because the court had issued a stay order on it. Similarly, he had also taken strong exception to the \u201cde-sealing by the courts of tobacco factories involved in tax evasion to the tune of billions of rupees.\u201d\nProducing the clipping of the premier\u2019s speech in its order, the apex court said that the matter was discussed at a meeting of the judges\u2019 council \u201cin view of its seriousness\u201d and it was unanimously decided \u201cit could not be overlooked because the dignity and authority of the courts was on stake and nobody could be allowed to undermine it.\u201d\n\u201cHowever, [\u2026] before issuing contempt notice we are intended to ask the Prime Minister to appear in person and explain his position on the referred news,\u201d it added.\nThe High Court order had almost identical observations.\n\u201cPrime Minister Tanveer Ilyas has directly threatened the superior judiciary and the language of his speech at a public meeting is highly derogatory, improper and indecently worded,\u201d the order said.\nNot only the latest statement, but his \u201cprevious track record from several months is [also] objectionable, unbecoming and improper,\u201d it added.\nThe order said the judges\u2019 council of the High Court had unanimously decided not to leave the mater unattended \u201csimply by shutting eye from contemptuous and derogatory statement of the person who is at the helm of affairs.\u201d\n\u201cBy showing magnanimity and judicial restraint, we have opted, in the beginning of the proceedings, to serve a notice on the prime minister to personally appear before the full court to explain his position.\u201d\nImmediately it was not clear that whether the PM would appear before the courts or not.\nIn Islamabad, when Mr Ilyas was questioned by some reporters about the notices, he maintained that he had just highlighted that stay orders had been affecting the projects of public utility.\n\u201cThis does not amount to contempt [of courts].\u201d \n"

He also said the principles outlined in the constitution reflects  Islamic, federal, democratic and  parliamentary Pakistan and these were the same principles which were outlined by Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah in his first address to the first Constituent Assembly of Pakistan on August 11, 1948.\nHe also said the construction of the monument was a very important and positive step.  He appreciated the tireless efforts of the former chairman Senate Raza Rabbani and his entire committee in establishing the monument.\nHe said the building of the constitution monument would spread awareness in the young  generation.

Even though rain lashed the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad, less water arrived in the lake from catchment areas.\nRawal Dam Superintendent Engineer Arsalan Ahmed told Dawn that there would be no shortage of water for the next five months while the coming monsoon will improve the water situation for city areas.\nHe said that water level in Rawal Lake was 1,744 feet while spillways were opened when the water level increased to 1,752 feet, adding that water storage was better and supply will continue towards Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) without any hurdle.\nRawal Dam is supplying 28 million gallons daily (MGD) of water to Rawalpindi city and Cantonment areas through Rawal Filtration plant after cleaning it. At present, the daily requirement of water in the garrison city is 60 MGD but the agency provides 54 MGD and there was shortage of six MGD.\nThere are three main sources of water for Rawalpindi city - Rawal Dam which provides 28 MGD, Khanpur Dam which provides six MGD and the remaining water is supplied through 420 tubewells. So Rawal Dam remains to be a major source of water.\nAs many as 61 union councils of Rawalpindi are supplied water from Rawal Dam. Pakistan Army, Pakistan Railways and other military organisations also rely on water from the dam.\nWasa spokesman Mohammad Umer Farooq said the agency was getting water from the Rawal lake as per routine and there was no shortage. However, he said that the agency was working on getting more water from Rawal Lake after starting its new project for reconstruction of its old line soon.\nOn the other hand, as per the Met Office, there will be no rain in the coming days.\n\u201cThe day temperature will rise further in the coming days as there is no chance of rain during the next one week,\u201d said an official of the department.\nHe said continental air is prevailing over most parts of the country. He said dry weather was expected in most parts of the country and it will remain hot in central/southern parts during day time. However, light rain-wind thunderstorm is expected at isolated places in northeastern Balochistan.\nIn the twin cities, the maximum temperature was recorded at 33C which is likely rise further in the next 24 hours.\n"

A large number of KIU students gathered outside the university vice chancellor\u2019s office in the main campus.\nThe students held placards, some of which stated, \u2018Anti Education Policies not Accepted\u2019. They were chanting slogans against the vice chancellor and university administration.\nAli Kawish, a student of the engineering department told Dawn that the university administration increased semester fee by 20pc in this semester.\nHe said on the university\u2019s website, the semester fee has been fixed at Rs32,000 while on vouchers, the fee is fixed at Rs50,000.\nHe said in public-sector universities in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab, students of the engineering department pay semester fees that are less than that in KIU.\nAli said that only one permanent teacher is available in the engineering department while two teachers have been hired as visiting teachers.\nHe said the laboratory has not been established in the department for students and the conditions of class rooms are also dilapidated.\nAlamdar Hussain, one of the organisers of the protest, said the university administration failed to provide facilities to students. There are numerous issues faced by students.\nShakeel Ahmed, another student said it is amazing that the university increases fees continously but does not provide basic facilities.\nProtesters said that financial grants from the Higher Education Commission (HEC), the GB government and international organisations are provided to the university.\nThey said how and where the funds are being utilised no one can know.\nSania Essa, a protester, said that many international organisations provided funds for scholarships however deserved students still do not get them.\nThey said the university is marred by financial irregularities and mismanagement. They asked the prime minister of Pakistan to intervene in the situation and play a role to provide justice to thousands of students.\nLater, the university management held negotiations with protesters and told them that the cut in financial grant from HEC causes increase of fees.\nThe university management assured protesters that their demands would be fulfilled.\n"

            "Text": "RAWALPINDI: The Punjab Cabinet Committee on Dengue Control on Monday directed the district authorities to improve the mechanism of monitoring, reporting, and surveillance of dengue, as the commissioner separately confirmed two cases of dengue virus reported in the district.\nThe direction came during a meeting of the committee attended by provincial ministers Dr Jamal Nasir, Dr Javed Akram, Azfar Ali, Mansoor Qadir, the chief secretary, and secretaries of various departments.\nDr Jamal Nasir said that an effective system should be devised instead of traditional methods to control dengue and the existing resources of hospitals should be used for anti-dengue activities. He directed that special attention should be paid to getting rid of dengue larvae in parks and other open places.\nDr Javed Akram said that for the complete elimination of dengue, there was a need to work along the scientific lines and raise awareness among people through community mobilisation.\nThe meeting decided to establish paraplegic centers in five cities for the rehabilitation of people suffering from traumatic spinal cord injury.\nThe chief secretary also issued instructions to the deputy commissioners regarding the prevention of smog. He said that special measures should be taken to prevent air pollution at construction sites. He added that only kilns with zigzag technology would be allowed to operate.\nMeanwhile, Rawalpindi Commissioner Liaquat Ali Chattha said that about 400 vacant plots have been identified in the Rawalpindi district, whose owners have been instructed to build boundary walls around the plots. He said that rainwater accumulates in the garbage dumped in the plots which lead to the breeding of dengue larvae. He said that plots that will not be cleaned and fenced would be marked \u2018red\u2019.\nHe expressed these views while addressing the participants of the anti-dengue meeting at the Commissioner\u2019s office. The commissioner directed the Rawalpindi Metropolitan Corporation to finalise the SOPs regarding building materials as soon as possible. He further said that public involvement in anti-dengue activities was important because lack of cleanliness was the main cause of dengue breeding.\nMr Chatha said two confirmed cases of dengue have been reported in the district so far. In graveyards and parks, where wild bushes grow, there is a risk of water accumulation, so emphasis should be placed on surveillance in these areas, he said and directed that immediate disposal of solid waste should be ensured.\nHe directed that the teams appointed for dengue surveillance should try to control the growth of dengue larvae by checking graveyards and other places on a daily basis. \u201cTeams must share their live location during their field visit and there should be no fake activity,\u201d he added. \n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: As many as 611,000 people have fallen ill due to tuberculosis (TB) in Pakistan over the past two years whereas 48,000 HIV-negative and 2,100 HIV-positive people died due to TB in the country but only 55pc of the cases were notified.\nVice chair of Stop TB Pakistan Dr Sharaf Ali Shah said this while speaking to participants of a seminar held on Monday.\nAccording to a statement released on Monday, the event was organised by Stop TB Partnership Pakistan in collaboration with the Centres for Disease Control (CDC) and Pfizer Pakistan.\nHighlighting the reasons for low TB case notification, Dr Shah said that poor understanding of TB and its symptoms (lack of awareness), poor knowledge about where to seek care and misconceptions around anti-TB drug availability at public sector health facilities, cost of transportation and loss of daily wages were some of the main factors.\nIt is worth mentioning that every year, Stop TB Partnership and its partners unite to raise public awareness of the devastating health, social and economic impacts of TB and call for an end to the epidemic.\n\nProvincial adviser says HIV-infected persons at increased risk of acquiring TB\n\nThrowing light on HIV TB co-infection, Dr Afshan Isani, provincial TB adviser CDC Sindh, said that tuberculosis and HIV, both infections facilitate each other.\n\u201cHIV-infected persons are at increased risk of acquiring TB and management of TB HIV co-infected cases is more challenging. The number of new HIV cases is increasing every year. In 2022, about 30,000 new HIV cases were registered in the country,\u201d she said.\nDr Salim Kazmi, senior technical adviser CDC, said that globally a lot is being done to implement the strategy that aims to end TB. Some recent developments include reducing the duration of treatment for sensitive TB in certain cases to four months and for drug-resistant TB to six months.\nIt is worth mentioning that multi drug resistant (MDR) TB is the one which grows when patients stop taking medicines without completion of course. The virus becomes so strong that the cost of treatment increases tenfold.\nDr Karam Shah, senior adviser, Stop TB Pakistan said that there was an urgent need to engage policymakers at district, provincial and federal levels to promote political commitment, to declare TB as a health priority and to allocate adequate domestic funding.\nHe added that different strategies could be used, including a parliamentary caucus and involvement of electronic, print, and social media.\nHe highlighted that according to the latest World Health Organisation (WHO) Global Tuberculosis Report 2022, total available funding for TB in Pakistan in 2021 was $47 million, out of which domestic funding was only 8pc while 92pc of the total funding came through international donors (mainly through Global Fund to Fight against AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria).\n\u201cBesides low allocation of domestic funds, timely release of funds without cuts and proper utilisation of allocated funds are common issues. Total dependence on international funding raises serious concerns about the sustainability of TB control services,\u201d he said.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Monday remanded PTI leader Ali Amin Gandapur in police custody for one day while Islamabad High Court (IHC) rejected his petitions seeking post-arrest protective bail in cases registered in Punjab.\nMr Gandapur, a former federal minister, was arrested in Dera Ismail Khan on Thursday nightand remanded sent to the city\u2019s central jail for six days.\nAn FIR registered against Mr Gandapur mentioned an audio leak in which he could be heard purportedlyusing derogatory language against the federal coalition. The case was registered on April 8 at Islamabad\u2019s Golra police station under Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act.\nThe PTI leader was produced before ATC Judge Raja Jawad Abbas Hassan on Monday. The investigation officer sought his custody for conducting his voice matching test from the Punjab Forensic Science Laboratory.\nAdvocate Babar Awan argued before the court that the FIR was registered against the PTI leader on September 29 last year. He termed the arrest of Gandapur mala fide.\nThe court, on the request of Advocate Awan, sought details of cases registered against Mr Gandapur in Islamabad. The prosecution informed the judge that the PTI leader was facing 18 cases in the federal capital.\nThe court handed over his custody to the police for one day and directed them to produce him on Tuesday.\nMeanwhile, a division bench of the IHC comprising Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb and Justice Arbab Mohammad Tahir sustained the objections of the registrar office on the maintainability of a petition filed seeking post-arrest protective bail in the first information report (FIR) registered with the Bhakkar police.\nAdvocate Sher Afzal Khan Marwat, the counsel for Mr Gandapur, argued before the court that the Dera Ismail Khan police had initially arrested his client who was later handed over to the Islamabad police in a case registered against him at the Golra police station.\nHe argued that Mr Gandapur was facing various FIRs for a single offence. The bench maintained the office\u2019s objection that the under custody suspect cannot seek protective bail, and dismissed the petition.\nThe IHC single-member bench, comprising Justice Arbab Mohammad Tahir, also dismissed another petition of Mr Gandapur seeking post-arrest protective bail in an FIR registered with Lahore police.\nThe registrar office had raised a similar objection on the petition which was sustained by the court.\n"
