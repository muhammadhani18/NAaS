[PM Shehbaz took over] the government [when it was] caught in the vortex of economic and social conditions in a constitutional manner [and handled the matters],\u201d the former premier said while addressing the guests at an iftar dinner hosted by a former MPA of the PP-16 constituency of Rawalpindi.\nHe added that free flour was being distributed among the deserving people of the country by reducing government expenditure.\nAbbasi further claimed that the PML-N was the only party engaged in serving the people by bringing facilities to their doorsteps.\nHe pointed out that 100 million deserving people would be provided with free flour through one of the biggest schemes launched in the country.\n\u201cThis scheme has been launched, setting aside political point scoring, only with the spirit of humanitarian service to provide relief to the people during the holy month of Ramazan,\u201d he maintained.\n\u201cThe poor Pakistanis, who will receive the free flour, will pray for the integrity of Pakistan,\u201d he added.\nThe PML-N leader claimed that had the PTI still remained in power, the country would have defaulted on its external repayments by now.\nHe continued that the PML-N was closely monitoring the country\u2019s economy.\nAbbasi maintained that the current rulers were forced to make tough decisions because the Imran-led government had destroyed the economy.\nHe added that the country was in the midst of financial difficulties, but he could claim that the country would never default.\nThe former premier noted that creating an atmosphere of uncertainty was enmity with the country, adding that the economic situation would improve soon.\nSpeaking on the occasion, former PML-N MNA Hanif Abbasi said the era of conspiracies had passed and party supremo Nawaz Sharif would return to the country soon.\nHe added that the PML-N was like a family.\nHanif noted that the country\u2019s economy was under pressure, but claimed that the situation would improve soon.\n\u201cWe have to face these problems together,\u201d he added.\nHanif claimed that the PML-N would sweep the polls across the country, especially in Rawalpindi.\nFormer PML-N senator Chaudhry Tanveer Khan said difficulties could be overcome by implementing the Constitution as well as laws and development was possible.\nHowever, he added that the country could not develop in a state of uncertainty.\nHe said the Almighty had granted his special grace to Pakistan and despite difficulties, the country would never default.\nHe pointed out that political stability could lead to improvement in the economic situation.\n\u201cInstead of going after each other, the country \u2018s interest should be considered first,\u201d the ex-senator said, while advising political rivals.\nHe continued that criticising and ridiculing each other could only make matters worse, and not improve them.\n\u201cPakistan is not the country of one person or group, it is the country of all of us,\u201d he added.\nThe former senator maintained that the PML-N would not rest easy even if Nawaz became the premier for the fourth time.\nAddressing the ceremony, Begum Tahira Aurangzeb said Nawaz was the heartbeat of millions of people of this country.\nShe added that the PML-N supremo could not be removed from the hearts of the people unjustly.\nFormer mayor Sardar Naseem, Barrister Daniyal Tanveer Chaudhry, Haji Parvez Khan, Raja Haneef Advocate, Rahat Quddusi, Sheikh Arsalan Hafeez, and Zaibun Nisa Awan also spoke on the occasion.\nThey maintained that the present government was in strong hands and those who pushed the country to the brink of default had to face defeat.\n"

The SC office also observed that a second review petition could not be filed against a decision already given on a review petition. The RO had highlighted that the curative appeals contained many other deficiencies.\nSubsequently, the federal government had lodged an appeal before the SC against the refusal by the RO to entertain unheard of legal remedy \u2014 curative review petition \u2014 in the Justice Isa case.\nHowever, on March 30, the PDM government led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif ordered the withdrawal of the curative review reference as the government decided to not pursue the matter further.\nRead Curative review: CJ\u2019s role \u2018crucial\u2019 in Justice Isa case\nSpeaking to journalists after CJ Bandial completed the in-chamber hearing, Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Awan revealed that the government has submitted that \"in our Constitution, there is no room for a second review or curative review\".\n\"In India, a second review was filed after a court judgment which was decided in 2002 following which the Supreme Court of India amended its rules and created a provision for curative review, pursuant to that judgment\" he explained.\n\"That amendment was followed by judicial proceedings,\" he said, \"whereas in this case there was an objection on the administrative side by the RO, against which there exists a remedy in the rules\".\n\"At that time (when the reference was filled) the government did not avail that remedy, [but] this government is no longer interested in availing the remedy, it seeks to withdraw that appeal,\" said AGP Awan.\n\"If the withdrawal order goes through then the consequence will be that the office order will be sustained, and that will be the end of it.\"\nHe did not reveal further details about the proceedings, however.\nRead more Reference against judges: Not a viable option\nThe AGP also declined to comment on a journalist's question about the maintainability of a reference against a CJ according to the constitution.\nIt may be noted here that earlier this month, the country\u2019s top security czar had said the incumbent coalition government may file references against the three SC judges including CJP Bandial who heard and decided on the plea against the postponement of polls in Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P).\n"

The meeting also discussed other pertinent issues.\nZiaul Haq Sarhadi, Coordinator and Director of PAJCCI, emphasized the need for steps to remove hindrances in the way of Pak-Afghan mutual trade and transit trade.\nHe explained that while there was no issue from the customs department at Torkham, Ghulam Khan, Kharlachi border, other institutions took a significant amount of time on checking. This slow processing has caused great difficulties for the business community, Sarhadi added.\nSarhadi further stated that despite official orders of cross-stuffing, the directives have not been implemented, and detention charges were also levied on each container.\nThe FCCA president suggested that Afghan transit trade goods should be carried out from Karachi to Torkham through Pakistan Railways along with a bonded carrier service. He urged the authorities concerned to allow filing of GD (Goods Documents) at Azakhel Dry Port, so that the customs clearing agents of K-P could also continue their business.\n"

            "Text": "Although not really known for actively enforcing traffic laws, the city of flowers\u2019 police can now add another feather to its cap for failing to curb the relentless rise of unregistered motorbikes in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) capital.\nEither due to a disregard for their duty or just sheer helplessness in trying to enforce the writ of the state, Peshawar\u2019s traffic police has consistently failed to get unregistered motorbikes, which are often used in the commission of street crime and terrorism, off the city\u2019s roads.\nAs per information obtained by The Express Tribune by the provincial Excise Department, Peshawar is home to more than 150,000 unregistered bikes. The Express Tribune also learnt that out of the 150,000 number, about 100,000 motorbikes\u2019 registration has already been processed but their respective owners have failed to show up at the excise office to pick up the number plates for the past 6 months \u2014 which officials believe is a deliberate act.\nFarooq Khan, who has been running a motorcycle dealership in Peshawar for the past decade, has no doubt that bike owners deliberately avoid getting number plates. \u201cWhenever someone purchases a bike, we provide them with a company receipt and ask them to take it to the Excise Department for registration,\u201d explained Khan, \u201chowever, they skip going to the excise office and instead drive around with impunity, using the company receipt as proof of ownership.\u201d\nKhan further said that motorcycle owners who claim that they do not get their bike registered because of the high costs are lying \u201cbecause it only costs Rs 4,000 for the entire process.\u201d However, it is perhaps unfair to put the blame entirely on motorcyclists as the traffic police does not care much for catching unregistered motorbikes, according to Khan. \u201cThey [traffic police] run a campaign against unregistered bikes once in a blue moon and then call it a day.\u201d\nThis apparent disregard for enforcing traffic laws means that unregistered bikes can easily be used to commit crimes. Evidence of which is the cold-blooded murder of Muhammad Amir, a resident of the Chamkani area, who was shot by robbers riding an unregistered motorcycle and thus have not been identified yet.\nIn this regard, Riaz Khan, the Spokesperson for K-P Police, while talking to The Express Tribune, conceded that in Peshawar unregistered motorbikes are relied upon heavily by criminals involved in mobile phone snatching and robberies. \u201cHowever, we have taken action against 32,913 unregistered motorcyclists in the past 13 months,\u201d he hastened to add.\nThe Express Tribune also spoke to Peshawar\u2019s SSP Traffic, Qamar Hayat, regarding the department\u2019s failure to get unregistered motorbikes off the city\u2019s roads, who informed that the sale of unregistered motorbikes has now been outlawed. \u201cNow, motorcycle dealerships and dealers will make sure that the registration process is completed before they allow a bike to leave their shop,\u201d said Hayat, adding that dealerships across the city had already agreed to such stringent measures. \u201cIf anyone is found aiding the sale of unregistered motorcycles, they will face harsh legal consequences,\u201d cautioned Hayat while talking to The Express Tribune.\n"

            "Text": "Yet another cleric has been gunned down in Bajaur tribal district of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P).\nPolice told The Express Tribune that in the Mamond area of Bajaur, unidentified miscreants opened fire. As a result, Maulana Naseeb Gul was killed on the spot while his friend Mufti Shafiullah critically injured.\n\u201cBoth of them were on their way back home in a motorcar after shopping in the Lagharai Bazaar when unidentified men ambushed them,\u201d a police official said, adding that the attackers managed to flee after committing the crime.\nThe injured was rushed to the Khar Hospital for treatment from where he was referred to the Lady Reading Hospital (LRH).\nPolice reached the site of the attack and cordoned off the entire area and conducted a door-to-door search operation. Local residents said that the slain cleric was a member of the Panjpiri group which is also known as Wahabi sect.\nAttacks on clerics\nMany Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) clerics and senior party members have been killed in Bajaur district in recent years.\nIn March 2021, JUI leader Maulana Abdul Salam was seriously injured in a remote-controlled bomb blast in the Dama Dola area of Mamund tehsil in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa\u2019s Bajaur tribal district.\nPolice officials told The Express Tribune that Maulana Salam was going to his madrassah early in the morning when he was hit by a roadside bomb. Police believed that a remote-controlled explosive device had been planted by the roadside and he was precisely the target.\nHe was later shifted to Peshawar for treatment where he succumbed to his injuries days later.\nThe attack was claimed by Islamic State-Khorasan.\nIn April 2022, Mufti Shafiullah, a JUI activist and an Arabic teacher at Government High School Badan, was targeted in a roadside bomb attack as he was on his way to school as per his daily routine.\n\u201cMufti Shafiullah was going to school. As per his habit he walked to school and during his walk, an IED device exploded near him. He was seriously injured in the explosion and rushed to a hospital where he succumbed to his wounds,\u201d the district police officer said.\n\u201cThe deceased was an active member of Jamiat,\u201d he said.\nIn November 2022, another ardent activist of JUI-F, Qari Ilyas, was shot dead in the tribal district and for the first time in the history of the tribal district, women staged a sit-in against the brutal murder.\nWidespread protests erupted against the murder which continued for two days. The women of the Qari Ilyas family, including his widow and mother, also participated in the sit-in. They blamed that Qari Ilays repeatedly demanded of the authorities that there were threats to his life but it was denied each time so the district administration was responsible for his death.\nAll the markets in Bajaur district also remained closed in protest.\nLawyers also didn\u2019t attend the courts as a mark of solidarity with the strike.\n"

            "Text": "Justice Qazi Faez Isa\u2014the senior most judge of the apex court after the chief justice\u2014has said he stands with the Constitution at a time when the federal government and the judiciary are at loggerheads and the schism between two groups of the Supreme Court judges is no longer a secret.\nThe presence of the senior puisne judge in the National Assembly\u2019s hall at the golden jubilee of the 1973 Constitution triggered a controversy as some critics said the judge shouldn\u2019t have attended the ceremony where he sat among the lawmakers whose cases he once heard in his courtroom.\nJustice Isa, who walked to the Parliament House from the Supreme Court building, was the only top court judge to attend the National Constitution Convention (NCC).\nIt is learnt that National Assembly Speaker Raja Pervez Ashraf had invited all Supreme Court judges. However, no one opted to attend the event except Justice Isa.\nAs he went back to the Supreme Court from the Parliament House after making a speech, several people, including YouTubers, intercepted the judge and asked him various questions but he remained silent, conveying that he had said whatever he wanted to say at the assembly hall.\nIt surprised many when Justice Isa sat in the front row on the treasury benches along with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, former president Asif Ali Zardari and Finance Minister Ishaq Dar.\nThough members of the legal fraternity considered Justice Isa\u2019s presence in the parliament as a historical development, they said the senior puisne judge should have avoided attending the convention in view of the current polarization arising out of the Punjab polls\u2019 case.\nDespite the government\u2019s reservations, incumbent Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial had recently ordered elections in Punjab. Subsequently, the National Assembly had passed a resolution against the SC verdict while the government had asked the top judge to step down.\nFormer Sindh High Court Bar Association president Salahuddin Ahmed, who was a member of Justice Isa\u2019s legal team once, said Justice Isa should not have attended the convention at a time of political turmoil. \u201cPerceptions matter. Even if he went there, he should have sat separately,\u201d he added.\nHowever, he said, those calling it a misconduct or unprecedented are uninformed. Even former chief justice Awnar Zaheer Jamali had addressed the Senate during his tenure. Interestingly, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) did not give an official response to Justice Isa participation in the event.\nRead Judiciary, executive trying to cool frayed tempers\nHowever, pro-PTI lawyers and media persons criticized Justice Isa for sitting with the lawmakers who got relief from his court in the past. For instance, Ishaq Dar, who was sitting on his left side, is a beneficiary of his ruling in the Hudabiya Paper Mills reference case. Also, Zardari, who was sitting on the right side, was exonerated by the Memogate Commission led by Justice Isa.\nThe commission, whose report was authored by Justice Isa, had conceded in its final report, presented before a larger bench of the Supreme Court that \u201cno evidence was produced before us that would indicate that President Asif Ali Zardari had either authorised the preparation of the memorandum or directed that it be sent to the American administration\u2026\u201d\nJustice Isa started his speech by saying that he came to the parliament to convey that he along with his institution stands with the Constitution. In his speech, Justice Isa said the judiciary, the parliament and the executive\u2019s purpose is one and that is to serve the people.\n\u00a0In his non-political speech, Justice Isa said the Supreme Court\u2019s job is to swiftly decide cases as per the law and the Constitution; the parliament\u2019s job is to enact legislation which is better for the people; and the executive and the government\u2019s job is to implement the laws and the policies for the betterment of the people.\nAddressing the speaker, Justice Isa said he had asked him before coming to the parliament if the speeches and discussion would only be limited to the Constitution and they would not wade into politics, saying that wasn\u2019t the case.\n\u201cA lot of political speeches have been made,\u201d Justice Isa said, smiling. \u201cIt\u2019s their [politicians'] right guaranteed by the Constitution; I don\u2019t say anything to them but it doesn\u2019t mean that I agree with them.\u201d\nJustice Isa said he wanted to clarify things as cases involving lawmakers might come up before him; decisions might come against them and they might speak against him in the same assembly hall. \u201cI came here because it was the Constitution's golden jubilee today; its celebration day,\u201d he said.\nRead more Govt demands CJ Bandial to step down\nDuring his speech, Justice Isa recalled that his father was the only member from Balochistan in Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah\u2019s 19-member central working committee of the All India Muslim League, saying his father had established the Muslim League in Balochistan.\nAt one point, Justice Isa said the Englishmen, who ruled the subcontinent, could have provided better administration but we wanted to move ahead by learning from our mistakes.\nJustice Isa also spoke about division in the judicial corridors since independence.\nHe said he didn\u2019t like the use of the word minority as those referred to as minority, are equal citizens and have contributed in the making of the country and afterwards.\n\u00a0\u201cWe [judges] write judgments and do not give speeches,\u201d Justice Isa said.\nIn his speech, he also discussed the impact of the dissolution of the constituent assembly by Governor General Ghulam Muhammad in 1954.\nJustice Isa also fondly remembered a former jurist of Parsi descent, Justice Dorab Patel, saying Justice Patel had refused to take oath of allegiance when former military ruler Gen Ziaul Haq issued a Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO).\nLauding Justice Patel\u2019s stance, Justice Isa questioned: \u201cIf we had stood by Maulvi Tamizuddin at the time when the courts had stood by him \u2014 and rejected Ghulam Mohammad\u2019s decree \u2014 do you think we would have seen the divide we see today?\u201d\n\"The Constitution is 50-year-old now; we should keep it close to our heart now,\u201d Justice Isa said. \"The Constitution should be cherished because it guarantees peoples\u2019 rights, which is the most important thing.\"\nEndorsing a resolution calling for teaching the Constitution in schools, Justice Isa said it is essential for the people to understand the kind of power the Constitution gives them.\nHe said his wife used to teach at an American school and she told him that the school taught the children about the Constitution, right to vote, among other things, from an early stage.\nHe said Pakistan\u2019s Constitution guarantees several rights that were not part of several other countries\u2019 constitutions. He gave an example of giving right to information under Article 19-A of the Constitution.\nJustice Isa said anybody could criticize him if he fails to defend the Constitution. Before concluding his roughly 15-minute speech, Justice Isa said he as well as the politicians have taken an oath to protect the Constitution.\nHe reiterated that he has nothing to do with the political speeches made before his speech. \u201cIt may be possible that tomorrow your case is presented before me. Do not then say that I ruled against you despite being invited here today,\u201d he quipped.\n"

He was driven to the Kharian Combined Military Hospital where doctors pronounced him dead on arrival, they added.\nIn a tweet on Monday, Imran said: \u201cWe demand a proper inquiry into the sudden death of SHO Amir Shehzad, of a heart attack.

It is equally important to recall the mysterious circumstances surrounding the death of FIA investigator Dr Rizwan as well as the deaths of Maqsood Chaprassi & all other witnesses in Shahbaz Sharif's money laundering case.\nMeanwhile, criticising the incumbent rulers, Imran underscored that they came to power just to close their corruption case.\nNearly 60% of the federal cabinet was on bails when they were imposed in the country.\nRead Multan-leg of PTI's 'Jail Bharo Tehreek' also ends with no arrests\nThey had given themselves a clean chit in the corruption cases of over Rs1,100 billion by amending the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) law and appointing their own persons at the anti-graft body, while the PTI government recovered looted money of Rs480 billion during its tenure, he highlighted.\nImran\nsaid the imported government had ruined all state institutions. The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and the police were being used to register fake cases and torturing the PTI leaders and workers.\nThe sanctions which were imposed on the PTI during the current regime had no example in the democratic history of the country.\nThe police and the law enforcement agencies had trampled the sanctity of \u201cchadar and chardewari\u201d by trespassing into the houses of the PTI leaders and workers, he said, adding that an attempt was made on his life while hundreds of his party workers had been arrested.\nHe said his party leaders and workers, including Azam Swati, Shahbaz Gill and others, journalists as well as social media activists had undergone custodial torture.\n\u201cA conspiracy was hatched to assassinate me in Murtaza Bhutto-style murder in the court compound in Islamabad. My chief of Staff, Shibli Faraz, was tortured in the Islamabad court compound. The main objective of the incumbent rulers was to weaken the state institutions to protect their looted wealth. Instead of focusing on the national economy, the government had all its focus on tightening the noose around its opponents by registering fake cases.\u201d\nOn the Toshakhana (gifts\u2019 repository) case, the PTI chief said the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had made a false case against him which would conclude soon.\n\u201cHowever, they hit an axe on their own foot by making a fake Toshakhana case against me. Now, both Nawaz Sharif and Zardari will face music when the PTI will unveil their thefts in Toshakhana. Both had illegally acquired expensive cars from the gift repository,\u201d he pointed out.\nImran said the imported rulers had also compromised the role of the opposition by appointing Raja Riaz as the opposition leader in the National Assembly.\n"

            "Text": "With ever-increasing gold prices, gold jewellery has gone out of the reach of most people. In such situation, artificial jewellery is one of the must-buy items when women go shopping for Eid. Since it is cheap, women can afford artificial jewellery despite the neck-breaking inflation in the country.\nThe most popular areas for artificial jewellery shopping include Hyderi Market, Tariq Road, Bahadurabad, Jama Market, Liaquatabad, PIB, Saddar, Bohri Bazaar, Bolton Market, Gulistan-e-Johar, Shaheed-e-Millat Road, Metro Mall, Gulf Centre, Karimabad, Dolmen Mall and Hyper Star. Women say that changing the design of gold jewellery is difficult. \"Nowadays, more than 90 per cent women wear artificial jewellery on Eid, weddings, and other events,\" one woman told The Express Tribune.\n\"The best thing about artificial jewellery is that we can have it matching with dresses for different events,\" she added. Shopkeepers and traders say that artificial jewellery is 20-30 per cent dearer than last year. This year the variety of artificial jewellery is limited because the government has banned imports of several items due to the dollars shortage in the country. Last year earrings from China and India were popular among women, but they have simply disappeared from the market this year. In summer, women prefer light tops, pendants, bracelets, and rings instead of heavy jewellery because they have to prepare meals for their families even on Eid day. On the other hand young girls try to buy the jewellery designs they find on social media.\nThe outbreak of the novel coronavirus pandemic in 2020 had triggered a trend among women to shop for artificial jewellery online. This also led to more and more middle-class women entrepreneurs joining this online business and now we see a large number of ecommerce websites doing roaring business, getting orders not only from Pakistan but also from abroad. Such women are not only financially independent but also employ other women. \"Quality artificial jewellery made in modern designs is becoming expensive day by day,\" said Sana, a woman shopper on Tariq Road.\n\"In such a situation, it is unimaginable to buy even artificial jewellery manufactured by top brands,\" she added. Working women prefer to buy foreign artificial jewellery. \"There is no point in buying heavy and expensive artificial jewellery on occasions like Eid because these ornaments cannot be worn afterwards,\" Aliya, a working woman, told The Express Tribune. \"Light and sophisticated artificial jewellery, such as pendants and rings, can be also worn in daily life,\" she added.\nAccording to shopkeepers, women from middle and lower middle classes prefer to buy light jewellery in the range of Rs1,500-2,000 due to the rising inflation. Such jewellery is not only attractive but also affordable. President of Bolton Market Artificial Jewellery Association, Anwar Mamo, said that there is an increasing trend among women to buy jewellery matching with their dresses. \"Because of this, jewellery with zircon gemstones has become popular,\" he said. \"Zircon jewellery can cost you from a few hundreds to thousands.

One reason behind such bazaars is to allow people to continue the custom of buying new outfits and shoes for Eid.\nAt one such Bachat Bazaar in Gulshan-e-Iqbal area of Karachi, there are a variety of stalls offering women's unstitched clothes, children's ready-to-wear clothes, sandals and slippers, bangles, henna, and jewelry. A person selling ready-towear dresses for girls says that the price of pret has increased by 30 to 40 per cent compared to last year.\nThe effects of inflation have not spared Bachat Bazaars, he said, adding that sales were down 50 percent compared to last year. For the shoppers, such markets are ideal for bargain deals. One shopper told The Express Tribune that she had brought her family to the market save money. \"Some items are available at a discount while others are available at the same rate as elsewhere,\" she said. Some buyers were unhappy with the quality of the product.\n"

Last month, the chief justice of the Sindh High Court took notice of the case and sought a detailed report.

            "Text": "China is currently focused on revitalising the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which was expected following the relaxation of Covid-19 policies.\nSince the recent two sessions, efforts to do so have been accelerated. It is anticipated that China will offer new opportunities for investment, with Chinese companies likely to invest in countries along the BRI. However, this new momentum of investment will be accompanied by a new philosophy of development, centred around the principles of high-quality development and green recovery.\nChina has made it clear that in order to achieve prosperity for both China and the world, development must adhere to the principles of ecological civilisation and sustainable development. It is crucial for Pakistan to contemplate the pace of implementation and status of projects under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).\nPakistan must also explore how to adjust its policy framework to benefit from the new philosophy and principles of high-quality development. This is especially important for Pakistan, as the country is highly susceptible to the effects of climate change and requires a development model that is compatible with the climate.\nFurthermore, China has identified Pakistan as a high-priority country and intends to give a boost to the CPEC initiative. During Ahsan Iqbal\u2019s visit, the Chinese leadership expressed strong desire to increase investment under CPEC.\nIn order to capitalise on the new opportunities, Pakistan must refine its existing policy and implementation framework. Merely making big statements and staging photo-ops will not suffice. Pakistan must take concrete steps and introduce a series of reforms in order to fully benefit from the new opportunities. These steps should be innovative and forward-thinking, as they have the potential to help in economic recovery.\nTo achieve this goal, Pakistan must move beyond relying on the euphoria of its strategic location. While it is true that Pakistan occupies a strategic location, it alone will not help.\nFurthermore, the notion of strategic location is relative and not absolute. For instance, if Pakistan wishes to access Central Asia, it must first pass through Afghanistan. In such a scenario, Afghanistan would be deemed to hold the strategic location.\nAdditionally, Pakistan must consolidate the progress made under CPEC. However, the current institutional framework and business environment are not conducive to fast-tracking implementation. In fact, they are likely to create hurdles.\nDespite Pakistan\u2019s improvement in the ease of doing business ranking, ground-level issues still persist. The business community has to deal with numerous organisations, institutes, and departments to pay taxes, obtain licences, or register a company.\nFor instance, there are 35 different tax agencies in Pakistan, resulting in wastage of time and resources. Moreover, the institutional system is inefficient and displays signs of rent-seeking.\nIn a nutshell, the process is cumbersome and discourages potential investors and industrialists from investing in Pakistan. In this backdrop, it is imperative for Pakistan to move beyond rhetoric and adopt measures that can give a fresh impetus to CPEC implementation.\nOne plausible solution could be to revive the CPEC Authority, which was an excellent initiative of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government. Although the CPEC Authority was primarily created as a monitoring body, it played a crucial role in facilitating stakeholders to implement CPEC projects.\nEven during the pandemic, the CPEC Authority continued to function and deliver results, demonstrating the resilience and determination of Pakistan and China to keep CPEC moving forward.\nHowever, the previous structure and setup of the CPEC Authority may not be adequate to meet the demands of the second phase of CPEC. The authority was previously responsible for overseeing and monitoring ongoing projects.\nTo fulfil the requirements of the second phase, a more robust and dynamic authority is required. Therefore, it is necessary to reform the authority, and the following suggestions are proposed for discussion and consideration:\nFirstly, it is necessary to elevate the status of CPEC Authority. The head of CPEC Authority should hold the rank of a federal minister. Furthermore, the CPEC Authority should be granted the power to make and execute decisions in close collaboration with relevant ministries and departments.\nSecondly, it is important to centralise services and work related to CPEC, particularly for industrialisation and agriculture, under the CPEC Authority.\nCurrently, these activities are scattered and time-consuming. Therefore, they should be consolidated under the CPEC Authority, which should also be authorised to issue licences, provide access to services such as electricity and gas, and manage taxation.\nThirdly, the CPEC Authority should have a diversified structure with two distinct departments: governance and research. The governance department would be responsible for programme execution, ensuring transparency and accountability. The research department would be tasked with devising innovative ways to attract investment, analysing international markets and global investment policies, and helping the government understand the philosophy of green BRI.\nFourthly, the CPEC Authority should be an apolitical body, immune to changes in government. As all political parties and stakeholders have consensus on CPEC, it should not be difficult to ensure that the authority remains apolitical. It is imperative that all political parties and stakeholders work together to ensure the authority\u2019s continuity and stability.\nFifth, to ensure inclusiveness, the government could establish a National CPEC Committee (NCC), chaired by the prime minister of Pakistan.\nThe committee should include representatives from the five leading political parties, the leader of the opposition, the chief ministers of provinces, the prime minister of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, the services chiefs, and the Chief Justice of Pakistan.\nThis committee could help address challenges that have arisen since the 18th Amendment and provide vision and direction for strengthening cooperation. To ensure higher standards of work and transparency, a strong monitoring and accountability mechanism would be necessary. To achieve this, a sub-committee could be created by the NCC to oversee and enforce transparency and accountability measures.\nThis sub-committee would be the most suitable forum, as it has representation from all major stakeholders.\nIn conclusion, the CPEC Authority should be staffed with genuine economic experts and political economists with a background and understanding of China. These experts should have comprehensive knowledge of the Chinese model of economy and development, governance, community with a shared future, GSI, GDI, and ecological civilisation.\nThis is necessary because western experts do not fully understand China and try to compare apples to oranges.\nThe writer is a political economist and a visiting research fellow at Hebei University, China\n\u00a0\nPublished in The Express Tribune, April 10th, 2023.\n"

            "Text": "Lahore Decades long inefficiency of the Punjab Police, which has either failed to close investigations immediately or shown reluctance in arresting seemingly powerful criminals, has resulted in notorious malefactors escaping the country; rarely to be heard of again.\nThe routine procedure for lawbreakers who flee the country is the police asking the courts to declare them as proclaimed offenders and issue warrants for their arrest.\nWhile these two steps might work without a hitch, criminals who escape are hardly heard of again because the police lose interest in them.\nThe Punjab Police\u2019s disinterest is backed by numbers as well. Police sources privy to the matter disclosed that the province\u2019s courts await the return of 674 proclaimed offenders, so that they can be punished for the various crimes they have been accused of, such as terrorism, fraud, kidnapping for ransom, and murder-for-hire. When asked about the police\u2019s lack of interest in bringing back the accused from foreign jurisdictions, Inspector General (IG) Punjab Police, Dr Usman Anwar, conceded that the department had been \u201cmoving slowly.\u201d However, what the recently appointed provincial police chief is perhaps not aware of is that the department has been moving slowly intentionally.\n\u201cSince there is barely a budget for remote investigations, it is easier for us to get an accused declared as proclaimed offender, and then wait for their arrest,\u201d a police official in the investigative unit told The Express Tribune, under the condition of anonymity.\nWhile using the low budget excuse is not new for government departments, the Punjab Police has failed to follow procedures which do not even involve money. For instance, if there\u2019s an apprehension that a particular malefactor will escape the country, the police can obtain approval from the Ministry of Interior to place them on the Exit Control List (ECL); however, this procedure is largely ignored, according to police sources. Dr Anwar, when asked about this lethargy of the police force, replied: \u201cthings are now picking up speed after our discussions with Interpol.\u201d Expanding on the discussions held with the international organisation that facilitates worldwide police cooperation, the IG informed that red notices, colloquially referred to as red warrants, would be issued for 406 proclaimed offenders.\n\u201cMoreover, red warrants for 84 proclaimed offenders have already been issued and the affected families are encouraged to report their concerns to the police,\u201d added Dr Anwar.\nWhile it remains to be seen whether red warrants for the 406 malefactors will be issued anytime soon, The Express Tribune learnt from police sources that the Punjab Police had recently asked the Ministry of Interior to revoke the passports of some 470 proclaimed offenders, so that they could be arrested.\nHowever, none of the police officials privy to this information commented on why a request to revoke passports of notorious criminals was only being made now.\n"

Due to his immense attachment to religion, he himself laid the foundation stone in 2001.\nThe mosque, composed of highly-decorated white marble, was established on an area of four kanals. Lime, mud and brick powder were mixed and used as mortar in the mosque\u2019s construction.\nThe 4.5 million bricks in the foundation were connected in an arched manner to provide protection against earthquakes and cracks caused by gas emissions.\nMasjid Pak Wiggah Sharif has become an image of timeless art due to its unique architecture, calligraphy and white marble exterior, which has also been beautifully decorated with calligraphy. A large number of people visit the mosque on a daily basis.\nMosque caretaker Sahibzada Ahsan Hafeez told The Express Tribune that artisans and devotees took part in the construction out of religious fervor and artistic zeal. Neither iron rods nor cement were used in the construction of the mosque. So far, around Rs19 billion was spent on building this mosque.\nIn the premises adjacent to the mosque, a free eye camp is organized and a weekly langar (free food) is held for visitors and worshippers.\nAbdul Rahman, the mosque administrator, said that the beauty of the mosque is exemplary in every respect and can also be observed at night.\nEven after the passing of Hafiz Muhammad Farrukh Hafeez, work is being carried out to maintain the mosque\u2019s beauty with the same spirit.\n"

            "Text": "A grand police operation got underway in Rahim Yar Khan\u2019s Katcha area on Sunday to cleanse the area of the criminals and anti-state elements.\nDuring the first battle of the operation on its first day, an alleged dacoit was killed while a policeman sustained injuries.\nThe battle started when the convoy of the Punjab Inspector General of Police, Dr. Usman Anwar, who is heading the operation, came under attack, ensuing an exchange of fire between the police and the dacoits.\nPolice arrested six alleged dacoits during the encounter. The RPO of Bahawalpur, Rai Babar Saeed, and the DPO of Rahim Yar Khan, Rizwan Omar Gondal, were assisting the Punjab IGP in the operation.\nSindh Police were also starting an operation in their areas, said Dr. Usman Anwar while addressing a press conference at the office of the DPO in Rahim Yar Khan.\nThe operation was launched in the light of the orders of the National Security Committee, said the police chief.\nPolice checkpoints had been fully restored in the Katcha area, and advancement was being made to clear the interior of anti-social elements, the Punjab IGP said.\n\u201cThe writ of the state and the rule of law will be restored by completely stamping out the hideouts of the criminals from the Katcha area,\u201d said the police chief.\nMore than 5,000 police personnel from several districts had been dispatched to Rahim Yar Khan, and fresh troops would take the front-line roles.\nAt least 11,000 policemen participated in the operation. The head constable who had sustained injuries during the encounter was moved to Lahore for treatment. The IGP told the press conference in Rahim Yar Khan that 2,000 soldiers had been sent from Punjab for the operation.\nHe said that intelligence-based operations had been going on for some time, while today a fully-fledged operation was being launched to clear the interior areas of the anti-social elements.\nThe police chief said that the morale of the police Jawans was very high, and all the anti-social elements would be eliminated once and for all.\nThe IGP said that modern weapons and armored vehicles would also be used in the operation.\nThe police chief told the press conference about the recovery of two children in Khanpur as a manifestation of the police\u2019s outstanding skills and professionalism.\nHe announced a cash reward of Rs1.2 million and certificates of appreciation for DPO Rizwan Umar Gondal and his team.\nMeanwhile, Dr Usman Anwar visited the residence of Dr. Hassan Mehmood, a former superintendent of the Tehsil Headquarters Hospital of Rahim Yar Khan, whose kidnapped children were recovered by Rahim Yar Khan Police. The IGP met with the two sons who had recently been recovered by Rahim Yar Khan Police.\nSuspected criminals from Kacha had kidnapped Dr. Mahmood\u2019s sons.\nHe also announced establishment of a new police station in Khanpur.\nThe IGP said that the Special Branch and the CTD had been jointly working to root out crimes, especially robberies and kidnappings for ransom, in the Kacha area.\nFor last few months, the incidents of kidnapping for ransom had been on the rise. The victims were taken to the Kacha areas where they were held hostage while their relatives contacted and demands for ransom made.\nJust a few weeks ago, an elderly man, who was the father of a doctor, hailing from Chung in Lahore, had been abducted.\nThe victim had been on his way to Khushab from Thokar Niaz Beg when he fell victim to the kidnappers.\nLater, his family got a call for ransom from the dacoits who had been hiding somewhere in the Kacha area.\nIn another case, a man and his elderly uncle from Liaqatabad had also been kidnapped for ransom by dacoits from the Kacha area when they had been on their way to attend a wedding ceremony.\n"
