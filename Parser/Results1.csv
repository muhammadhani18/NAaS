• Asks Elahi to stay until successor appointed
• Terming order ‘illegal’, Elahi vows to move court
• Fawad says reference to be sent to president for governor’s ouster
LAHORE: Punjab Governor Balighur Rehman sprang into action late on Thursday night and denotified Chaudhry Parvez Elahi as chief minister of the largest province in a bid to forestall ousted premier Imran Khan’s plan to dissolve the Punjab Assembly.
The development was immediately described as ‘illegal’ by Mr Elahi, who said he would move the court against the governor’s order on Friday (today).
PTI senior leader Fawad Chaudhry also termed the governor’s order illegal and said that “a selected governor has denotified an elected chief minister”.
Punjab Chief Secretary Abdullah Sumbal, who was appointed by the federal government on Wednesday, issued a notification in line with the governor’s order.
 
 

After the governor and the chief secretary’s notifications, Mr Elahi called an emergency meeting at his residence in which the advocate general of Punjab, Speaker Sibtain Khan, Moonis Elahi, Law Minister Basharat Raja and some other senior leaders were present to finalise Friday’s strategy.
In his order dated Dec 22, the governor said that since the chief minister had refrained from taking a vote of confidence at the appo­i­nted day and time, he ceased to hold the office.
He, however, asked Mr Elahi to continue working as chief minister until his successor takes charge.
Fawad Chaudhry tweeted that there was “no legal status of the governor’s order de-notifying CM Parvez Elahi. Mr Elahi and his cabinet will continue to perform their duties. A reference against the governor will be sent to the president for his ouster”.
 






Sources said the governor was given the go-ahead to denotify Mr Elahi following the failure of PPP senior leader Asif Ali Zardari and PML-Q president Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain to woo the PTI and PML-Q lawmakers in Punjab.
The governor in the order said: “Consequent to the facts that Ch. Parvez Elahi … refrained from obtaining the vote of confidence at 1600 hours yesterday (Wednesday), in line with an order under Article 130(7) of the Constitution … issued under my hand on Dec 19, 2022, in line with Rule 22(7) of the Rules of Procedure of provincial assembly of Punjab, 1997, and that he still has not done so even after the lapse of another 24 hours, I am satisfied that he does not command the confidence of the majority of the members of the Punjab Assembly, and therefore ceases to hold his office with immediate effect.”
As a result, “the provincial cabinet stands dissolved forthwith”, he said.
In terms of Article 133 of the Constitution, Mr Elahi, “former Punjab CM, is hereby asked to continue to hold office until his successor enters upon the office of the chief minister”, the governor said.
However, it remains to be seen whether the governor’s late-night order will hold the field or not.
Earlier in the day, the constituent parties of the ruling coalition in the Centre engaged in a lengthy huddle to decide whether Governor Rehman should be given the go-ahead to denotify Mr Elahi right away or wait till the PTI and PML-Q make their move in the face of the governor’s directive to the chief executive to seek a vote of confidence.
The coalition parties were of the view that they should stick to having the governor’s order implemented by forcing the chief minister to seek a vote of confidence.
Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah, federal minister of the PML-Q (Shujaat group) Tariq Bashir Cheema, PPP Sindh Minister Nasir Hussain Shah and PM’s Special Assistant Malik Ahmad Khan were present in the meeting. Governor Rehman and the PML-N leaders also held separate meetings with legal experts in this regard.
Zardari’s efforts fail
“The PML-N and PPP are in no mood to push for their no-confidence motion against the chief minister in the Punjab Assembly,” a PML-N insider told Dawn after the meeting. “The motion was only filed to stop the CM from dissolving the assembly. At present, we don’t have the 186 votes required to oust the chief minister, and efforts of PPP’s Asif Ali Zardari to coax at least six PML-Q lawmakers have yet to bear fruit, rather he has failed. If the PA speaker adopts the no-trust motion, the PMLN and PPP are not ready to go for it.”
PM’s Special Assistant Attaullah Tarar told a private TV channel that after the expiry of the governor’s deadline to Punjab Assembly Speaker Sibtain Khan, the governor had decided to give some “more time” to him to implement the order regarding CM Elahi’s vote of confidence.
“As this matter eventually has to land in court, the governor was observing caution. Earlier, 48 hours were given to the speaker to execute the order. As the speaker did not ask CM Elahi to take a vote of confidence till Thursday, the governor decided to issue an order denotifying the chief minister.”
 
 

The Punjab Assembly’s ongoing session will be held on Friday (today). Speaker Sibtain Khan on Tuesday had disposed of the governor’s order for CM Elahi to obtain a vote of confidence from the house, terming it “against the Constitution and Rules of Procedure”.
Talking to reporters outside the Governor House earlier, Rana Sanaullah said Mr Elahi had “constitutionally” ceased to be the chief minister after skipping the vote of confidence.
“CM Elahi now cannot advise dissolution of the Punjab Assembly after he did not obtain a vote of confidence on the governor’s order. I think the governor’s order to denotify Mr Elahi is just a formality now,” he remarked.
Hamza’s ‘mysterious’ absence
As the PML-N and PPP are busy making moves in Punjab to stop the provincial assembly’s dissolution, the opposition leader in the house, Hamza Shehbaz, is conspicuous by his absence. He travelled to London over a week ago and is expressing no interest in the province his party once ruled.
Since his defeat at the hands of Mr Elahi in the chief minister’s election in July, Hamza has been away from any party activity. Speculations are rife within the party that “he is being cut to size” regarding PML-N affairs by his cousin Maryam Nawaz or that his brother Suleman Shehbaz, who returned home after four years in self-exile, may be given a role in the party in the coming days.
If his wings aren’t being ‘clipped’, questions are being raised over the opposition leader’s ‘lack of seriousness’ in such a crucial time for the party in its bastion of Punjab.

2023-01-01,2022-12-23,Dissolution of  Punjab and KP assemblies ‘stalled’,"Speaker says no-trust motions against CM, speaker, deputy speaker to be decided by Jan 1, 2023","LAHORE: Imran Khan’s announcement that Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa assemblies will be dissolved on Friday (today) is far from turning into a reality as recent developments pushed any such action to at least two weeks away.
Punjab Assembly Speaker Sibtain Khan effectively maintains the dissolution has been put on hold till they get the vote of confidence out of their way.
The KP assembly is also not going to be dissolved, at least on Friday.
Though KP Chief Minister Mahmood Khan on Thursday said he would dissolve the assembly the “moment” Imran Khan asked him to do so, PTI insiders told Dawn the legislature would undergo such an action only after the Punjab Assembly was sent packing.

Speaker says no-trust motions against CM, speaker, deputy speaker to be decided by Jan 1, 2023

Earlier in the day, Speaker Sibtain Khan had confirmed that the no-confidence motions moved against the chief minister, speaker and deputy speaker would be decided by Jan 1, 2023. He also wrote a letter to the governor that as per his ruling his (the governor’s) asking the chief minister to take a vote of confidence was against facts because the session of the house summoned by the governor was unconstitutional under Article 209-A of the Punjab Assembly’s Rules of Procedure.
‘Constitutional right’
Earlier, PTI chief Imran Khan on Thursday censured the PDM government for turning its challenge to him to dissolve the provincial assemblies into a complete farce by blocking the “constitutional process” through no-trust vote moves.
“It is our constitutional right to dissolve our governments in Punjab and KP to move forward for fresh general elections, but the scared federal government is taking measures to save ‘our assemblies’,” he stressed, and termed the federal government’s threats to impose Governor Rule or de-notify the chief minister sheer “absurdity”.
Asking the state institutions, including the military establishment and judiciary, whether they were concerned about the country’s well-being, Mr Khan said Pakistan was drowning in crises and time was not far when it would get out of hand.
“Free and fair elections are the only way to restore economic stability through political stability,” he said while speaking to his party’s parliamentarians, workers and supporters, who had gathered on his call outside the Governor House to keep Governor Balighur Rehman from taking any “unconstitutional” action of de-notifying Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi.
The PTI workers and supporters, who had also brought along a 100-metre-long PTI flag, chanted slogans against the governor.
Eight months ago, Mr Khan said, “one man” decided to eliminate him and his party through all kinds of aggressive measures, and went on to say the person did to the country what even an enemy could not do.
“The country was progressing on all fronts by leaps and bounds when the person toppled the PTI government and installed thieves and looters and allowed them to get all their corruption cases cleared,” he regretted.
Although the PTI chief had been directly castigating retired Gen Qamar Bajwa, sources in the PML-Q told Dawn that Mr Khan did not name the former army chief as CM Elahi had taken strong exception to accusing the “benefactor” of both the PTI and PML-Q.
The former prime minister said the country’s economy was at its lowest ebb, political stability shattered and terrorism from across Afghanistan on the rise. “Where is the foreign policy?” he asked and chided Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari for allegedly spending Rs1.75 billion on his foreign tours instead of going to Afghanistan to improve relations and control the cross-border attacks.
He stressed the federal government should invest in tribal areas to create jobs as a first step to bringing peace to the region. He also chided the federal government for not giving due shares of funds to Punjab, KP and Kashmir governments.
The PTI chairman also lambasted the elements releasing indecent audios and videos on social media to blackmail him, and regretted that the leaked clips were accessible to “our children”.
Governor’s powers
Punjab Assembly Speaker Sibtain Khan, meanwhile, asserted that the governor did not have the powers to de-notify the chief minister even if the assembly was not in session.
He told the media that the Constitution did not have any provision that empowered a governor to do so.

2022-12-22,2022-12-23,NA approves bill seeking LG polls delay in Islamabad,Bill seeks to increase number of UCs from 101 to 125; passed with house visibly lacking quorum throughout the proceedings.,"ISLAMABAD: In a frantic attempt to get the local government (LG) polls in the federal capital delayed, the National Assembly on Thu­rsday passed a government bill seeking to increase the number of union councils from 101 to 125.
The move comes less than 10 days ahead of the polling day, December 31, and the bill was passed with the house visibly lacking quorum throughout the proceedings which lasted less than 40 minutes.
A lawmaker even asked if the house was in order and Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ash­raf replied in the affirmative without ordering a count.
Against the required strength of 86 for the quorum, 54 lawmakers were present in the house at the start of the session and just 43 at the end, according to a fact-sheet prepared by the Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen).
Rules were suspended to allow taking up for consideration at once the Islam­abad Capital Territory Loc­al Government Amendment Bill introduced by Minister of State for Law Shahadat Awan on behalf of Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah.
PTI dissident Ramesh Kumar Vankwani again tried to point out the lack of quorum when the bill was being moved, but his voice was simply ignored by the speaker.
Before the controversial bill was put to vote, Maulana Akbar Chitrali of Jamaat-i-Islami raised questions over the last-minute decision to amend the law a little over a week before the polls scheduled for December 31.
He said the transfer of power to grassroots level was a constitutional obligation and the only way to efficiently serve the masses. He regretted that the Constitution had been made a toy and fiddling with it had become a custom for the rulers.
He said the move meant to get the LG polls in the capital delayed was unconstitutional and recorded his strong protest over it.
PTI dissident Ramesh Kumar Vankwani also criticised the summoning of the National Assembly for a single day exclusively for approving the controversial bill. Claiming that the daylong session cost the national kitty Rs50 million, he asked the government why it was trying to escape elections.
Sabir Qaim Khani of MQM-P supported the bill and called for fresh delimitation of constituencies for LG polls in Sindh as well.
“How can the people be served when delimitation is not proportionate to population,” he asked.
The house also passed Federal Employees Benevolent Fund and Group Insurance Amendment Bill. The bill was moved by Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Murtaza Javed Abbasi.
Commenting on the development, a senior official of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) told Dawn that the ECP would stick to its position as it was committed to holding local government elections as per schedule. He said amendments to an act could not override constitutional provisions.
He said all steps for electoral exercise, including filing and scrutiny of nomination papers, decision by Appellate Tribunals, finalisation of candidates, allotment of symbols, announcement of polling scheme, appointment and training of polling staff and printing of ballot papers had been completed and the stage was now set for holding LG polls.
He said as the ECP pointed out in its order dated December 20, the federal government increased the number of union councils from 101 to 125 without concurrence of the Election Commission as required under Section-4(4) of the ICT Local Government Act, 2015.
The section reads: “The Government may, with the concurrence of the Election Commission, alter the limits of a local area under this section after the initiation of proceedings of delimitation of constituencies by the Election Commission, but the Government shall not alter the limits of a local area after the announcement of election schedule for election in local area.”
He said the move to amend the bill at this stage was not only immoral and mala fide, but illegal as well.
Amendments to LG law
Increase in the number of union councils and provision for direct election for offices of mayor and deputy mayor are key features of the LG amendment bill passed by the National Assembly.
Section 6 (1) of the Islamabad Capital Territory law in its amended form reads: “There shall be one hundred and twenty-five Union Councils within the Islamabad Capital Territory under this Act. The Federal Government on the recommendations of Ministry of Interior by notification in the official Gazette may increase or decrease the number of union councils from time to time.”
Likewise, the substituted section 12(3) reads: “The Mayor and the Deputy Mayor shall be directly elected as joint candidates by the voters. The election of the Mayor and the Deputy Mayor shall be held on the day of election of members of Union Council under section 11.”

2023-01-01,2022-12-23,Rs1bn ‘New Year gift’ for govt employees unveiled,"Govt finalises “special dispensation package” for its civilian employees in grades 1 to 16, who have been protesting for pay raise.","ISLAMABAD: The government has finalised a “special dispensation package” for its civilian employees in grades 1 to 16, who have been protesting for an increase in salaries, citing inflation and alleged discrimination.
The package, involving an additional annual impact of around Rs1 billion and finalised by the finance ministry after negotiations with the All-Government Employees Grand Alliance (AGEGA), has been submitted to the prime minister for approval before a formal notification.
The package, which is on the pattern of a similar dispensation given to employees of the Khyber Pakhtun­khwa government, will come into force on Jan 1.
To be announced as a “New Year gift” to the non-gazetted employees, the package will not apply to employees paid out of the defence budget and will cost just Rs500 million during the remaining fiscal year, which ends in June.
These employees, thro­ugh their numerous unions and representative bodies, have been agitating for improvement in the service structure of their cadres along with financial amelioration.
Most demands presented by these employees and organisations were based on seeking parity with the benefits that have been granted in the provincial governments.
The main demands included the upgradation for the post of the lower division clerk (LDC) from basic pay scale (BPS) 9 to 11 and the upper division clerk (UDC) from BPS 11 to 14, besides grant of higher pay scale along the lines of those authorised by the KP government, i.e. two high pay scales to employees in BPS-1 to 5 and one high pay scale to those in BPS-6 to 15.
During the four-year PTI government that ended in April, an agreement was concluded between the AGEGA and the ministers for defence, interior and parliamentary affairs that included the upgradation of posts on the pattern of the KP government.
All demands decided under that agreement were met except those related to upgradation, giving cause to continuous unrest and agitation among the employees.
The finance ministry and the establishment division, the government’s human resource arm, re-engaged the protesting representatives of the employees’ alliance and reached a mutually acceptable ground on the analogy of the KP government.
Under the finalised package, the employees in BPS 1 to 5 will be granted two higher pay scales as a one-time dispensation if they have yet to avail timescale promotion (TSP) under the 2022 policy.
However, those in the same grade who have availed the promotion will be granted one higher pay scale as a one-time dispensation.
In BPS 6 to 15, employees who have not availed TSP 2022 will be granted the next higher pay scale as a one-time dispensation, whereas those who have availed the benefit will only be granted one additional increment of their current pay scale.
However, the substantive pay scales of all the above categories will remain unchanged. Also, employees in BPS 16 will be granted one additional increment as a one-time dispensation.
Moreover, the post of LDC will be upgraded from BPS 9 to BPS 11 and that of UDC from BPS 11 to 13, along with incumbents. The recruitment rules will be amended by the establishment division accordingly as per the upgradation policy.
However, these special dispensations will only apply to those civil servants of the federal government who are in BPS 1 to 16 (excluding employees paid out of defence estimates) and are in receipt of disparity reduction allowances.
Besides, one chance of granting a higher timescale, admissible under TSP 2022, will be considered lapsed for employees who avail of the benefit under this dispensation. This special dispensation will not involve any upgradation of the posts except the posts of UDC and LDC and no premature increment will be admissible on grant of the higher pay scale under this dispensation.
The beneficiary of the grant of a higher pay scale under this dispensation shall continue to draw allowances, perks, privileges, etc., sanctioned for the substantive pay scale of the beneficiary.
The substantive pay scale is one that a civil servant regularly acquires through initial appointment or by means of promotion or appointment by transfer.

2022-12-22,2022-12-23,Kabul renews pledge to curb cross-border terrorism: FO,"""We have received some assurances and have held some important consultations with the Afghan authorities,"" says FO spokesperson.","ISLAMABAD: The Foreign Office on Thursday said Afghanistan’s de facto government has renewed its commitment to rein in cross-border terrorism and hoped that the Taliban administration would live up to its pledge.
“We have received some assurances and have held some important consultations with the Afghan authorities. We hope that the Afghan interim government will fulfil the commitments that it has made to Pakistan in terms of security,” FO spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said at the weekly media briefing.
 
 

The remarks, made in response to media questions, come against the backdrop of spate of recent terrorism incidents in the country, believed to have been planned and directed by the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) leaders based in Afghanistan, including the incident at the Counter-Terrorism Department’s interrogation facility in Bannu.
“We have certain mechani­sms with Afghanistan in which we engage to discuss these iss­ues. We will continue to engage with them to ensure that the Afg­han authorities fulfil the commitments that they have made to Pakistan that Afghan territory will not be used to des­t­a­bilise or to threaten Pakistan’s security,” she said.
Bannu stand-off underscored Pakistan’s resurgent terrorism problem. The TTP, which has ideological linkages with the Afghan Taliban, has executed around 115 attacks so far this year, most of which happened after August this year when the group’s peace talks with the Pakistan government began to falter. The ceasefire was formally ended last month by the TTP.
 
 

The group that has been involved in terrorism for 15 years and executed some of the deadliest attacks in the country’s history, including the one on Army Public School, Peshawar, in December 2014 had been weakened by successive counter-terrorism operations and many of its fighters and commanders fled to neighbouring Afghanistan.
Islamabad had been pressing successive governments in Kabul to take action against the TTP and other militants based in Afghanistan. While the previous governments turned a deaf ear to Pakistani pleadings, the Afghan Taliban persuaded Islamabad to hold peace talks with the militants.
 
 

The peace talks that began last year broke down twice and nothing substantive was achieved by Pakistan, but it helped the TTP secure release of some of its detained leaders, while allowing a large number of its Afghanistan-based fighters to relocate here.
TTP chief Noor Wali Mehsud’s message in the middle of hostage crisis in Bannu this week left little doubt that the group’s leaders were directing terrorist attacks from their hideouts in Afghanistan.
“I congratulate you for carrying out this sacred act. I instruct you not to surrender to these infidels and apostates under any circumstances,” Mehsud said while addressing the hostage takers in Bannu in an audio message, according to VoA.
The FO spokesperson pointed to engagement with other count­r­ies as well on the issue of terrorism threat emanating from Afghanistan as she said: “We are engaged with international partners, including our neighbour Afghanistan, to ensure that terrorist groups do not threaten Pakistan’s security.”
Ms Baloch did not specify any particular international partner with which Pakistan is engaging on this particular terrorist threat.
Commander of US Central Command (Centcom) Gen Michael Kurilla, who visited Pakistan last week for meetings with the Pakistani military leadership, it should be recalled, toured Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, besides his meetings in Islamabad, to discuss the security situation along the border with Afghanistan.
Pakistan’s other major concern is the recent border incidents involving Taliban forces.
Ms Baloch, meanwhile, emphasised that despite these irritants Islamabad will remain engaged with the Taliban administration, which is still not internationally recognised.
“Pakistan prioritises dialogue and finding constructive solutions. That has always been our policy. We also want to find constructive solution to the current situation that we are facing, through dialogue,” she said.

Special Judge (Central) Azam Khan observed that Senator Swati had repeated the same crime in which he was already on a post-arrest bail.
During the course of the hearing, FIA’s special prosecutor Raja Rizwan Abbasi argued that Mr Swati operated a verified Twitter account and he was being followed by politicians, journalists and the public at large. He said Mr Swati never contested the ownership of his Twitter handle and used it to build an anti-army narrative.
Mr Abbasi claimed this was a deliberate attempt to incite mutiny among personnel of the armed forces. He said the PTI leader misused the relief of bail and tweeted the same text for which he was facing a case before the FIA’s Cybercrimes Wing.
Mr Swati’s counsel Babar Awan argued that the complainant, who had lodged the first information report (FIR) against his client, was not an aggrieved party.
He said the case had been registered by the FIA and it was not on a par with the complaint filed under defamation laws.
Mr Awan argued that the court could impose a maximum penalty of Rs1,000 on Mr Swati over his tweet, but he was being moved from one province to another.
The FIA had earlier this month arrested Mr Swati for defamation, statement conducing to public mischief, and highly obnoxious campaign of intimidating tweets, after his fiery speech at a PTI long march in Rawalpindi in which he lashed out at the senior military leadership.

Police said the armed clash occurred in Janikhel Mandi (bazaar) where both groups confronted and opened fire on each other. Police identified one of the deceased as Attaullah, saying he belonged to Ishaq group.
Police said that two men belonging to Akhtar Mohammad group, were also killed in the clash.
Police said the bodies were shifted to a local hospital and a large contingent of law enforcement personnel rushed to the area to control the situation.

2022-12-20,2022-12-22,‘TTP is Pakistan’s absolute red line’,Bilawal says Islamabad willing to consider all options to ensure citizens’ safety and security.,"WASHINGTON: Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has suggested letting neighbouring countries know that the outlawed TTP is an “absolute red line” for Pakistan and it would not allow anyone to cross that line.
“As far as the TTP (Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan) is concerned, it’s absolutely our red line. It is something that we will not tolerate,” said the foreign minister while speaking at the Atlantic Council, Washington, on Tuesday evening. 
“And absolutely we will be willing to consider each and every single option to ensure the safety and security of our people.” 

 





 
As the foreign minister stressed the need for combating militants in his Washington talk, Pakistan’s UN Ambassador Munir Akram told the UN Security Council in New York that engagement with the Taliban was the best option to stabilise the region.
“Coercion and isolation have not proved successful in the past; they will prove to be counter-productive now and in the future,” said Ambassador Akram while participating in a UN debate on the situation in Afghanistan. “We need a coherent and practical plan to realise the objectives of the international community through patient engagement with the interim government,” the Pakistani envoy told the 15-member Council.

Bilawal says Islamabad willing to consider all options to ensure citizens’ safety and security

Mr Bhutto-Zardari made a similar observation in his talk at the Atlantic Council, urging world powers to work with Afghanistan’s de facto rulers to stabilise the region. When the moderator, Uzair Younus, asked if Pakistan could deploy troops inside Afghanistan or on the border to stop attacks by Afghanistan-based militant groups, the minister suggested using the “hammer and anvil” strategy, with Kabul’s cooperation, to eliminate militancy.
The chief Pakistani diplomat pointed out that despite these border and cross-border attacks, the situation was far more secure and stable now than it was in 2007, when Pakistan launched a series of operations against the TTP and other militants.
“But those things can be put at risk if this goes unchecked. And obviously that would undermine any hope, whether it is CPEC or any other form of economic activity. Nobody wants to put lives at risk in order to conduct business,” he warned.
“That’s why I have been particularly hawkish on the issue of the TTP, and on the issue of terrorism in general. I believe that recent events in the region are alarming, not only the border incidents but the recent Bannu incident, which our security commanders have very bravely managed to overcome,” he said.
The foreign minister, however, stressed the need to “impress on our neighbours, particularly Afghan­istan” that they have to demonstrate the will and the capacity to take on the TTP or other groups functioning from there.
He acknowledged that there’s room for improvement in Pakistan’s Afghan policy — as there’s in America’s — and “we need to be serious about what we can do going forward”.
“Are we going learn from our mistakes to ensure that we do not repeat them,” he asked. “The answer to that question is going to define the safety and stability of Afghanistan, the safety and stability of Pakistan and the safety and stability of our region.” 
Pakistan’s number one option, he said, was to get the Afghan interim government to demonstrate that they had the capacity to deal with this issue.
Separately, the foreign minister also met Deputy Secretary of State Wendy R. Sherman where they discussed Pakistan’s efforts to recover from devastating floods and the upcoming Jan 9 International Con­ference on Climate Resilient Pakistan in Geneva. 
According to a readout issued by the State Department, the US official expressed condolences for Pakistani lives lost in recent terrorist attacks, and they committed to strengthen cooperation between the two countries.

2022-12-20,2022-12-22,‘TTP is Pakistan’s absolute red line’,Bilawal says Islamabad willing to consider all options to ensure citizens’ safety and security.,"WASHINGTON: Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has suggested letting neighbouring countries know that the outlawed TTP is an “absolute red line” for Pakistan and it would not allow anyone to cross that line.
“As far as the TTP (Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan) is concerned, it’s absolutely our red line. It is something that we will not tolerate,” said the foreign minister while speaking at the Atlantic Council, Washington, on Tuesday evening. 
“And absolutely we will be willing to consider each and every single option to ensure the safety and security of our people.” 

 





 
As the foreign minister stressed the need for combating militants in his Washington talk, Pakistan’s UN Ambassador Munir Akram told the UN Security Council in New York that engagement with the Taliban was the best option to stabilise the region.
“Coercion and isolation have not proved successful in the past; they will prove to be counter-productive now and in the future,” said Ambassador Akram while participating in a UN debate on the situation in Afghanistan. “We need a coherent and practical plan to realise the objectives of the international community through patient engagement with the interim government,” the Pakistani envoy told the 15-member Council.

Bilawal says Islamabad willing to consider all options to ensure citizens’ safety and security

Mr Bhutto-Zardari made a similar observation in his talk at the Atlantic Council, urging world powers to work with Afghanistan’s de facto rulers to stabilise the region. When the moderator, Uzair Younus, asked if Pakistan could deploy troops inside Afghanistan or on the border to stop attacks by Afghanistan-based militant groups, the minister suggested using the “hammer and anvil” strategy, with Kabul’s cooperation, to eliminate militancy.
The chief Pakistani diplomat pointed out that despite these border and cross-border attacks, the situation was far more secure and stable now than it was in 2007, when Pakistan launched a series of operations against the TTP and other militants.
“But those things can be put at risk if this goes unchecked. And obviously that would undermine any hope, whether it is CPEC or any other form of economic activity. Nobody wants to put lives at risk in order to conduct business,” he warned.
“That’s why I have been particularly hawkish on the issue of the TTP, and on the issue of terrorism in general. I believe that recent events in the region are alarming, not only the border incidents but the recent Bannu incident, which our security commanders have very bravely managed to overcome,” he said.
The foreign minister, however, stressed the need to “impress on our neighbours, particularly Afghan­istan” that they have to demonstrate the will and the capacity to take on the TTP or other groups functioning from there.
He acknowledged that there’s room for improvement in Pakistan’s Afghan policy — as there’s in America’s — and “we need to be serious about what we can do going forward”.
“Are we going learn from our mistakes to ensure that we do not repeat them,” he asked. “The answer to that question is going to define the safety and stability of Afghanistan, the safety and stability of Pakistan and the safety and stability of our region.” 
Pakistan’s number one option, he said, was to get the Afghan interim government to demonstrate that they had the capacity to deal with this issue.
Separately, the foreign minister also met Deputy Secretary of State Wendy R. Sherman where they discussed Pakistan’s efforts to recover from devastating floods and the upcoming Jan 9 International Con­ference on Climate Resilient Pakistan in Geneva. 
According to a readout issued by the State Department, the US official expressed condolences for Pakistani lives lost in recent terrorist attacks, and they committed to strengthen cooperation between the two countries.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,ECC defers PSO’s request for Rs17bn,Receivables of embattled national fuel supplier cross Rs612bn.,"ISLAMABAD: The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet was informed on Wednesday that receivables of the national fuel supplier – Pakistan State Oil (PSO) had crossed Rs612 billion and it was struggling to manage remittances to its foreign suppliers.
The meeting of the ECC presided over by Finance Minister Ishaq Dar, however, did not immediately approve Rs17bn urgently demanded by the PSO to honour its liabilities to international firms, particularly its long-term fuel supplier Kuwait Petroleum Company (KPC).
“The ECC deferred a summary submitted by the Ministry of Energy (Petroleum Division) for foreign exchange coverage to PSO and directed the Ministry of Energy to resubmit the summary after reviewing the numbers”, said an official statement.
The Petroleum Division reported that under a credit facility provided by KPC since 2000 and extended annually for the supply of diesel, a joint account of the federal government and KPC had been set up with the National Bank of Pakistan in which PSO keeps on depositing rupee equivalent funds after 30 days of the bill of lading for each shipment.
After 90 days from the bill of lading, the NBP has to transfer the cargo cost to KPC and exchange cover for an additional 60 days is borne by the federal government.
However, the account facility started to face huge shortfalls in April 2020 on account of exchange losses, posing a default situation in remittances to KPC.
At the time the ECC approved a supplementary grant of Rs12bn which helped PSO avoid an international default. The facility worked well for another two years but then suffered a shortfall again and now this shortfall stood at Rs17bn owing to “prevalent upheaval” in the rupee-dollar parity.

Receivables of embattled national fuel supplier cross Rs612bn

The Petroleum Division said the PSO had been defaulting even on rupee deposits in the NBP account because of its liquidity challenges as its receivables reached Rs612bn and “it urgently required adequate funds so that liabilities are met on time”. 
The Petroleum Division and PSO have been trying to manage the situation for avoiding international default by depositing required funds on due dates but the situation was “too critical” now.
It also complained that the Petroleum Division had been submitting budget requirements for exchange loss on this facility every year but the Ministry of Finance did not make separate provisions which led to exposure to international default.
The finance ministry, however, argued that the government had already released Rs30bn to address PSO’s liquidity position under the foreign exchange head in September and arranged another Rs50bn through market financing. Also, the government was now trying to ensure PSO recoveries through power companies and gas companies.
The Petroleum Division, however, insisted that the matter related to actual foreign exchange loss of over Rs17bn so far on the KPC’s credit facility up to Dec 2, which has to be paid by the government sooner or later.
“PSO has made all outstanding payments delayed due to liquidity position. Exchange loss, however, is the liability of the government”, Petroleum Division was quoted but a decision was deferred.
Supplementary grants
The ECC approved a summary of the Ministry of Energy (Petroleum Division) on the transfer of 30pc working interests in exploration licences/block – Margala Block – owned by M/s MOL of Hungary to M/s Mari Petroleum Company Ltd. 
It was apprised that Margala Block was governed by Pakistan Petroleum Exploration and Production Rules 2001 and the acquiring company MPCL was operating in Pakistan since 1954 and has working interests in 23 exploration licences and 15 development & production leases. The ECC was further informed that M/s MOL had cleared all its financial obligations.
The ECC also approved a Rs823m technical supplementary grant to the Ministry of Maritime Affairs, enabling Gwadar Port Authority (GPA) to disburse the amount of Rs250,000 per head to 3,291 fishermen registered with Balochistan Fisheries Department for the purchase of boat engines.
The ECC also approved another Rs200mn Technical Supplementary Grant to the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulation and Coordination for Ghurki Trust Teaching Hospital (GTTH), Lahore. Ghurki Trust Teaching Hospital (GTTH) is a tertiary care non-profit organisation providing “State of the Art” health facilities to needy and poor patients.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,"China willing to provide ‘all kinds of assistance’, envoy assures Dar","Both sides deliberate on several avenues for expanding bilateral relations, especially in the economic and financial sectors.","ISLAMABAD: China assured Pakistan on Wednesday that it is ready to help Islamabad in every possible way following its request for about $8.75 billion in an additional financial package, including the rollover of debt, bank deposits and currency swaps.
Chinese Ambassador in Islamabad Nong Rong called on Finance Minister Ishaq Dar on Wednesday and “assured continuous support of the Chinese government to Pakistan”, the finance ministry said in a statement.
The “government of China stands with the people of Pakistan and is willing to provide all kinds of assistance”, the statement added.
Mr Dar told reporters last month that Pakistan had sought about $9bn in additional financial support from China during the visit of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to Beijing, and that the Chinese leadership had promised to “roll over $4bn in sovereign loans, refinance $3.3bn commercial bank loans and increase currency swap by about $1.45bn — from 30bn yuan to 40bn yuan”. The total worked out at $8.75bn.
Pakistan needs at least $34bn until June 30, 2023, to meet its international liabilities, including debt and trade payments. Pakistan is banking on about $13bn in additional support from China and Saudi Arabia.
The statement said Mr Dar “thanked the Chinese ambassador for their continuous support and assistance” and praised the long-standing and deep-rooted friendly relations between the two countries.
Both sides deliberated on several avenues for expanding bilateral relations, especially in the economic and financial sectors. The ambassador appreciated the government’s policy initiatives to sustain and boost fiscal and monetary stability.
Mr Dar had earlier said that the Chinese president and prime minister had assured Prime Minister Sharif that his government would stand by Pakistan and “will not let you down”.
He had then separately taken up the issue of refinancing $3bn in China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) deposit and about $3.3bn debt rollover. Both these heads are due for maturity on different dates before June 30.

Topline Securities said bearish sentiments prevailed especially in the second half of the trading session as investors went on a selling spree that eroded earlier gains. The sell-off was in reaction to the tug of war between the PTI and other parties on the dissolution of the Punjab Assembly.
Arif Habib Ltd said trading remained lacklustre owing to the low participation from investors. However, a notable number of shares changed hands in third-tier stocks.
As a result, the KSE-100 index settled at 39,342.89 points, down 489.56 points or 1.23 per cent from the preceding session.



 
The overall trading volume decreased 37.4pc to 166 million shares. The traded value went down 38.2pc to $17.9m on a day-on-day basis.
Stocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included WorldCall Telecom Ltd (17.4m shares), Hum Network Ltd (11.8m shares), Dewan Farooque Motor Company Ltd (8.5m shares), K-Electric Ltd (7.7m shares) and Hascol Petroleum Ltd (6.7m shares).
Sectors that contributed negatively to the index performance were commercial banking (159 points), technology and communication (106.4 points), fertiliser (71.2 points), exploration and production (52.2 points) and oil marketing (24.4 points).

Special Judge (Central) Azam Khan observed that Senator Swati had repeated the same crime in which he was already on a post-arrest bail.
During the course of the hearing, FIA’s special prosecutor Raja Rizwan Abbasi argued that Mr Swati operated a verified Twitter account and he was being followed by politicians, journalists and the public at large. He said Mr Swati never contested the ownership of his Twitter handle and used it to build an anti-army narrative.
Mr Abbasi claimed this was a deliberate attempt to incite mutiny among personnel of the armed forces. He said the PTI leader misused the relief of bail and tweeted the same text for which he was facing a case before the FIA’s Cybercrimes Wing.
Mr Swati’s counsel Babar Awan argued that the complainant, who had lodged the first information report (FIR) against his client, was not an aggrieved party.
He said the case had been registered by the FIA and it was not on a par with the complaint filed under defamation laws.
Mr Awan argued that the court could impose a maximum penalty of Rs1,000 on Mr Swati over his tweet, but he was being moved from one province to another.
The FIA had earlier this month arrested Mr Swati for defamation, statement conducing to public mischief, and highly obnoxious campaign of intimidating tweets, after his fiery speech at a PTI long march in Rawalpindi in which he lashed out at the senior military leadership.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,CM Elahi on thin ice after ruling by speaker ‘rejected’,"• Sana hints at governor’s rule in Punjab, says Elahi’s de-notification imminent • Interior ministry asks Rangers, FC to perform","• Sana hints at governor’s rule in Punjab, says Elahi’s de-notification imminent
• Interior ministry asks Rangers, FC to perform security duties in Punjab
LAHORE: In a tit-for-tat move, Governor Balighur Rehman on Wednesday termed the ruling of Punjab Assembly Speaker Sibtain Khan disposing of his directives regarding the vote of confidence “unconstitutional”, whereas the coalition government hinted at the imposition of governor’s rule in Pakistan’s largest province.
The PML-N government initially hinted that governor’s rule could be imposed for two months through a resolution in a joint session of parliament, but the period could be extended to six months.
“Since the chief minister on Wednesday failed to take the trust vote in the Punjab Assembly in compliance with the governor’s order, legally he ceases to hold his office. And now any time... probably on Thursday (today), the governor can issue an order de-notifying the CM,” Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah said earlier in the day.
This view was echoed by SAPM Attaullah Tarrar, who told reporters late on Wednesday night that the governor had discretionary powers to de-notify the CM and it was up to him whether he wanted to do it “tomorrow or the day after”.
Another option, Mr Sanaullah said, is governor’s rule by the Centre. “In the wake of the constitutional crisis, the government may get a resolution passed from the National Assembly and Senate to impose governor’s rule in Punjab for two months initially — the period can be extended to six months as well,” the minister added.
He was of the view that “all was not well” in the camp of Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Punjab parliamentary party. “Had the PTI been confident that CM Elahi could secure the support of 186 MPAs in the PA he would have gone for the trust vote on Wednesday in compliance with the governor’s order,” he said, adding that the CM could have gone for PA’s dissolution after the vote in line with Imran Khan’s plan for the dissolution of assemblies. “But the PTI chose otherwise because it knew it did not have the required number,” Mr Sanaullah claimed.
Governor’s order on PA speaker ruling
In the late evening, Governor Rehman wrote a three-page order in response to PA Speaker Sibtain Khan’s ruling which had termed Mr Rehman’s order seeking vote of confidence from Mr Elahi ‘illegal’.
In his order, the governor said under Article 130(7) of the Constitution that PA speaker’s ruling had no bearing on his order and termed it unconstitutional. The governor said the speaker’s ruling was also in violation of Rule 209 of the Rules of Procedure of the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab, 1997.
“The speaker’s ruling, consequent acts and omissions constitute and result in enabling the chief minister to refrain from obtaining a vote of confidence in terms of Article 130(7). Helping and aiding the CM in refraining from fulfilling his duty and preventing the constitutional process from proceeding to its logical end leads to the consequences stipulated in Rule 22 (7) of the Rules of Procedure of the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab, 1997.”
Meanwhile, taking a screenshot of the governor’s reply, PTI senior leader Fawad Chaudhry, in a tweet, asked Mr Rehman not to make a mockery of his office. “Dear Governor! Do not make a mockery of your office, the speaker’s ruling is final as far affairs of the Assembly are concerned and do not expose yourself to misconduct proceedings. Respect the Constitution,” he added.
Earlier in the day, the governor held a meeting with the PML-N and PPP leaders and legal experts to discuss the strategy of the federal government. Federal ministers Rana Sanaullah and Saad Rafique, premier’s special assistants Attaullah Tarar and Malik Ahmed Khan, and PPP Punjab parliamentary party leader Hasan Murtaza were present in the meeting.
Separately, the federal government on Wednesday decided to deploy Pakistan Rangers and Frontier Constabulary (FC) across Punjab, interior ministry sources said, adding that the federal agencies would ensure law and order in the province and work for implementation of laws and Constitution.
Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah directed the Punjab chief secretary and inspector general of police to maintain law and order, protection of the life and property of the people, and perform their duties as per law and Constitution, sources said.
The interior minister also warned officials not to become part of any process that was against the law and Constitution.

2022-12-22,2022-12-22,‘Unconstitutional’ removal of chief minister to be opposed: PTI,Imran to announce party’s future course of action at protest today.,"• Imran to announce party’s future course of action at protest today
• Fawad claims Zardari offered PTI women MPAs Rs50m each to abstain from voting
• As per agreement with PTI, PML-Q to get 30 PA, 15 NA seats 
LAHORE: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has announced that it will challenge any “unconstitutional” move of de-notifying Punjab Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi, and asked its leadership, parliamentarians and party workers to reach the Governor House at 5pm on Thursday (today) to ‘block’ the governor from taking any such action.
PTI Chairman Imran Khan will address the protesters through video link and announce the party’s next line of action in the face of the provincial opposition’s moves to save the Punjab Assembly.
Earlier on Wednesday, Governor Balighur Rehman had declared Punjab Assembly Speaker Sibtain Khan’s ruling regarding CM Elahi’s vote of confidence “unconstitutional” and “illegal”.
On Tuesday, the speaker had termed the governor’s orders — to the CM to obtain a vote of confidence from the provincial assembly by 4pm on Wednesday — as “illegal, against the provisions of the Constitution and thus stand disposed of”, and issued a ruling in this regard.
The PTI leadership on Wednesday maintained the speaker had ruled that the assembly was in session and until the session was prorogued, the governor could not summon a fresh session, citing a 1997 ruling by the Lahore High Court. They said the court had ruled that “not less than 10 clear days” must be granted to the chief minister to obtain a vote of confidence.
PTI Central Punjab General Secretary Hammad Azhar gave a call to PTI leaders, lawmakers and party workers and supporters to reach outside the Governor House at 5pm on Thursday (today).
“The masses can no longer remain silent spectators while an unconstitutional game is being played,” he remarked.
Meanwhile, the federal government has sought deployment of Rangers to beef up security of the Governor House “till further orders under sections 7(b) and 10 of the Pakistan Rangers Ordinance, 1959 and Section 4(3)(i) of Anti-Terrorism Act 1997”.
“The Pakistan Rangers (Punjab) is requested to immediate necessary action with regard to beefing up the security at the Governor’s House, Lahore, in coordination with the office of the governor,” said the Interior Ministry.
PTI senior leader Fawad Chaudhry told the media outside party chief Imran Khan’s Zaman Park residence that the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) parties were ‘scared of’ holding general elections, adding they would be violating the Constitution’s Article 109 by asking the chief minister to take a vote of confidence immediately. 
He said the governor should give 10 clear days for the vote or challenge the Punjab Assembly speaker’s ruling in court.
He further said the PTI had called its parliamentary party meeting on Thursday (today) and stressed its 177 as well as the PML-Q’s 10 MPAs were available to foil a no-confidence motion submitted by the PML-N and the PPP separately against the chief minister as well as the Punjab Assembly speaker and deputy speaker.
Mr Chaudhry also claimed that the party’s women MPAs had told Mr Khan that they were receiving offers from former president Asif Zardari to abstain from voting for Rs50 million each.
“The people of Sindh should know that Asif Zardari is spending their welfare money to buy loyalties of PTI MPAs,” he said.
Claiming that some other MPAs had also received threatening calls to abstain from voting, he demanded the superior courts take notice and identify those who were trying to terrify the party legislators.
“As soon as the vote of no-confidence fails, the Punjab Assembly will be dissolved and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly will follow suit,” he declared.
On the other hand, a three-member committee of the PTI held a meeting with CM Elahi and his party members and discussed seat adjustment prospects in detail.
As part of a formula, sources said, the PTI agreed to offer 30 Punjab Assembly and 15 National Assembly seats to the PML-Q. The party of the Chaudhrys had sought seats in the newly created Gujrat division – their hometown -- that included Gujrat, Mandi Bahauddin, Wazirabad and Hafizabad districts, some parts of south Punjab as well as Sialkot.
PTI leader Shafqat Mahmood later confirmed that both the allied parties had mutually agreed over giving 30 Punjab and 15 National Assembly seats to Mr Elahi’s party.
Meanwhile, the PML-Q held its parliamentary party meeting, chaired by CM Elahi and parliamentary leader Sajid Bhatti, and discussed the current political situation and decided their future course of action.
The chief minister has also called the provincial cabinet’s seventh meeting at his office on Thursday (today) at 1:30pm with 21 items on the agenda.
Soon afterwards, PML-Q MNA Hussain Elahi tweeted that all 10 PML-Q MPAs had announced complete support for PTI chief Imran Khan and Chief Minister Parvez Elahi in the meeting.
Responding to the PDM government’s claim that it had won the loyalties of six PML-Q MPAs, Mr Hussain asserted that the federal ruling coalition would not be able to fool anyone with its propaganda, and commented: “They (PDM) talk about six MPAs when they can’t even break one.”
A PML-Q spokesman said the parliamentary party had delegated complete authority of making all the decisions to CM Elahi and resolved to vote in favour of the CM, speaker and deputy speaker when a vote of no-confidence was taken up in the house.
Mr Elahi also asserted that the PML-Q would continue standing by Imran Khan and that his party was united and would remain so to bulldoze any propaganda or rumours being spread by the PDM government in the Centre.
Earlier in the day, as Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah had claimed he would seal the Chief Minister House if Mr Elahi didn’t take a vote of confidence, the CM’s son, Moonis, said he had “reached 8-Club CM House and waiting for you”. A few hours later, he tweeted: “Rana sb am bored now. Heading home but pls do let me know when you plan to come.”

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,"PTI set to approach SC, not speaker, for resignations’ acceptance","“We are dealing with those people who do not have any moral standing,” says Senator Shibli Faraz.","ISLAMABAD: Contra­dicting the announcement it made only days ago that PTI members of National Assembly are ready to appear before Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf for verification of their resignations, the party on Wednesday changed its stance as senior party leader Senator Shibli Faraz declared that the lawmakers would not go to the Parliament House, and instead, the PTI would approach the Supreme Court to seek acceptance of the mass resignations.
“We had decided to go to the assembly for acceptance of our resignations. But this is not the way and MNAs, who are elected by the people, cannot be asked to keep standing in a queue for acceptance of their resignations … The government is doing all this [handling the resignation issue] with a mala fide intention,” said Mr Faraz, alleging that the speaker wanted to “humiliate” the PTI lawmakers by treating them as “charity seekers”.
Talking to Dawn, Mr Faraz said they would approach the Supreme Court and ask it to direct the speaker to accept the resignations submitted some eight months ago.
“We will go to the SC in a day or two,” he said.
The party is going to the apex court where this issue has already been discussed during the hearing of various petitions and even the judges had observed that PTI should reconsider its decision of quitting the assembly.
When asked if it was not a U-turn as PTI Vice Chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi had written a letter to the speaker only six days back, asking him to allocate some time for the party’s MNAs to verify their resignations, Mr Faraz said they wanted to do so, but the government did not seem to be serious which was evident from the fact that it had convened a session of the National Assembly on Thursday (today) on a one-day notice despite the fact that the speaker was not even present in the country.
“This is not a U-turn. Look at the spirit of the matter. Why is the government delaying acceptance of our resignations? Why has the speaker adopted a pick-and-choose policy by accepting the resignations of only 11 members?” he said, adding that submission of mass resignations was part of the party strategy to force the government to hold early elections in the country. Otherwise, he said, the party MNAs could have been asked to submit resignations in groups.
When his attention was drawn to the assembly rules under which the speaker is required to individually call the members for verification of resignations, Mr Faraz posed a valid counter-question, saying: “Under which law did the speaker accept the resignations of the 11 MNAs who had also not appeared before him for verification [of their resignations]?”
“We are dealing with those people who do not have any moral standing,” the PTI senator alleged, questioning the logic behind the speaker’s decision to accept the resignations of 11 members out of 123 who had submitted the resignations en masse at the time of the election of Shehbaz Sharif as the prime minister in April.
On Dec 15, while talking to reporters in Lahore, Mr Qureshi had expressed his party’s resolve to dissolve the assemblies of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and get the MNAs’ resignations accepted after appearing before the speaker.
“We have already made our decision. We will execute it,” he had stated, adding that party Chairman Imran Khan had given him the letter for sending it to the speaker.
He also waved the ‘letter’ bearing the subject “Resignations of MNAs of PTI” to the media and chided the speaker for being “selective” while accepting the resignations of 11 MNAs “illegally”.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,"Onus on Centre to fight militancy, says KP",KP govt's spokesperson says the police’s job is to counter routine crimes and ‘national security’ is beyond their mandate.,"PESHAWAR: As some semblance of normalcy returned to Bannu on Wednesday, a day after an operation against terrorists, the under-fire KP government refused to accept the blame for the resurgence of terrorism, saying it was the responsibility of the Centre to tackle the issue.
Chief Minister Mahmood Khan in a media talk declared that ‘fighting militancy’ was the mandate of the federal government.
Meanwhile, President Arif Alvi, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Army chief Gen Syed Asim Munir, separately, paid tribute to the soldiers who took part in the operation at the CTD centre in Bannu on Tuesday.
The KP chief minister explained that it was the Centre’s job to fight militancy since the institutions fighting [against militants] fell within the jurisdiction of the federal government.
“Crime and law and order situation is the provincial government’s job but militancy falls within their [federal government’s] domain and hence this is their responsibility,” he maintained.
Besides, the chief minister claimed that the federal government was reluctant to release funds for both current and developmental expenditures. “Neither do we receive the current nor the developmental expenditures [funding],” he said and alleged that the funds were being diverted to the federal government’s members of parliament.
Endorsing the CM’s views, the KP government’s spokesperson told a press briefing that the police’s job was to counter routine crimes and ‘national security’ was beyond its mandate.
He said the incident that took place inside the Bannu CTD centre fell within the definition of ‘national security’ which was the federal the government’s domain.
“This is not something about general law and order…it falls within the domain of the national security which is the responsibility of the federal government,” CM Adviser on Information Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif said.
In reply to a question about the recently held talks with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Afghanistan, the special assistant said that war had never ended since 2001 and dialogue was an attempt to further improve the situation but a permanent solution [to militancy] could not be found.
“The reason for dialogue with them [TTP] was to improve the situation,” Mr Saif said, adding that war never ended, though its intensity fluctuated. “We wanted a permanent solution but it did not happen,” he said while explaining the reason for holding talks with the Taliban.
A KP minister, however, appeared to have a different stance, reported APP.
Kamran Bangash at a presser reiterated the provincial government’s resolve to eliminate terrorism and extremism in all its forms and manifestations and said the government was taking pragmatic steps to improve the capacity of police and the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD).
Referring to the terrorist attack on the CTD compound, he said police and security forces had already shared information about the possible terrorist attacks.
Meanwhile, Chief of Army Staff Gen Syed Asim Munir met the officers and soldiers, who were injured during the Bannu operation, at the CMH Rawalpindi, according to an Inter-Services Public Relations release.
The COAS remained with them for some time and inquired about their well-being.
He appreciated their high spirit and morale and lauded their professionalism during the operation against the terrorists.
Pledge against terrorism
President Alvi lauded the security forces for carrying out a successful operation against terrorists in Bannu and expressed the resolve to eliminate terrorism from the country’s soil, APP reported.
The president, in a statement, termed the success a result of the professionalism of security forces and their unwavering commitment against terrorism.
In separate remarks, Prime Minister Sharif said the state would not surrender to any terrorist group or organisation and vowed that militants would be dealt with according to the Constitution and law.
Strongly condemning the activities of terrorists, he said such attempts would be crushed.
“We will not let the sacrifices of the martyrs go to waste,” he said and mentioned the military operations of Raddul Fasaad and Zarb-i-Azb as significant measures to eradicate terrorism.
The prime minister said that though main responsibility for law and order lies with the provinces, the federation could not turn a blind eye to such problems.
He assured the provinces that the federal government would work along with them in fighting terrorism and vowed to fully implement the National Action Plan to eliminate terrorism.
PM Shehbaz said the federal government would assist the provinces in improving the professional capacity of the anti-terrorism force and departments.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,SC overturns verdicts in favour of khula,"Husband’s claim of conjugal rights seemed to be motivated by his intention to avoid payment of dower amount, judge observes.","ISLAMABAD: In a family suit, the Supreme Court on Wednesday set aside the Peshawar High Court (PHC) and appellate court decisions for dissolution of a marriage by way of khula and restored the decree of a family court to dissolve the marriage on the basis of cruelty inflicted by a man on his wife.
While the family court after recording of evidence and hearing both sides had dissolved the marriage due to cruelty on a suit moved by Tayyeba Ambareen against her husband Shafqat Ali Kiyani demanding dower amount, dowry articles, medical expenses and maintenance for herself and their daughter, the appellate court on Nov 10, 2015 overturned the decree and converted it into khula with the direction to the woman to refund five-tola gold to her husband. The high court also upheld the appellate court decision.
Headed by Justice Sardar Tariq Masood, a three-judge Supreme Court bench then took up an appeal against the PHC verdict.
In its decision, the apex court observed that husband’s claim of conjugal rights — despite his ‘ruthless, tyrannical and oppressive’ conduct or behaviour — seemed to be motivated by the sole intention to avoid paying maintenance allowance and the dower amount and he ultimately succeeded in his effort when the appellate court dissolved the marriage by way of khula with the direction to the wife to refund the dower amount.

Husband’s claim of conjugal rights seemed to be motivated by his intention to avoid payment of dower amount, judge observes

Justice Mohammad Ali Mazhar, a member of the SC bench, in a judgment he wrote, observed the main disagreement or source of discord between the parties was whether petitioner Tayyeba Ambareen was entitled to claim a decree for dissolution of marriage on the ground of cruelty and whether the appellate forum rightly converted the dissolution of marriage on the ground of cruelty to dissolution by way of khula.
The SC noted that the family court unequivocally articulated that the petitioner discharged the burden of proving cruelty on part of the husband by quoting many incidents while her evidence was not shattered during her cross-examination and thus the family court rightly dissolved the marriage on account of cruelty after a thorough examination and consideration of evidence.
Justice Mazhar observed that the appellate court could modify or set aside the judgment of the family court if it was found contrary to the evidence since the purpose of appellate jurisdiction was to reappraise whether the lower court committed any error. Likewise, he noted, the high court affirmed the findings of the appellate court without realizing that the allegations of maltreatment and cruelty had been satisfactorily proved by the petitioner during the trial.
The matrimonial bond between a man and woman is a pious relationship that plays an important part and also nurtures between the husband and wife happiness and compassion, the lineage and family heredity also depends on it, Justice Mazhar observed, adding the connubial affairs are based on gentle, human and emotional affiliation which requires mutual trust, regard, respect, love and affection and the relationship should also be in accordance with social norms.
As Islam ordains husbands to provide food, clothing, accommodation and all other necessities of life to the best of his capability and capacity, a man is expected to treat his wife nicely, with love and affection, Justice Mazhar observed. A conduct or behaviour that inflicts upon the wife mental pain and anguish makes it impossible for her to continue matrimonial relationship, the verdict explained.
Justice Mazhar recalled how the family court decision depicted different acts which caused mental anguish and torture to the wife, as only a week after their marriage, the husband started pressurising his wife to arrange money to get a house on rent. The husband and his family members also levelled false accusations at her, alleging that his daughter was not their child, with the result that the petitioner suffered severe mental agony, the court noted.
While she was in the family way, the man left her instead of supporting his wife, the court observed. He did not turn up at the crucial time; neither did he pay any maintenance allowance nor delivery expenses, it was recalled.
Also, the husband and his family members imposed a harsh condition on her that she should deposit her salary into a joint account with her husband and seek his permission for personal use.
Despite filing the family suit, the husband’s behaviour did not change rather he caused more mental anguish and started levelling false accusations, imposing condition that the amount for the house purchased by the wife be reimbursed by her father to the husband.
But the apex court noted that the appellate court, instead of considering the evidence reached a conclusion without any reason that no solid piece of evidence was brought to show physical torture or mental agony and held the allegation was exaggerated, adding that the “acts of cruelty were common” in nature and were “found in every family”.
On the basis of the observations, the Supreme Court set aside the judgments of the high court and the appellate court and restored the decree passed by the family court.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,SBP slashes GDP growth forecast to below 3-4pc,"Cuts FY23 outlook after considering flood-induced destruction, policy focus on stabilisation.","KARACHI: The central bank has lowered its projected GDP growth from the previously announced range of 3-4 per cent for the current fiscal year, citing flood-induced destruction and the stabilisation policy as major factors in its flagship economic health report released on Wednesday.
However, in its Annual Report on the State of Pakistan’s Economy, which mostly discussed the previous financial year that ended on June 30, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said economic growth was stronger than expected in the 2021-22 fiscal year as real GDP increased by 6pc compared to 5.7pc a year ago.
The primary drivers of this growth were a broad-based expansion in large-scale manufacturing (LSM) and improved agricultural output, the report said.
“A combination of adverse global and domestic developments led to the re-emergence of macroeconomic imbalances during FY22,” it said.

Cuts FY23 outlook after considering flood-induced destruction, policy focus on stabilisation

The SBP said that the economy was already in a stabilisation phase when widespread flooding hit a large part of the country at the start of the current fiscal year.
It said the flooding was likely to impinge on the country’s real economic activity through various channels, fearing that losses in agriculture emerging from the damages to crops and livestock were likely to transmit to the rest of the economy through various backward and forward linkages.
 
 

The large-scale destruction of infrastructure in the affected provinces might also undermine the country’s growth prospects during the year, the bank said.
The SBP avoided providing any range for the growth rate of the current financial year apparently due to the worsening economic situation. Industries have either shut down or drastically cut their production due to high inflation and the unavailability of gas and electricity.
One major reason is the cork put by the SBP on the opening of letters of credit (LCs) for imports in an attempt to save dollars.
The All-Pakistan Textile Mills Association has threatened to announce lay-offs within days if the gas supply is not restored and LCs are not opened.
The textile industry claims that up to 500,000 people, who were associated with the sector directly or indirectly, have lost their jobs. No official data is available in this regard.
International credit rating agencies have slashed the credit rating of Pakistan and predicted an economic growth rate of around 2pc for the current fiscal year.
The SBP report said that several corrective and other measures were likely to slow the momentum of economic activity during FY23, including a hike of 675 basis points in the policy rate, demand management measures announced in the previous fiscal year, and the government’s decision to unwind the fiscal package for fuel and electricity subsidies towards the end of FY22.
The report noted that the expansionary fiscal stance in FY22, an upsurge in global commodity prices, and the fallout of the Russia-Ukraine conflict led to a marked deterioration in the current account deficit.
 
 

In addition, the delay in the resumption of the IMF loan programme and political instability exacerbated the country’s vulnerability through the depletion of foreign exchange reserves.
The resulting rupee depreciation “amplified inflationary pressures by magnifying the effect of global price increase”, the SBP report said.
It said the experience from FY22 brought to the fore once again the need to address the country’s structural weaknesses, such as a narrow base of foreign exchange earnings and meagre inflows of foreign investment.
“A concerted approach is required to encourage increased localisation of the manufacturing base, along with the lowering of energy intensity of the economy by ensuring energy efficiency and conservation,” the report said.
Moreover, amid the growing issues related to climate change and inadequate food security situation, there is an urgent need to formulate a well-thought-out strategy to meet these challenges, it said.
It stressed that priority should be given to producing new varieties of seeds that are suitable to varying weather conditions and to devise a framework that emphasises water management strategies to increase agricultural productivity.
“The losses to agriculture produce induced by the recent floods is likely to step up the import of agriculture commodities, particularly cotton,” the report said.
It said the government has targeted to reduce the fiscal deficit to 4.9pc of GDP in FY23 from 7.9pc in FY22. “This outcome would be achieved through both revenue and expenditure measures,” it said.
In fact, the fiscal deficit exceeded in the first quarter of FY23, annoying the IMF, which demanded more measures to reduce the gap.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,PM promises Rs5bn to reconstruct flood-hit homes,Govt launches ‘4RF’ comprehensive plan for rehabilitation of millions of survivors.,"SUKKUR/ISLAMABAD: As he assured Sindh that the federal government would not leave flood survivors in a lurch, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the Centre would spend at least Rs5 billion to construct houses for flood victims in the province.
After his visit to rain-hit areas in Khairpur on Wednesday, the prime minister said that Rs4.80 billion had been donated to the prime minister’s account for flood survivors and added that more funds were expected to be donated.
According to PM Sharif, the rehabilitation process was already underway across the country, but there were still several areas in Khairpur and Dadu which were underwater. 
He added that the government would move towards reconstruction and rehabilitation works, but at present, at least eight million families were rain-affected. 
He elaborated that at least 20m people, including nine million children, were waiting for the government to help them.

Govt launches ‘4RF’ comprehensive plan for rehabilitation of millions of survivors

Drainage plan
He said that the government would build houses for the affected people and added that the chief minister would provide plots for the construction and the same process would be followed in other provinces as well.
“A donors conference is going to be held in Geneva next month,” said PM Sharif and added that he would go to the moot fully prepared to present Pakistan’s case for aid in light of massive destruction due to floods. The PM also announced the establishment of a campus of COMSATS University in Khairpur.
Speaking at the residence of PPP leader Manzoor Wassan in Khairpur, Shehbaz Sharif said that his government would “positively consider” the master plan for drainage on the left bank of the River Indus proposed by a foreign consultant, Louis Berger.
Mr Sharif said that the scale of the disaster was massive so Pakistan would require plenty of resources to tackle this challenge.
During the visit, the premier was also briefed by Chief Engineer Development Region-I Mansoor Memon in Pir Gaddo, Kot Diji about inundated areas in the province.
The chief engineer said that out of 3.3m acres of area, 2m acres were inundated on the right bank and 1.3m acres on the left bank of the Indus till Aug 31.
In Khairpur, 141,000 acres of land was submerged till Aug 31 but now only 7,800 acres of land needed to be dewatered, Mr Memon informed. He maintained that field drains on an area of 200 square kms were created to drain rainwater.
According to the chief engineer, Khairpur was a victim of a “poor drainage network” and the only drainage system that existed in the area pertained to salinity control and water-logging issue. He informed when the Sukkur barrage was built, the flow of natural watercourses in the area was obstructed. 
“Even this area where we are standing is an old waterway,” Mr Memon said while showing the site on a satellite image.
He said that floodwater from the mountainous range stretching over 75,000 sq kms in Balochistan reached Qambar Shahdadkot and Dadu districts in recent floods and 600,000 acres and 400,000 acres of the area was inundated respectively in Qambar and Dadu districts. This meant that out of 2m acres, 50pc of the area was affected in these two districts, he added.
Speaking about the Berger plan regarding drainage, the engineer urged that the scheme was of paramount importance for left bank areas. CM Murad agreed. The Sindh CM said the provincial government wanted to use funds deposited with the apex court in the Bahria Town case for the execution of this scheme.
‘4RF plan’
Separately, the government launched a comprehensive plan prepared by the planning and development division for the rehabilitation of flood victims. 
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, Prime Minister Shehbaz launched the ‘Resilient, Recovery, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Framework’ (4RF) which envisaged short, medium, and long-term strategies to rehabilitate the survivors.
A copy of the 4RF report was presented to the prime minister by Ahsan Iqbal, Minister for Planning Development and Special Initiatives (MoPD&SI) during a meeting. 
Mr Iqbal apprised the prime minister that the document was based on the loss and damage estimated in the post-disaster needs assessment report, which was launched in October this year.
PM Sharif directed that necessary efforts must be made for the effective pitching of this framework in the upcoming donors’ conference, scheduled to be held on January 9, 2023, in Geneva, Switzerland.
He directed that the planning ministry in coordination with the foreign ministry, climate change ministry, and economic affairs division may take necessary steps for the effective dissemination of the document to all the stakeholders at home and abroad.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,FIA court rejects Swati’s post-arrest bail,ISLAMABAD: A special court of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on Wednesday rejected the post-arrest bail of...,"ISLAMABAD: A special court of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on Wednesday rejected the post-arrest bail of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Senator Azam Khan Swati in a case registered against him over anti-establishment tweets.
Special Judge (Central) Azam Khan observed that Senator Swati had repeated the same crime in which he was already on a post-arrest bail.
During the course of the hearing, FIA’s special prosecutor Raja Rizwan Abbasi argued that Mr Swati operated a verified Twitter account and he was being followed by politicians, journalists and the public at large. He said Mr Swati never contested the ownership of his Twitter handle and used it to build an anti-army narrative.
Mr Abbasi claimed this was a deliberate attempt to incite mutiny among personnel of the armed forces. He said the PTI leader misused the relief of bail and tweeted the same text for which he was facing a case before the FIA’s Cybercrimes Wing.
Mr Swati’s counsel Babar Awan argued that the complainant, who had lodged the first information report (FIR) against his client, was not an aggrieved party.
He said the case had been registered by the FIA and it was not on a par with the complaint filed under defamation laws.
Mr Awan argued that the court could impose a maximum penalty of Rs1,000 on Mr Swati over his tweet, but he was being moved from one province to another.
The FIA had earlier this month arrested Mr Swati for defamation, statement conducing to public mischief, and highly obnoxious campaign of intimidating tweets, after his fiery speech at a PTI long march in Rawalpindi in which he lashed out at the senior military leadership.

2022-12-20,2022-12-22,‘TTP is Pakistan’s absolute red line’,Bilawal says Islamabad willing to consider all options to ensure citizens’ safety and security.,"WASHINGTON: Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has suggested letting neighbouring countries know that the outlawed TTP is an “absolute red line” for Pakistan and it would not allow anyone to cross that line.
“As far as the TTP (Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan) is concerned, it’s absolutely our red line. It is something that we will not tolerate,” said the foreign minister while speaking at the Atlantic Council, Washington, on Tuesday evening. 
“And absolutely we will be willing to consider each and every single option to ensure the safety and security of our people.” 

 





 
As the foreign minister stressed the need for combating militants in his Washington talk, Pakistan’s UN Ambassador Munir Akram told the UN Security Council in New York that engagement with the Taliban was the best option to stabilise the region.
“Coercion and isolation have not proved successful in the past; they will prove to be counter-productive now and in the future,” said Ambassador Akram while participating in a UN debate on the situation in Afghanistan. “We need a coherent and practical plan to realise the objectives of the international community through patient engagement with the interim government,” the Pakistani envoy told the 15-member Council.

Bilawal says Islamabad willing to consider all options to ensure citizens’ safety and security

Mr Bhutto-Zardari made a similar observation in his talk at the Atlantic Council, urging world powers to work with Afghanistan’s de facto rulers to stabilise the region. When the moderator, Uzair Younus, asked if Pakistan could deploy troops inside Afghanistan or on the border to stop attacks by Afghanistan-based militant groups, the minister suggested using the “hammer and anvil” strategy, with Kabul’s cooperation, to eliminate militancy.
The chief Pakistani diplomat pointed out that despite these border and cross-border attacks, the situation was far more secure and stable now than it was in 2007, when Pakistan launched a series of operations against the TTP and other militants.
“But those things can be put at risk if this goes unchecked. And obviously that would undermine any hope, whether it is CPEC or any other form of economic activity. Nobody wants to put lives at risk in order to conduct business,” he warned.
“That’s why I have been particularly hawkish on the issue of the TTP, and on the issue of terrorism in general. I believe that recent events in the region are alarming, not only the border incidents but the recent Bannu incident, which our security commanders have very bravely managed to overcome,” he said.
The foreign minister, however, stressed the need to “impress on our neighbours, particularly Afghan­istan” that they have to demonstrate the will and the capacity to take on the TTP or other groups functioning from there.
He acknowledged that there’s room for improvement in Pakistan’s Afghan policy — as there’s in America’s — and “we need to be serious about what we can do going forward”.
“Are we going learn from our mistakes to ensure that we do not repeat them,” he asked. “The answer to that question is going to define the safety and stability of Afghanistan, the safety and stability of Pakistan and the safety and stability of our region.” 
Pakistan’s number one option, he said, was to get the Afghan interim government to demonstrate that they had the capacity to deal with this issue.
Separately, the foreign minister also met Deputy Secretary of State Wendy R. Sherman where they discussed Pakistan’s efforts to recover from devastating floods and the upcoming Jan 9 International Con­ference on Climate Resilient Pakistan in Geneva. 
According to a readout issued by the State Department, the US official expressed condolences for Pakistani lives lost in recent terrorist attacks, and they committed to strengthen cooperation between the two countries.

The 13-member committee would be responsible to undertake a detailed mapping of the ‘gas sector circular debt stock as of June 30, 2022’, segregating the principal amount of debt, late payment surcharges, penalties and liquidity damages among the PSEs of petroleum and power sectors.
It would work out a comprehensive circular debt settlement plan through cash and non-cash payments and adjustments and also cover legal and procedural requirements on the pattern of a previous circular debt settlement in 2013.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,ECC defers PSO’s request for Rs17bn,Receivables of embattled national fuel supplier cross Rs612bn.,"ISLAMABAD: The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet was informed on Wednesday that receivables of the national fuel supplier – Pakistan State Oil (PSO) had crossed Rs612 billion and it was struggling to manage remittances to its foreign suppliers.
The meeting of the ECC presided over by Finance Minister Ishaq Dar, however, did not immediately approve Rs17bn urgently demanded by the PSO to honour its liabilities to international firms, particularly its long-term fuel supplier Kuwait Petroleum Company (KPC).
“The ECC deferred a summary submitted by the Ministry of Energy (Petroleum Division) for foreign exchange coverage to PSO and directed the Ministry of Energy to resubmit the summary after reviewing the numbers”, said an official statement.
The Petroleum Division reported that under a credit facility provided by KPC since 2000 and extended annually for the supply of diesel, a joint account of the federal government and KPC had been set up with the National Bank of Pakistan in which PSO keeps on depositing rupee equivalent funds after 30 days of the bill of lading for each shipment.
After 90 days from the bill of lading, the NBP has to transfer the cargo cost to KPC and exchange cover for an additional 60 days is borne by the federal government.
However, the account facility started to face huge shortfalls in April 2020 on account of exchange losses, posing a default situation in remittances to KPC.
At the time the ECC approved a supplementary grant of Rs12bn which helped PSO avoid an international default. The facility worked well for another two years but then suffered a shortfall again and now this shortfall stood at Rs17bn owing to “prevalent upheaval” in the rupee-dollar parity.

Receivables of embattled national fuel supplier cross Rs612bn

The Petroleum Division said the PSO had been defaulting even on rupee deposits in the NBP account because of its liquidity challenges as its receivables reached Rs612bn and “it urgently required adequate funds so that liabilities are met on time”. 
The Petroleum Division and PSO have been trying to manage the situation for avoiding international default by depositing required funds on due dates but the situation was “too critical” now.
It also complained that the Petroleum Division had been submitting budget requirements for exchange loss on this facility every year but the Ministry of Finance did not make separate provisions which led to exposure to international default.
The finance ministry, however, argued that the government had already released Rs30bn to address PSO’s liquidity position under the foreign exchange head in September and arranged another Rs50bn through market financing. Also, the government was now trying to ensure PSO recoveries through power companies and gas companies.
The Petroleum Division, however, insisted that the matter related to actual foreign exchange loss of over Rs17bn so far on the KPC’s credit facility up to Dec 2, which has to be paid by the government sooner or later.
“PSO has made all outstanding payments delayed due to liquidity position. Exchange loss, however, is the liability of the government”, Petroleum Division was quoted but a decision was deferred.
Supplementary grants
The ECC approved a summary of the Ministry of Energy (Petroleum Division) on the transfer of 30pc working interests in exploration licences/block – Margala Block – owned by M/s MOL of Hungary to M/s Mari Petroleum Company Ltd. 
It was apprised that Margala Block was governed by Pakistan Petroleum Exploration and Production Rules 2001 and the acquiring company MPCL was operating in Pakistan since 1954 and has working interests in 23 exploration licences and 15 development & production leases. The ECC was further informed that M/s MOL had cleared all its financial obligations.
The ECC also approved a Rs823m technical supplementary grant to the Ministry of Maritime Affairs, enabling Gwadar Port Authority (GPA) to disburse the amount of Rs250,000 per head to 3,291 fishermen registered with Balochistan Fisheries Department for the purchase of boat engines.
The ECC also approved another Rs200mn Technical Supplementary Grant to the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulation and Coordination for Ghurki Trust Teaching Hospital (GTTH), Lahore. Ghurki Trust Teaching Hospital (GTTH) is a tertiary care non-profit organisation providing “State of the Art” health facilities to needy and poor patients.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,"China willing to provide ‘all kinds of assistance’, envoy assures Dar","Both sides deliberate on several avenues for expanding bilateral relations, especially in the economic and financial sectors.","ISLAMABAD: China assured Pakistan on Wednesday that it is ready to help Islamabad in every possible way following its request for about $8.75 billion in an additional financial package, including the rollover of debt, bank deposits and currency swaps.
Chinese Ambassador in Islamabad Nong Rong called on Finance Minister Ishaq Dar on Wednesday and “assured continuous support of the Chinese government to Pakistan”, the finance ministry said in a statement.
The “government of China stands with the people of Pakistan and is willing to provide all kinds of assistance”, the statement added.
Mr Dar told reporters last month that Pakistan had sought about $9bn in additional financial support from China during the visit of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to Beijing, and that the Chinese leadership had promised to “roll over $4bn in sovereign loans, refinance $3.3bn commercial bank loans and increase currency swap by about $1.45bn — from 30bn yuan to 40bn yuan”. The total worked out at $8.75bn.
Pakistan needs at least $34bn until June 30, 2023, to meet its international liabilities, including debt and trade payments. Pakistan is banking on about $13bn in additional support from China and Saudi Arabia.
The statement said Mr Dar “thanked the Chinese ambassador for their continuous support and assistance” and praised the long-standing and deep-rooted friendly relations between the two countries.
Both sides deliberated on several avenues for expanding bilateral relations, especially in the economic and financial sectors. The ambassador appreciated the government’s policy initiatives to sustain and boost fiscal and monetary stability.
Mr Dar had earlier said that the Chinese president and prime minister had assured Prime Minister Sharif that his government would stand by Pakistan and “will not let you down”.
He had then separately taken up the issue of refinancing $3bn in China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) deposit and about $3.3bn debt rollover. Both these heads are due for maturity on different dates before June 30.

The bond is perpetual in nature, which means there’s no redemption date and bondholders can liquidate their investments in the secondary market at the time of their choosing.
The investment will offer a floating rate of six-month Karachi interbank offered rate (Kibor) plus 200 basis points if the bank is compliant with CAR, minimum capital requirement (MCR) and leverage ratio (LR) at the end of a given period.

Topline Securities said bearish sentiments prevailed especially in the second half of the trading session as investors went on a selling spree that eroded earlier gains. The sell-off was in reaction to the tug of war between the PTI and other parties on the dissolution of the Punjab Assembly.

As a result, the KSE-100 index settled at 39,342.89 points, down 489.56 points or 1.23 per cent from the preceding session.

• Interior ministry asks Rangers, FC to perform security duties in Punjab
LAHORE: In a tit-for-tat move, Governor Balighur Rehman on Wednesday termed the ruling of Punjab Assembly Speaker Sibtain Khan disposing of his directives regarding the vote of confidence “unconstitutional”, whereas the coalition government hinted at the imposition of governor’s rule in Pakistan’s largest province.
The PML-N government initially hinted that governor’s rule could be imposed for two months through a resolution in a joint session of parliament, but the period could be extended to six months.
“Since the chief minister on Wednesday failed to take the trust vote in the Punjab Assembly in compliance with the governor’s order, legally he ceases to hold his office. And now any time... probably on Thursday (today), the governor can issue an order de-notifying the CM,” Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah said earlier in the day.
This view was echoed by SAPM Attaullah Tarrar, who told reporters late on Wednesday night that the governor had discretionary powers to de-notify the CM and it was up to him whether he wanted to do it “tomorrow or the day after”.
Another option, Mr Sanaullah said, is governor’s rule by the Centre. “In the wake of the constitutional crisis, the government may get a resolution passed from the National Assembly and Senate to impose governor’s rule in Punjab for two months initially — the period can be extended to six months as well,” the minister added.
He was of the view that “all was not well” in the camp of Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Punjab parliamentary party. “Had the PTI been confident that CM Elahi could secure the support of 186 MPAs in the PA he would have gone for the trust vote on Wednesday in compliance with the governor’s order,” he said, adding that the CM could have gone for PA’s dissolution after the vote in line with Imran Khan’s plan for the dissolution of assemblies. “But the PTI chose otherwise because it knew it did not have the required number,” Mr Sanaullah claimed.
Governor’s order on PA speaker ruling
In the late evening, Governor Rehman wrote a three-page order in response to PA Speaker Sibtain Khan’s ruling which had termed Mr Rehman’s order seeking vote of confidence from Mr Elahi ‘illegal’.
In his order, the governor said under Article 130(7) of the Constitution that PA speaker’s ruling had no bearing on his order and termed it unconstitutional. The governor said the speaker’s ruling was also in violation of Rule 209 of the Rules of Procedure of the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab, 1997.
“The speaker’s ruling, consequent acts and omissions constitute and result in enabling the chief minister to refrain from obtaining a vote of confidence in terms of Article 130(7). Helping and aiding the CM in refraining from fulfilling his duty and preventing the constitutional process from proceeding to its logical end leads to the consequences stipulated in Rule 22 (7) of the Rules of Procedure of the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab, 1997.”
Meanwhile, taking a screenshot of the governor’s reply, PTI senior leader Fawad Chaudhry, in a tweet, asked Mr Rehman not to make a mockery of his office. “Dear Governor! Do not make a mockery of your office, the speaker’s ruling is final as far affairs of the Assembly are concerned and do not expose yourself to misconduct proceedings. Respect the Constitution,” he added.
Earlier in the day, the governor held a meeting with the PML-N and PPP leaders and legal experts to discuss the strategy of the federal government. Federal ministers Rana Sanaullah and Saad Rafique, premier’s special assistants Attaullah Tarar and Malik Ahmed Khan, and PPP Punjab parliamentary party leader Hasan Murtaza were present in the meeting.
Separately, the federal government on Wednesday decided to deploy Pakistan Rangers and Frontier Constabulary (FC) across Punjab, interior ministry sources said, adding that the federal agencies would ensure law and order in the province and work for implementation of laws and Constitution.
Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah directed the Punjab chief secretary and inspector general of police to maintain law and order, protection of the life and property of the people, and perform their duties as per law and Constitution, sources said.
The interior minister also warned officials not to become part of any process that was against the law and Constitution.

• As per agreement with PTI, PML-Q to get 30 PA, 15 NA seats 
LAHORE: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has announced that it will challenge any “unconstitutional” move of de-notifying Punjab Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi, and asked its leadership, parliamentarians and party workers to reach the Governor House at 5pm on Thursday (today) to ‘block’ the governor from taking any such action.
PTI Chairman Imran Khan will address the protesters through video link and announce the party’s next line of action in the face of the provincial opposition’s moves to save the Punjab Assembly.
Earlier on Wednesday, Governor Balighur Rehman had declared Punjab Assembly Speaker Sibtain Khan’s ruling regarding CM Elahi’s vote of confidence “unconstitutional” and “illegal”.
On Tuesday, the speaker had termed the governor’s orders — to the CM to obtain a vote of confidence from the provincial assembly by 4pm on Wednesday — as “illegal, against the provisions of the Constitution and thus stand disposed of”, and issued a ruling in this regard.
The PTI leadership on Wednesday maintained the speaker had ruled that the assembly was in session and until the session was prorogued, the governor could not summon a fresh session, citing a 1997 ruling by the Lahore High Court. They said the court had ruled that “not less than 10 clear days” must be granted to the chief minister to obtain a vote of confidence.
PTI Central Punjab General Secretary Hammad Azhar gave a call to PTI leaders, lawmakers and party workers and supporters to reach outside the Governor House at 5pm on Thursday (today).
“The masses can no longer remain silent spectators while an unconstitutional game is being played,” he remarked.
Meanwhile, the federal government has sought deployment of Rangers to beef up security of the Governor House “till further orders under sections 7(b) and 10 of the Pakistan Rangers Ordinance, 1959 and Section 4(3)(i) of Anti-Terrorism Act 1997”.
“The Pakistan Rangers (Punjab) is requested to immediate necessary action with regard to beefing up the security at the Governor’s House, Lahore, in coordination with the office of the governor,” said the Interior Ministry.
PTI senior leader Fawad Chaudhry told the media outside party chief Imran Khan’s Zaman Park residence that the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) parties were ‘scared of’ holding general elections, adding they would be violating the Constitution’s Article 109 by asking the chief minister to take a vote of confidence immediately. 
He said the governor should give 10 clear days for the vote or challenge the Punjab Assembly speaker’s ruling in court.
He further said the PTI had called its parliamentary party meeting on Thursday (today) and stressed its 177 as well as the PML-Q’s 10 MPAs were available to foil a no-confidence motion submitted by the PML-N and the PPP separately against the chief minister as well as the Punjab Assembly speaker and deputy speaker.
Mr Chaudhry also claimed that the party’s women MPAs had told Mr Khan that they were receiving offers from former president Asif Zardari to abstain from voting for Rs50 million each.
“The people of Sindh should know that Asif Zardari is spending their welfare money to buy loyalties of PTI MPAs,” he said.
Claiming that some other MPAs had also received threatening calls to abstain from voting, he demanded the superior courts take notice and identify those who were trying to terrify the party legislators.
“As soon as the vote of no-confidence fails, the Punjab Assembly will be dissolved and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly will follow suit,” he declared.
On the other hand, a three-member committee of the PTI held a meeting with CM Elahi and his party members and discussed seat adjustment prospects in detail.
As part of a formula, sources said, the PTI agreed to offer 30 Punjab Assembly and 15 National Assembly seats to the PML-Q. The party of the Chaudhrys had sought seats in the newly created Gujrat division – their hometown -- that included Gujrat, Mandi Bahauddin, Wazirabad and Hafizabad districts, some parts of south Punjab as well as Sialkot.
PTI leader Shafqat Mahmood later confirmed that both the allied parties had mutually agreed over giving 30 Punjab and 15 National Assembly seats to Mr Elahi’s party.
Meanwhile, the PML-Q held its parliamentary party meeting, chaired by CM Elahi and parliamentary leader Sajid Bhatti, and discussed the current political situation and decided their future course of action.
The chief minister has also called the provincial cabinet’s seventh meeting at his office on Thursday (today) at 1:30pm with 21 items on the agenda.
Soon afterwards, PML-Q MNA Hussain Elahi tweeted that all 10 PML-Q MPAs had announced complete support for PTI chief Imran Khan and Chief Minister Parvez Elahi in the meeting.
Responding to the PDM government’s claim that it had won the loyalties of six PML-Q MPAs, Mr Hussain asserted that the federal ruling coalition would not be able to fool anyone with its propaganda, and commented: “They (PDM) talk about six MPAs when they can’t even break one.”
A PML-Q spokesman said the parliamentary party had delegated complete authority of making all the decisions to CM Elahi and resolved to vote in favour of the CM, speaker and deputy speaker when a vote of no-confidence was taken up in the house.
Mr Elahi also asserted that the PML-Q would continue standing by Imran Khan and that his party was united and would remain so to bulldoze any propaganda or rumours being spread by the PDM government in the Centre.
Earlier in the day, as Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah had claimed he would seal the Chief Minister House if Mr Elahi didn’t take a vote of confidence, the CM’s son, Moonis, said he had “reached 8-Club CM House and waiting for you”. A few hours later, he tweeted: “Rana sb am bored now. Heading home but pls do let me know when you plan to come.”

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,"PTI set to approach SC, not speaker, for resignations’ acceptance","“We are dealing with those people who do not have any moral standing,” says Senator Shibli Faraz.","ISLAMABAD: Contra­dicting the announcement it made only days ago that PTI members of National Assembly are ready to appear before Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf for verification of their resignations, the party on Wednesday changed its stance as senior party leader Senator Shibli Faraz declared that the lawmakers would not go to the Parliament House, and instead, the PTI would approach the Supreme Court to seek acceptance of the mass resignations.
“We had decided to go to the assembly for acceptance of our resignations. But this is not the way and MNAs, who are elected by the people, cannot be asked to keep standing in a queue for acceptance of their resignations … The government is doing all this [handling the resignation issue] with a mala fide intention,” said Mr Faraz, alleging that the speaker wanted to “humiliate” the PTI lawmakers by treating them as “charity seekers”.
Talking to Dawn, Mr Faraz said they would approach the Supreme Court and ask it to direct the speaker to accept the resignations submitted some eight months ago.
“We will go to the SC in a day or two,” he said.
The party is going to the apex court where this issue has already been discussed during the hearing of various petitions and even the judges had observed that PTI should reconsider its decision of quitting the assembly.
When asked if it was not a U-turn as PTI Vice Chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi had written a letter to the speaker only six days back, asking him to allocate some time for the party’s MNAs to verify their resignations, Mr Faraz said they wanted to do so, but the government did not seem to be serious which was evident from the fact that it had convened a session of the National Assembly on Thursday (today) on a one-day notice despite the fact that the speaker was not even present in the country.
“This is not a U-turn. Look at the spirit of the matter. Why is the government delaying acceptance of our resignations? Why has the speaker adopted a pick-and-choose policy by accepting the resignations of only 11 members?” he said, adding that submission of mass resignations was part of the party strategy to force the government to hold early elections in the country. Otherwise, he said, the party MNAs could have been asked to submit resignations in groups.
When his attention was drawn to the assembly rules under which the speaker is required to individually call the members for verification of resignations, Mr Faraz posed a valid counter-question, saying: “Under which law did the speaker accept the resignations of the 11 MNAs who had also not appeared before him for verification [of their resignations]?”
“We are dealing with those people who do not have any moral standing,” the PTI senator alleged, questioning the logic behind the speaker’s decision to accept the resignations of 11 members out of 123 who had submitted the resignations en masse at the time of the election of Shehbaz Sharif as the prime minister in April.
On Dec 15, while talking to reporters in Lahore, Mr Qureshi had expressed his party’s resolve to dissolve the assemblies of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and get the MNAs’ resignations accepted after appearing before the speaker.
“We have already made our decision. We will execute it,” he had stated, adding that party Chairman Imran Khan had given him the letter for sending it to the speaker.
He also waved the ‘letter’ bearing the subject “Resignations of MNAs of PTI” to the media and chided the speaker for being “selective” while accepting the resignations of 11 MNAs “illegally”.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,"Onus on Centre to fight militancy, says KP",KP govt's spokesperson says the police’s job is to counter routine crimes and ‘national security’ is beyond their mandate.,"PESHAWAR: As some semblance of normalcy returned to Bannu on Wednesday, a day after an operation against terrorists, the under-fire KP government refused to accept the blame for the resurgence of terrorism, saying it was the responsibility of the Centre to tackle the issue.
Chief Minister Mahmood Khan in a media talk declared that ‘fighting militancy’ was the mandate of the federal government.
Meanwhile, President Arif Alvi, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Army chief Gen Syed Asim Munir, separately, paid tribute to the soldiers who took part in the operation at the CTD centre in Bannu on Tuesday.
The KP chief minister explained that it was the Centre’s job to fight militancy since the institutions fighting [against militants] fell within the jurisdiction of the federal government.
“Crime and law and order situation is the provincial government’s job but militancy falls within their [federal government’s] domain and hence this is their responsibility,” he maintained.
Besides, the chief minister claimed that the federal government was reluctant to release funds for both current and developmental expenditures. “Neither do we receive the current nor the developmental expenditures [funding],” he said and alleged that the funds were being diverted to the federal government’s members of parliament.
Endorsing the CM’s views, the KP government’s spokesperson told a press briefing that the police’s job was to counter routine crimes and ‘national security’ was beyond its mandate.
He said the incident that took place inside the Bannu CTD centre fell within the definition of ‘national security’ which was the federal the government’s domain.
“This is not something about general law and order…it falls within the domain of the national security which is the responsibility of the federal government,” CM Adviser on Information Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif said.
In reply to a question about the recently held talks with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Afghanistan, the special assistant said that war had never ended since 2001 and dialogue was an attempt to further improve the situation but a permanent solution [to militancy] could not be found.
“The reason for dialogue with them [TTP] was to improve the situation,” Mr Saif said, adding that war never ended, though its intensity fluctuated. “We wanted a permanent solution but it did not happen,” he said while explaining the reason for holding talks with the Taliban.
A KP minister, however, appeared to have a different stance, reported APP.
Kamran Bangash at a presser reiterated the provincial government’s resolve to eliminate terrorism and extremism in all its forms and manifestations and said the government was taking pragmatic steps to improve the capacity of police and the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD).
Referring to the terrorist attack on the CTD compound, he said police and security forces had already shared information about the possible terrorist attacks.
Meanwhile, Chief of Army Staff Gen Syed Asim Munir met the officers and soldiers, who were injured during the Bannu operation, at the CMH Rawalpindi, according to an Inter-Services Public Relations release.
The COAS remained with them for some time and inquired about their well-being.
He appreciated their high spirit and morale and lauded their professionalism during the operation against the terrorists.
Pledge against terrorism
President Alvi lauded the security forces for carrying out a successful operation against terrorists in Bannu and expressed the resolve to eliminate terrorism from the country’s soil, APP reported.
The president, in a statement, termed the success a result of the professionalism of security forces and their unwavering commitment against terrorism.
In separate remarks, Prime Minister Sharif said the state would not surrender to any terrorist group or organisation and vowed that militants would be dealt with according to the Constitution and law.
Strongly condemning the activities of terrorists, he said such attempts would be crushed.
“We will not let the sacrifices of the martyrs go to waste,” he said and mentioned the military operations of Raddul Fasaad and Zarb-i-Azb as significant measures to eradicate terrorism.
The prime minister said that though main responsibility for law and order lies with the provinces, the federation could not turn a blind eye to such problems.
He assured the provinces that the federal government would work along with them in fighting terrorism and vowed to fully implement the National Action Plan to eliminate terrorism.
PM Shehbaz said the federal government would assist the provinces in improving the professional capacity of the anti-terrorism force and departments.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,SC overturns verdicts in favour of khula,"Husband’s claim of conjugal rights seemed to be motivated by his intention to avoid payment of dower amount, judge observes.","ISLAMABAD: In a family suit, the Supreme Court on Wednesday set aside the Peshawar High Court (PHC) and appellate court decisions for dissolution of a marriage by way of khula and restored the decree of a family court to dissolve the marriage on the basis of cruelty inflicted by a man on his wife.
While the family court after recording of evidence and hearing both sides had dissolved the marriage due to cruelty on a suit moved by Tayyeba Ambareen against her husband Shafqat Ali Kiyani demanding dower amount, dowry articles, medical expenses and maintenance for herself and their daughter, the appellate court on Nov 10, 2015 overturned the decree and converted it into khula with the direction to the woman to refund five-tola gold to her husband. The high court also upheld the appellate court decision.
Headed by Justice Sardar Tariq Masood, a three-judge Supreme Court bench then took up an appeal against the PHC verdict.
In its decision, the apex court observed that husband’s claim of conjugal rights — despite his ‘ruthless, tyrannical and oppressive’ conduct or behaviour — seemed to be motivated by the sole intention to avoid paying maintenance allowance and the dower amount and he ultimately succeeded in his effort when the appellate court dissolved the marriage by way of khula with the direction to the wife to refund the dower amount.

Husband’s claim of conjugal rights seemed to be motivated by his intention to avoid payment of dower amount, judge observes

Justice Mohammad Ali Mazhar, a member of the SC bench, in a judgment he wrote, observed the main disagreement or source of discord between the parties was whether petitioner Tayyeba Ambareen was entitled to claim a decree for dissolution of marriage on the ground of cruelty and whether the appellate forum rightly converted the dissolution of marriage on the ground of cruelty to dissolution by way of khula.
The SC noted that the family court unequivocally articulated that the petitioner discharged the burden of proving cruelty on part of the husband by quoting many incidents while her evidence was not shattered during her cross-examination and thus the family court rightly dissolved the marriage on account of cruelty after a thorough examination and consideration of evidence.
Justice Mazhar observed that the appellate court could modify or set aside the judgment of the family court if it was found contrary to the evidence since the purpose of appellate jurisdiction was to reappraise whether the lower court committed any error. Likewise, he noted, the high court affirmed the findings of the appellate court without realizing that the allegations of maltreatment and cruelty had been satisfactorily proved by the petitioner during the trial.
The matrimonial bond between a man and woman is a pious relationship that plays an important part and also nurtures between the husband and wife happiness and compassion, the lineage and family heredity also depends on it, Justice Mazhar observed, adding the connubial affairs are based on gentle, human and emotional affiliation which requires mutual trust, regard, respect, love and affection and the relationship should also be in accordance with social norms.
As Islam ordains husbands to provide food, clothing, accommodation and all other necessities of life to the best of his capability and capacity, a man is expected to treat his wife nicely, with love and affection, Justice Mazhar observed. A conduct or behaviour that inflicts upon the wife mental pain and anguish makes it impossible for her to continue matrimonial relationship, the verdict explained.
Justice Mazhar recalled how the family court decision depicted different acts which caused mental anguish and torture to the wife, as only a week after their marriage, the husband started pressurising his wife to arrange money to get a house on rent. The husband and his family members also levelled false accusations at her, alleging that his daughter was not their child, with the result that the petitioner suffered severe mental agony, the court noted.
While she was in the family way, the man left her instead of supporting his wife, the court observed. He did not turn up at the crucial time; neither did he pay any maintenance allowance nor delivery expenses, it was recalled.
Also, the husband and his family members imposed a harsh condition on her that she should deposit her salary into a joint account with her husband and seek his permission for personal use.
Despite filing the family suit, the husband’s behaviour did not change rather he caused more mental anguish and started levelling false accusations, imposing condition that the amount for the house purchased by the wife be reimbursed by her father to the husband.
But the apex court noted that the appellate court, instead of considering the evidence reached a conclusion without any reason that no solid piece of evidence was brought to show physical torture or mental agony and held the allegation was exaggerated, adding that the “acts of cruelty were common” in nature and were “found in every family”.
On the basis of the observations, the Supreme Court set aside the judgments of the high court and the appellate court and restored the decree passed by the family court.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,SBP slashes GDP growth forecast to below 3-4pc,"Cuts FY23 outlook after considering flood-induced destruction, policy focus on stabilisation.","KARACHI: The central bank has lowered its projected GDP growth from the previously announced range of 3-4 per cent for the current fiscal year, citing flood-induced destruction and the stabilisation policy as major factors in its flagship economic health report released on Wednesday.
However, in its Annual Report on the State of Pakistan’s Economy, which mostly discussed the previous financial year that ended on June 30, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said economic growth was stronger than expected in the 2021-22 fiscal year as real GDP increased by 6pc compared to 5.7pc a year ago.
The primary drivers of this growth were a broad-based expansion in large-scale manufacturing (LSM) and improved agricultural output, the report said.
“A combination of adverse global and domestic developments led to the re-emergence of macroeconomic imbalances during FY22,” it said.

Cuts FY23 outlook after considering flood-induced destruction, policy focus on stabilisation

The SBP said that the economy was already in a stabilisation phase when widespread flooding hit a large part of the country at the start of the current fiscal year.
It said the flooding was likely to impinge on the country’s real economic activity through various channels, fearing that losses in agriculture emerging from the damages to crops and livestock were likely to transmit to the rest of the economy through various backward and forward linkages.
 
 

The large-scale destruction of infrastructure in the affected provinces might also undermine the country’s growth prospects during the year, the bank said.
The SBP avoided providing any range for the growth rate of the current financial year apparently due to the worsening economic situation. Industries have either shut down or drastically cut their production due to high inflation and the unavailability of gas and electricity.
One major reason is the cork put by the SBP on the opening of letters of credit (LCs) for imports in an attempt to save dollars.
The All-Pakistan Textile Mills Association has threatened to announce lay-offs within days if the gas supply is not restored and LCs are not opened.
The textile industry claims that up to 500,000 people, who were associated with the sector directly or indirectly, have lost their jobs. No official data is available in this regard.
International credit rating agencies have slashed the credit rating of Pakistan and predicted an economic growth rate of around 2pc for the current fiscal year.
The SBP report said that several corrective and other measures were likely to slow the momentum of economic activity during FY23, including a hike of 675 basis points in the policy rate, demand management measures announced in the previous fiscal year, and the government’s decision to unwind the fiscal package for fuel and electricity subsidies towards the end of FY22.
The report noted that the expansionary fiscal stance in FY22, an upsurge in global commodity prices, and the fallout of the Russia-Ukraine conflict led to a marked deterioration in the current account deficit.
 
 

In addition, the delay in the resumption of the IMF loan programme and political instability exacerbated the country’s vulnerability through the depletion of foreign exchange reserves.
The resulting rupee depreciation “amplified inflationary pressures by magnifying the effect of global price increase”, the SBP report said.
It said the experience from FY22 brought to the fore once again the need to address the country’s structural weaknesses, such as a narrow base of foreign exchange earnings and meagre inflows of foreign investment.
“A concerted approach is required to encourage increased localisation of the manufacturing base, along with the lowering of energy intensity of the economy by ensuring energy efficiency and conservation,” the report said.
Moreover, amid the growing issues related to climate change and inadequate food security situation, there is an urgent need to formulate a well-thought-out strategy to meet these challenges, it said.
It stressed that priority should be given to producing new varieties of seeds that are suitable to varying weather conditions and to devise a framework that emphasises water management strategies to increase agricultural productivity.
“The losses to agriculture produce induced by the recent floods is likely to step up the import of agriculture commodities, particularly cotton,” the report said.
It said the government has targeted to reduce the fiscal deficit to 4.9pc of GDP in FY23 from 7.9pc in FY22. “This outcome would be achieved through both revenue and expenditure measures,” it said.
In fact, the fiscal deficit exceeded in the first quarter of FY23, annoying the IMF, which demanded more measures to reduce the gap.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,PM promises Rs5bn to reconstruct flood-hit homes,Govt launches ‘4RF’ comprehensive plan for rehabilitation of millions of survivors.,"SUKKUR/ISLAMABAD: As he assured Sindh that the federal government would not leave flood survivors in a lurch, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the Centre would spend at least Rs5 billion to construct houses for flood victims in the province.
After his visit to rain-hit areas in Khairpur on Wednesday, the prime minister said that Rs4.80 billion had been donated to the prime minister’s account for flood survivors and added that more funds were expected to be donated.
According to PM Sharif, the rehabilitation process was already underway across the country, but there were still several areas in Khairpur and Dadu which were underwater. 
He added that the government would move towards reconstruction and rehabilitation works, but at present, at least eight million families were rain-affected. 
He elaborated that at least 20m people, including nine million children, were waiting for the government to help them.

Govt launches ‘4RF’ comprehensive plan for rehabilitation of millions of survivors

Drainage plan
He said that the government would build houses for the affected people and added that the chief minister would provide plots for the construction and the same process would be followed in other provinces as well.
“A donors conference is going to be held in Geneva next month,” said PM Sharif and added that he would go to the moot fully prepared to present Pakistan’s case for aid in light of massive destruction due to floods. The PM also announced the establishment of a campus of COMSATS University in Khairpur.
Speaking at the residence of PPP leader Manzoor Wassan in Khairpur, Shehbaz Sharif said that his government would “positively consider” the master plan for drainage on the left bank of the River Indus proposed by a foreign consultant, Louis Berger.
Mr Sharif said that the scale of the disaster was massive so Pakistan would require plenty of resources to tackle this challenge.
During the visit, the premier was also briefed by Chief Engineer Development Region-I Mansoor Memon in Pir Gaddo, Kot Diji about inundated areas in the province.
The chief engineer said that out of 3.3m acres of area, 2m acres were inundated on the right bank and 1.3m acres on the left bank of the Indus till Aug 31.
In Khairpur, 141,000 acres of land was submerged till Aug 31 but now only 7,800 acres of land needed to be dewatered, Mr Memon informed. He maintained that field drains on an area of 200 square kms were created to drain rainwater.
According to the chief engineer, Khairpur was a victim of a “poor drainage network” and the only drainage system that existed in the area pertained to salinity control and water-logging issue. He informed when the Sukkur barrage was built, the flow of natural watercourses in the area was obstructed. 
“Even this area where we are standing is an old waterway,” Mr Memon said while showing the site on a satellite image.
He said that floodwater from the mountainous range stretching over 75,000 sq kms in Balochistan reached Qambar Shahdadkot and Dadu districts in recent floods and 600,000 acres and 400,000 acres of the area was inundated respectively in Qambar and Dadu districts. This meant that out of 2m acres, 50pc of the area was affected in these two districts, he added.
Speaking about the Berger plan regarding drainage, the engineer urged that the scheme was of paramount importance for left bank areas. CM Murad agreed. The Sindh CM said the provincial government wanted to use funds deposited with the apex court in the Bahria Town case for the execution of this scheme.
‘4RF plan’
Separately, the government launched a comprehensive plan prepared by the planning and development division for the rehabilitation of flood victims. 
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, Prime Minister Shehbaz launched the ‘Resilient, Recovery, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Framework’ (4RF) which envisaged short, medium, and long-term strategies to rehabilitate the survivors.
A copy of the 4RF report was presented to the prime minister by Ahsan Iqbal, Minister for Planning Development and Special Initiatives (MoPD&SI) during a meeting. 
Mr Iqbal apprised the prime minister that the document was based on the loss and damage estimated in the post-disaster needs assessment report, which was launched in October this year.
PM Sharif directed that necessary efforts must be made for the effective pitching of this framework in the upcoming donors’ conference, scheduled to be held on January 9, 2023, in Geneva, Switzerland.
He directed that the planning ministry in coordination with the foreign ministry, climate change ministry, and economic affairs division may take necessary steps for the effective dissemination of the document to all the stakeholders at home and abroad.

2023-05-20,2022-12-22,Over 100 Rohingya stranded in boat off India’s coast,MUMBAI: At least 100 ethnic Rohingya are stranded in a boat off India’s Andaman Islands and as many as 16-20 may...,"MUMBAI: At least 100 ethnic Rohingya are stranded in a boat off India’s Andaman Islands and as many as 16-20 may have have died of thirst, hunger or drowned, said two Myanmar Rohingya activist groups.
Each year many Rohingya, members of a Muslim minority, risk their lives boarding rickety vessels to escape violence in Myanmar and squalor in Bangladesh refugee camps. Many attempt to reach Malaysia.
The stranded boat was approached by five Indian ships late on Tuesday, a source said.
A spokesperson for the Indian Navy said he did not have any details to share. A spokesperson for the Coast Guard did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters.
“We estimate that probably as many as 20 have died some from hunger and thirst, and others jumped overboard in desperation. This is absolutely awful and outrageous,” said Chris Lewa, director of the Arakan Project which works to support Myanmar’s Rohingyas.
Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Networks Rohingya Working Group said the group had been adrift for more than two weeks.
“We heard late last night that there were some Indian vessels approaching the boat so we are awaiting updates now, said Lilianne Fan, chair of Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Networks Rohingya Working Group.
“We hope that the Indian Navy or Coastguard will manage to rescue and disembark the boat as soon as possible. These people have been adrift on a damaged boat for more than 2 weeks without food and water. We have heard that up to 16 people may have already died.”  Another boat, carrying more than a hundred Rohingya was rescued by Sri Lanka’s navy on the weekend.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Nepal court orders release of serial killer Charles Sobhraj,"“Keeping him in the prison continuously is not in line with the prisoner’s human rights,” says court.","KATHMANDU: Nepal’s top court ordered on Wednesday the release and deportation of Charles Sobhraj, the French serial killer portrayed in the Netflix series  “The Serpent” who was responsible for a string of murders across Asia in the 1970s.
The Supreme Court ruled Sobhraj, 78, who has been in prison in the Himalayan republic since 2003 for murdering two North American tourists, should be freed on health grounds.
“Keeping him in the prison continuously is not in line with the prisoner’s human rights,” read a copy of the verdict.
“If there is not any other pending cases against him to keep him in the prison, this court orders his release by today and... the return to his country within 15 days.” Sobhraj needed open heart surgery and his release was in keeping with the law allowing the compassionate discharge of bedridden prisoners who had already served three-quarters of their sentence, the verdict added.
The notorious murderer underwent a five-hour cardiac operation in 2017 and the verdict said he remained in regular treatment for heart disease. Sobhraj will likely be freed from Kathmandu’s Central Jail on Thursday, an official at the prison said.
He will first have to appear in a lower court for administrative formalities before he can walk free, the official added.
Backpacker murders 
After a troubled childhood and several prison terms in France for petty crimes, Sobhraj began travelling the world in the early 1970s and wound up in the Thai capital Bangkok.
His modus operandi was to charm and befriend his victims — many of them starry-eyed Western backpackers on a quest for spirituality — before drugging, robbing and murdering them.
Suave and sophisticated, he was implicated in his first murder, that of a young American woman whose body was found on a beach in Pattaya wearing a bikini, in 1975. He was eventually linked to more than 20 killings.
His victims were strangled, beaten or burned, and he often used the passports of his male victims to travel to his next destination.
Sobhraj’s sobriquet,  “The Serpent”, came from his ability to assume other identities in order to evade justice. It became the title of a hit series made by the BBC and Netflix that was based on his life.
He was arrested in India in 1976 and ultimately spent 21 years in jail there, with a brief break in 1986 when he escaped and was caught again in the Indian coastal state of Goa.
Released in 1997, Sobhraj retired to Paris but resurfaced in 2003 in Nepal, where he was spotted in Kathmandu’s tourist district and arrested.
A court there handed him a life sentence the following year for killing US tourist Connie Jo Bronzich in 1975. A decade later he was also found guilty of killing Bronzich’s Canadian companion. In prison in 2008, Sobhraj married Nihita Biswas, who is 44 years his junior and the daughter of his Nepalese lawyer.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Ambulance workers walk out in strike-hit UK,Employees across the UK economy demand salary rises to match or beat decades-high inflation.,"LONDON: Striking ambulance workers in England and Wales manned picket lines on Wednesday, escalating a pay dispute between the government and a host of public-sector staff.
A series of stoppages are causing misery across Britain in the run-up to Christmas, with railway workers and passport control officers set to hinder festive holiday getaways as the government resists the growing pay demands.
Employees across the UK economy are demanding salary rises to match or beat decades-high inflation — currently running at nearly 11 percent — which is spurring the worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation.
“We’re not paid enough for what we deserve,” 24-year-old paramedic Kirsten Reid said in Crawley, southern England.  “Secondly, patient safety is a huge thing... our response times are shocking, and they need to be better.”  “We do 12-hour shifts with a 30-minute break, but they’re rarely ever 12-hour shifts. We’re usually overrun,” she added.
The government and unions continue to trade blame over the strikes amid fears of possible loss of life, as healthcare leaders warned about straining a system already in crisis.
On Tuesday, thousands of members of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) in England, Wales and Northern Ireland took to picket lines, five days after their first strike in its 106-year history.
Health Secretary Steve Barclay, writing in the Daily Telegraph newspaper, accused the unions of making a  “conscious decision” to  “inflict harm” on patients. GMB union national secretary, Rachel Harrison, hit back calling his comments  “insulting”.
“Ambulance workers are seething at such a crude, insulting attempt to divert attention from the government’s continued chaos in the NHS,” she said.
Around a dozen staff formed the picket line outside the ambulance base in Crawley.
“My members are striking today for fair pay. At the end of the day, they’ve had a 20 percent pay cut over the last 10 years, and they can no longer afford to keep going with that,” GMB union representative Lib Whitfield said.
Outside the West Midlands Ambulance Services’ hub in Longford in central England, striking staff stood behind a banner reading  “our NHS is under siege”.
As passing ambulances sounded their horns in support, union representative Steve Thompson called on the government to  “wake up and realise that this situation is serious”.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,FIA court rejects Swati’s post-arrest bail,ISLAMABAD: A special court of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on Wednesday rejected the post-arrest bail of...,"ISLAMABAD: A special court of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on Wednesday rejected the post-arrest bail of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Senator Azam Khan Swati in a case registered against him over anti-establishment tweets.
Special Judge (Central) Azam Khan observed that Senator Swati had repeated the same crime in which he was already on a post-arrest bail.
During the course of the hearing, FIA’s special prosecutor Raja Rizwan Abbasi argued that Mr Swati operated a verified Twitter account and he was being followed by politicians, journalists and the public at large. He said Mr Swati never contested the ownership of his Twitter handle and used it to build an anti-army narrative.
Mr Abbasi claimed this was a deliberate attempt to incite mutiny among personnel of the armed forces. He said the PTI leader misused the relief of bail and tweeted the same text for which he was facing a case before the FIA’s Cybercrimes Wing.
Mr Swati’s counsel Babar Awan argued that the complainant, who had lodged the first information report (FIR) against his client, was not an aggrieved party.
He said the case had been registered by the FIA and it was not on a par with the complaint filed under defamation laws.
Mr Awan argued that the court could impose a maximum penalty of Rs1,000 on Mr Swati over his tweet, but he was being moved from one province to another.
The FIA had earlier this month arrested Mr Swati for defamation, statement conducing to public mischief, and highly obnoxious campaign of intimidating tweets, after his fiery speech at a PTI long march in Rawalpindi in which he lashed out at the senior military leadership.

2022-12-20,2022-12-22,‘TTP is Pakistan’s absolute red line’,Bilawal says Islamabad willing to consider all options to ensure citizens’ safety and security.,"WASHINGTON: Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has suggested letting neighbouring countries know that the outlawed TTP is an “absolute red line” for Pakistan and it would not allow anyone to cross that line.
“As far as the TTP (Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan) is concerned, it’s absolutely our red line. It is something that we will not tolerate,” said the foreign minister while speaking at the Atlantic Council, Washington, on Tuesday evening. 
“And absolutely we will be willing to consider each and every single option to ensure the safety and security of our people.” 

 





 
As the foreign minister stressed the need for combating militants in his Washington talk, Pakistan’s UN Ambassador Munir Akram told the UN Security Council in New York that engagement with the Taliban was the best option to stabilise the region.
“Coercion and isolation have not proved successful in the past; they will prove to be counter-productive now and in the future,” said Ambassador Akram while participating in a UN debate on the situation in Afghanistan. “We need a coherent and practical plan to realise the objectives of the international community through patient engagement with the interim government,” the Pakistani envoy told the 15-member Council.

Bilawal says Islamabad willing to consider all options to ensure citizens’ safety and security

Mr Bhutto-Zardari made a similar observation in his talk at the Atlantic Council, urging world powers to work with Afghanistan’s de facto rulers to stabilise the region. When the moderator, Uzair Younus, asked if Pakistan could deploy troops inside Afghanistan or on the border to stop attacks by Afghanistan-based militant groups, the minister suggested using the “hammer and anvil” strategy, with Kabul’s cooperation, to eliminate militancy.
The chief Pakistani diplomat pointed out that despite these border and cross-border attacks, the situation was far more secure and stable now than it was in 2007, when Pakistan launched a series of operations against the TTP and other militants.
“But those things can be put at risk if this goes unchecked. And obviously that would undermine any hope, whether it is CPEC or any other form of economic activity. Nobody wants to put lives at risk in order to conduct business,” he warned.
“That’s why I have been particularly hawkish on the issue of the TTP, and on the issue of terrorism in general. I believe that recent events in the region are alarming, not only the border incidents but the recent Bannu incident, which our security commanders have very bravely managed to overcome,” he said.
The foreign minister, however, stressed the need to “impress on our neighbours, particularly Afghan­istan” that they have to demonstrate the will and the capacity to take on the TTP or other groups functioning from there.
He acknowledged that there’s room for improvement in Pakistan’s Afghan policy — as there’s in America’s — and “we need to be serious about what we can do going forward”.
“Are we going learn from our mistakes to ensure that we do not repeat them,” he asked. “The answer to that question is going to define the safety and stability of Afghanistan, the safety and stability of Pakistan and the safety and stability of our region.” 
Pakistan’s number one option, he said, was to get the Afghan interim government to demonstrate that they had the capacity to deal with this issue.
Separately, the foreign minister also met Deputy Secretary of State Wendy R. Sherman where they discussed Pakistan’s efforts to recover from devastating floods and the upcoming Jan 9 International Con­ference on Climate Resilient Pakistan in Geneva. 
According to a readout issued by the State Department, the US official expressed condolences for Pakistani lives lost in recent terrorist attacks, and they committed to strengthen cooperation between the two countries.

The 13-member committee would be responsible to undertake a detailed mapping of the ‘gas sector circular debt stock as of June 30, 2022’, segregating the principal amount of debt, late payment surcharges, penalties and liquidity damages among the PSEs of petroleum and power sectors.
It would work out a comprehensive circular debt settlement plan through cash and non-cash payments and adjustments and also cover legal and procedural requirements on the pattern of a previous circular debt settlement in 2013.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,ECC defers PSO’s request for Rs17bn,Receivables of embattled national fuel supplier cross Rs612bn.,"ISLAMABAD: The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet was informed on Wednesday that receivables of the national fuel supplier – Pakistan State Oil (PSO) had crossed Rs612 billion and it was struggling to manage remittances to its foreign suppliers.
The meeting of the ECC presided over by Finance Minister Ishaq Dar, however, did not immediately approve Rs17bn urgently demanded by the PSO to honour its liabilities to international firms, particularly its long-term fuel supplier Kuwait Petroleum Company (KPC).
“The ECC deferred a summary submitted by the Ministry of Energy (Petroleum Division) for foreign exchange coverage to PSO and directed the Ministry of Energy to resubmit the summary after reviewing the numbers”, said an official statement.
The Petroleum Division reported that under a credit facility provided by KPC since 2000 and extended annually for the supply of diesel, a joint account of the federal government and KPC had been set up with the National Bank of Pakistan in which PSO keeps on depositing rupee equivalent funds after 30 days of the bill of lading for each shipment.
After 90 days from the bill of lading, the NBP has to transfer the cargo cost to KPC and exchange cover for an additional 60 days is borne by the federal government.
However, the account facility started to face huge shortfalls in April 2020 on account of exchange losses, posing a default situation in remittances to KPC.
At the time the ECC approved a supplementary grant of Rs12bn which helped PSO avoid an international default. The facility worked well for another two years but then suffered a shortfall again and now this shortfall stood at Rs17bn owing to “prevalent upheaval” in the rupee-dollar parity.

Receivables of embattled national fuel supplier cross Rs612bn

The Petroleum Division said the PSO had been defaulting even on rupee deposits in the NBP account because of its liquidity challenges as its receivables reached Rs612bn and “it urgently required adequate funds so that liabilities are met on time”. 
The Petroleum Division and PSO have been trying to manage the situation for avoiding international default by depositing required funds on due dates but the situation was “too critical” now.
It also complained that the Petroleum Division had been submitting budget requirements for exchange loss on this facility every year but the Ministry of Finance did not make separate provisions which led to exposure to international default.
The finance ministry, however, argued that the government had already released Rs30bn to address PSO’s liquidity position under the foreign exchange head in September and arranged another Rs50bn through market financing. Also, the government was now trying to ensure PSO recoveries through power companies and gas companies.
The Petroleum Division, however, insisted that the matter related to actual foreign exchange loss of over Rs17bn so far on the KPC’s credit facility up to Dec 2, which has to be paid by the government sooner or later.
“PSO has made all outstanding payments delayed due to liquidity position. Exchange loss, however, is the liability of the government”, Petroleum Division was quoted but a decision was deferred.
Supplementary grants
The ECC approved a summary of the Ministry of Energy (Petroleum Division) on the transfer of 30pc working interests in exploration licences/block – Margala Block – owned by M/s MOL of Hungary to M/s Mari Petroleum Company Ltd. 
It was apprised that Margala Block was governed by Pakistan Petroleum Exploration and Production Rules 2001 and the acquiring company MPCL was operating in Pakistan since 1954 and has working interests in 23 exploration licences and 15 development & production leases. The ECC was further informed that M/s MOL had cleared all its financial obligations.
The ECC also approved a Rs823m technical supplementary grant to the Ministry of Maritime Affairs, enabling Gwadar Port Authority (GPA) to disburse the amount of Rs250,000 per head to 3,291 fishermen registered with Balochistan Fisheries Department for the purchase of boat engines.
The ECC also approved another Rs200mn Technical Supplementary Grant to the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulation and Coordination for Ghurki Trust Teaching Hospital (GTTH), Lahore. Ghurki Trust Teaching Hospital (GTTH) is a tertiary care non-profit organisation providing “State of the Art” health facilities to needy and poor patients.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,"China willing to provide ‘all kinds of assistance’, envoy assures Dar","Both sides deliberate on several avenues for expanding bilateral relations, especially in the economic and financial sectors.","ISLAMABAD: China assured Pakistan on Wednesday that it is ready to help Islamabad in every possible way following its request for about $8.75 billion in an additional financial package, including the rollover of debt, bank deposits and currency swaps.
Chinese Ambassador in Islamabad Nong Rong called on Finance Minister Ishaq Dar on Wednesday and “assured continuous support of the Chinese government to Pakistan”, the finance ministry said in a statement.
The “government of China stands with the people of Pakistan and is willing to provide all kinds of assistance”, the statement added.
Mr Dar told reporters last month that Pakistan had sought about $9bn in additional financial support from China during the visit of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to Beijing, and that the Chinese leadership had promised to “roll over $4bn in sovereign loans, refinance $3.3bn commercial bank loans and increase currency swap by about $1.45bn — from 30bn yuan to 40bn yuan”. The total worked out at $8.75bn.
Pakistan needs at least $34bn until June 30, 2023, to meet its international liabilities, including debt and trade payments. Pakistan is banking on about $13bn in additional support from China and Saudi Arabia.
The statement said Mr Dar “thanked the Chinese ambassador for their continuous support and assistance” and praised the long-standing and deep-rooted friendly relations between the two countries.
Both sides deliberated on several avenues for expanding bilateral relations, especially in the economic and financial sectors. The ambassador appreciated the government’s policy initiatives to sustain and boost fiscal and monetary stability.
Mr Dar had earlier said that the Chinese president and prime minister had assured Prime Minister Sharif that his government would stand by Pakistan and “will not let you down”.
He had then separately taken up the issue of refinancing $3bn in China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) deposit and about $3.3bn debt rollover. Both these heads are due for maturity on different dates before June 30.

As a result, the KSE-100 index settled at 39,342.89 points, down 489.56 points or 1.23 per cent from the preceding session.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,CM Elahi on thin ice after ruling by speaker ‘rejected’,"• Sana hints at governor’s rule in Punjab, says Elahi’s de-notification imminent • Interior ministry asks Rangers, FC to perform","• Sana hints at governor’s rule in Punjab, says Elahi’s de-notification imminent
• Interior ministry asks Rangers, FC to perform security duties in Punjab
LAHORE: In a tit-for-tat move, Governor Balighur Rehman on Wednesday termed the ruling of Punjab Assembly Speaker Sibtain Khan disposing of his directives regarding the vote of confidence “unconstitutional”, whereas the coalition government hinted at the imposition of governor’s rule in Pakistan’s largest province.
The PML-N government initially hinted that governor’s rule could be imposed for two months through a resolution in a joint session of parliament, but the period could be extended to six months.
“Since the chief minister on Wednesday failed to take the trust vote in the Punjab Assembly in compliance with the governor’s order, legally he ceases to hold his office. And now any time... probably on Thursday (today), the governor can issue an order de-notifying the CM,” Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah said earlier in the day.
This view was echoed by SAPM Attaullah Tarrar, who told reporters late on Wednesday night that the governor had discretionary powers to de-notify the CM and it was up to him whether he wanted to do it “tomorrow or the day after”.
Another option, Mr Sanaullah said, is governor’s rule by the Centre. “In the wake of the constitutional crisis, the government may get a resolution passed from the National Assembly and Senate to impose governor’s rule in Punjab for two months initially — the period can be extended to six months as well,” the minister added.
He was of the view that “all was not well” in the camp of Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Punjab parliamentary party. “Had the PTI been confident that CM Elahi could secure the support of 186 MPAs in the PA he would have gone for the trust vote on Wednesday in compliance with the governor’s order,” he said, adding that the CM could have gone for PA’s dissolution after the vote in line with Imran Khan’s plan for the dissolution of assemblies. “But the PTI chose otherwise because it knew it did not have the required number,” Mr Sanaullah claimed.
Governor’s order on PA speaker ruling
In the late evening, Governor Rehman wrote a three-page order in response to PA Speaker Sibtain Khan’s ruling which had termed Mr Rehman’s order seeking vote of confidence from Mr Elahi ‘illegal’.
In his order, the governor said under Article 130(7) of the Constitution that PA speaker’s ruling had no bearing on his order and termed it unconstitutional. The governor said the speaker’s ruling was also in violation of Rule 209 of the Rules of Procedure of the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab, 1997.
“The speaker’s ruling, consequent acts and omissions constitute and result in enabling the chief minister to refrain from obtaining a vote of confidence in terms of Article 130(7). Helping and aiding the CM in refraining from fulfilling his duty and preventing the constitutional process from proceeding to its logical end leads to the consequences stipulated in Rule 22 (7) of the Rules of Procedure of the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab, 1997.”
Meanwhile, taking a screenshot of the governor’s reply, PTI senior leader Fawad Chaudhry, in a tweet, asked Mr Rehman not to make a mockery of his office. “Dear Governor! Do not make a mockery of your office, the speaker’s ruling is final as far affairs of the Assembly are concerned and do not expose yourself to misconduct proceedings. Respect the Constitution,” he added.
Earlier in the day, the governor held a meeting with the PML-N and PPP leaders and legal experts to discuss the strategy of the federal government. Federal ministers Rana Sanaullah and Saad Rafique, premier’s special assistants Attaullah Tarar and Malik Ahmed Khan, and PPP Punjab parliamentary party leader Hasan Murtaza were present in the meeting.
Separately, the federal government on Wednesday decided to deploy Pakistan Rangers and Frontier Constabulary (FC) across Punjab, interior ministry sources said, adding that the federal agencies would ensure law and order in the province and work for implementation of laws and Constitution.
Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah directed the Punjab chief secretary and inspector general of police to maintain law and order, protection of the life and property of the people, and perform their duties as per law and Constitution, sources said.
The interior minister also warned officials not to become part of any process that was against the law and Constitution.

2022-12-22,2022-12-22,‘Unconstitutional’ removal of chief minister to be opposed: PTI,Imran to announce party’s future course of action at protest today.,"• Imran to announce party’s future course of action at protest today
• Fawad claims Zardari offered PTI women MPAs Rs50m each to abstain from voting
• As per agreement with PTI, PML-Q to get 30 PA, 15 NA seats 
LAHORE: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has announced that it will challenge any “unconstitutional” move of de-notifying Punjab Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi, and asked its leadership, parliamentarians and party workers to reach the Governor House at 5pm on Thursday (today) to ‘block’ the governor from taking any such action.
PTI Chairman Imran Khan will address the protesters through video link and announce the party’s next line of action in the face of the provincial opposition’s moves to save the Punjab Assembly.
Earlier on Wednesday, Governor Balighur Rehman had declared Punjab Assembly Speaker Sibtain Khan’s ruling regarding CM Elahi’s vote of confidence “unconstitutional” and “illegal”.
On Tuesday, the speaker had termed the governor’s orders — to the CM to obtain a vote of confidence from the provincial assembly by 4pm on Wednesday — as “illegal, against the provisions of the Constitution and thus stand disposed of”, and issued a ruling in this regard.
The PTI leadership on Wednesday maintained the speaker had ruled that the assembly was in session and until the session was prorogued, the governor could not summon a fresh session, citing a 1997 ruling by the Lahore High Court. They said the court had ruled that “not less than 10 clear days” must be granted to the chief minister to obtain a vote of confidence.
PTI Central Punjab General Secretary Hammad Azhar gave a call to PTI leaders, lawmakers and party workers and supporters to reach outside the Governor House at 5pm on Thursday (today).
“The masses can no longer remain silent spectators while an unconstitutional game is being played,” he remarked.
Meanwhile, the federal government has sought deployment of Rangers to beef up security of the Governor House “till further orders under sections 7(b) and 10 of the Pakistan Rangers Ordinance, 1959 and Section 4(3)(i) of Anti-Terrorism Act 1997”.
“The Pakistan Rangers (Punjab) is requested to immediate necessary action with regard to beefing up the security at the Governor’s House, Lahore, in coordination with the office of the governor,” said the Interior Ministry.
PTI senior leader Fawad Chaudhry told the media outside party chief Imran Khan’s Zaman Park residence that the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) parties were ‘scared of’ holding general elections, adding they would be violating the Constitution’s Article 109 by asking the chief minister to take a vote of confidence immediately. 
He said the governor should give 10 clear days for the vote or challenge the Punjab Assembly speaker’s ruling in court.
He further said the PTI had called its parliamentary party meeting on Thursday (today) and stressed its 177 as well as the PML-Q’s 10 MPAs were available to foil a no-confidence motion submitted by the PML-N and the PPP separately against the chief minister as well as the Punjab Assembly speaker and deputy speaker.
Mr Chaudhry also claimed that the party’s women MPAs had told Mr Khan that they were receiving offers from former president Asif Zardari to abstain from voting for Rs50 million each.
“The people of Sindh should know that Asif Zardari is spending their welfare money to buy loyalties of PTI MPAs,” he said.
Claiming that some other MPAs had also received threatening calls to abstain from voting, he demanded the superior courts take notice and identify those who were trying to terrify the party legislators.
“As soon as the vote of no-confidence fails, the Punjab Assembly will be dissolved and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly will follow suit,” he declared.
On the other hand, a three-member committee of the PTI held a meeting with CM Elahi and his party members and discussed seat adjustment prospects in detail.
As part of a formula, sources said, the PTI agreed to offer 30 Punjab Assembly and 15 National Assembly seats to the PML-Q. The party of the Chaudhrys had sought seats in the newly created Gujrat division – their hometown -- that included Gujrat, Mandi Bahauddin, Wazirabad and Hafizabad districts, some parts of south Punjab as well as Sialkot.
PTI leader Shafqat Mahmood later confirmed that both the allied parties had mutually agreed over giving 30 Punjab and 15 National Assembly seats to Mr Elahi’s party.
Meanwhile, the PML-Q held its parliamentary party meeting, chaired by CM Elahi and parliamentary leader Sajid Bhatti, and discussed the current political situation and decided their future course of action.
The chief minister has also called the provincial cabinet’s seventh meeting at his office on Thursday (today) at 1:30pm with 21 items on the agenda.
Soon afterwards, PML-Q MNA Hussain Elahi tweeted that all 10 PML-Q MPAs had announced complete support for PTI chief Imran Khan and Chief Minister Parvez Elahi in the meeting.
Responding to the PDM government’s claim that it had won the loyalties of six PML-Q MPAs, Mr Hussain asserted that the federal ruling coalition would not be able to fool anyone with its propaganda, and commented: “They (PDM) talk about six MPAs when they can’t even break one.”
A PML-Q spokesman said the parliamentary party had delegated complete authority of making all the decisions to CM Elahi and resolved to vote in favour of the CM, speaker and deputy speaker when a vote of no-confidence was taken up in the house.
Mr Elahi also asserted that the PML-Q would continue standing by Imran Khan and that his party was united and would remain so to bulldoze any propaganda or rumours being spread by the PDM government in the Centre.
Earlier in the day, as Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah had claimed he would seal the Chief Minister House if Mr Elahi didn’t take a vote of confidence, the CM’s son, Moonis, said he had “reached 8-Club CM House and waiting for you”. A few hours later, he tweeted: “Rana sb am bored now. Heading home but pls do let me know when you plan to come.”

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,"PTI set to approach SC, not speaker, for resignations’ acceptance","“We are dealing with those people who do not have any moral standing,” says Senator Shibli Faraz.","ISLAMABAD: Contra­dicting the announcement it made only days ago that PTI members of National Assembly are ready to appear before Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf for verification of their resignations, the party on Wednesday changed its stance as senior party leader Senator Shibli Faraz declared that the lawmakers would not go to the Parliament House, and instead, the PTI would approach the Supreme Court to seek acceptance of the mass resignations.
“We had decided to go to the assembly for acceptance of our resignations. But this is not the way and MNAs, who are elected by the people, cannot be asked to keep standing in a queue for acceptance of their resignations … The government is doing all this [handling the resignation issue] with a mala fide intention,” said Mr Faraz, alleging that the speaker wanted to “humiliate” the PTI lawmakers by treating them as “charity seekers”.
Talking to Dawn, Mr Faraz said they would approach the Supreme Court and ask it to direct the speaker to accept the resignations submitted some eight months ago.
“We will go to the SC in a day or two,” he said.
The party is going to the apex court where this issue has already been discussed during the hearing of various petitions and even the judges had observed that PTI should reconsider its decision of quitting the assembly.
When asked if it was not a U-turn as PTI Vice Chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi had written a letter to the speaker only six days back, asking him to allocate some time for the party’s MNAs to verify their resignations, Mr Faraz said they wanted to do so, but the government did not seem to be serious which was evident from the fact that it had convened a session of the National Assembly on Thursday (today) on a one-day notice despite the fact that the speaker was not even present in the country.
“This is not a U-turn. Look at the spirit of the matter. Why is the government delaying acceptance of our resignations? Why has the speaker adopted a pick-and-choose policy by accepting the resignations of only 11 members?” he said, adding that submission of mass resignations was part of the party strategy to force the government to hold early elections in the country. Otherwise, he said, the party MNAs could have been asked to submit resignations in groups.
When his attention was drawn to the assembly rules under which the speaker is required to individually call the members for verification of resignations, Mr Faraz posed a valid counter-question, saying: “Under which law did the speaker accept the resignations of the 11 MNAs who had also not appeared before him for verification [of their resignations]?”
“We are dealing with those people who do not have any moral standing,” the PTI senator alleged, questioning the logic behind the speaker’s decision to accept the resignations of 11 members out of 123 who had submitted the resignations en masse at the time of the election of Shehbaz Sharif as the prime minister in April.
On Dec 15, while talking to reporters in Lahore, Mr Qureshi had expressed his party’s resolve to dissolve the assemblies of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and get the MNAs’ resignations accepted after appearing before the speaker.
“We have already made our decision. We will execute it,” he had stated, adding that party Chairman Imran Khan had given him the letter for sending it to the speaker.
He also waved the ‘letter’ bearing the subject “Resignations of MNAs of PTI” to the media and chided the speaker for being “selective” while accepting the resignations of 11 MNAs “illegally”.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,"Onus on Centre to fight militancy, says KP",KP govt's spokesperson says the police’s job is to counter routine crimes and ‘national security’ is beyond their mandate.,"PESHAWAR: As some semblance of normalcy returned to Bannu on Wednesday, a day after an operation against terrorists, the under-fire KP government refused to accept the blame for the resurgence of terrorism, saying it was the responsibility of the Centre to tackle the issue.
Chief Minister Mahmood Khan in a media talk declared that ‘fighting militancy’ was the mandate of the federal government.
Meanwhile, President Arif Alvi, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Army chief Gen Syed Asim Munir, separately, paid tribute to the soldiers who took part in the operation at the CTD centre in Bannu on Tuesday.
The KP chief minister explained that it was the Centre’s job to fight militancy since the institutions fighting [against militants] fell within the jurisdiction of the federal government.
“Crime and law and order situation is the provincial government’s job but militancy falls within their [federal government’s] domain and hence this is their responsibility,” he maintained.
Besides, the chief minister claimed that the federal government was reluctant to release funds for both current and developmental expenditures. “Neither do we receive the current nor the developmental expenditures [funding],” he said and alleged that the funds were being diverted to the federal government’s members of parliament.
Endorsing the CM’s views, the KP government’s spokesperson told a press briefing that the police’s job was to counter routine crimes and ‘national security’ was beyond its mandate.
He said the incident that took place inside the Bannu CTD centre fell within the definition of ‘national security’ which was the federal the government’s domain.
“This is not something about general law and order…it falls within the domain of the national security which is the responsibility of the federal government,” CM Adviser on Information Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif said.
In reply to a question about the recently held talks with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Afghanistan, the special assistant said that war had never ended since 2001 and dialogue was an attempt to further improve the situation but a permanent solution [to militancy] could not be found.
“The reason for dialogue with them [TTP] was to improve the situation,” Mr Saif said, adding that war never ended, though its intensity fluctuated. “We wanted a permanent solution but it did not happen,” he said while explaining the reason for holding talks with the Taliban.
A KP minister, however, appeared to have a different stance, reported APP.
Kamran Bangash at a presser reiterated the provincial government’s resolve to eliminate terrorism and extremism in all its forms and manifestations and said the government was taking pragmatic steps to improve the capacity of police and the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD).
Referring to the terrorist attack on the CTD compound, he said police and security forces had already shared information about the possible terrorist attacks.
Meanwhile, Chief of Army Staff Gen Syed Asim Munir met the officers and soldiers, who were injured during the Bannu operation, at the CMH Rawalpindi, according to an Inter-Services Public Relations release.
The COAS remained with them for some time and inquired about their well-being.
He appreciated their high spirit and morale and lauded their professionalism during the operation against the terrorists.
Pledge against terrorism
President Alvi lauded the security forces for carrying out a successful operation against terrorists in Bannu and expressed the resolve to eliminate terrorism from the country’s soil, APP reported.
The president, in a statement, termed the success a result of the professionalism of security forces and their unwavering commitment against terrorism.
In separate remarks, Prime Minister Sharif said the state would not surrender to any terrorist group or organisation and vowed that militants would be dealt with according to the Constitution and law.
Strongly condemning the activities of terrorists, he said such attempts would be crushed.
“We will not let the sacrifices of the martyrs go to waste,” he said and mentioned the military operations of Raddul Fasaad and Zarb-i-Azb as significant measures to eradicate terrorism.
The prime minister said that though main responsibility for law and order lies with the provinces, the federation could not turn a blind eye to such problems.
He assured the provinces that the federal government would work along with them in fighting terrorism and vowed to fully implement the National Action Plan to eliminate terrorism.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,SC overturns verdicts in favour of khula,"Husband’s claim of conjugal rights seemed to be motivated by his intention to avoid payment of dower amount, judge observes.","ISLAMABAD: In a family suit, the Supreme Court on Wednesday set aside the Peshawar High Court (PHC) and appellate court decisions for dissolution of a marriage by way of khula and restored the decree of a family court to dissolve the marriage on the basis of cruelty inflicted by a man on his wife.
While the family court after recording of evidence and hearing both sides had dissolved the marriage due to cruelty on a suit moved by Tayyeba Ambareen against her husband Shafqat Ali Kiyani demanding dower amount, dowry articles, medical expenses and maintenance for herself and their daughter, the appellate court on Nov 10, 2015 overturned the decree and converted it into khula with the direction to the woman to refund five-tola gold to her husband. The high court also upheld the appellate court decision.
Headed by Justice Sardar Tariq Masood, a three-judge Supreme Court bench then took up an appeal against the PHC verdict.
In its decision, the apex court observed that husband’s claim of conjugal rights — despite his ‘ruthless, tyrannical and oppressive’ conduct or behaviour — seemed to be motivated by the sole intention to avoid paying maintenance allowance and the dower amount and he ultimately succeeded in his effort when the appellate court dissolved the marriage by way of khula with the direction to the wife to refund the dower amount.

Husband’s claim of conjugal rights seemed to be motivated by his intention to avoid payment of dower amount, judge observes

Justice Mohammad Ali Mazhar, a member of the SC bench, in a judgment he wrote, observed the main disagreement or source of discord between the parties was whether petitioner Tayyeba Ambareen was entitled to claim a decree for dissolution of marriage on the ground of cruelty and whether the appellate forum rightly converted the dissolution of marriage on the ground of cruelty to dissolution by way of khula.
The SC noted that the family court unequivocally articulated that the petitioner discharged the burden of proving cruelty on part of the husband by quoting many incidents while her evidence was not shattered during her cross-examination and thus the family court rightly dissolved the marriage on account of cruelty after a thorough examination and consideration of evidence.
Justice Mazhar observed that the appellate court could modify or set aside the judgment of the family court if it was found contrary to the evidence since the purpose of appellate jurisdiction was to reappraise whether the lower court committed any error. Likewise, he noted, the high court affirmed the findings of the appellate court without realizing that the allegations of maltreatment and cruelty had been satisfactorily proved by the petitioner during the trial.
The matrimonial bond between a man and woman is a pious relationship that plays an important part and also nurtures between the husband and wife happiness and compassion, the lineage and family heredity also depends on it, Justice Mazhar observed, adding the connubial affairs are based on gentle, human and emotional affiliation which requires mutual trust, regard, respect, love and affection and the relationship should also be in accordance with social norms.
As Islam ordains husbands to provide food, clothing, accommodation and all other necessities of life to the best of his capability and capacity, a man is expected to treat his wife nicely, with love and affection, Justice Mazhar observed. A conduct or behaviour that inflicts upon the wife mental pain and anguish makes it impossible for her to continue matrimonial relationship, the verdict explained.
Justice Mazhar recalled how the family court decision depicted different acts which caused mental anguish and torture to the wife, as only a week after their marriage, the husband started pressurising his wife to arrange money to get a house on rent. The husband and his family members also levelled false accusations at her, alleging that his daughter was not their child, with the result that the petitioner suffered severe mental agony, the court noted.
While she was in the family way, the man left her instead of supporting his wife, the court observed. He did not turn up at the crucial time; neither did he pay any maintenance allowance nor delivery expenses, it was recalled.
Also, the husband and his family members imposed a harsh condition on her that she should deposit her salary into a joint account with her husband and seek his permission for personal use.
Despite filing the family suit, the husband’s behaviour did not change rather he caused more mental anguish and started levelling false accusations, imposing condition that the amount for the house purchased by the wife be reimbursed by her father to the husband.
But the apex court noted that the appellate court, instead of considering the evidence reached a conclusion without any reason that no solid piece of evidence was brought to show physical torture or mental agony and held the allegation was exaggerated, adding that the “acts of cruelty were common” in nature and were “found in every family”.
On the basis of the observations, the Supreme Court set aside the judgments of the high court and the appellate court and restored the decree passed by the family court.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,SBP slashes GDP growth forecast to below 3-4pc,"Cuts FY23 outlook after considering flood-induced destruction, policy focus on stabilisation.","KARACHI: The central bank has lowered its projected GDP growth from the previously announced range of 3-4 per cent for the current fiscal year, citing flood-induced destruction and the stabilisation policy as major factors in its flagship economic health report released on Wednesday.
However, in its Annual Report on the State of Pakistan’s Economy, which mostly discussed the previous financial year that ended on June 30, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said economic growth was stronger than expected in the 2021-22 fiscal year as real GDP increased by 6pc compared to 5.7pc a year ago.
The primary drivers of this growth were a broad-based expansion in large-scale manufacturing (LSM) and improved agricultural output, the report said.
“A combination of adverse global and domestic developments led to the re-emergence of macroeconomic imbalances during FY22,” it said.

Cuts FY23 outlook after considering flood-induced destruction, policy focus on stabilisation

The SBP said that the economy was already in a stabilisation phase when widespread flooding hit a large part of the country at the start of the current fiscal year.
It said the flooding was likely to impinge on the country’s real economic activity through various channels, fearing that losses in agriculture emerging from the damages to crops and livestock were likely to transmit to the rest of the economy through various backward and forward linkages.
 
 

The large-scale destruction of infrastructure in the affected provinces might also undermine the country’s growth prospects during the year, the bank said.
The SBP avoided providing any range for the growth rate of the current financial year apparently due to the worsening economic situation. Industries have either shut down or drastically cut their production due to high inflation and the unavailability of gas and electricity.
One major reason is the cork put by the SBP on the opening of letters of credit (LCs) for imports in an attempt to save dollars.
The All-Pakistan Textile Mills Association has threatened to announce lay-offs within days if the gas supply is not restored and LCs are not opened.
The textile industry claims that up to 500,000 people, who were associated with the sector directly or indirectly, have lost their jobs. No official data is available in this regard.
International credit rating agencies have slashed the credit rating of Pakistan and predicted an economic growth rate of around 2pc for the current fiscal year.
The SBP report said that several corrective and other measures were likely to slow the momentum of economic activity during FY23, including a hike of 675 basis points in the policy rate, demand management measures announced in the previous fiscal year, and the government’s decision to unwind the fiscal package for fuel and electricity subsidies towards the end of FY22.
The report noted that the expansionary fiscal stance in FY22, an upsurge in global commodity prices, and the fallout of the Russia-Ukraine conflict led to a marked deterioration in the current account deficit.
 
 

In addition, the delay in the resumption of the IMF loan programme and political instability exacerbated the country’s vulnerability through the depletion of foreign exchange reserves.
The resulting rupee depreciation “amplified inflationary pressures by magnifying the effect of global price increase”, the SBP report said.
It said the experience from FY22 brought to the fore once again the need to address the country’s structural weaknesses, such as a narrow base of foreign exchange earnings and meagre inflows of foreign investment.
“A concerted approach is required to encourage increased localisation of the manufacturing base, along with the lowering of energy intensity of the economy by ensuring energy efficiency and conservation,” the report said.
Moreover, amid the growing issues related to climate change and inadequate food security situation, there is an urgent need to formulate a well-thought-out strategy to meet these challenges, it said.
It stressed that priority should be given to producing new varieties of seeds that are suitable to varying weather conditions and to devise a framework that emphasises water management strategies to increase agricultural productivity.
“The losses to agriculture produce induced by the recent floods is likely to step up the import of agriculture commodities, particularly cotton,” the report said.
It said the government has targeted to reduce the fiscal deficit to 4.9pc of GDP in FY23 from 7.9pc in FY22. “This outcome would be achieved through both revenue and expenditure measures,” it said.
In fact, the fiscal deficit exceeded in the first quarter of FY23, annoying the IMF, which demanded more measures to reduce the gap.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,PM promises Rs5bn to reconstruct flood-hit homes,Govt launches ‘4RF’ comprehensive plan for rehabilitation of millions of survivors.,"SUKKUR/ISLAMABAD: As he assured Sindh that the federal government would not leave flood survivors in a lurch, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the Centre would spend at least Rs5 billion to construct houses for flood victims in the province.
After his visit to rain-hit areas in Khairpur on Wednesday, the prime minister said that Rs4.80 billion had been donated to the prime minister’s account for flood survivors and added that more funds were expected to be donated.
According to PM Sharif, the rehabilitation process was already underway across the country, but there were still several areas in Khairpur and Dadu which were underwater. 
He added that the government would move towards reconstruction and rehabilitation works, but at present, at least eight million families were rain-affected. 
He elaborated that at least 20m people, including nine million children, were waiting for the government to help them.

Govt launches ‘4RF’ comprehensive plan for rehabilitation of millions of survivors

Drainage plan
He said that the government would build houses for the affected people and added that the chief minister would provide plots for the construction and the same process would be followed in other provinces as well.
“A donors conference is going to be held in Geneva next month,” said PM Sharif and added that he would go to the moot fully prepared to present Pakistan’s case for aid in light of massive destruction due to floods. The PM also announced the establishment of a campus of COMSATS University in Khairpur.
Speaking at the residence of PPP leader Manzoor Wassan in Khairpur, Shehbaz Sharif said that his government would “positively consider” the master plan for drainage on the left bank of the River Indus proposed by a foreign consultant, Louis Berger.
Mr Sharif said that the scale of the disaster was massive so Pakistan would require plenty of resources to tackle this challenge.
During the visit, the premier was also briefed by Chief Engineer Development Region-I Mansoor Memon in Pir Gaddo, Kot Diji about inundated areas in the province.
The chief engineer said that out of 3.3m acres of area, 2m acres were inundated on the right bank and 1.3m acres on the left bank of the Indus till Aug 31.
In Khairpur, 141,000 acres of land was submerged till Aug 31 but now only 7,800 acres of land needed to be dewatered, Mr Memon informed. He maintained that field drains on an area of 200 square kms were created to drain rainwater.
According to the chief engineer, Khairpur was a victim of a “poor drainage network” and the only drainage system that existed in the area pertained to salinity control and water-logging issue. He informed when the Sukkur barrage was built, the flow of natural watercourses in the area was obstructed. 
“Even this area where we are standing is an old waterway,” Mr Memon said while showing the site on a satellite image.
He said that floodwater from the mountainous range stretching over 75,000 sq kms in Balochistan reached Qambar Shahdadkot and Dadu districts in recent floods and 600,000 acres and 400,000 acres of the area was inundated respectively in Qambar and Dadu districts. This meant that out of 2m acres, 50pc of the area was affected in these two districts, he added.
Speaking about the Berger plan regarding drainage, the engineer urged that the scheme was of paramount importance for left bank areas. CM Murad agreed. The Sindh CM said the provincial government wanted to use funds deposited with the apex court in the Bahria Town case for the execution of this scheme.
‘4RF plan’
Separately, the government launched a comprehensive plan prepared by the planning and development division for the rehabilitation of flood victims. 
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, Prime Minister Shehbaz launched the ‘Resilient, Recovery, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Framework’ (4RF) which envisaged short, medium, and long-term strategies to rehabilitate the survivors.
A copy of the 4RF report was presented to the prime minister by Ahsan Iqbal, Minister for Planning Development and Special Initiatives (MoPD&SI) during a meeting. 
Mr Iqbal apprised the prime minister that the document was based on the loss and damage estimated in the post-disaster needs assessment report, which was launched in October this year.
PM Sharif directed that necessary efforts must be made for the effective pitching of this framework in the upcoming donors’ conference, scheduled to be held on January 9, 2023, in Geneva, Switzerland.
He directed that the planning ministry in coordination with the foreign ministry, climate change ministry, and economic affairs division may take necessary steps for the effective dissemination of the document to all the stakeholders at home and abroad.

2023-05-20,2022-12-22,Over 100 Rohingya stranded in boat off India’s coast,MUMBAI: At least 100 ethnic Rohingya are stranded in a boat off India’s Andaman Islands and as many as 16-20 may...,"MUMBAI: At least 100 ethnic Rohingya are stranded in a boat off India’s Andaman Islands and as many as 16-20 may have have died of thirst, hunger or drowned, said two Myanmar Rohingya activist groups.
Each year many Rohingya, members of a Muslim minority, risk their lives boarding rickety vessels to escape violence in Myanmar and squalor in Bangladesh refugee camps. Many attempt to reach Malaysia.
The stranded boat was approached by five Indian ships late on Tuesday, a source said.
A spokesperson for the Indian Navy said he did not have any details to share. A spokesperson for the Coast Guard did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters.
“We estimate that probably as many as 20 have died some from hunger and thirst, and others jumped overboard in desperation. This is absolutely awful and outrageous,” said Chris Lewa, director of the Arakan Project which works to support Myanmar’s Rohingyas.
Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Networks Rohingya Working Group said the group had been adrift for more than two weeks.
“We heard late last night that there were some Indian vessels approaching the boat so we are awaiting updates now, said Lilianne Fan, chair of Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Networks Rohingya Working Group.
“We hope that the Indian Navy or Coastguard will manage to rescue and disembark the boat as soon as possible. These people have been adrift on a damaged boat for more than 2 weeks without food and water. We have heard that up to 16 people may have already died.”  Another boat, carrying more than a hundred Rohingya was rescued by Sri Lanka’s navy on the weekend.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Nepal court orders release of serial killer Charles Sobhraj,"“Keeping him in the prison continuously is not in line with the prisoner’s human rights,” says court.","KATHMANDU: Nepal’s top court ordered on Wednesday the release and deportation of Charles Sobhraj, the French serial killer portrayed in the Netflix series  “The Serpent” who was responsible for a string of murders across Asia in the 1970s.
The Supreme Court ruled Sobhraj, 78, who has been in prison in the Himalayan republic since 2003 for murdering two North American tourists, should be freed on health grounds.
“Keeping him in the prison continuously is not in line with the prisoner’s human rights,” read a copy of the verdict.
“If there is not any other pending cases against him to keep him in the prison, this court orders his release by today and... the return to his country within 15 days.” Sobhraj needed open heart surgery and his release was in keeping with the law allowing the compassionate discharge of bedridden prisoners who had already served three-quarters of their sentence, the verdict added.
The notorious murderer underwent a five-hour cardiac operation in 2017 and the verdict said he remained in regular treatment for heart disease. Sobhraj will likely be freed from Kathmandu’s Central Jail on Thursday, an official at the prison said.
He will first have to appear in a lower court for administrative formalities before he can walk free, the official added.
Backpacker murders 
After a troubled childhood and several prison terms in France for petty crimes, Sobhraj began travelling the world in the early 1970s and wound up in the Thai capital Bangkok.
His modus operandi was to charm and befriend his victims — many of them starry-eyed Western backpackers on a quest for spirituality — before drugging, robbing and murdering them.
Suave and sophisticated, he was implicated in his first murder, that of a young American woman whose body was found on a beach in Pattaya wearing a bikini, in 1975. He was eventually linked to more than 20 killings.
His victims were strangled, beaten or burned, and he often used the passports of his male victims to travel to his next destination.
Sobhraj’s sobriquet,  “The Serpent”, came from his ability to assume other identities in order to evade justice. It became the title of a hit series made by the BBC and Netflix that was based on his life.
He was arrested in India in 1976 and ultimately spent 21 years in jail there, with a brief break in 1986 when he escaped and was caught again in the Indian coastal state of Goa.
Released in 1997, Sobhraj retired to Paris but resurfaced in 2003 in Nepal, where he was spotted in Kathmandu’s tourist district and arrested.
A court there handed him a life sentence the following year for killing US tourist Connie Jo Bronzich in 1975. A decade later he was also found guilty of killing Bronzich’s Canadian companion. In prison in 2008, Sobhraj married Nihita Biswas, who is 44 years his junior and the daughter of his Nepalese lawyer.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Ambulance workers walk out in strike-hit UK,Employees across the UK economy demand salary rises to match or beat decades-high inflation.,"LONDON: Striking ambulance workers in England and Wales manned picket lines on Wednesday, escalating a pay dispute between the government and a host of public-sector staff.
A series of stoppages are causing misery across Britain in the run-up to Christmas, with railway workers and passport control officers set to hinder festive holiday getaways as the government resists the growing pay demands.
Employees across the UK economy are demanding salary rises to match or beat decades-high inflation — currently running at nearly 11 percent — which is spurring the worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation.
“We’re not paid enough for what we deserve,” 24-year-old paramedic Kirsten Reid said in Crawley, southern England.  “Secondly, patient safety is a huge thing... our response times are shocking, and they need to be better.”  “We do 12-hour shifts with a 30-minute break, but they’re rarely ever 12-hour shifts. We’re usually overrun,” she added.
The government and unions continue to trade blame over the strikes amid fears of possible loss of life, as healthcare leaders warned about straining a system already in crisis.
On Tuesday, thousands of members of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) in England, Wales and Northern Ireland took to picket lines, five days after their first strike in its 106-year history.
Health Secretary Steve Barclay, writing in the Daily Telegraph newspaper, accused the unions of making a  “conscious decision” to  “inflict harm” on patients. GMB union national secretary, Rachel Harrison, hit back calling his comments  “insulting”.
“Ambulance workers are seething at such a crude, insulting attempt to divert attention from the government’s continued chaos in the NHS,” she said.
Around a dozen staff formed the picket line outside the ambulance base in Crawley.
“My members are striking today for fair pay. At the end of the day, they’ve had a 20 percent pay cut over the last 10 years, and they can no longer afford to keep going with that,” GMB union representative Lib Whitfield said.
Outside the West Midlands Ambulance Services’ hub in Longford in central England, striking staff stood behind a banner reading  “our NHS is under siege”.
As passing ambulances sounded their horns in support, union representative Steve Thompson called on the government to  “wake up and realise that this situation is serious”.

2022-12-22,2022-12-22,Govt calls emergency NA session today to approve controversial LG law,PML-N candidate seeks delay in polls; PTI leader files contempt petition against PM for changes in law.,"ISLAMABAD: The government has summoned an emergency session of the National Assembly on Thursday (today) to get Islamabad’s local government amendment bill passed, with an aim to increase the number of union councils and seek direct election for the post of mayor.
The session has been convened by President Dr Arif Alvi at a time when political parties are already busy campaigning for the local government polls scheduled for Dec 31.
In a related development, a ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) candidate and a senior member of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) filed separate petitions before the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on the issue with the former seeking postponement of the polls and the latter desiring initiation of contempt proceedings against Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his “cabinet” for making changes in the law which could cause a delay in the elections.
The National Assembly Secretariat on Wednesday issued a 10-point agenda which shows the Islamabad Capital Territory Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2022 standing in the name of Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah Khan.

PML-N candidate seeks delay in polls; PTI leader files contempt petition against PM for changes in law

The minister will also present a motion seeking to suspend the rules of the assembly to enable the members to pass the bill on the same day without referring it to the concerned committee and following the parliamentary procedure.
After passage of the bill from the lower house of the parliament, it will also have to be passed by the Senate before getting the president’s ceremonial assent.
It may be recalled that the National Assembly had been prorogued by the president only on Tuesday after passing the Foreign Investment (Promotion and Protection) Bill in a similar fashion and after suspending the rules. 
The federal cabinet has already approved the amendments to the law through a circular on Dec 19 after which the interior ministry issued a letter increasing the number of seats from 101 to 125. 
Moreover, the federal cabinet has also approved a summary for direct election of Islamabad’s mayor and for this necessary amendment, the bill is being tabled before the National Assembly.
Despite these developments, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), however, refused to defer the LG elections and vowed to conduct it in accordance with the already announced schedule.
Since the PML-N and PTI have brought this matter before the IHC, the fate of LG elections now depends upon the judicial verdict.
In the petition, PML-N candidate from Tarlai Union Council Shahzad Aurangzeb defended the government’s decision of increasing the number of UCs.
The petition stated that Islamabad districtfor the most part has been administered without a local government comprising elected representatives of the people until the passing of the 18th Amendment in the Constitution on April 19, 2010.
It said the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) Local Government Act 2015 in sections 5 & 6 of the Act, empowered the federal government to declare any area as union council and to divide an existing area of one union council into two and to notify the number of union councils in Islamabad, adding that the federal government had recently increased the number of union councils to 125.
The petitioner pointed out anomalies in the voters’ lists of different areas and said “in such conditions any election that is held would be disputed and cannot be declared as a free and fair election”.
It requested the court to set aside the ECP’s decision of conducting elections in 101 UCs.
On the other hand, PTI leader Ali Nawaz Awan asserted in the petition that the ECP in the light of the judgements of the superior courts announced schedule for local government elections in 101 UCs to be held on Dec 31.
“However, the federal government with utmost mala fide, has yet again in its bid to frustrate the process has done exactly what had been apprehended,” the petition said, adding that the act of federal government of increasing the number of UCs is a “clear attempt at frustrating the process and holding of elections, which is clear cut violation of the judgement of this court”.
According to the petition, the federal government was “well aware” of court’s directions, “however, the action of yet again increasing the number of UCs, merely 11 days prior to the elections…is a blatant disregard to the dictum laid down exhaustively by the court.”
The petition termed it a deliberate attempt to frustrate the judgement of the IHC.
Subsequently, it requested the court to initiate contempt of court proceeding against the prime minister and all the members of the federal cabinet.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Verdict reserved on appeal over Zahir’s sentence in Noor case,"The court asks lawyers to submit written arguments, if they want, within seven days.","ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday reserved verdict on a plea challenging the death sentence of Zahir Jaffer in Noor Mukadam murder case.
The two-member division bench comprising IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Sardar Ijaz Ishaq Khan reserved the verdict after the lawyers completed their arguments.
Jaffer’s lawyer, Usman Khosa, in his argument on the last day of hearing on Wednesday, said one of the reasons for giving the death sentence to his client could be to set an example that there was a lesson for others to not take such a step. 
He added that such a punishment was awarded to habitual criminals to create deterrence.
He said there was pressure on Pakistan at an international level to abolish the death penalty, adding that his client was an American citizen and a resident of New Jersey, where there was no concept of capital punishment. He urged the court to take this point into consideration.
Chief Justice Aamer Farooq remarked that abolishing the death penalty was a matter of legislation and only legislators could view this subject, however, he added that Pakistan was an independent country and it had its own law. 
The lawyer of the plaintiff, Shaukat Mukadam, said Jameel, Jaffer’s cook, worked during the day and had no role in the crime.
While the court inquired whether any drugs were recovered from the crime scene, Mr Mukadam’s lawyer Babar Hayat said no drug was recovered and the relevant report had been attached with the record.
The court also inquired about Noor’s handbag, which was not part of the record but it was visible in the CCTV footage.
Mr Hayat said only the prosecution could talk about the bag. After the two sides concluded their arguments, the bench reserved its judgement.
The court asked the lawyers to submit written arguments, if they wanted, within seven days.
The trial court in Islamabad had awarded death penalty to Jaffer in February 2022 for killing Noor Mukadam. Her body was found in Jaffer’s residence in F-7 on July 20, 2021.

He requested the court for grant of protective bail, enabling him to surrender before the competent court of law.
Mr Aziz is a co-accused in the assets reference.
According to NAB, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s family members received foreign funds through alleged fake transactions.
These transactions had been made through the company, allegedly owned by Shehbaz Sharif’s son-in-law Haroon Yousaf Aziz. 
The maximum numbers of fake transactions to the Shehbaz family had been made through Al-Zarooni Exchange of Dubai.
After hearing preliminary arguments, the IHC bench restrained the LEAs from arresting Aziz till Dec 22 and ordered him to appear in person on Thursday.
Further hearing in this matter has been adjourned till today.

2022-12-22,2022-12-22,OBITUARY: Dr Tabish — a Midas of children’s health,Top paediatrician laid to rest in Lahore,"


 
ISLAMABAD: One of the top paediatricians of Pakistan, Dr Tabish Hazir, who served at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) for over three decades, breathed his last at the same hospital on Tuesday night, leaving his family, friends, and those whose children are in good health because of his efforts saddened.
His funeral prayers were offered at 4pm in B Block Model Town, Lahore, on Wednesday which were attended by a large number people including politicians, academics and medical practitioners. The deceased was later laid to rest in a local graveyard in Model Town.
Dr Hazir, 74, was the husband of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leader Dr Shireen Mazari and was suffering from colon cancer for the last two years. He had been under treatment at Pims.
Former Pims executive director Dr Ijaz Qadeer, while talking to Dawn, said Dr Hazir was a top paediatrician of Pakistan and his services for Pims would always be remembered.

Top paediatrician laid to rest in Lahore

He said the deceased established the paediatric department at the hospital and headed the neonatology department.
It is worth mentioning here that neonatology is a sub-specialty of paediatrics that focuses on medical care of newborns, especially those who are ill or premature.
“He believed in research and never stopped learning new fields while he was in the hospital. He was expert on issues related to reasons of death in newborn and also reasons of infection in children,” Dr Qadeer said.
Talking to Dawn, former vice chancellor of Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Medical University Prof Dr Javed Akram said he had frequent interaction with Dr Hazir as Pims was the affiliated hospital of the university.
“He was a thorough gentleman and professional. He was supportive of academics and was a supporter of the university. He was eager to do research, which is why I consider him as one of my best friends,” he said.
Dr Tabish Hazir’s sister Tamkinet Karim, while talking to Dawn, said her brother was born on May 31, 1958 in Lahore.
“He did his initial schooling in Sialkot and MBBS from Allama Iqbal Medical College, Lahore. He also did a number of courses and specialisation and joined Pims which he served till his retirement. He was under treatment at Pims at the time of his death. We shifted the body on Wednesday morning to his house in Islamabad and then to Lahore,” she said.
Ms Karim said the deceased had worked in collaboration with the World Health Organisation and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for the welfare of the children of Pakistan.
She said Dr Tabish Hazir and Dr Shireen Mazari separated 12 years ago but it was not correct that the couple had divorce.
“The deceased has a daughter Imaan Mazari-Hazir and a son Sabeel Mazari-Hazir,” she said.

2023-12-18,2022-12-22,Work on widening of Soan River bridge restarts finally,RAWALPINDI: Work on widening the Soan River Bridge finally commenced earlier this week. The project is anticipated...,"RAWALPINDI: Work on widening the Soan River Bridge finally commenced earlier this week.
The project is anticipated to be completed by the end of Dec 2023.
The Soan River Bridge was two lanes wide on each side, but after work, it will have four lanes on each side.
According to an official from the National Highway Authority (NHA), widening of the bridge had been suspended in April 2022 after the contractor was black-listed and now a fresh contract had been awarded to Frontier Works Organisation (FWO).
The widening of the bridge across Soan River was started in 2017 and was scheduled to be completed by January 2022. However, the bridge will now be completed by the end of 2023.
Due to left-over construction material scattered on the bridge and its adjoining area, hundreds of commuters entering the city have been facing problems.
Motorists, while proceeding towards Rawalpindi from Rawat, face difficulty as safety walls of the bridge have been demolished by the previous contractor and left abandoned.
More than 62,000 vehicles cross Soan Bridge every day, where widening of the bridge began about five years ago and is yet to be completed.
The former chief of army staff had taken strict notice of the delay in the construction of Soan Bridge project and the poor workmanship and directed the authorities concerned to complete it without wasting time.
“I have never seen such sheer negligence in public welfare/important projects while living abroad,” said an expatriate who recently came to Pakistan to spend vacations with his family.

Students of Al-Huda International School took part in creating awareness about global warming by organising a science exhibition under the title ‘Earth Matters’. 
They displayed over 60 projects to highlight the issues of global warming, urging that an organic life style and natural method in work was the only solution to save the planet.
Topics like bio gas, water, solar energy, green grills, hydroponic planting, collection of garbage, floods and mitigation, importance of birds and so on were well covered by students through their projects. 
These topics were connected with Islam and its teachings and in all stalls, related verses of the Quran were also highlighted.
“Through this exhibition, we are trying to create awareness as environment is a serious issue the world is facing today,” said Fareha Wasim, a teacher.
A seventh grader said that everyone will have to play a role towards reducing the impact of fast changing climate. Another teacher Fouzia Umar said that besides taking care of the climate and human beings, there is also need to protect birds.
Students from montessori to senior grades constructed and displayed their projects. Each project was presented in a distinctive way and the uniqueness of the event was that each child participated and the projects were made from recycled and eco-friendly material.
The exhibition comprised of different sub themes such as ‘Green Vibes Only’, ‘Air Care’, ‘Slow the Flow’, ‘Master the Disaster’, ‘Waste Wise’ and ‘Now and Never’. 
The student’s project display and demonstration of projects was an effort towards provoking thoughts and leave the audience inspired. Students had captured the attention and focus of the audience and visitors throughout the day. 
The message from all students was clear and crisp that this was high time that we have to take care of our planet.
They emphasised that according to the Quran, environmental conservation is a religious duty as well as a social obligation and not an optional matter. The event was graced by dignitaries and educationists from the twin cities, journalists and the kinsfolk of the students. 
Different schools and university students also made an appearance and interacted with students. The programme was spread over two days and was split into three slots of morning and evening.

According to an FIR, police officials had detained a merchant from Peshawar and released him after receiving Rs1 million from his heirs.
Javaid Ahmad had come to Rawalpindi on Dec 6 with Rs300,000 to purchase some goods. He was sitting in a hotel when a man in police uniform came and started interrogating him. In the meanwhile, two persons also joined and snatched Rs300,000 from him.
Ammad Akbar, employer of Javaid Ahmed, said in his FIR registered with Pirwadhai police on Wednesday that the accused shifted the victim to an undisclosed location after covering his face. The victim was detained in a room where he was tortured by the kidnappers who demanded money from him. 
On Dec 8, the kidnappers forced him to talk to his family asking him to arrange Rs600,000 more for his release.
Rahimullah, a friend of the victim, brought the money to Rawalpindi. When Mr Rahim arrived in Pirwadhai, the kidnappers detained him as well and took the money. Later, they started demanding more money from Rahimullah following which Rs50,000 were transferred twice in the bank account of one of the accomplices of the police official.
“Yes, Javaid was tortured by the kidnapper,” Ammad Akbar told Dawn while quoting Javaid.
He said after his release, Javaid approached the CTO Rawalpindi who ordered an inquiry which led to the registration of an FIR on charges of kidnapping and robbery and led to the arrest of one of the policemen.
A police spokesman said following a complaint against the constable, an FIR was registered against him and his two friends. The constable was arrested while raids were underway to detain his two accomplices.

He assured the high-powered delegation that Nadra would surely extend all possible G2G support in ID-related projects and urged the visiting dignitaries to develop an ID ecosystem that would bring about ‘Single Version of Truth’.
The potential is endless for the digital public goods to be rolled out on the basis of a good ID system, he added.
The Nadra chairman said: “A good ID system helps build a strong democratic system, especially in developing countries. The ethos of democracy in ‘One Person, One Vote’ is better delivered through a national ID system that facilitates in development of computerised electoral rolls with negligible margins of voter fraud and other fraudulent practices.”
It is pertinent to mention here that under South-South cooperation, Nadra was assisting the governments of Nigeria, Sudan, Kenya and Somalia with regard to development of identity management and civil registration system.
The Somalian interior minister lauded the efforts of the incumbent Nadra chairman, Tariq Malik and his team. He showed his desire to get Nadra’s assistance for the Somalian government to develop a robust identity management system and its linkage with other disparate systems operating in Somalia and its states.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Call to ensure ease of business in pharma sector,ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PPMA) Chairman Arshad Mahmood on Wednesday said...,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PPMA) Chairman Arshad Mahmood on Wednesday said Pakistan would become Nigeria if ease of business was not ensured in the pharmaceutical sector, fearing that the country would be left with no choice but to import medicines worth $20 billion every year.
“The foreign exchange starved Pakistan should be eyeing on the export of pharmaceutical products which is an $1,800 billion industry. Even if we capture the market of Africa, which is an $86 billion market, we would be able to bridge the gap between imports and exports of the country. If ease of business would not be ensured, investments will be shifted from Pakistan to Bangladesh, China, Iran and other countries,” he said while speaking to participants at an international conference on pharma and healthcare.
Mr Mahmood said once Nigeria used to manufacture medicines but with the passage of time, it implemented conditions of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and increased taxes and now it was importing 100pc of its medicines.
“On Wednesday morning, I was shocked to see in a newspaper that the per unit cost of the pharma sector is going to be increased by Rs32 due to which, each unit of electricity will be Rs93. Currently, the per month bill of my factory goes over Rs4 million, out of which electricity charges remain around Rs1.8 million and the rest are all taxes,” he said, adding Pakistan can export medicines to a number of countries of Africa and some countries of Asia including Myanmar, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan.
“A number of companies have been manufacturing medicines for people of Pakistan but when they get orders to export medicines to other countries, the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap) refuses to issue them a letter of good manufacturing practices (GMP) and insists on carrying out another inspection of the factory. The letter is mandatory to export medicines,” Mr Mahmood said.
“It is unfortunate that Drap allows companies to sell medicines to people of Pakistan but does not allow exporting the same medicine to other countries. That is why our exports are worth $269 million. On the other hand, India has been exporting medicines worth of $24 billion per annum. The local industry has been providing medicines worth $5 billion to people of Pakistan and if manufacturing would be stopped due to high cost of production, Pakistan will have to import medicines worth of $20 billion because in that case, foreign countries/companies will provide medicines on their cost and conditions,” he said.
“We cannot compete with international/foreign companies by importing raw material. The business community has been thinking about shifting investments abroad because over here, policies are made without taking the stakeholders onboard. The government needs to take steps for industrialisation rather than depending on remittances of overseas Pakistanis,” he added.
During a panel discussion, member of the PPMA Central Executive Committee Usman Shaukat said it was time to enforce an export emergency in Pakistan to tackle the current economic crisis and pharmaceuticals can play a vital role in earning precious foreign exchange for Pakistan.
“A pharma export council needs to be set up immediately to enhance the exports of pharmaceuticals which has immense potential. The stakeholders such as Drap and Ministry of Commerce have already principally agreed to formulate the pharma export council and the industry requests the process to be expedited in order to facilitate exports,” he added.
It was high time that Pakistan pharmaceutical products reach developed markets such as the United States and Europe.
Drap Chief Executive Officer Dr Asim Rauf, who also attended the conference, said that all possible steps would be taken to facilitate the pharmaceutical sector and ensure increase in export of medicines from Pakistan.

2022-12-22,2022-12-22,CDA plans housing projects for expats to attract dollars,Auction of commercial plots also on the cards.,"ISLAMABAD: In a bid to attract foreign investment into the country, the federal government is looking towards the Capital Development Authority (CDA) to launch new housing schemes for expatriates to boost country’s dollar reserves.
The civic body has prepared a presentation which would likely be given to the prime minister on Thursday (today) in light of his directives pertaining to these housing projects.
Sources said the CDA was planning to develop Gandhara Enclave – a housing project which falls in Zone I and partially in Zone III – and the Kuri housing scheme. Similarly, the civic body will also brief the government about the revenue potential from the under-construction Nilor Heights housing project.
CDA Chairman Mohammad Usman and his team will give a presentation on the schemes, sources said, adding that the auction of some commercial plots will also come under discussion. They said both schemes have the potential to generate billions of rupees in revenue.

Auction of commercial plots also on the cards

In its briefing, the CDA would also inform the federal government that if it wanted to develop Gandhara Enclave on more than 5,000 kanals, then the civic body would need to acquire more land falling in Zone III. Under the current zoning regulations, construction in Zone III is not allowed. However, the CDA is reportedly working on amending these regulations.
Similarly, the sources said in the first phase, the Kuri housing scheme could be developed on 10,000 kanals. They said it would be one of the largest schemes if everything went as per the plan. Sources said the Kuri scheme could turn out to be a “complicated matter because of chronic and unsettled issues with the locals” also known as affected persons.
The CDA had acquired the land decades ago but after announcing the award, no serious step was taken for the development of the Kuri model village. The civic body officials said thousands of housing units could be constructed as part of this scheme.
The officials said after paying compensation and built-up property claims, the civic agency would have around 2,000 acres of land worth billions of rupees. However, the civic agency never made any serious effort to settle issues with locals to get land’s possession. The officials said an initial survey had shown 1,100 occupants on the said land, but in 2011 the number had risen to 7,000.
At that time, the CDA officials in connivance with locals added many bogus cases to the list of land ownership claims. Later, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) probed the matter and cleared 3,422 ownership cases.
The CDA officials said the civic agency had acquired the land in 1968 while the built-up-property award was announced in 1971. But the CDA failed to take possession of the land after removing the objections raised by locals. In 2009, the civic agency announced a revised built-up property award, but due to allegations of bogus claims, it could not resolve the issue.
“Since the federal government has been supporting CDA, we will deliver and will launch at least two housing schemes, with a focus on apartments,” a CDA official said. He added that the plots would be sold to developers and investors who will be asked to build apartments.

Health Services Academy (HSA) Vice Chancellor Prof Shahzad Ali Khan said majority of the Pakistani population is either depressed, experiencing stress or anxiety and are not very optimistic about the country’s future.
He was addressing the launch of the 24th Thematic Calendar by Jahan-i-Maseeha Adbi Forum (JMAF). The theme of the 2023 calendar is, under these circumstances, Allama Iqbal’s message of ‘Khudi’.
Prof Khan said that hopelessness and despair has spread among the youth and under these circumstances, Iqbal’s message of self-hood can lift the spirits of the Pakistani nation again.
He added that the Pakistani youth now consider everybody as corrupt and incompetent, adding that majority of youngsters are desperate to leave the country although the entire world is facing similar issues and problems like inflation, joblessness and recession.
“Initially, teachers and academia of our society was targeted and they were defamed, later, character assassination of physicians and healthcare professionals was carried out and the same treatment was met out to politicians,” Prof Khan said, adding that things were not as bad as they were being portrayed.
He lauded the philosophy of Iqbal, adding that he was able to turn youngsters from a minority group in the Indian subcontinent into a united force by teaching them lessons of optimism, enthusiasm and encouragement.
The event was organised in collaboration with pharmaceutical firm Pharmevo that has been promoting Iqbal’s philosophy among healthcare professionals throughout the country.
Syed Jamshaid Ahmed of Pharmevo stressed on establishing and creating a healthier society in Pakistan and said that for a healthier society, not just medicines but promotion of literary activities was essential like holding book fairs, mushairas and so on.
Renowned poet Ajmal Siraj said an advisory committee comprising educationists, writers and scholars selected life and literary works of Iqbal as the theme for the next year’s calendar.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,FIA court rejects Swati’s post-arrest bail,ISLAMABAD: A special court of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on Wednesday rejected the post-arrest bail of...,"ISLAMABAD: A special court of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on Wednesday rejected the post-arrest bail of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Senator Azam Khan Swati in a case registered against him over anti-establishment tweets.
Special Judge (Central) Azam Khan observed that Senator Swati had repeated the same crime in which he was already on a post-arrest bail.
During the course of the hearing, FIA’s special prosecutor Raja Rizwan Abbasi argued that Mr Swati operated a verified Twitter account and he was being followed by politicians, journalists and the public at large. He said Mr Swati never contested the ownership of his Twitter handle and used it to build an anti-army narrative.
Mr Abbasi claimed this was a deliberate attempt to incite mutiny among personnel of the armed forces. He said the PTI leader misused the relief of bail and tweeted the same text for which he was facing a case before the FIA’s Cybercrimes Wing.
Mr Swati’s counsel Babar Awan argued that the complainant, who had lodged the first information report (FIR) against his client, was not an aggrieved party.
He said the case had been registered by the FIA and it was not on a par with the complaint filed under defamation laws.
Mr Awan argued that the court could impose a maximum penalty of Rs1,000 on Mr Swati over his tweet, but he was being moved from one province to another.
The FIA had earlier this month arrested Mr Swati for defamation, statement conducing to public mischief, and highly obnoxious campaign of intimidating tweets, after his fiery speech at a PTI long march in Rawalpindi in which he lashed out at the senior military leadership.

2022-12-20,2022-12-22,‘TTP is Pakistan’s absolute red line’,Bilawal says Islamabad willing to consider all options to ensure citizens’ safety and security.,"WASHINGTON: Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has suggested letting neighbouring countries know that the outlawed TTP is an “absolute red line” for Pakistan and it would not allow anyone to cross that line.
“As far as the TTP (Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan) is concerned, it’s absolutely our red line. It is something that we will not tolerate,” said the foreign minister while speaking at the Atlantic Council, Washington, on Tuesday evening. 
“And absolutely we will be willing to consider each and every single option to ensure the safety and security of our people.” 

 





 
As the foreign minister stressed the need for combating militants in his Washington talk, Pakistan’s UN Ambassador Munir Akram told the UN Security Council in New York that engagement with the Taliban was the best option to stabilise the region.
“Coercion and isolation have not proved successful in the past; they will prove to be counter-productive now and in the future,” said Ambassador Akram while participating in a UN debate on the situation in Afghanistan. “We need a coherent and practical plan to realise the objectives of the international community through patient engagement with the interim government,” the Pakistani envoy told the 15-member Council.

Bilawal says Islamabad willing to consider all options to ensure citizens’ safety and security

Mr Bhutto-Zardari made a similar observation in his talk at the Atlantic Council, urging world powers to work with Afghanistan’s de facto rulers to stabilise the region. When the moderator, Uzair Younus, asked if Pakistan could deploy troops inside Afghanistan or on the border to stop attacks by Afghanistan-based militant groups, the minister suggested using the “hammer and anvil” strategy, with Kabul’s cooperation, to eliminate militancy.
The chief Pakistani diplomat pointed out that despite these border and cross-border attacks, the situation was far more secure and stable now than it was in 2007, when Pakistan launched a series of operations against the TTP and other militants.
“But those things can be put at risk if this goes unchecked. And obviously that would undermine any hope, whether it is CPEC or any other form of economic activity. Nobody wants to put lives at risk in order to conduct business,” he warned.
“That’s why I have been particularly hawkish on the issue of the TTP, and on the issue of terrorism in general. I believe that recent events in the region are alarming, not only the border incidents but the recent Bannu incident, which our security commanders have very bravely managed to overcome,” he said.
The foreign minister, however, stressed the need to “impress on our neighbours, particularly Afghan­istan” that they have to demonstrate the will and the capacity to take on the TTP or other groups functioning from there.
He acknowledged that there’s room for improvement in Pakistan’s Afghan policy — as there’s in America’s — and “we need to be serious about what we can do going forward”.
“Are we going learn from our mistakes to ensure that we do not repeat them,” he asked. “The answer to that question is going to define the safety and stability of Afghanistan, the safety and stability of Pakistan and the safety and stability of our region.” 
Pakistan’s number one option, he said, was to get the Afghan interim government to demonstrate that they had the capacity to deal with this issue.
Separately, the foreign minister also met Deputy Secretary of State Wendy R. Sherman where they discussed Pakistan’s efforts to recover from devastating floods and the upcoming Jan 9 International Con­ference on Climate Resilient Pakistan in Geneva. 
According to a readout issued by the State Department, the US official expressed condolences for Pakistani lives lost in recent terrorist attacks, and they committed to strengthen cooperation between the two countries.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,ECC defers PSO’s request for Rs17bn,Receivables of embattled national fuel supplier cross Rs612bn.,"ISLAMABAD: The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet was informed on Wednesday that receivables of the national fuel supplier – Pakistan State Oil (PSO) had crossed Rs612 billion and it was struggling to manage remittances to its foreign suppliers.
The meeting of the ECC presided over by Finance Minister Ishaq Dar, however, did not immediately approve Rs17bn urgently demanded by the PSO to honour its liabilities to international firms, particularly its long-term fuel supplier Kuwait Petroleum Company (KPC).
“The ECC deferred a summary submitted by the Ministry of Energy (Petroleum Division) for foreign exchange coverage to PSO and directed the Ministry of Energy to resubmit the summary after reviewing the numbers”, said an official statement.
The Petroleum Division reported that under a credit facility provided by KPC since 2000 and extended annually for the supply of diesel, a joint account of the federal government and KPC had been set up with the National Bank of Pakistan in which PSO keeps on depositing rupee equivalent funds after 30 days of the bill of lading for each shipment.
After 90 days from the bill of lading, the NBP has to transfer the cargo cost to KPC and exchange cover for an additional 60 days is borne by the federal government.
However, the account facility started to face huge shortfalls in April 2020 on account of exchange losses, posing a default situation in remittances to KPC.
At the time the ECC approved a supplementary grant of Rs12bn which helped PSO avoid an international default. The facility worked well for another two years but then suffered a shortfall again and now this shortfall stood at Rs17bn owing to “prevalent upheaval” in the rupee-dollar parity.

Receivables of embattled national fuel supplier cross Rs612bn

The Petroleum Division said the PSO had been defaulting even on rupee deposits in the NBP account because of its liquidity challenges as its receivables reached Rs612bn and “it urgently required adequate funds so that liabilities are met on time”. 
The Petroleum Division and PSO have been trying to manage the situation for avoiding international default by depositing required funds on due dates but the situation was “too critical” now.
It also complained that the Petroleum Division had been submitting budget requirements for exchange loss on this facility every year but the Ministry of Finance did not make separate provisions which led to exposure to international default.
The finance ministry, however, argued that the government had already released Rs30bn to address PSO’s liquidity position under the foreign exchange head in September and arranged another Rs50bn through market financing. Also, the government was now trying to ensure PSO recoveries through power companies and gas companies.
The Petroleum Division, however, insisted that the matter related to actual foreign exchange loss of over Rs17bn so far on the KPC’s credit facility up to Dec 2, which has to be paid by the government sooner or later.
“PSO has made all outstanding payments delayed due to liquidity position. Exchange loss, however, is the liability of the government”, Petroleum Division was quoted but a decision was deferred.
Supplementary grants
The ECC approved a summary of the Ministry of Energy (Petroleum Division) on the transfer of 30pc working interests in exploration licences/block – Margala Block – owned by M/s MOL of Hungary to M/s Mari Petroleum Company Ltd. 
It was apprised that Margala Block was governed by Pakistan Petroleum Exploration and Production Rules 2001 and the acquiring company MPCL was operating in Pakistan since 1954 and has working interests in 23 exploration licences and 15 development & production leases. The ECC was further informed that M/s MOL had cleared all its financial obligations.
The ECC also approved a Rs823m technical supplementary grant to the Ministry of Maritime Affairs, enabling Gwadar Port Authority (GPA) to disburse the amount of Rs250,000 per head to 3,291 fishermen registered with Balochistan Fisheries Department for the purchase of boat engines.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,"China willing to provide ‘all kinds of assistance’, envoy assures Dar","Both sides deliberate on several avenues for expanding bilateral relations, especially in the economic and financial sectors.","ISLAMABAD: China assured Pakistan on Wednesday that it is ready to help Islamabad in every possible way following its request for about $8.75 billion in an additional financial package, including the rollover of debt, bank deposits and currency swaps.
Chinese Ambassador in Islamabad Nong Rong called on Finance Minister Ishaq Dar on Wednesday and “assured continuous support of the Chinese government to Pakistan”, the finance ministry said in a statement.
The “government of China stands with the people of Pakistan and is willing to provide all kinds of assistance”, the statement added.
Mr Dar told reporters last month that Pakistan had sought about $9bn in additional financial support from China during the visit of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to Beijing, and that the Chinese leadership had promised to “roll over $4bn in sovereign loans, refinance $3.3bn commercial bank loans and increase currency swap by about $1.45bn — from 30bn yuan to 40bn yuan”. The total worked out at $8.75bn.
Pakistan needs at least $34bn until June 30, 2023, to meet its international liabilities, including debt and trade payments. Pakistan is banking on about $13bn in additional support from China and Saudi Arabia.
The statement said Mr Dar “thanked the Chinese ambassador for their continuous support and assistance” and praised the long-standing and deep-rooted friendly relations between the two countries.
Both sides deliberated on several avenues for expanding bilateral relations, especially in the economic and financial sectors. The ambassador appreciated the government’s policy initiatives to sustain and boost fiscal and monetary stability.
Mr Dar had earlier said that the Chinese president and prime minister had assured Prime Minister Sharif that his government would stand by Pakistan and “will not let you down”.
He had then separately taken up the issue of refinancing $3bn in China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) deposit and about $3.3bn debt rollover. Both these heads are due for maturity on different dates before June 30.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,CM Elahi on thin ice after ruling by speaker ‘rejected’,"• Sana hints at governor’s rule in Punjab, says Elahi’s de-notification imminent • Interior ministry asks Rangers, FC to perform","• Sana hints at governor’s rule in Punjab, says Elahi’s de-notification imminent
• Interior ministry asks Rangers, FC to perform security duties in Punjab
LAHORE: In a tit-for-tat move, Governor Balighur Rehman on Wednesday termed the ruling of Punjab Assembly Speaker Sibtain Khan disposing of his directives regarding the vote of confidence “unconstitutional”, whereas the coalition government hinted at the imposition of governor’s rule in Pakistan’s largest province.
The PML-N government initially hinted that governor’s rule could be imposed for two months through a resolution in a joint session of parliament, but the period could be extended to six months.
“Since the chief minister on Wednesday failed to take the trust vote in the Punjab Assembly in compliance with the governor’s order, legally he ceases to hold his office. And now any time... probably on Thursday (today), the governor can issue an order de-notifying the CM,” Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah said earlier in the day.
This view was echoed by SAPM Attaullah Tarrar, who told reporters late on Wednesday night that the governor had discretionary powers to de-notify the CM and it was up to him whether he wanted to do it “tomorrow or the day after”.
Another option, Mr Sanaullah said, is governor’s rule by the Centre. “In the wake of the constitutional crisis, the government may get a resolution passed from the National Assembly and Senate to impose governor’s rule in Punjab for two months initially — the period can be extended to six months as well,” the minister added.
He was of the view that “all was not well” in the camp of Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Punjab parliamentary party. “Had the PTI been confident that CM Elahi could secure the support of 186 MPAs in the PA he would have gone for the trust vote on Wednesday in compliance with the governor’s order,” he said, adding that the CM could have gone for PA’s dissolution after the vote in line with Imran Khan’s plan for the dissolution of assemblies. “But the PTI chose otherwise because it knew it did not have the required number,” Mr Sanaullah claimed.
Governor’s order on PA speaker ruling
In the late evening, Governor Rehman wrote a three-page order in response to PA Speaker Sibtain Khan’s ruling which had termed Mr Rehman’s order seeking vote of confidence from Mr Elahi ‘illegal’.
In his order, the governor said under Article 130(7) of the Constitution that PA speaker’s ruling had no bearing on his order and termed it unconstitutional. The governor said the speaker’s ruling was also in violation of Rule 209 of the Rules of Procedure of the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab, 1997.
“The speaker’s ruling, consequent acts and omissions constitute and result in enabling the chief minister to refrain from obtaining a vote of confidence in terms of Article 130(7). Helping and aiding the CM in refraining from fulfilling his duty and preventing the constitutional process from proceeding to its logical end leads to the consequences stipulated in Rule 22 (7) of the Rules of Procedure of the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab, 1997.”
Meanwhile, taking a screenshot of the governor’s reply, PTI senior leader Fawad Chaudhry, in a tweet, asked Mr Rehman not to make a mockery of his office. “Dear Governor! Do not make a mockery of your office, the speaker’s ruling is final as far affairs of the Assembly are concerned and do not expose yourself to misconduct proceedings. Respect the Constitution,” he added.
Earlier in the day, the governor held a meeting with the PML-N and PPP leaders and legal experts to discuss the strategy of the federal government. Federal ministers Rana Sanaullah and Saad Rafique, premier’s special assistants Attaullah Tarar and Malik Ahmed Khan, and PPP Punjab parliamentary party leader Hasan Murtaza were present in the meeting.
Separately, the federal government on Wednesday decided to deploy Pakistan Rangers and Frontier Constabulary (FC) across Punjab, interior ministry sources said, adding that the federal agencies would ensure law and order in the province and work for implementation of laws and Constitution.
Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah directed the Punjab chief secretary and inspector general of police to maintain law and order, protection of the life and property of the people, and perform their duties as per law and Constitution, sources said.
The interior minister also warned officials not to become part of any process that was against the law and Constitution.

2022-12-22,2022-12-22,‘Unconstitutional’ removal of chief minister to be opposed: PTI,Imran to announce party’s future course of action at protest today.,"• Imran to announce party’s future course of action at protest today
• Fawad claims Zardari offered PTI women MPAs Rs50m each to abstain from voting
• As per agreement with PTI, PML-Q to get 30 PA, 15 NA seats 
LAHORE: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has announced that it will challenge any “unconstitutional” move of de-notifying Punjab Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi, and asked its leadership, parliamentarians and party workers to reach the Governor House at 5pm on Thursday (today) to ‘block’ the governor from taking any such action.
PTI Chairman Imran Khan will address the protesters through video link and announce the party’s next line of action in the face of the provincial opposition’s moves to save the Punjab Assembly.
Earlier on Wednesday, Governor Balighur Rehman had declared Punjab Assembly Speaker Sibtain Khan’s ruling regarding CM Elahi’s vote of confidence “unconstitutional” and “illegal”.
On Tuesday, the speaker had termed the governor’s orders — to the CM to obtain a vote of confidence from the provincial assembly by 4pm on Wednesday — as “illegal, against the provisions of the Constitution and thus stand disposed of”, and issued a ruling in this regard.
The PTI leadership on Wednesday maintained the speaker had ruled that the assembly was in session and until the session was prorogued, the governor could not summon a fresh session, citing a 1997 ruling by the Lahore High Court. They said the court had ruled that “not less than 10 clear days” must be granted to the chief minister to obtain a vote of confidence.
PTI Central Punjab General Secretary Hammad Azhar gave a call to PTI leaders, lawmakers and party workers and supporters to reach outside the Governor House at 5pm on Thursday (today).
“The masses can no longer remain silent spectators while an unconstitutional game is being played,” he remarked.
Meanwhile, the federal government has sought deployment of Rangers to beef up security of the Governor House “till further orders under sections 7(b) and 10 of the Pakistan Rangers Ordinance, 1959 and Section 4(3)(i) of Anti-Terrorism Act 1997”.
“The Pakistan Rangers (Punjab) is requested to immediate necessary action with regard to beefing up the security at the Governor’s House, Lahore, in coordination with the office of the governor,” said the Interior Ministry.
PTI senior leader Fawad Chaudhry told the media outside party chief Imran Khan’s Zaman Park residence that the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) parties were ‘scared of’ holding general elections, adding they would be violating the Constitution’s Article 109 by asking the chief minister to take a vote of confidence immediately. 
He said the governor should give 10 clear days for the vote or challenge the Punjab Assembly speaker’s ruling in court.
He further said the PTI had called its parliamentary party meeting on Thursday (today) and stressed its 177 as well as the PML-Q’s 10 MPAs were available to foil a no-confidence motion submitted by the PML-N and the PPP separately against the chief minister as well as the Punjab Assembly speaker and deputy speaker.
Mr Chaudhry also claimed that the party’s women MPAs had told Mr Khan that they were receiving offers from former president Asif Zardari to abstain from voting for Rs50 million each.
“The people of Sindh should know that Asif Zardari is spending their welfare money to buy loyalties of PTI MPAs,” he said.
Claiming that some other MPAs had also received threatening calls to abstain from voting, he demanded the superior courts take notice and identify those who were trying to terrify the party legislators.
“As soon as the vote of no-confidence fails, the Punjab Assembly will be dissolved and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly will follow suit,” he declared.
On the other hand, a three-member committee of the PTI held a meeting with CM Elahi and his party members and discussed seat adjustment prospects in detail.
As part of a formula, sources said, the PTI agreed to offer 30 Punjab Assembly and 15 National Assembly seats to the PML-Q. The party of the Chaudhrys had sought seats in the newly created Gujrat division – their hometown -- that included Gujrat, Mandi Bahauddin, Wazirabad and Hafizabad districts, some parts of south Punjab as well as Sialkot.
PTI leader Shafqat Mahmood later confirmed that both the allied parties had mutually agreed over giving 30 Punjab and 15 National Assembly seats to Mr Elahi’s party.
Meanwhile, the PML-Q held its parliamentary party meeting, chaired by CM Elahi and parliamentary leader Sajid Bhatti, and discussed the current political situation and decided their future course of action.
The chief minister has also called the provincial cabinet’s seventh meeting at his office on Thursday (today) at 1:30pm with 21 items on the agenda.
Soon afterwards, PML-Q MNA Hussain Elahi tweeted that all 10 PML-Q MPAs had announced complete support for PTI chief Imran Khan and Chief Minister Parvez Elahi in the meeting.
Responding to the PDM government’s claim that it had won the loyalties of six PML-Q MPAs, Mr Hussain asserted that the federal ruling coalition would not be able to fool anyone with its propaganda, and commented: “They (PDM) talk about six MPAs when they can’t even break one.”
A PML-Q spokesman said the parliamentary party had delegated complete authority of making all the decisions to CM Elahi and resolved to vote in favour of the CM, speaker and deputy speaker when a vote of no-confidence was taken up in the house.
Mr Elahi also asserted that the PML-Q would continue standing by Imran Khan and that his party was united and would remain so to bulldoze any propaganda or rumours being spread by the PDM government in the Centre.
Earlier in the day, as Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah had claimed he would seal the Chief Minister House if Mr Elahi didn’t take a vote of confidence, the CM’s son, Moonis, said he had “reached 8-Club CM House and waiting for you”. A few hours later, he tweeted: “Rana sb am bored now. Heading home but pls do let me know when you plan to come.”

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,"PTI set to approach SC, not speaker, for resignations’ acceptance","“We are dealing with those people who do not have any moral standing,” says Senator Shibli Faraz.","ISLAMABAD: Contra­dicting the announcement it made only days ago that PTI members of National Assembly are ready to appear before Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf for verification of their resignations, the party on Wednesday changed its stance as senior party leader Senator Shibli Faraz declared that the lawmakers would not go to the Parliament House, and instead, the PTI would approach the Supreme Court to seek acceptance of the mass resignations.
“We had decided to go to the assembly for acceptance of our resignations. But this is not the way and MNAs, who are elected by the people, cannot be asked to keep standing in a queue for acceptance of their resignations … The government is doing all this [handling the resignation issue] with a mala fide intention,” said Mr Faraz, alleging that the speaker wanted to “humiliate” the PTI lawmakers by treating them as “charity seekers”.
Talking to Dawn, Mr Faraz said they would approach the Supreme Court and ask it to direct the speaker to accept the resignations submitted some eight months ago.
“We will go to the SC in a day or two,” he said.
The party is going to the apex court where this issue has already been discussed during the hearing of various petitions and even the judges had observed that PTI should reconsider its decision of quitting the assembly.
When asked if it was not a U-turn as PTI Vice Chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi had written a letter to the speaker only six days back, asking him to allocate some time for the party’s MNAs to verify their resignations, Mr Faraz said they wanted to do so, but the government did not seem to be serious which was evident from the fact that it had convened a session of the National Assembly on Thursday (today) on a one-day notice despite the fact that the speaker was not even present in the country.
“This is not a U-turn. Look at the spirit of the matter. Why is the government delaying acceptance of our resignations? Why has the speaker adopted a pick-and-choose policy by accepting the resignations of only 11 members?” he said, adding that submission of mass resignations was part of the party strategy to force the government to hold early elections in the country. Otherwise, he said, the party MNAs could have been asked to submit resignations in groups.
When his attention was drawn to the assembly rules under which the speaker is required to individually call the members for verification of resignations, Mr Faraz posed a valid counter-question, saying: “Under which law did the speaker accept the resignations of the 11 MNAs who had also not appeared before him for verification [of their resignations]?”
“We are dealing with those people who do not have any moral standing,” the PTI senator alleged, questioning the logic behind the speaker’s decision to accept the resignations of 11 members out of 123 who had submitted the resignations en masse at the time of the election of Shehbaz Sharif as the prime minister in April.
On Dec 15, while talking to reporters in Lahore, Mr Qureshi had expressed his party’s resolve to dissolve the assemblies of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and get the MNAs’ resignations accepted after appearing before the speaker.
“We have already made our decision. We will execute it,” he had stated, adding that party Chairman Imran Khan had given him the letter for sending it to the speaker.
He also waved the ‘letter’ bearing the subject “Resignations of MNAs of PTI” to the media and chided the speaker for being “selective” while accepting the resignations of 11 MNAs “illegally”.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,"Onus on Centre to fight militancy, says KP",KP govt's spokesperson says the police’s job is to counter routine crimes and ‘national security’ is beyond their mandate.,"PESHAWAR: As some semblance of normalcy returned to Bannu on Wednesday, a day after an operation against terrorists, the under-fire KP government refused to accept the blame for the resurgence of terrorism, saying it was the responsibility of the Centre to tackle the issue.
Chief Minister Mahmood Khan in a media talk declared that ‘fighting militancy’ was the mandate of the federal government.
Meanwhile, President Arif Alvi, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Army chief Gen Syed Asim Munir, separately, paid tribute to the soldiers who took part in the operation at the CTD centre in Bannu on Tuesday.
The KP chief minister explained that it was the Centre’s job to fight militancy since the institutions fighting [against militants] fell within the jurisdiction of the federal government.
“Crime and law and order situation is the provincial government’s job but militancy falls within their [federal government’s] domain and hence this is their responsibility,” he maintained.
Besides, the chief minister claimed that the federal government was reluctant to release funds for both current and developmental expenditures. “Neither do we receive the current nor the developmental expenditures [funding],” he said and alleged that the funds were being diverted to the federal government’s members of parliament.
Endorsing the CM’s views, the KP government’s spokesperson told a press briefing that the police’s job was to counter routine crimes and ‘national security’ was beyond its mandate.
He said the incident that took place inside the Bannu CTD centre fell within the definition of ‘national security’ which was the federal the government’s domain.
“This is not something about general law and order…it falls within the domain of the national security which is the responsibility of the federal government,” CM Adviser on Information Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif said.
In reply to a question about the recently held talks with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Afghanistan, the special assistant said that war had never ended since 2001 and dialogue was an attempt to further improve the situation but a permanent solution [to militancy] could not be found.
“The reason for dialogue with them [TTP] was to improve the situation,” Mr Saif said, adding that war never ended, though its intensity fluctuated. “We wanted a permanent solution but it did not happen,” he said while explaining the reason for holding talks with the Taliban.
A KP minister, however, appeared to have a different stance, reported APP.
Kamran Bangash at a presser reiterated the provincial government’s resolve to eliminate terrorism and extremism in all its forms and manifestations and said the government was taking pragmatic steps to improve the capacity of police and the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD).
Referring to the terrorist attack on the CTD compound, he said police and security forces had already shared information about the possible terrorist attacks.
Meanwhile, Chief of Army Staff Gen Syed Asim Munir met the officers and soldiers, who were injured during the Bannu operation, at the CMH Rawalpindi, according to an Inter-Services Public Relations release.
The COAS remained with them for some time and inquired about their well-being.
He appreciated their high spirit and morale and lauded their professionalism during the operation against the terrorists.
Pledge against terrorism
President Alvi lauded the security forces for carrying out a successful operation against terrorists in Bannu and expressed the resolve to eliminate terrorism from the country’s soil, APP reported.
The president, in a statement, termed the success a result of the professionalism of security forces and their unwavering commitment against terrorism.
In separate remarks, Prime Minister Sharif said the state would not surrender to any terrorist group or organisation and vowed that militants would be dealt with according to the Constitution and law.
Strongly condemning the activities of terrorists, he said such attempts would be crushed.
“We will not let the sacrifices of the martyrs go to waste,” he said and mentioned the military operations of Raddul Fasaad and Zarb-i-Azb as significant measures to eradicate terrorism.
The prime minister said that though main responsibility for law and order lies with the provinces, the federation could not turn a blind eye to such problems.
He assured the provinces that the federal government would work along with them in fighting terrorism and vowed to fully implement the National Action Plan to eliminate terrorism.
PM Shehbaz said the federal government would assist the provinces in improving the professional capacity of the anti-terrorism force and departments.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,SC overturns verdicts in favour of khula,"Husband’s claim of conjugal rights seemed to be motivated by his intention to avoid payment of dower amount, judge observes.","ISLAMABAD: In a family suit, the Supreme Court on Wednesday set aside the Peshawar High Court (PHC) and appellate court decisions for dissolution of a marriage by way of khula and restored the decree of a family court to dissolve the marriage on the basis of cruelty inflicted by a man on his wife.
While the family court after recording of evidence and hearing both sides had dissolved the marriage due to cruelty on a suit moved by Tayyeba Ambareen against her husband Shafqat Ali Kiyani demanding dower amount, dowry articles, medical expenses and maintenance for herself and their daughter, the appellate court on Nov 10, 2015 overturned the decree and converted it into khula with the direction to the woman to refund five-tola gold to her husband. The high court also upheld the appellate court decision.
Headed by Justice Sardar Tariq Masood, a three-judge Supreme Court bench then took up an appeal against the PHC verdict.
In its decision, the apex court observed that husband’s claim of conjugal rights — despite his ‘ruthless, tyrannical and oppressive’ conduct or behaviour — seemed to be motivated by the sole intention to avoid paying maintenance allowance and the dower amount and he ultimately succeeded in his effort when the appellate court dissolved the marriage by way of khula with the direction to the wife to refund the dower amount.

Husband’s claim of conjugal rights seemed to be motivated by his intention to avoid payment of dower amount, judge observes

Justice Mohammad Ali Mazhar, a member of the SC bench, in a judgment he wrote, observed the main disagreement or source of discord between the parties was whether petitioner Tayyeba Ambareen was entitled to claim a decree for dissolution of marriage on the ground of cruelty and whether the appellate forum rightly converted the dissolution of marriage on the ground of cruelty to dissolution by way of khula.
The SC noted that the family court unequivocally articulated that the petitioner discharged the burden of proving cruelty on part of the husband by quoting many incidents while her evidence was not shattered during her cross-examination and thus the family court rightly dissolved the marriage on account of cruelty after a thorough examination and consideration of evidence.
Justice Mazhar observed that the appellate court could modify or set aside the judgment of the family court if it was found contrary to the evidence since the purpose of appellate jurisdiction was to reappraise whether the lower court committed any error. Likewise, he noted, the high court affirmed the findings of the appellate court without realizing that the allegations of maltreatment and cruelty had been satisfactorily proved by the petitioner during the trial.
The matrimonial bond between a man and woman is a pious relationship that plays an important part and also nurtures between the husband and wife happiness and compassion, the lineage and family heredity also depends on it, Justice Mazhar observed, adding the connubial affairs are based on gentle, human and emotional affiliation which requires mutual trust, regard, respect, love and affection and the relationship should also be in accordance with social norms.
As Islam ordains husbands to provide food, clothing, accommodation and all other necessities of life to the best of his capability and capacity, a man is expected to treat his wife nicely, with love and affection, Justice Mazhar observed. A conduct or behaviour that inflicts upon the wife mental pain and anguish makes it impossible for her to continue matrimonial relationship, the verdict explained.
Justice Mazhar recalled how the family court decision depicted different acts which caused mental anguish and torture to the wife, as only a week after their marriage, the husband started pressurising his wife to arrange money to get a house on rent. The husband and his family members also levelled false accusations at her, alleging that his daughter was not their child, with the result that the petitioner suffered severe mental agony, the court noted.
While she was in the family way, the man left her instead of supporting his wife, the court observed. He did not turn up at the crucial time; neither did he pay any maintenance allowance nor delivery expenses, it was recalled.
Also, the husband and his family members imposed a harsh condition on her that she should deposit her salary into a joint account with her husband and seek his permission for personal use.
Despite filing the family suit, the husband’s behaviour did not change rather he caused more mental anguish and started levelling false accusations, imposing condition that the amount for the house purchased by the wife be reimbursed by her father to the husband.
But the apex court noted that the appellate court, instead of considering the evidence reached a conclusion without any reason that no solid piece of evidence was brought to show physical torture or mental agony and held the allegation was exaggerated, adding that the “acts of cruelty were common” in nature and were “found in every family”.
On the basis of the observations, the Supreme Court set aside the judgments of the high court and the appellate court and restored the decree passed by the family court.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,SBP slashes GDP growth forecast to below 3-4pc,"Cuts FY23 outlook after considering flood-induced destruction, policy focus on stabilisation.","KARACHI: The central bank has lowered its projected GDP growth from the previously announced range of 3-4 per cent for the current fiscal year, citing flood-induced destruction and the stabilisation policy as major factors in its flagship economic health report released on Wednesday.
However, in its Annual Report on the State of Pakistan’s Economy, which mostly discussed the previous financial year that ended on June 30, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said economic growth was stronger than expected in the 2021-22 fiscal year as real GDP increased by 6pc compared to 5.7pc a year ago.
The primary drivers of this growth were a broad-based expansion in large-scale manufacturing (LSM) and improved agricultural output, the report said.
“A combination of adverse global and domestic developments led to the re-emergence of macroeconomic imbalances during FY22,” it said.

Cuts FY23 outlook after considering flood-induced destruction, policy focus on stabilisation

The SBP said that the economy was already in a stabilisation phase when widespread flooding hit a large part of the country at the start of the current fiscal year.
It said the flooding was likely to impinge on the country’s real economic activity through various channels, fearing that losses in agriculture emerging from the damages to crops and livestock were likely to transmit to the rest of the economy through various backward and forward linkages.
 
 

The large-scale destruction of infrastructure in the affected provinces might also undermine the country’s growth prospects during the year, the bank said.
The SBP avoided providing any range for the growth rate of the current financial year apparently due to the worsening economic situation. Industries have either shut down or drastically cut their production due to high inflation and the unavailability of gas and electricity.
One major reason is the cork put by the SBP on the opening of letters of credit (LCs) for imports in an attempt to save dollars.
The All-Pakistan Textile Mills Association has threatened to announce lay-offs within days if the gas supply is not restored and LCs are not opened.
The textile industry claims that up to 500,000 people, who were associated with the sector directly or indirectly, have lost their jobs. No official data is available in this regard.
International credit rating agencies have slashed the credit rating of Pakistan and predicted an economic growth rate of around 2pc for the current fiscal year.
The SBP report said that several corrective and other measures were likely to slow the momentum of economic activity during FY23, including a hike of 675 basis points in the policy rate, demand management measures announced in the previous fiscal year, and the government’s decision to unwind the fiscal package for fuel and electricity subsidies towards the end of FY22.
The report noted that the expansionary fiscal stance in FY22, an upsurge in global commodity prices, and the fallout of the Russia-Ukraine conflict led to a marked deterioration in the current account deficit.
 
 

In addition, the delay in the resumption of the IMF loan programme and political instability exacerbated the country’s vulnerability through the depletion of foreign exchange reserves.
The resulting rupee depreciation “amplified inflationary pressures by magnifying the effect of global price increase”, the SBP report said.
It said the experience from FY22 brought to the fore once again the need to address the country’s structural weaknesses, such as a narrow base of foreign exchange earnings and meagre inflows of foreign investment.
“A concerted approach is required to encourage increased localisation of the manufacturing base, along with the lowering of energy intensity of the economy by ensuring energy efficiency and conservation,” the report said.
Moreover, amid the growing issues related to climate change and inadequate food security situation, there is an urgent need to formulate a well-thought-out strategy to meet these challenges, it said.
It stressed that priority should be given to producing new varieties of seeds that are suitable to varying weather conditions and to devise a framework that emphasises water management strategies to increase agricultural productivity.
“The losses to agriculture produce induced by the recent floods is likely to step up the import of agriculture commodities, particularly cotton,” the report said.
It said the government has targeted to reduce the fiscal deficit to 4.9pc of GDP in FY23 from 7.9pc in FY22. “This outcome would be achieved through both revenue and expenditure measures,” it said.
In fact, the fiscal deficit exceeded in the first quarter of FY23, annoying the IMF, which demanded more measures to reduce the gap.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,PM promises Rs5bn to reconstruct flood-hit homes,Govt launches ‘4RF’ comprehensive plan for rehabilitation of millions of survivors.,"SUKKUR/ISLAMABAD: As he assured Sindh that the federal government would not leave flood survivors in a lurch, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the Centre would spend at least Rs5 billion to construct houses for flood victims in the province.
After his visit to rain-hit areas in Khairpur on Wednesday, the prime minister said that Rs4.80 billion had been donated to the prime minister’s account for flood survivors and added that more funds were expected to be donated.
According to PM Sharif, the rehabilitation process was already underway across the country, but there were still several areas in Khairpur and Dadu which were underwater. 
He added that the government would move towards reconstruction and rehabilitation works, but at present, at least eight million families were rain-affected. 
He elaborated that at least 20m people, including nine million children, were waiting for the government to help them.

Govt launches ‘4RF’ comprehensive plan for rehabilitation of millions of survivors

Drainage plan
He said that the government would build houses for the affected people and added that the chief minister would provide plots for the construction and the same process would be followed in other provinces as well.
“A donors conference is going to be held in Geneva next month,” said PM Sharif and added that he would go to the moot fully prepared to present Pakistan’s case for aid in light of massive destruction due to floods. The PM also announced the establishment of a campus of COMSATS University in Khairpur.
Speaking at the residence of PPP leader Manzoor Wassan in Khairpur, Shehbaz Sharif said that his government would “positively consider” the master plan for drainage on the left bank of the River Indus proposed by a foreign consultant, Louis Berger.
Mr Sharif said that the scale of the disaster was massive so Pakistan would require plenty of resources to tackle this challenge.
During the visit, the premier was also briefed by Chief Engineer Development Region-I Mansoor Memon in Pir Gaddo, Kot Diji about inundated areas in the province.
The chief engineer said that out of 3.3m acres of area, 2m acres were inundated on the right bank and 1.3m acres on the left bank of the Indus till Aug 31.
In Khairpur, 141,000 acres of land was submerged till Aug 31 but now only 7,800 acres of land needed to be dewatered, Mr Memon informed. He maintained that field drains on an area of 200 square kms were created to drain rainwater.
According to the chief engineer, Khairpur was a victim of a “poor drainage network” and the only drainage system that existed in the area pertained to salinity control and water-logging issue. He informed when the Sukkur barrage was built, the flow of natural watercourses in the area was obstructed. 
“Even this area where we are standing is an old waterway,” Mr Memon said while showing the site on a satellite image.
He said that floodwater from the mountainous range stretching over 75,000 sq kms in Balochistan reached Qambar Shahdadkot and Dadu districts in recent floods and 600,000 acres and 400,000 acres of the area was inundated respectively in Qambar and Dadu districts. This meant that out of 2m acres, 50pc of the area was affected in these two districts, he added.
Speaking about the Berger plan regarding drainage, the engineer urged that the scheme was of paramount importance for left bank areas. CM Murad agreed. The Sindh CM said the provincial government wanted to use funds deposited with the apex court in the Bahria Town case for the execution of this scheme.
‘4RF plan’
Separately, the government launched a comprehensive plan prepared by the planning and development division for the rehabilitation of flood victims. 
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, Prime Minister Shehbaz launched the ‘Resilient, Recovery, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Framework’ (4RF) which envisaged short, medium, and long-term strategies to rehabilitate the survivors.
A copy of the 4RF report was presented to the prime minister by Ahsan Iqbal, Minister for Planning Development and Special Initiatives (MoPD&SI) during a meeting. 
Mr Iqbal apprised the prime minister that the document was based on the loss and damage estimated in the post-disaster needs assessment report, which was launched in October this year.
PM Sharif directed that necessary efforts must be made for the effective pitching of this framework in the upcoming donors’ conference, scheduled to be held on January 9, 2023, in Geneva, Switzerland.
He directed that the planning ministry in coordination with the foreign ministry, climate change ministry, and economic affairs division may take necessary steps for the effective dissemination of the document to all the stakeholders at home and abroad.

2023-05-20,2022-12-22,Over 100 Rohingya stranded in boat off India’s coast,MUMBAI: At least 100 ethnic Rohingya are stranded in a boat off India’s Andaman Islands and as many as 16-20 may...,"MUMBAI: At least 100 ethnic Rohingya are stranded in a boat off India’s Andaman Islands and as many as 16-20 may have have died of thirst, hunger or drowned, said two Myanmar Rohingya activist groups.
Each year many Rohingya, members of a Muslim minority, risk their lives boarding rickety vessels to escape violence in Myanmar and squalor in Bangladesh refugee camps. Many attempt to reach Malaysia.
The stranded boat was approached by five Indian ships late on Tuesday, a source said.
A spokesperson for the Indian Navy said he did not have any details to share. A spokesperson for the Coast Guard did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters.
“We estimate that probably as many as 20 have died some from hunger and thirst, and others jumped overboard in desperation. This is absolutely awful and outrageous,” said Chris Lewa, director of the Arakan Project which works to support Myanmar’s Rohingyas.
Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Networks Rohingya Working Group said the group had been adrift for more than two weeks.
“We heard late last night that there were some Indian vessels approaching the boat so we are awaiting updates now, said Lilianne Fan, chair of Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Networks Rohingya Working Group.
“We hope that the Indian Navy or Coastguard will manage to rescue and disembark the boat as soon as possible. These people have been adrift on a damaged boat for more than 2 weeks without food and water. We have heard that up to 16 people may have already died.”  Another boat, carrying more than a hundred Rohingya was rescued by Sri Lanka’s navy on the weekend.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Nepal court orders release of serial killer Charles Sobhraj,"“Keeping him in the prison continuously is not in line with the prisoner’s human rights,” says court.","KATHMANDU: Nepal’s top court ordered on Wednesday the release and deportation of Charles Sobhraj, the French serial killer portrayed in the Netflix series  “The Serpent” who was responsible for a string of murders across Asia in the 1970s.
The Supreme Court ruled Sobhraj, 78, who has been in prison in the Himalayan republic since 2003 for murdering two North American tourists, should be freed on health grounds.
“Keeping him in the prison continuously is not in line with the prisoner’s human rights,” read a copy of the verdict.
“If there is not any other pending cases against him to keep him in the prison, this court orders his release by today and... the return to his country within 15 days.” Sobhraj needed open heart surgery and his release was in keeping with the law allowing the compassionate discharge of bedridden prisoners who had already served three-quarters of their sentence, the verdict added.
The notorious murderer underwent a five-hour cardiac operation in 2017 and the verdict said he remained in regular treatment for heart disease. Sobhraj will likely be freed from Kathmandu’s Central Jail on Thursday, an official at the prison said.
He will first have to appear in a lower court for administrative formalities before he can walk free, the official added.
Backpacker murders 
After a troubled childhood and several prison terms in France for petty crimes, Sobhraj began travelling the world in the early 1970s and wound up in the Thai capital Bangkok.
His modus operandi was to charm and befriend his victims — many of them starry-eyed Western backpackers on a quest for spirituality — before drugging, robbing and murdering them.
Suave and sophisticated, he was implicated in his first murder, that of a young American woman whose body was found on a beach in Pattaya wearing a bikini, in 1975. He was eventually linked to more than 20 killings.
His victims were strangled, beaten or burned, and he often used the passports of his male victims to travel to his next destination.
Sobhraj’s sobriquet,  “The Serpent”, came from his ability to assume other identities in order to evade justice. It became the title of a hit series made by the BBC and Netflix that was based on his life.
He was arrested in India in 1976 and ultimately spent 21 years in jail there, with a brief break in 1986 when he escaped and was caught again in the Indian coastal state of Goa.
Released in 1997, Sobhraj retired to Paris but resurfaced in 2003 in Nepal, where he was spotted in Kathmandu’s tourist district and arrested.
A court there handed him a life sentence the following year for killing US tourist Connie Jo Bronzich in 1975. A decade later he was also found guilty of killing Bronzich’s Canadian companion. In prison in 2008, Sobhraj married Nihita Biswas, who is 44 years his junior and the daughter of his Nepalese lawyer.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Ambulance workers walk out in strike-hit UK,Employees across the UK economy demand salary rises to match or beat decades-high inflation.,"LONDON: Striking ambulance workers in England and Wales manned picket lines on Wednesday, escalating a pay dispute between the government and a host of public-sector staff.
A series of stoppages are causing misery across Britain in the run-up to Christmas, with railway workers and passport control officers set to hinder festive holiday getaways as the government resists the growing pay demands.
Employees across the UK economy are demanding salary rises to match or beat decades-high inflation — currently running at nearly 11 percent — which is spurring the worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation.
“We’re not paid enough for what we deserve,” 24-year-old paramedic Kirsten Reid said in Crawley, southern England.  “Secondly, patient safety is a huge thing... our response times are shocking, and they need to be better.”  “We do 12-hour shifts with a 30-minute break, but they’re rarely ever 12-hour shifts. We’re usually overrun,” she added.
The government and unions continue to trade blame over the strikes amid fears of possible loss of life, as healthcare leaders warned about straining a system already in crisis.
On Tuesday, thousands of members of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) in England, Wales and Northern Ireland took to picket lines, five days after their first strike in its 106-year history.
Health Secretary Steve Barclay, writing in the Daily Telegraph newspaper, accused the unions of making a  “conscious decision” to  “inflict harm” on patients. GMB union national secretary, Rachel Harrison, hit back calling his comments  “insulting”.
“Ambulance workers are seething at such a crude, insulting attempt to divert attention from the government’s continued chaos in the NHS,” she said.
Around a dozen staff formed the picket line outside the ambulance base in Crawley.
“My members are striking today for fair pay. At the end of the day, they’ve had a 20 percent pay cut over the last 10 years, and they can no longer afford to keep going with that,” GMB union representative Lib Whitfield said.
Outside the West Midlands Ambulance Services’ hub in Longford in central England, striking staff stood behind a banner reading  “our NHS is under siege”.
As passing ambulances sounded their horns in support, union representative Steve Thompson called on the government to  “wake up and realise that this situation is serious”.

2022-12-22,2022-12-22,Govt calls emergency NA session today to approve controversial LG law,PML-N candidate seeks delay in polls; PTI leader files contempt petition against PM for changes in law.,"ISLAMABAD: The government has summoned an emergency session of the National Assembly on Thursday (today) to get Islamabad’s local government amendment bill passed, with an aim to increase the number of union councils and seek direct election for the post of mayor.
The session has been convened by President Dr Arif Alvi at a time when political parties are already busy campaigning for the local government polls scheduled for Dec 31.
In a related development, a ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) candidate and a senior member of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) filed separate petitions before the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on the issue with the former seeking postponement of the polls and the latter desiring initiation of contempt proceedings against Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his “cabinet” for making changes in the law which could cause a delay in the elections.
The National Assembly Secretariat on Wednesday issued a 10-point agenda which shows the Islamabad Capital Territory Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2022 standing in the name of Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah Khan.

PML-N candidate seeks delay in polls; PTI leader files contempt petition against PM for changes in law

The minister will also present a motion seeking to suspend the rules of the assembly to enable the members to pass the bill on the same day without referring it to the concerned committee and following the parliamentary procedure.
After passage of the bill from the lower house of the parliament, it will also have to be passed by the Senate before getting the president’s ceremonial assent.
It may be recalled that the National Assembly had been prorogued by the president only on Tuesday after passing the Foreign Investment (Promotion and Protection) Bill in a similar fashion and after suspending the rules. 
The federal cabinet has already approved the amendments to the law through a circular on Dec 19 after which the interior ministry issued a letter increasing the number of seats from 101 to 125. 
Moreover, the federal cabinet has also approved a summary for direct election of Islamabad’s mayor and for this necessary amendment, the bill is being tabled before the National Assembly.
Despite these developments, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), however, refused to defer the LG elections and vowed to conduct it in accordance with the already announced schedule.
Since the PML-N and PTI have brought this matter before the IHC, the fate of LG elections now depends upon the judicial verdict.
In the petition, PML-N candidate from Tarlai Union Council Shahzad Aurangzeb defended the government’s decision of increasing the number of UCs.
The petition stated that Islamabad districtfor the most part has been administered without a local government comprising elected representatives of the people until the passing of the 18th Amendment in the Constitution on April 19, 2010.
It said the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) Local Government Act 2015 in sections 5 & 6 of the Act, empowered the federal government to declare any area as union council and to divide an existing area of one union council into two and to notify the number of union councils in Islamabad, adding that the federal government had recently increased the number of union councils to 125.
The petitioner pointed out anomalies in the voters’ lists of different areas and said “in such conditions any election that is held would be disputed and cannot be declared as a free and fair election”.
It requested the court to set aside the ECP’s decision of conducting elections in 101 UCs.
On the other hand, PTI leader Ali Nawaz Awan asserted in the petition that the ECP in the light of the judgements of the superior courts announced schedule for local government elections in 101 UCs to be held on Dec 31.
“However, the federal government with utmost mala fide, has yet again in its bid to frustrate the process has done exactly what had been apprehended,” the petition said, adding that the act of federal government of increasing the number of UCs is a “clear attempt at frustrating the process and holding of elections, which is clear cut violation of the judgement of this court”.
According to the petition, the federal government was “well aware” of court’s directions, “however, the action of yet again increasing the number of UCs, merely 11 days prior to the elections…is a blatant disregard to the dictum laid down exhaustively by the court.”
The petition termed it a deliberate attempt to frustrate the judgement of the IHC.
Subsequently, it requested the court to initiate contempt of court proceeding against the prime minister and all the members of the federal cabinet.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Verdict reserved on appeal over Zahir’s sentence in Noor case,"The court asks lawyers to submit written arguments, if they want, within seven days.","ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday reserved verdict on a plea challenging the death sentence of Zahir Jaffer in Noor Mukadam murder case.
The two-member division bench comprising IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Sardar Ijaz Ishaq Khan reserved the verdict after the lawyers completed their arguments.
Jaffer’s lawyer, Usman Khosa, in his argument on the last day of hearing on Wednesday, said one of the reasons for giving the death sentence to his client could be to set an example that there was a lesson for others to not take such a step. 
He added that such a punishment was awarded to habitual criminals to create deterrence.
He said there was pressure on Pakistan at an international level to abolish the death penalty, adding that his client was an American citizen and a resident of New Jersey, where there was no concept of capital punishment. He urged the court to take this point into consideration.
Chief Justice Aamer Farooq remarked that abolishing the death penalty was a matter of legislation and only legislators could view this subject, however, he added that Pakistan was an independent country and it had its own law. 
The lawyer of the plaintiff, Shaukat Mukadam, said Jameel, Jaffer’s cook, worked during the day and had no role in the crime.
While the court inquired whether any drugs were recovered from the crime scene, Mr Mukadam’s lawyer Babar Hayat said no drug was recovered and the relevant report had been attached with the record.
The court also inquired about Noor’s handbag, which was not part of the record but it was visible in the CCTV footage.
Mr Hayat said only the prosecution could talk about the bag. After the two sides concluded their arguments, the bench reserved its judgement.
The court asked the lawyers to submit written arguments, if they wanted, within seven days.
The trial court in Islamabad had awarded death penalty to Jaffer in February 2022 for killing Noor Mukadam. Her body was found in Jaffer’s residence in F-7 on July 20, 2021.

His counsel Amjad Pervaiz advocate argued before the court that Aziz was scheduled to arrive at Islamabad International Airport via Qatar Airways at 7:35pm on Dec 21.
He said Haroon Yousaf Aziz intended to surrender before the Accountability Court of Lahore in connection with assets reference case.
In the petition, Mr Aziz cited the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) chairman, NAB Lahore director general and Accountability Court Lahore judge as respondents.
He requested the court for grant of protective bail, enabling him to surrender before the competent court of law.
Mr Aziz is a co-accused in the assets reference.
According to NAB, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s family members received foreign funds through alleged fake transactions.
These transactions had been made through the company, allegedly owned by Shehbaz Sharif’s son-in-law Haroon Yousaf Aziz. 
The maximum numbers of fake transactions to the Shehbaz family had been made through Al-Zarooni Exchange of Dubai.
After hearing preliminary arguments, the IHC bench restrained the LEAs from arresting Aziz till Dec 22 and ordered him to appear in person on Thursday.
Further hearing in this matter has been adjourned till today.

2022-12-22,2022-12-22,OBITUARY: Dr Tabish — a Midas of children’s health,Top paediatrician laid to rest in Lahore,"


 
ISLAMABAD: One of the top paediatricians of Pakistan, Dr Tabish Hazir, who served at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) for over three decades, breathed his last at the same hospital on Tuesday night, leaving his family, friends, and those whose children are in good health because of his efforts saddened.
His funeral prayers were offered at 4pm in B Block Model Town, Lahore, on Wednesday which were attended by a large number people including politicians, academics and medical practitioners. The deceased was later laid to rest in a local graveyard in Model Town.
Dr Hazir, 74, was the husband of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leader Dr Shireen Mazari and was suffering from colon cancer for the last two years. He had been under treatment at Pims.
Former Pims executive director Dr Ijaz Qadeer, while talking to Dawn, said Dr Hazir was a top paediatrician of Pakistan and his services for Pims would always be remembered.

Top paediatrician laid to rest in Lahore

He said the deceased established the paediatric department at the hospital and headed the neonatology department.
It is worth mentioning here that neonatology is a sub-specialty of paediatrics that focuses on medical care of newborns, especially those who are ill or premature.
“He believed in research and never stopped learning new fields while he was in the hospital. He was expert on issues related to reasons of death in newborn and also reasons of infection in children,” Dr Qadeer said.
Talking to Dawn, former vice chancellor of Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Medical University Prof Dr Javed Akram said he had frequent interaction with Dr Hazir as Pims was the affiliated hospital of the university.
“He was a thorough gentleman and professional. He was supportive of academics and was a supporter of the university. He was eager to do research, which is why I consider him as one of my best friends,” he said.
Dr Tabish Hazir’s sister Tamkinet Karim, while talking to Dawn, said her brother was born on May 31, 1958 in Lahore.
“He did his initial schooling in Sialkot and MBBS from Allama Iqbal Medical College, Lahore. He also did a number of courses and specialisation and joined Pims which he served till his retirement. He was under treatment at Pims at the time of his death. We shifted the body on Wednesday morning to his house in Islamabad and then to Lahore,” she said.
Ms Karim said the deceased had worked in collaboration with the World Health Organisation and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for the welfare of the children of Pakistan.
She said Dr Tabish Hazir and Dr Shireen Mazari separated 12 years ago but it was not correct that the couple had divorce.
“The deceased has a daughter Imaan Mazari-Hazir and a son Sabeel Mazari-Hazir,” she said.
Tamkinet Karim said Dr Hazir was the son of renowned poet Taufiq Rafat and wanted to be laid besides his father’s grave, which was why his body was shifted to Lahore.
She said Qul would be held on Thursday (today) in Model Town Lahore between 1pm to 3pm.

2023-12-18,2022-12-22,Work on widening of Soan River bridge restarts finally,RAWALPINDI: Work on widening the Soan River Bridge finally commenced earlier this week. The project is anticipated...,"RAWALPINDI: Work on widening the Soan River Bridge finally commenced earlier this week.
The project is anticipated to be completed by the end of Dec 2023.
The Soan River Bridge was two lanes wide on each side, but after work, it will have four lanes on each side.
According to an official from the National Highway Authority (NHA), widening of the bridge had been suspended in April 2022 after the contractor was black-listed and now a fresh contract had been awarded to Frontier Works Organisation (FWO).
The widening of the bridge across Soan River was started in 2017 and was scheduled to be completed by January 2022. However, the bridge will now be completed by the end of 2023.
Due to left-over construction material scattered on the bridge and its adjoining area, hundreds of commuters entering the city have been facing problems.
Motorists, while proceeding towards Rawalpindi from Rawat, face difficulty as safety walls of the bridge have been demolished by the previous contractor and left abandoned.
More than 62,000 vehicles cross Soan Bridge every day, where widening of the bridge began about five years ago and is yet to be completed.
The former chief of army staff had taken strict notice of the delay in the construction of Soan Bridge project and the poor workmanship and directed the authorities concerned to complete it without wasting time.
“I have never seen such sheer negligence in public welfare/important projects while living abroad,” said an expatriate who recently came to Pakistan to spend vacations with his family.

Students of Al-Huda International School took part in creating awareness about global warming by organising a science exhibition under the title ‘Earth Matters’. 
They displayed over 60 projects to highlight the issues of global warming, urging that an organic life style and natural method in work was the only solution to save the planet.
Topics like bio gas, water, solar energy, green grills, hydroponic planting, collection of garbage, floods and mitigation, importance of birds and so on were well covered by students through their projects. 
These topics were connected with Islam and its teachings and in all stalls, related verses of the Quran were also highlighted.
“Through this exhibition, we are trying to create awareness as environment is a serious issue the world is facing today,” said Fareha Wasim, a teacher.
A seventh grader said that everyone will have to play a role towards reducing the impact of fast changing climate. Another teacher Fouzia Umar said that besides taking care of the climate and human beings, there is also need to protect birds.
Students from montessori to senior grades constructed and displayed their projects. Each project was presented in a distinctive way and the uniqueness of the event was that each child participated and the projects were made from recycled and eco-friendly material.
The exhibition comprised of different sub themes such as ‘Green Vibes Only’, ‘Air Care’, ‘Slow the Flow’, ‘Master the Disaster’, ‘Waste Wise’ and ‘Now and Never’. 
The student’s project display and demonstration of projects was an effort towards provoking thoughts and leave the audience inspired. Students had captured the attention and focus of the audience and visitors throughout the day. 
The message from all students was clear and crisp that this was high time that we have to take care of our planet.
They emphasised that according to the Quran, environmental conservation is a religious duty as well as a social obligation and not an optional matter. The event was graced by dignitaries and educationists from the twin cities, journalists and the kinsfolk of the students. 
Different schools and university students also made an appearance and interacted with students. The programme was spread over two days and was split into three slots of morning and evening.

According to an FIR, police officials had detained a merchant from Peshawar and released him after receiving Rs1 million from his heirs.
Javaid Ahmad had come to Rawalpindi on Dec 6 with Rs300,000 to purchase some goods. He was sitting in a hotel when a man in police uniform came and started interrogating him. In the meanwhile, two persons also joined and snatched Rs300,000 from him.
Ammad Akbar, employer of Javaid Ahmed, said in his FIR registered with Pirwadhai police on Wednesday that the accused shifted the victim to an undisclosed location after covering his face. The victim was detained in a room where he was tortured by the kidnappers who demanded money from him. 
On Dec 8, the kidnappers forced him to talk to his family asking him to arrange Rs600,000 more for his release.
Rahimullah, a friend of the victim, brought the money to Rawalpindi. When Mr Rahim arrived in Pirwadhai, the kidnappers detained him as well and took the money. Later, they started demanding more money from Rahimullah following which Rs50,000 were transferred twice in the bank account of one of the accomplices of the police official.
“Yes, Javaid was tortured by the kidnapper,” Ammad Akbar told Dawn while quoting Javaid.

He assured the high-powered delegation that Nadra would surely extend all possible G2G support in ID-related projects and urged the visiting dignitaries to develop an ID ecosystem that would bring about ‘Single Version of Truth’.
The potential is endless for the digital public goods to be rolled out on the basis of a good ID system, he added.
The Nadra chairman said: “A good ID system helps build a strong democratic system, especially in developing countries. The ethos of democracy in ‘One Person, One Vote’ is better delivered through a national ID system that facilitates in development of computerised electoral rolls with negligible margins of voter fraud and other fraudulent practices.”
It is pertinent to mention here that under South-South cooperation, Nadra was assisting the governments of Nigeria, Sudan, Kenya and Somalia with regard to development of identity management and civil registration system.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Call to ensure ease of business in pharma sector,ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PPMA) Chairman Arshad Mahmood on Wednesday said...,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PPMA) Chairman Arshad Mahmood on Wednesday said Pakistan would become Nigeria if ease of business was not ensured in the pharmaceutical sector, fearing that the country would be left with no choice but to import medicines worth $20 billion every year.
“The foreign exchange starved Pakistan should be eyeing on the export of pharmaceutical products which is an $1,800 billion industry. Even if we capture the market of Africa, which is an $86 billion market, we would be able to bridge the gap between imports and exports of the country. If ease of business would not be ensured, investments will be shifted from Pakistan to Bangladesh, China, Iran and other countries,” he said while speaking to participants at an international conference on pharma and healthcare.
Mr Mahmood said once Nigeria used to manufacture medicines but with the passage of time, it implemented conditions of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and increased taxes and now it was importing 100pc of its medicines.
“On Wednesday morning, I was shocked to see in a newspaper that the per unit cost of the pharma sector is going to be increased by Rs32 due to which, each unit of electricity will be Rs93. Currently, the per month bill of my factory goes over Rs4 million, out of which electricity charges remain around Rs1.8 million and the rest are all taxes,” he said, adding Pakistan can export medicines to a number of countries of Africa and some countries of Asia including Myanmar, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan.
“A number of companies have been manufacturing medicines for people of Pakistan but when they get orders to export medicines to other countries, the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap) refuses to issue them a letter of good manufacturing practices (GMP) and insists on carrying out another inspection of the factory. The letter is mandatory to export medicines,” Mr Mahmood said.
“It is unfortunate that Drap allows companies to sell medicines to people of Pakistan but does not allow exporting the same medicine to other countries. That is why our exports are worth $269 million. On the other hand, India has been exporting medicines worth of $24 billion per annum. The local industry has been providing medicines worth $5 billion to people of Pakistan and if manufacturing would be stopped due to high cost of production, Pakistan will have to import medicines worth of $20 billion because in that case, foreign countries/companies will provide medicines on their cost and conditions,” he said.
“We cannot compete with international/foreign companies by importing raw material. The business community has been thinking about shifting investments abroad because over here, policies are made without taking the stakeholders onboard. The government needs to take steps for industrialisation rather than depending on remittances of overseas Pakistanis,” he added.
During a panel discussion, member of the PPMA Central Executive Committee Usman Shaukat said it was time to enforce an export emergency in Pakistan to tackle the current economic crisis and pharmaceuticals can play a vital role in earning precious foreign exchange for Pakistan.
“A pharma export council needs to be set up immediately to enhance the exports of pharmaceuticals which has immense potential. The stakeholders such as Drap and Ministry of Commerce have already principally agreed to formulate the pharma export council and the industry requests the process to be expedited in order to facilitate exports,” he added.
It was high time that Pakistan pharmaceutical products reach developed markets such as the United States and Europe.
Drap Chief Executive Officer Dr Asim Rauf, who also attended the conference, said that all possible steps would be taken to facilitate the pharmaceutical sector and ensure increase in export of medicines from Pakistan.

2022-12-22,2022-12-22,CDA plans housing projects for expats to attract dollars,Auction of commercial plots also on the cards.,"ISLAMABAD: In a bid to attract foreign investment into the country, the federal government is looking towards the Capital Development Authority (CDA) to launch new housing schemes for expatriates to boost country’s dollar reserves.
The civic body has prepared a presentation which would likely be given to the prime minister on Thursday (today) in light of his directives pertaining to these housing projects.
Sources said the CDA was planning to develop Gandhara Enclave – a housing project which falls in Zone I and partially in Zone III – and the Kuri housing scheme. Similarly, the civic body will also brief the government about the revenue potential from the under-construction Nilor Heights housing project.
CDA Chairman Mohammad Usman and his team will give a presentation on the schemes, sources said, adding that the auction of some commercial plots will also come under discussion. They said both schemes have the potential to generate billions of rupees in revenue.

Auction of commercial plots also on the cards

In its briefing, the CDA would also inform the federal government that if it wanted to develop Gandhara Enclave on more than 5,000 kanals, then the civic body would need to acquire more land falling in Zone III. Under the current zoning regulations, construction in Zone III is not allowed. However, the CDA is reportedly working on amending these regulations.
Similarly, the sources said in the first phase, the Kuri housing scheme could be developed on 10,000 kanals. They said it would be one of the largest schemes if everything went as per the plan. Sources said the Kuri scheme could turn out to be a “complicated matter because of chronic and unsettled issues with the locals” also known as affected persons.
The CDA had acquired the land decades ago but after announcing the award, no serious step was taken for the development of the Kuri model village. The civic body officials said thousands of housing units could be constructed as part of this scheme.
The officials said after paying compensation and built-up property claims, the civic agency would have around 2,000 acres of land worth billions of rupees. However, the civic agency never made any serious effort to settle issues with locals to get land’s possession. The officials said an initial survey had shown 1,100 occupants on the said land, but in 2011 the number had risen to 7,000.
At that time, the CDA officials in connivance with locals added many bogus cases to the list of land ownership claims. Later, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) probed the matter and cleared 3,422 ownership cases.
The CDA officials said the civic agency had acquired the land in 1968 while the built-up-property award was announced in 1971. But the CDA failed to take possession of the land after removing the objections raised by locals. In 2009, the civic agency announced a revised built-up property award, but due to allegations of bogus claims, it could not resolve the issue.
“Since the federal government has been supporting CDA, we will deliver and will launch at least two housing schemes, with a focus on apartments,” a CDA official said. He added that the plots would be sold to developers and investors who will be asked to build apartments.

Health Services Academy (HSA) Vice Chancellor Prof Shahzad Ali Khan said majority of the Pakistani population is either depressed, experiencing stress or anxiety and are not very optimistic about the country’s future.
He was addressing the launch of the 24th Thematic Calendar by Jahan-i-Maseeha Adbi Forum (JMAF). The theme of the 2023 calendar is, under these circumstances, Allama Iqbal’s message of ‘Khudi’.
Prof Khan said that hopelessness and despair has spread among the youth and under these circumstances, Iqbal’s message of self-hood can lift the spirits of the Pakistani nation again.
He added that the Pakistani youth now consider everybody as corrupt and incompetent, adding that majority of youngsters are desperate to leave the country although the entire world is facing similar issues and problems like inflation, joblessness and recession.
“Initially, teachers and academia of our society was targeted and they were defamed, later, character assassination of physicians and healthcare professionals was carried out and the same treatment was met out to politicians,” Prof Khan said, adding that things were not as bad as they were being portrayed.
He lauded the philosophy of Iqbal, adding that he was able to turn youngsters from a minority group in the Indian subcontinent into a united force by teaching them lessons of optimism, enthusiasm and encouragement.
The event was organised in collaboration with pharmaceutical firm Pharmevo that has been promoting Iqbal’s philosophy among healthcare professionals throughout the country.
Syed Jamshaid Ahmed of Pharmevo stressed on establishing and creating a healthier society in Pakistan and said that for a healthier society, not just medicines but promotion of literary activities was essential like holding book fairs, mushairas and so on.
Renowned poet Ajmal Siraj said an advisory committee comprising educationists, writers and scholars selected life and literary works of Iqbal as the theme for the next year’s calendar.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Setback for MQM-P as ECP wants order to appoint administrators withdrawn,"PTI's Ali Zaidi claims the appointment of such officers around 20 days before LG polls is ""blatant pre-poll rigging"".","KARACHI: The Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan may suffer a setback as the Election Commission of Pakistan on Wednesday asked the Sindh government to reverse the appointment of three government officers, said to be party loyalists, as administrators of Hyderabad and Karachi’s East and Korangi districts.
On Dec 19, the provincial government had appointed Muhammad Farooque, Syed Shakeel Ahmed and Muhammad Sharif as the administrators of Hyderabad Municipal Corporation and district municipal corporations of Korangi and East districts in line with an agreement between the Pakistan Peoples Party and MQM-P.
Prior to their appointment, Mr Farooque and Mr Ahmed had been working as administrator of Worker Model School, SITE Hyderabad, and Korangi, respectively. Mr Sharif had earlier been working as director-charged parking at the DMC-Central.
However, their appointment is criticised by opposition parties, which termed it a pre-poll rigging attempt as local government elections in Karachi and Hyderabad divisions were scheduled to be held on Jan 15.
On Wednesday, the office of the provincial election commissioner in a letter addressed to the local government secretary said that ECP, through a notification issued on June 10, had imposed a ban on transfer/ posting during the conduct of local government elections.
It directed the local government secretary to either withdraw the order or kept it in abeyance till the culmination of the second phase of the local government elections in Karachi and Hyderabad divisions.
The letter reminded the government of an earlier ECP notification that states: “For Divisions in respect of which Election schedule of Local Government Elections has been issued no transfer / posting of the Government Officers and Officials including those of autonomous bodies/ Authorities shall be made without prior approval of the Commission till the publication of Election Results”.
Meanwhile, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leader Ali Zaidi said in a tweet that the ECP ordered withdrawal of the notification appointing administrators.

 





 
Earlier in the day, he told a press conference that his party had written a letter to the chief secretary and informed him that the newly-appointed administrators were affiliated with the MQM-P.
He said that the appointment of such officers as administrators around 20 days before the LG polls was blatant pre-poll rigging.
Also, the Sindh United Party (SUP) raised concerns over the appointment of administrators and Hyderabad commissioner before the LG polls.
SUP chairman and convener of the Sindh Action Committee Syed Jalal Mehmood Shah demanded that the ECP declare null and void the appointment orders of the new administrator and Hyderabad commissioner.

• Muggers shoot Bin Qasim SHO, friend over resistance
KARACHI: While police claimed to have killed two alleged robbers in Korangi in an encounter, in which two policemen also suffered bullet wounds, muggers’ criminal streak in the city continued with assaults, taking lives of a young man and a policeman in the same area on Wednesday.  
The SHO of Bin Qasim police station was also shot at and wounded by armed muggers in Gulshan-i-Maymar.  
In the first incident, the police said that Qayyum Umer, 24, was gunned down by robbers when he put up resistance near Ghousia Masjid in Korangi-3.  
Korangi-SSP Sajid Amir Sadozai said armed motorcyclists were looting his cousin at some distance. Qayyum was standing outside his home and saw the robbers looting his cousin. As he yelled at the robbers, the robbers opened fire on him and fled. He died on the spot.
The body was taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre to fulfil medico-legal formalities.  
Police Surgeon Summaiya Syed said that the victim sustained a gunshot injury to chest and arm. His family members did not allow doctors to complete medico-legal formalities and took away the body, she added.  
The relatives told media that the victim was an orphaned child who sold vegetables in the area to earn his living. Hailing from Mansehra, he also played football at a local club in Korangi.  
Later, police intensified patrol and snap-checking in the area in search of the killers.  
DIG-East Muqaddas Haider told Dawn that two policemen of ‘Shaheen Force’ indicated two suspects to stop in Zaman Town. However, the suspects opened fire on them and an exchange of gunfire took place in which Head Constable Manzoor Ahmed, 38, was killed and the suspects managed to speed away.
However, after an interval of around 30 minutes, the Korangi Industrial Area police spotted two suspects and another encounter ensued in Mehran Town.  
After an exchange of gunfire, two alleged robbers were shot dead while two policemen, Khan Razik and Sajid, were wounded.
The DIG East said that one of the injured policemen had identified both the deceased as the same criminals who had killed the head constable during the earlier encounter.  
He said they were also probing the possibility as to whether the same suspects had gunned down Qayyum over resistance as these three incidents took place in the same vicinity of Korangi. 
The deceased suspects’ involvement in the three incidents would be verified with witnesses’ accounts and matching of spent bullet casings found from the crime scenes, the officials added.  
SHO, friend wounded by robbers 
The Bin Qasim SHO and his friend were shot at and wounded by robbers off Superhighway on Wednesday.  
The SITE-Superhighway Industrial Area (SSIA) police said that SHO Irdees Bangash and citizen Asif Ibrahim, 36, got injured in the firing at an estate agency in Ahsanabad.  
East-SSP Syed Abdul Rahim Shirazi said that the SHO had gone there for some personal work. He was sitting with his friends when armed muggers arrived and attempted to snatch cash and other valuables from them.  
The SHO overpowered one suspect, but his accomplice opened fire resulting in bullet injuries to the police officer and his friend.  
One suspect, later identified as Nadeem, was also wounded by the firing of the SHO and arrested by a police patrol that reached the scene after hearing gunshots.
The SHO was taken to the Aga Khan University Hospital. SSP Shirazi said he suffered a bullet wound near the abdomen.
Bangash had served as SHO of the SITE-Superhighway Industrial Area police station and was recently transferred to the Bin Qasim police station.

The officer stated this in a report submitted in compliance with the bench’s directive to verify employees lists and find out if there were any ghost employees in the departments of education, health and police. 
The division bench, comprising Justices Shamsuddin Abbasi and Amajad Ali Sahito, had issued the directives while hearing a petition filed by advocate Mumtaz Ali Jesar. 
The director general of the Sindh monitoring and evaluation cell was directed to appear in person and file a detailed report regarding procuring the attendance of teachers and the process of issuance of form-II to stop the salaries of the absentees. 
But he was called absent while the deputy director of the cell said he had received the direction in late hours; therefore, the DG did not turn up. At this juncture, the director of school education said the DG was in contact with them.
The bench observed: “We [bench] are noticing this act of the DG with dismay, as he is deliberately avoiding appearing before this court and warn him to remain careful in future.” 
The medical superintendent of Chandka Medical College Hospital said he had issued a letter to the Larkana DAO for blocking the IDs’ of the ghost employees. 
“We have also noted with dismay that the secretary education, Sindh IGP and health department secretary, who were asked to upload the lists of their employees with names, parentage and CNICs on their official website but still compliance had not been made by them,” the two judges bench observed. “Once again we are directing them to upload the list of the employees and furnish report within a month’s time,” it added.
The court found the replies of the show-cause notices issued to the project director (PD) and registrar of Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Medical University (SMBBMU), for not appearing in hearing on Dec 14, satisfactory and vacated the notices, directing them to remain careful in future. 
The PD in his report said that the Higher Education Commission (HEC) and Sindh government were approached for a grant-in-aid of Rs1,820.124 million to complete their (varsity) projects, but they did not receive any response yet. 
The bench directed the HEC and Sindh government to provide required funds to the university for completion of their projects.

The commission’s member judicial-I retired Justice Arshad Noor Khan said at a press conference held at Darbar hall here the other day that it was regrettable that despite passage of five months to heavy rainfall, rainwater had still not receded from talukas of Sindhri, Jhuddo, Digri, Kot Ghulam Mohammad etc.
He said that similar flood situation might recur over succeeding years due to climate change. “We should therefore adopt a procedure to save population from big disaster in future and in this connection the district administration should perform its duties towards people with honesty and sincerity,” he said.
He said that even if they succeeded to persuade 50 per cent people they could save a large population from disaster. “We have discussed problems of masses particularly flood victims,” he said.
He urged the commission officers to go into the field to listen to grievances of masses and flood victims and resolve their problems by taking drastic measures within available resources.
Later, he held an open kachehry where social workers and villagers alleged that relief goods, ration, tents and food were distributed on the directives of political personalities and elected representatives while genuine victims, who were still living in makeshift huts along roads under open sky, were deprived of all government help.
They deplored that officers concerned of the district administration did not visit many flood hit areas to assess damage from the disaster and meet flood victim families. Most school buildings had suffered damage after flood and heavy rainfall, he said.
They claimed that blankets meant for flood victims were supplied to bungalows of feudal lords and were not distributed among flood victims.
They said that saline water was being drained with heavy pumping machines into West Jamrao canal, which was causing different diseases among masses.
They objected to a survey of damage to houses and crops carried out under supervision of army and revenue officials.
They accused deputy commissioner and other officers concerned of obeying orders of local ruling party MNAs and demanded authorities launch rehabilitation work and distribute wheat seed among victims without any discrimination.
They demanded the government immediately remove illegal encroachments from all waterways.
The kachehry was also attended by Mirpurkhas deputy commissioner Zainul Abideen Memon, SSP Asad Chaudhry, Zaheer Hussain and the commission member Noor Ahmad Narejo.

They were addressing a seminar on the “Strategic and Economic Dimensions of Pakistan and China Relations Amid Deepening Global Geopolitical Divide” at Sindh University on Wednesday. 
SU Thatta campus Pro-Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Rafique Ahmed Memon in his presidential address said that there were vast opportunities for cooperation in the field of higher education and research in China. 
He said that Chinese varsities could admit a large number of Pakistani students. Chinese educational institutions should register themselves with Pakistan accreditation bodies to resolve problems faced by Pakistani students on their return after obtaining higher degrees from various Chinese varsities. 
Pakistan Ambassador to China Moinul Haque said China’s production of Al-Khalid tanks and GF-17 Thunder fighter jets with Pakistan was actually a great proof of extraordinary defense cooperation between the two countries. 
He said that a cynical propaganda was being spread that the CPEC project would push Pakistan deeper into the debt mire, but it was not the case at all. 
Mr Haque said that it was important to open the CPEC project to public so that no propaganda could affect the friendship between the two countries. 
The two countries would soon start working on an important project to prepare submarines for Pakistan Navy and China would ensure access of Pakistani engineers to its manufacturing plant. 
He announced that the SU would be provided with opportunities to enter into educational agreements with top varsities of China so that it could advance in the field of higher education and research being an old varsity of Pakistan. 
Centre for International Strategic Studies Sindh (CSSS) Executive Director and former ambassador Kazi M. Khalilullah said: “Pakistan has a successful foreign policy, which we have to trust,” he said. Both countries had supported each other in testing times while in terms of defense, China had always helped Pakistan to stand on its own feet, he added. 
Former Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) chairman Dr Ansar Pervez said that Pakistan initially bought a nuclear power plant from Canada, but due to Canada’s coldness, the project could not go ahead and then China started the same project and it assisted Pakistan. 
He said that 325 megawatt nuclear power plant provided by China was successfully operationalized, adding that China’s cooperation was continuing to meet energy needs of Pakistan. 
Federal Minister Ahsan Iqbal, Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed and others also made speeches online.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,FIA court rejects Swati’s post-arrest bail,ISLAMABAD: A special court of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on Wednesday rejected the post-arrest bail of...,"ISLAMABAD: A special court of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on Wednesday rejected the post-arrest bail of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Senator Azam Khan Swati in a case registered against him over anti-establishment tweets.
Special Judge (Central) Azam Khan observed that Senator Swati had repeated the same crime in which he was already on a post-arrest bail.
During the course of the hearing, FIA’s special prosecutor Raja Rizwan Abbasi argued that Mr Swati operated a verified Twitter account and he was being followed by politicians, journalists and the public at large. He said Mr Swati never contested the ownership of his Twitter handle and used it to build an anti-army narrative.
Mr Abbasi claimed this was a deliberate attempt to incite mutiny among personnel of the armed forces. He said the PTI leader misused the relief of bail and tweeted the same text for which he was facing a case before the FIA’s Cybercrimes Wing.
Mr Swati’s counsel Babar Awan argued that the complainant, who had lodged the first information report (FIR) against his client, was not an aggrieved party.
He said the case had been registered by the FIA and it was not on a par with the complaint filed under defamation laws.
Mr Awan argued that the court could impose a maximum penalty of Rs1,000 on Mr Swati over his tweet, but he was being moved from one province to another.
The FIA had earlier this month arrested Mr Swati for defamation, statement conducing to public mischief, and highly obnoxious campaign of intimidating tweets, after his fiery speech at a PTI long march in Rawalpindi in which he lashed out at the senior military leadership.

2022-12-20,2022-12-22,‘TTP is Pakistan’s absolute red line’,Bilawal says Islamabad willing to consider all options to ensure citizens’ safety and security.,"WASHINGTON: Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has suggested letting neighbouring countries know that the outlawed TTP is an “absolute red line” for Pakistan and it would not allow anyone to cross that line.
“As far as the TTP (Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan) is concerned, it’s absolutely our red line. It is something that we will not tolerate,” said the foreign minister while speaking at the Atlantic Council, Washington, on Tuesday evening. 
“And absolutely we will be willing to consider each and every single option to ensure the safety and security of our people.” 

 





 
As the foreign minister stressed the need for combating militants in his Washington talk, Pakistan’s UN Ambassador Munir Akram told the UN Security Council in New York that engagement with the Taliban was the best option to stabilise the region.
“Coercion and isolation have not proved successful in the past; they will prove to be counter-productive now and in the future,” said Ambassador Akram while participating in a UN debate on the situation in Afghanistan. “We need a coherent and practical plan to realise the objectives of the international community through patient engagement with the interim government,” the Pakistani envoy told the 15-member Council.

Bilawal says Islamabad willing to consider all options to ensure citizens’ safety and security

Mr Bhutto-Zardari made a similar observation in his talk at the Atlantic Council, urging world powers to work with Afghanistan’s de facto rulers to stabilise the region. When the moderator, Uzair Younus, asked if Pakistan could deploy troops inside Afghanistan or on the border to stop attacks by Afghanistan-based militant groups, the minister suggested using the “hammer and anvil” strategy, with Kabul’s cooperation, to eliminate militancy.
The chief Pakistani diplomat pointed out that despite these border and cross-border attacks, the situation was far more secure and stable now than it was in 2007, when Pakistan launched a series of operations against the TTP and other militants.
“But those things can be put at risk if this goes unchecked. And obviously that would undermine any hope, whether it is CPEC or any other form of economic activity. Nobody wants to put lives at risk in order to conduct business,” he warned.
“That’s why I have been particularly hawkish on the issue of the TTP, and on the issue of terrorism in general. I believe that recent events in the region are alarming, not only the border incidents but the recent Bannu incident, which our security commanders have very bravely managed to overcome,” he said.
The foreign minister, however, stressed the need to “impress on our neighbours, particularly Afghan­istan” that they have to demonstrate the will and the capacity to take on the TTP or other groups functioning from there.
He acknowledged that there’s room for improvement in Pakistan’s Afghan policy — as there’s in America’s — and “we need to be serious about what we can do going forward”.
“Are we going learn from our mistakes to ensure that we do not repeat them,” he asked. “The answer to that question is going to define the safety and stability of Afghanistan, the safety and stability of Pakistan and the safety and stability of our region.” 
Pakistan’s number one option, he said, was to get the Afghan interim government to demonstrate that they had the capacity to deal with this issue.
Separately, the foreign minister also met Deputy Secretary of State Wendy R. Sherman where they discussed Pakistan’s efforts to recover from devastating floods and the upcoming Jan 9 International Con­ference on Climate Resilient Pakistan in Geneva. 
According to a readout issued by the State Department, the US official expressed condolences for Pakistani lives lost in recent terrorist attacks, and they committed to strengthen cooperation between the two countries.

The 13-member committee would be responsible to undertake a detailed mapping of the ‘gas sector circular debt stock as of June 30, 2022’, segregating the principal amount of debt, late payment surcharges, penalties and liquidity damages among the PSEs of petroleum and power sectors.
It would work out a comprehensive circular debt settlement plan through cash and non-cash payments and adjustments and also cover legal and procedural requirements on the pattern of a previous circular debt settlement in 2013.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,ECC defers PSO’s request for Rs17bn,Receivables of embattled national fuel supplier cross Rs612bn.,"ISLAMABAD: The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet was informed on Wednesday that receivables of the national fuel supplier – Pakistan State Oil (PSO) had crossed Rs612 billion and it was struggling to manage remittances to its foreign suppliers.
The meeting of the ECC presided over by Finance Minister Ishaq Dar, however, did not immediately approve Rs17bn urgently demanded by the PSO to honour its liabilities to international firms, particularly its long-term fuel supplier Kuwait Petroleum Company (KPC).
“The ECC deferred a summary submitted by the Ministry of Energy (Petroleum Division) for foreign exchange coverage to PSO and directed the Ministry of Energy to resubmit the summary after reviewing the numbers”, said an official statement.
The Petroleum Division reported that under a credit facility provided by KPC since 2000 and extended annually for the supply of diesel, a joint account of the federal government and KPC had been set up with the National Bank of Pakistan in which PSO keeps on depositing rupee equivalent funds after 30 days of the bill of lading for each shipment.
After 90 days from the bill of lading, the NBP has to transfer the cargo cost to KPC and exchange cover for an additional 60 days is borne by the federal government.
However, the account facility started to face huge shortfalls in April 2020 on account of exchange losses, posing a default situation in remittances to KPC.
At the time the ECC approved a supplementary grant of Rs12bn which helped PSO avoid an international default. The facility worked well for another two years but then suffered a shortfall again and now this shortfall stood at Rs17bn owing to “prevalent upheaval” in the rupee-dollar parity.

Receivables of embattled national fuel supplier cross Rs612bn

The Petroleum Division said the PSO had been defaulting even on rupee deposits in the NBP account because of its liquidity challenges as its receivables reached Rs612bn and “it urgently required adequate funds so that liabilities are met on time”. 
The Petroleum Division and PSO have been trying to manage the situation for avoiding international default by depositing required funds on due dates but the situation was “too critical” now.
It also complained that the Petroleum Division had been submitting budget requirements for exchange loss on this facility every year but the Ministry of Finance did not make separate provisions which led to exposure to international default.
The finance ministry, however, argued that the government had already released Rs30bn to address PSO’s liquidity position under the foreign exchange head in September and arranged another Rs50bn through market financing. Also, the government was now trying to ensure PSO recoveries through power companies and gas companies.
The Petroleum Division, however, insisted that the matter related to actual foreign exchange loss of over Rs17bn so far on the KPC’s credit facility up to Dec 2, which has to be paid by the government sooner or later.
“PSO has made all outstanding payments delayed due to liquidity position. Exchange loss, however, is the liability of the government”, Petroleum Division was quoted but a decision was deferred.
Supplementary grants
The ECC approved a summary of the Ministry of Energy (Petroleum Division) on the transfer of 30pc working interests in exploration licences/block – Margala Block – owned by M/s MOL of Hungary to M/s Mari Petroleum Company Ltd. 
It was apprised that Margala Block was governed by Pakistan Petroleum Exploration and Production Rules 2001 and the acquiring company MPCL was operating in Pakistan since 1954 and has working interests in 23 exploration licences and 15 development & production leases. The ECC was further informed that M/s MOL had cleared all its financial obligations.
The ECC also approved a Rs823m technical supplementary grant to the Ministry of Maritime Affairs, enabling Gwadar Port Authority (GPA) to disburse the amount of Rs250,000 per head to 3,291 fishermen registered with Balochistan Fisheries Department for the purchase of boat engines.
The ECC also approved another Rs200mn Technical Supplementary Grant to the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulation and Coordination for Ghurki Trust Teaching Hospital (GTTH), Lahore. Ghurki Trust Teaching Hospital (GTTH) is a tertiary care non-profit organisation providing “State of the Art” health facilities to needy and poor patients.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,"China willing to provide ‘all kinds of assistance’, envoy assures Dar","Both sides deliberate on several avenues for expanding bilateral relations, especially in the economic and financial sectors.","ISLAMABAD: China assured Pakistan on Wednesday that it is ready to help Islamabad in every possible way following its request for about $8.75 billion in an additional financial package, including the rollover of debt, bank deposits and currency swaps.
Chinese Ambassador in Islamabad Nong Rong called on Finance Minister Ishaq Dar on Wednesday and “assured continuous support of the Chinese government to Pakistan”, the finance ministry said in a statement.
The “government of China stands with the people of Pakistan and is willing to provide all kinds of assistance”, the statement added.
Mr Dar told reporters last month that Pakistan had sought about $9bn in additional financial support from China during the visit of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to Beijing, and that the Chinese leadership had promised to “roll over $4bn in sovereign loans, refinance $3.3bn commercial bank loans and increase currency swap by about $1.45bn — from 30bn yuan to 40bn yuan”. The total worked out at $8.75bn.
Pakistan needs at least $34bn until June 30, 2023, to meet its international liabilities, including debt and trade payments. Pakistan is banking on about $13bn in additional support from China and Saudi Arabia.
The statement said Mr Dar “thanked the Chinese ambassador for their continuous support and assistance” and praised the long-standing and deep-rooted friendly relations between the two countries.
Both sides deliberated on several avenues for expanding bilateral relations, especially in the economic and financial sectors. The ambassador appreciated the government’s policy initiatives to sustain and boost fiscal and monetary stability.
Mr Dar had earlier said that the Chinese president and prime minister had assured Prime Minister Sharif that his government would stand by Pakistan and “will not let you down”.
He had then separately taken up the issue of refinancing $3bn in China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) deposit and about $3.3bn debt rollover. Both these heads are due for maturity on different dates before June 30.

Topline Securities said bearish sentiments prevailed especially in the second half of the trading session as investors went on a selling spree that eroded earlier gains. The sell-off was in reaction to the tug of war between the PTI and other parties on the dissolution of the Punjab Assembly.

As a result, the KSE-100 index settled at 39,342.89 points, down 489.56 points or 1.23 per cent from the preceding session.

• Interior ministry asks Rangers, FC to perform security duties in Punjab
LAHORE: In a tit-for-tat move, Governor Balighur Rehman on Wednesday termed the ruling of Punjab Assembly Speaker Sibtain Khan disposing of his directives regarding the vote of confidence “unconstitutional”, whereas the coalition government hinted at the imposition of governor’s rule in Pakistan’s largest province.
The PML-N government initially hinted that governor’s rule could be imposed for two months through a resolution in a joint session of parliament, but the period could be extended to six months.
“Since the chief minister on Wednesday failed to take the trust vote in the Punjab Assembly in compliance with the governor’s order, legally he ceases to hold his office. And now any time... probably on Thursday (today), the governor can issue an order de-notifying the CM,” Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah said earlier in the day.
This view was echoed by SAPM Attaullah Tarrar, who told reporters late on Wednesday night that the governor had discretionary powers to de-notify the CM and it was up to him whether he wanted to do it “tomorrow or the day after”.
Another option, Mr Sanaullah said, is governor’s rule by the Centre. “In the wake of the constitutional crisis, the government may get a resolution passed from the National Assembly and Senate to impose governor’s rule in Punjab for two months initially — the period can be extended to six months as well,” the minister added.
He was of the view that “all was not well” in the camp of Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Punjab parliamentary party. “Had the PTI been confident that CM Elahi could secure the support of 186 MPAs in the PA he would have gone for the trust vote on Wednesday in compliance with the governor’s order,” he said, adding that the CM could have gone for PA’s dissolution after the vote in line with Imran Khan’s plan for the dissolution of assemblies. “But the PTI chose otherwise because it knew it did not have the required number,” Mr Sanaullah claimed.
Governor’s order on PA speaker ruling
In the late evening, Governor Rehman wrote a three-page order in response to PA Speaker Sibtain Khan’s ruling which had termed Mr Rehman’s order seeking vote of confidence from Mr Elahi ‘illegal’.
In his order, the governor said under Article 130(7) of the Constitution that PA speaker’s ruling had no bearing on his order and termed it unconstitutional. The governor said the speaker’s ruling was also in violation of Rule 209 of the Rules of Procedure of the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab, 1997.
“The speaker’s ruling, consequent acts and omissions constitute and result in enabling the chief minister to refrain from obtaining a vote of confidence in terms of Article 130(7). Helping and aiding the CM in refraining from fulfilling his duty and preventing the constitutional process from proceeding to its logical end leads to the consequences stipulated in Rule 22 (7) of the Rules of Procedure of the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab, 1997.”
Meanwhile, taking a screenshot of the governor’s reply, PTI senior leader Fawad Chaudhry, in a tweet, asked Mr Rehman not to make a mockery of his office. “Dear Governor! Do not make a mockery of your office, the speaker’s ruling is final as far affairs of the Assembly are concerned and do not expose yourself to misconduct proceedings. Respect the Constitution,” he added.
Earlier in the day, the governor held a meeting with the PML-N and PPP leaders and legal experts to discuss the strategy of the federal government. Federal ministers Rana Sanaullah and Saad Rafique, premier’s special assistants Attaullah Tarar and Malik Ahmed Khan, and PPP Punjab parliamentary party leader Hasan Murtaza were present in the meeting.
Separately, the federal government on Wednesday decided to deploy Pakistan Rangers and Frontier Constabulary (FC) across Punjab, interior ministry sources said, adding that the federal agencies would ensure law and order in the province and work for implementation of laws and Constitution.
Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah directed the Punjab chief secretary and inspector general of police to maintain law and order, protection of the life and property of the people, and perform their duties as per law and Constitution, sources said.
The interior minister also warned officials not to become part of any process that was against the law and Constitution.

• As per agreement with PTI, PML-Q to get 30 PA, 15 NA seats 
LAHORE: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has announced that it will challenge any “unconstitutional” move of de-notifying Punjab Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi, and asked its leadership, parliamentarians and party workers to reach the Governor House at 5pm on Thursday (today) to ‘block’ the governor from taking any such action.
PTI Chairman Imran Khan will address the protesters through video link and announce the party’s next line of action in the face of the provincial opposition’s moves to save the Punjab Assembly.
Earlier on Wednesday, Governor Balighur Rehman had declared Punjab Assembly Speaker Sibtain Khan’s ruling regarding CM Elahi’s vote of confidence “unconstitutional” and “illegal”.
On Tuesday, the speaker had termed the governor’s orders — to the CM to obtain a vote of confidence from the provincial assembly by 4pm on Wednesday — as “illegal, against the provisions of the Constitution and thus stand disposed of”, and issued a ruling in this regard.
The PTI leadership on Wednesday maintained the speaker had ruled that the assembly was in session and until the session was prorogued, the governor could not summon a fresh session, citing a 1997 ruling by the Lahore High Court. They said the court had ruled that “not less than 10 clear days” must be granted to the chief minister to obtain a vote of confidence.
PTI Central Punjab General Secretary Hammad Azhar gave a call to PTI leaders, lawmakers and party workers and supporters to reach outside the Governor House at 5pm on Thursday (today).
“The masses can no longer remain silent spectators while an unconstitutional game is being played,” he remarked.
Meanwhile, the federal government has sought deployment of Rangers to beef up security of the Governor House “till further orders under sections 7(b) and 10 of the Pakistan Rangers Ordinance, 1959 and Section 4(3)(i) of Anti-Terrorism Act 1997”.
“The Pakistan Rangers (Punjab) is requested to immediate necessary action with regard to beefing up the security at the Governor’s House, Lahore, in coordination with the office of the governor,” said the Interior Ministry.
PTI senior leader Fawad Chaudhry told the media outside party chief Imran Khan’s Zaman Park residence that the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) parties were ‘scared of’ holding general elections, adding they would be violating the Constitution’s Article 109 by asking the chief minister to take a vote of confidence immediately. 
He said the governor should give 10 clear days for the vote or challenge the Punjab Assembly speaker’s ruling in court.
He further said the PTI had called its parliamentary party meeting on Thursday (today) and stressed its 177 as well as the PML-Q’s 10 MPAs were available to foil a no-confidence motion submitted by the PML-N and the PPP separately against the chief minister as well as the Punjab Assembly speaker and deputy speaker.
Mr Chaudhry also claimed that the party’s women MPAs had told Mr Khan that they were receiving offers from former president Asif Zardari to abstain from voting for Rs50 million each.
“The people of Sindh should know that Asif Zardari is spending their welfare money to buy loyalties of PTI MPAs,” he said.
Claiming that some other MPAs had also received threatening calls to abstain from voting, he demanded the superior courts take notice and identify those who were trying to terrify the party legislators.
“As soon as the vote of no-confidence fails, the Punjab Assembly will be dissolved and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly will follow suit,” he declared.
On the other hand, a three-member committee of the PTI held a meeting with CM Elahi and his party members and discussed seat adjustment prospects in detail.
As part of a formula, sources said, the PTI agreed to offer 30 Punjab Assembly and 15 National Assembly seats to the PML-Q. The party of the Chaudhrys had sought seats in the newly created Gujrat division – their hometown -- that included Gujrat, Mandi Bahauddin, Wazirabad and Hafizabad districts, some parts of south Punjab as well as Sialkot.
PTI leader Shafqat Mahmood later confirmed that both the allied parties had mutually agreed over giving 30 Punjab and 15 National Assembly seats to Mr Elahi’s party.
Meanwhile, the PML-Q held its parliamentary party meeting, chaired by CM Elahi and parliamentary leader Sajid Bhatti, and discussed the current political situation and decided their future course of action.
The chief minister has also called the provincial cabinet’s seventh meeting at his office on Thursday (today) at 1:30pm with 21 items on the agenda.
Soon afterwards, PML-Q MNA Hussain Elahi tweeted that all 10 PML-Q MPAs had announced complete support for PTI chief Imran Khan and Chief Minister Parvez Elahi in the meeting.
Responding to the PDM government’s claim that it had won the loyalties of six PML-Q MPAs, Mr Hussain asserted that the federal ruling coalition would not be able to fool anyone with its propaganda, and commented: “They (PDM) talk about six MPAs when they can’t even break one.”
A PML-Q spokesman said the parliamentary party had delegated complete authority of making all the decisions to CM Elahi and resolved to vote in favour of the CM, speaker and deputy speaker when a vote of no-confidence was taken up in the house.
Mr Elahi also asserted that the PML-Q would continue standing by Imran Khan and that his party was united and would remain so to bulldoze any propaganda or rumours being spread by the PDM government in the Centre.
Earlier in the day, as Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah had claimed he would seal the Chief Minister House if Mr Elahi didn’t take a vote of confidence, the CM’s son, Moonis, said he had “reached 8-Club CM House and waiting for you”. A few hours later, he tweeted: “Rana sb am bored now. Heading home but pls do let me know when you plan to come.”

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,"PTI set to approach SC, not speaker, for resignations’ acceptance","“We are dealing with those people who do not have any moral standing,” says Senator Shibli Faraz.","ISLAMABAD: Contra­dicting the announcement it made only days ago that PTI members of National Assembly are ready to appear before Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf for verification of their resignations, the party on Wednesday changed its stance as senior party leader Senator Shibli Faraz declared that the lawmakers would not go to the Parliament House, and instead, the PTI would approach the Supreme Court to seek acceptance of the mass resignations.
“We had decided to go to the assembly for acceptance of our resignations. But this is not the way and MNAs, who are elected by the people, cannot be asked to keep standing in a queue for acceptance of their resignations … The government is doing all this [handling the resignation issue] with a mala fide intention,” said Mr Faraz, alleging that the speaker wanted to “humiliate” the PTI lawmakers by treating them as “charity seekers”.
Talking to Dawn, Mr Faraz said they would approach the Supreme Court and ask it to direct the speaker to accept the resignations submitted some eight months ago.
“We will go to the SC in a day or two,” he said.
The party is going to the apex court where this issue has already been discussed during the hearing of various petitions and even the judges had observed that PTI should reconsider its decision of quitting the assembly.
When asked if it was not a U-turn as PTI Vice Chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi had written a letter to the speaker only six days back, asking him to allocate some time for the party’s MNAs to verify their resignations, Mr Faraz said they wanted to do so, but the government did not seem to be serious which was evident from the fact that it had convened a session of the National Assembly on Thursday (today) on a one-day notice despite the fact that the speaker was not even present in the country.
“This is not a U-turn. Look at the spirit of the matter. Why is the government delaying acceptance of our resignations? Why has the speaker adopted a pick-and-choose policy by accepting the resignations of only 11 members?” he said, adding that submission of mass resignations was part of the party strategy to force the government to hold early elections in the country. Otherwise, he said, the party MNAs could have been asked to submit resignations in groups.
When his attention was drawn to the assembly rules under which the speaker is required to individually call the members for verification of resignations, Mr Faraz posed a valid counter-question, saying: “Under which law did the speaker accept the resignations of the 11 MNAs who had also not appeared before him for verification [of their resignations]?”
“We are dealing with those people who do not have any moral standing,” the PTI senator alleged, questioning the logic behind the speaker’s decision to accept the resignations of 11 members out of 123 who had submitted the resignations en masse at the time of the election of Shehbaz Sharif as the prime minister in April.
On Dec 15, while talking to reporters in Lahore, Mr Qureshi had expressed his party’s resolve to dissolve the assemblies of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and get the MNAs’ resignations accepted after appearing before the speaker.
“We have already made our decision. We will execute it,” he had stated, adding that party Chairman Imran Khan had given him the letter for sending it to the speaker.
He also waved the ‘letter’ bearing the subject “Resignations of MNAs of PTI” to the media and chided the speaker for being “selective” while accepting the resignations of 11 MNAs “illegally”.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,"Onus on Centre to fight militancy, says KP",KP govt's spokesperson says the police’s job is to counter routine crimes and ‘national security’ is beyond their mandate.,"PESHAWAR: As some semblance of normalcy returned to Bannu on Wednesday, a day after an operation against terrorists, the under-fire KP government refused to accept the blame for the resurgence of terrorism, saying it was the responsibility of the Centre to tackle the issue.
Chief Minister Mahmood Khan in a media talk declared that ‘fighting militancy’ was the mandate of the federal government.
Meanwhile, President Arif Alvi, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Army chief Gen Syed Asim Munir, separately, paid tribute to the soldiers who took part in the operation at the CTD centre in Bannu on Tuesday.
The KP chief minister explained that it was the Centre’s job to fight militancy since the institutions fighting [against militants] fell within the jurisdiction of the federal government.
“Crime and law and order situation is the provincial government’s job but militancy falls within their [federal government’s] domain and hence this is their responsibility,” he maintained.
Besides, the chief minister claimed that the federal government was reluctant to release funds for both current and developmental expenditures. “Neither do we receive the current nor the developmental expenditures [funding],” he said and alleged that the funds were being diverted to the federal government’s members of parliament.
Endorsing the CM’s views, the KP government’s spokesperson told a press briefing that the police’s job was to counter routine crimes and ‘national security’ was beyond its mandate.
He said the incident that took place inside the Bannu CTD centre fell within the definition of ‘national security’ which was the federal the government’s domain.
“This is not something about general law and order…it falls within the domain of the national security which is the responsibility of the federal government,” CM Adviser on Information Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif said.
In reply to a question about the recently held talks with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Afghanistan, the special assistant said that war had never ended since 2001 and dialogue was an attempt to further improve the situation but a permanent solution [to militancy] could not be found.
“The reason for dialogue with them [TTP] was to improve the situation,” Mr Saif said, adding that war never ended, though its intensity fluctuated. “We wanted a permanent solution but it did not happen,” he said while explaining the reason for holding talks with the Taliban.
A KP minister, however, appeared to have a different stance, reported APP.
Kamran Bangash at a presser reiterated the provincial government’s resolve to eliminate terrorism and extremism in all its forms and manifestations and said the government was taking pragmatic steps to improve the capacity of police and the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD).
Referring to the terrorist attack on the CTD compound, he said police and security forces had already shared information about the possible terrorist attacks.
Meanwhile, Chief of Army Staff Gen Syed Asim Munir met the officers and soldiers, who were injured during the Bannu operation, at the CMH Rawalpindi, according to an Inter-Services Public Relations release.
The COAS remained with them for some time and inquired about their well-being.
He appreciated their high spirit and morale and lauded their professionalism during the operation against the terrorists.
Pledge against terrorism
President Alvi lauded the security forces for carrying out a successful operation against terrorists in Bannu and expressed the resolve to eliminate terrorism from the country’s soil, APP reported.
The president, in a statement, termed the success a result of the professionalism of security forces and their unwavering commitment against terrorism.
In separate remarks, Prime Minister Sharif said the state would not surrender to any terrorist group or organisation and vowed that militants would be dealt with according to the Constitution and law.
Strongly condemning the activities of terrorists, he said such attempts would be crushed.
“We will not let the sacrifices of the martyrs go to waste,” he said and mentioned the military operations of Raddul Fasaad and Zarb-i-Azb as significant measures to eradicate terrorism.
The prime minister said that though main responsibility for law and order lies with the provinces, the federation could not turn a blind eye to such problems.
He assured the provinces that the federal government would work along with them in fighting terrorism and vowed to fully implement the National Action Plan to eliminate terrorism.
PM Shehbaz said the federal government would assist the provinces in improving the professional capacity of the anti-terrorism force and departments.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,SC overturns verdicts in favour of khula,"Husband’s claim of conjugal rights seemed to be motivated by his intention to avoid payment of dower amount, judge observes.","ISLAMABAD: In a family suit, the Supreme Court on Wednesday set aside the Peshawar High Court (PHC) and appellate court decisions for dissolution of a marriage by way of khula and restored the decree of a family court to dissolve the marriage on the basis of cruelty inflicted by a man on his wife.
While the family court after recording of evidence and hearing both sides had dissolved the marriage due to cruelty on a suit moved by Tayyeba Ambareen against her husband Shafqat Ali Kiyani demanding dower amount, dowry articles, medical expenses and maintenance for herself and their daughter, the appellate court on Nov 10, 2015 overturned the decree and converted it into khula with the direction to the woman to refund five-tola gold to her husband. The high court also upheld the appellate court decision.
Headed by Justice Sardar Tariq Masood, a three-judge Supreme Court bench then took up an appeal against the PHC verdict.
In its decision, the apex court observed that husband’s claim of conjugal rights — despite his ‘ruthless, tyrannical and oppressive’ conduct or behaviour — seemed to be motivated by the sole intention to avoid paying maintenance allowance and the dower amount and he ultimately succeeded in his effort when the appellate court dissolved the marriage by way of khula with the direction to the wife to refund the dower amount.

Husband’s claim of conjugal rights seemed to be motivated by his intention to avoid payment of dower amount, judge observes

Justice Mohammad Ali Mazhar, a member of the SC bench, in a judgment he wrote, observed the main disagreement or source of discord between the parties was whether petitioner Tayyeba Ambareen was entitled to claim a decree for dissolution of marriage on the ground of cruelty and whether the appellate forum rightly converted the dissolution of marriage on the ground of cruelty to dissolution by way of khula.
The SC noted that the family court unequivocally articulated that the petitioner discharged the burden of proving cruelty on part of the husband by quoting many incidents while her evidence was not shattered during her cross-examination and thus the family court rightly dissolved the marriage on account of cruelty after a thorough examination and consideration of evidence.
Justice Mazhar observed that the appellate court could modify or set aside the judgment of the family court if it was found contrary to the evidence since the purpose of appellate jurisdiction was to reappraise whether the lower court committed any error. Likewise, he noted, the high court affirmed the findings of the appellate court without realizing that the allegations of maltreatment and cruelty had been satisfactorily proved by the petitioner during the trial.
The matrimonial bond between a man and woman is a pious relationship that plays an important part and also nurtures between the husband and wife happiness and compassion, the lineage and family heredity also depends on it, Justice Mazhar observed, adding the connubial affairs are based on gentle, human and emotional affiliation which requires mutual trust, regard, respect, love and affection and the relationship should also be in accordance with social norms.
As Islam ordains husbands to provide food, clothing, accommodation and all other necessities of life to the best of his capability and capacity, a man is expected to treat his wife nicely, with love and affection, Justice Mazhar observed. A conduct or behaviour that inflicts upon the wife mental pain and anguish makes it impossible for her to continue matrimonial relationship, the verdict explained.
Justice Mazhar recalled how the family court decision depicted different acts which caused mental anguish and torture to the wife, as only a week after their marriage, the husband started pressurising his wife to arrange money to get a house on rent. The husband and his family members also levelled false accusations at her, alleging that his daughter was not their child, with the result that the petitioner suffered severe mental agony, the court noted.
While she was in the family way, the man left her instead of supporting his wife, the court observed. He did not turn up at the crucial time; neither did he pay any maintenance allowance nor delivery expenses, it was recalled.
Also, the husband and his family members imposed a harsh condition on her that she should deposit her salary into a joint account with her husband and seek his permission for personal use.
Despite filing the family suit, the husband’s behaviour did not change rather he caused more mental anguish and started levelling false accusations, imposing condition that the amount for the house purchased by the wife be reimbursed by her father to the husband.
But the apex court noted that the appellate court, instead of considering the evidence reached a conclusion without any reason that no solid piece of evidence was brought to show physical torture or mental agony and held the allegation was exaggerated, adding that the “acts of cruelty were common” in nature and were “found in every family”.
On the basis of the observations, the Supreme Court set aside the judgments of the high court and the appellate court and restored the decree passed by the family court.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,SBP slashes GDP growth forecast to below 3-4pc,"Cuts FY23 outlook after considering flood-induced destruction, policy focus on stabilisation.","KARACHI: The central bank has lowered its projected GDP growth from the previously announced range of 3-4 per cent for the current fiscal year, citing flood-induced destruction and the stabilisation policy as major factors in its flagship economic health report released on Wednesday.
However, in its Annual Report on the State of Pakistan’s Economy, which mostly discussed the previous financial year that ended on June 30, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said economic growth was stronger than expected in the 2021-22 fiscal year as real GDP increased by 6pc compared to 5.7pc a year ago.
The primary drivers of this growth were a broad-based expansion in large-scale manufacturing (LSM) and improved agricultural output, the report said.
“A combination of adverse global and domestic developments led to the re-emergence of macroeconomic imbalances during FY22,” it said.

Cuts FY23 outlook after considering flood-induced destruction, policy focus on stabilisation

The SBP said that the economy was already in a stabilisation phase when widespread flooding hit a large part of the country at the start of the current fiscal year.
It said the flooding was likely to impinge on the country’s real economic activity through various channels, fearing that losses in agriculture emerging from the damages to crops and livestock were likely to transmit to the rest of the economy through various backward and forward linkages.
 
 

The large-scale destruction of infrastructure in the affected provinces might also undermine the country’s growth prospects during the year, the bank said.
The SBP avoided providing any range for the growth rate of the current financial year apparently due to the worsening economic situation. Industries have either shut down or drastically cut their production due to high inflation and the unavailability of gas and electricity.
One major reason is the cork put by the SBP on the opening of letters of credit (LCs) for imports in an attempt to save dollars.
The All-Pakistan Textile Mills Association has threatened to announce lay-offs within days if the gas supply is not restored and LCs are not opened.
The textile industry claims that up to 500,000 people, who were associated with the sector directly or indirectly, have lost their jobs. No official data is available in this regard.
International credit rating agencies have slashed the credit rating of Pakistan and predicted an economic growth rate of around 2pc for the current fiscal year.
The SBP report said that several corrective and other measures were likely to slow the momentum of economic activity during FY23, including a hike of 675 basis points in the policy rate, demand management measures announced in the previous fiscal year, and the government’s decision to unwind the fiscal package for fuel and electricity subsidies towards the end of FY22.
The report noted that the expansionary fiscal stance in FY22, an upsurge in global commodity prices, and the fallout of the Russia-Ukraine conflict led to a marked deterioration in the current account deficit.
 
 

In addition, the delay in the resumption of the IMF loan programme and political instability exacerbated the country’s vulnerability through the depletion of foreign exchange reserves.
The resulting rupee depreciation “amplified inflationary pressures by magnifying the effect of global price increase”, the SBP report said.
It said the experience from FY22 brought to the fore once again the need to address the country’s structural weaknesses, such as a narrow base of foreign exchange earnings and meagre inflows of foreign investment.
“A concerted approach is required to encourage increased localisation of the manufacturing base, along with the lowering of energy intensity of the economy by ensuring energy efficiency and conservation,” the report said.
Moreover, amid the growing issues related to climate change and inadequate food security situation, there is an urgent need to formulate a well-thought-out strategy to meet these challenges, it said.
It stressed that priority should be given to producing new varieties of seeds that are suitable to varying weather conditions and to devise a framework that emphasises water management strategies to increase agricultural productivity.
“The losses to agriculture produce induced by the recent floods is likely to step up the import of agriculture commodities, particularly cotton,” the report said.
It said the government has targeted to reduce the fiscal deficit to 4.9pc of GDP in FY23 from 7.9pc in FY22. “This outcome would be achieved through both revenue and expenditure measures,” it said.
In fact, the fiscal deficit exceeded in the first quarter of FY23, annoying the IMF, which demanded more measures to reduce the gap.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,PM promises Rs5bn to reconstruct flood-hit homes,Govt launches ‘4RF’ comprehensive plan for rehabilitation of millions of survivors.,"SUKKUR/ISLAMABAD: As he assured Sindh that the federal government would not leave flood survivors in a lurch, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the Centre would spend at least Rs5 billion to construct houses for flood victims in the province.
After his visit to rain-hit areas in Khairpur on Wednesday, the prime minister said that Rs4.80 billion had been donated to the prime minister’s account for flood survivors and added that more funds were expected to be donated.
According to PM Sharif, the rehabilitation process was already underway across the country, but there were still several areas in Khairpur and Dadu which were underwater. 
He added that the government would move towards reconstruction and rehabilitation works, but at present, at least eight million families were rain-affected. 
He elaborated that at least 20m people, including nine million children, were waiting for the government to help them.

Govt launches ‘4RF’ comprehensive plan for rehabilitation of millions of survivors

Drainage plan
He said that the government would build houses for the affected people and added that the chief minister would provide plots for the construction and the same process would be followed in other provinces as well.
“A donors conference is going to be held in Geneva next month,” said PM Sharif and added that he would go to the moot fully prepared to present Pakistan’s case for aid in light of massive destruction due to floods. The PM also announced the establishment of a campus of COMSATS University in Khairpur.
Speaking at the residence of PPP leader Manzoor Wassan in Khairpur, Shehbaz Sharif said that his government would “positively consider” the master plan for drainage on the left bank of the River Indus proposed by a foreign consultant, Louis Berger.
Mr Sharif said that the scale of the disaster was massive so Pakistan would require plenty of resources to tackle this challenge.
During the visit, the premier was also briefed by Chief Engineer Development Region-I Mansoor Memon in Pir Gaddo, Kot Diji about inundated areas in the province.
The chief engineer said that out of 3.3m acres of area, 2m acres were inundated on the right bank and 1.3m acres on the left bank of the Indus till Aug 31.
In Khairpur, 141,000 acres of land was submerged till Aug 31 but now only 7,800 acres of land needed to be dewatered, Mr Memon informed. He maintained that field drains on an area of 200 square kms were created to drain rainwater.
According to the chief engineer, Khairpur was a victim of a “poor drainage network” and the only drainage system that existed in the area pertained to salinity control and water-logging issue. He informed when the Sukkur barrage was built, the flow of natural watercourses in the area was obstructed. 
“Even this area where we are standing is an old waterway,” Mr Memon said while showing the site on a satellite image.
He said that floodwater from the mountainous range stretching over 75,000 sq kms in Balochistan reached Qambar Shahdadkot and Dadu districts in recent floods and 600,000 acres and 400,000 acres of the area was inundated respectively in Qambar and Dadu districts. This meant that out of 2m acres, 50pc of the area was affected in these two districts, he added.
Speaking about the Berger plan regarding drainage, the engineer urged that the scheme was of paramount importance for left bank areas. CM Murad agreed. The Sindh CM said the provincial government wanted to use funds deposited with the apex court in the Bahria Town case for the execution of this scheme.
‘4RF plan’
Separately, the government launched a comprehensive plan prepared by the planning and development division for the rehabilitation of flood victims. 
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, Prime Minister Shehbaz launched the ‘Resilient, Recovery, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Framework’ (4RF) which envisaged short, medium, and long-term strategies to rehabilitate the survivors.
A copy of the 4RF report was presented to the prime minister by Ahsan Iqbal, Minister for Planning Development and Special Initiatives (MoPD&SI) during a meeting. 
Mr Iqbal apprised the prime minister that the document was based on the loss and damage estimated in the post-disaster needs assessment report, which was launched in October this year.
PM Sharif directed that necessary efforts must be made for the effective pitching of this framework in the upcoming donors’ conference, scheduled to be held on January 9, 2023, in Geneva, Switzerland.
He directed that the planning ministry in coordination with the foreign ministry, climate change ministry, and economic affairs division may take necessary steps for the effective dissemination of the document to all the stakeholders at home and abroad.

2023-05-20,2022-12-22,Over 100 Rohingya stranded in boat off India’s coast,MUMBAI: At least 100 ethnic Rohingya are stranded in a boat off India’s Andaman Islands and as many as 16-20 may...,"MUMBAI: At least 100 ethnic Rohingya are stranded in a boat off India’s Andaman Islands and as many as 16-20 may have have died of thirst, hunger or drowned, said two Myanmar Rohingya activist groups.
Each year many Rohingya, members of a Muslim minority, risk their lives boarding rickety vessels to escape violence in Myanmar and squalor in Bangladesh refugee camps. Many attempt to reach Malaysia.
The stranded boat was approached by five Indian ships late on Tuesday, a source said.
A spokesperson for the Indian Navy said he did not have any details to share. A spokesperson for the Coast Guard did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters.
“We estimate that probably as many as 20 have died some from hunger and thirst, and others jumped overboard in desperation. This is absolutely awful and outrageous,” said Chris Lewa, director of the Arakan Project which works to support Myanmar’s Rohingyas.
Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Networks Rohingya Working Group said the group had been adrift for more than two weeks.
“We heard late last night that there were some Indian vessels approaching the boat so we are awaiting updates now, said Lilianne Fan, chair of Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Networks Rohingya Working Group.
“We hope that the Indian Navy or Coastguard will manage to rescue and disembark the boat as soon as possible. These people have been adrift on a damaged boat for more than 2 weeks without food and water. We have heard that up to 16 people may have already died.”  Another boat, carrying more than a hundred Rohingya was rescued by Sri Lanka’s navy on the weekend.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Nepal court orders release of serial killer Charles Sobhraj,"“Keeping him in the prison continuously is not in line with the prisoner’s human rights,” says court.","KATHMANDU: Nepal’s top court ordered on Wednesday the release and deportation of Charles Sobhraj, the French serial killer portrayed in the Netflix series  “The Serpent” who was responsible for a string of murders across Asia in the 1970s.
The Supreme Court ruled Sobhraj, 78, who has been in prison in the Himalayan republic since 2003 for murdering two North American tourists, should be freed on health grounds.
“Keeping him in the prison continuously is not in line with the prisoner’s human rights,” read a copy of the verdict.
“If there is not any other pending cases against him to keep him in the prison, this court orders his release by today and... the return to his country within 15 days.” Sobhraj needed open heart surgery and his release was in keeping with the law allowing the compassionate discharge of bedridden prisoners who had already served three-quarters of their sentence, the verdict added.
The notorious murderer underwent a five-hour cardiac operation in 2017 and the verdict said he remained in regular treatment for heart disease. Sobhraj will likely be freed from Kathmandu’s Central Jail on Thursday, an official at the prison said.
He will first have to appear in a lower court for administrative formalities before he can walk free, the official added.
Backpacker murders 
After a troubled childhood and several prison terms in France for petty crimes, Sobhraj began travelling the world in the early 1970s and wound up in the Thai capital Bangkok.
His modus operandi was to charm and befriend his victims — many of them starry-eyed Western backpackers on a quest for spirituality — before drugging, robbing and murdering them.
Suave and sophisticated, he was implicated in his first murder, that of a young American woman whose body was found on a beach in Pattaya wearing a bikini, in 1975. He was eventually linked to more than 20 killings.
His victims were strangled, beaten or burned, and he often used the passports of his male victims to travel to his next destination.
Sobhraj’s sobriquet,  “The Serpent”, came from his ability to assume other identities in order to evade justice. It became the title of a hit series made by the BBC and Netflix that was based on his life.
He was arrested in India in 1976 and ultimately spent 21 years in jail there, with a brief break in 1986 when he escaped and was caught again in the Indian coastal state of Goa.
Released in 1997, Sobhraj retired to Paris but resurfaced in 2003 in Nepal, where he was spotted in Kathmandu’s tourist district and arrested.
A court there handed him a life sentence the following year for killing US tourist Connie Jo Bronzich in 1975. A decade later he was also found guilty of killing Bronzich’s Canadian companion. In prison in 2008, Sobhraj married Nihita Biswas, who is 44 years his junior and the daughter of his Nepalese lawyer.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Ambulance workers walk out in strike-hit UK,Employees across the UK economy demand salary rises to match or beat decades-high inflation.,"LONDON: Striking ambulance workers in England and Wales manned picket lines on Wednesday, escalating a pay dispute between the government and a host of public-sector staff.
A series of stoppages are causing misery across Britain in the run-up to Christmas, with railway workers and passport control officers set to hinder festive holiday getaways as the government resists the growing pay demands.
Employees across the UK economy are demanding salary rises to match or beat decades-high inflation — currently running at nearly 11 percent — which is spurring the worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation.
“We’re not paid enough for what we deserve,” 24-year-old paramedic Kirsten Reid said in Crawley, southern England.  “Secondly, patient safety is a huge thing... our response times are shocking, and they need to be better.”  “We do 12-hour shifts with a 30-minute break, but they’re rarely ever 12-hour shifts. We’re usually overrun,” she added.
The government and unions continue to trade blame over the strikes amid fears of possible loss of life, as healthcare leaders warned about straining a system already in crisis.
On Tuesday, thousands of members of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) in England, Wales and Northern Ireland took to picket lines, five days after their first strike in its 106-year history.
Health Secretary Steve Barclay, writing in the Daily Telegraph newspaper, accused the unions of making a  “conscious decision” to  “inflict harm” on patients. GMB union national secretary, Rachel Harrison, hit back calling his comments  “insulting”.
“Ambulance workers are seething at such a crude, insulting attempt to divert attention from the government’s continued chaos in the NHS,” she said.
Around a dozen staff formed the picket line outside the ambulance base in Crawley.
“My members are striking today for fair pay. At the end of the day, they’ve had a 20 percent pay cut over the last 10 years, and they can no longer afford to keep going with that,” GMB union representative Lib Whitfield said.
Outside the West Midlands Ambulance Services’ hub in Longford in central England, striking staff stood behind a banner reading  “our NHS is under siege”.
As passing ambulances sounded their horns in support, union representative Steve Thompson called on the government to  “wake up and realise that this situation is serious”.

2022-12-22,2022-12-22,Govt calls emergency NA session today to approve controversial LG law,PML-N candidate seeks delay in polls; PTI leader files contempt petition against PM for changes in law.,"ISLAMABAD: The government has summoned an emergency session of the National Assembly on Thursday (today) to get Islamabad’s local government amendment bill passed, with an aim to increase the number of union councils and seek direct election for the post of mayor.
The session has been convened by President Dr Arif Alvi at a time when political parties are already busy campaigning for the local government polls scheduled for Dec 31.
In a related development, a ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) candidate and a senior member of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) filed separate petitions before the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on the issue with the former seeking postponement of the polls and the latter desiring initiation of contempt proceedings against Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his “cabinet” for making changes in the law which could cause a delay in the elections.
The National Assembly Secretariat on Wednesday issued a 10-point agenda which shows the Islamabad Capital Territory Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2022 standing in the name of Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah Khan.

PML-N candidate seeks delay in polls; PTI leader files contempt petition against PM for changes in law

The minister will also present a motion seeking to suspend the rules of the assembly to enable the members to pass the bill on the same day without referring it to the concerned committee and following the parliamentary procedure.
After passage of the bill from the lower house of the parliament, it will also have to be passed by the Senate before getting the president’s ceremonial assent.
It may be recalled that the National Assembly had been prorogued by the president only on Tuesday after passing the Foreign Investment (Promotion and Protection) Bill in a similar fashion and after suspending the rules. 
The federal cabinet has already approved the amendments to the law through a circular on Dec 19 after which the interior ministry issued a letter increasing the number of seats from 101 to 125. 
Moreover, the federal cabinet has also approved a summary for direct election of Islamabad’s mayor and for this necessary amendment, the bill is being tabled before the National Assembly.
Despite these developments, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), however, refused to defer the LG elections and vowed to conduct it in accordance with the already announced schedule.
Since the PML-N and PTI have brought this matter before the IHC, the fate of LG elections now depends upon the judicial verdict.
In the petition, PML-N candidate from Tarlai Union Council Shahzad Aurangzeb defended the government’s decision of increasing the number of UCs.
The petition stated that Islamabad districtfor the most part has been administered without a local government comprising elected representatives of the people until the passing of the 18th Amendment in the Constitution on April 19, 2010.
It said the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) Local Government Act 2015 in sections 5 & 6 of the Act, empowered the federal government to declare any area as union council and to divide an existing area of one union council into two and to notify the number of union councils in Islamabad, adding that the federal government had recently increased the number of union councils to 125.
The petitioner pointed out anomalies in the voters’ lists of different areas and said “in such conditions any election that is held would be disputed and cannot be declared as a free and fair election”.
It requested the court to set aside the ECP’s decision of conducting elections in 101 UCs.
On the other hand, PTI leader Ali Nawaz Awan asserted in the petition that the ECP in the light of the judgements of the superior courts announced schedule for local government elections in 101 UCs to be held on Dec 31.
“However, the federal government with utmost mala fide, has yet again in its bid to frustrate the process has done exactly what had been apprehended,” the petition said, adding that the act of federal government of increasing the number of UCs is a “clear attempt at frustrating the process and holding of elections, which is clear cut violation of the judgement of this court”.
According to the petition, the federal government was “well aware” of court’s directions, “however, the action of yet again increasing the number of UCs, merely 11 days prior to the elections…is a blatant disregard to the dictum laid down exhaustively by the court.”
The petition termed it a deliberate attempt to frustrate the judgement of the IHC.
Subsequently, it requested the court to initiate contempt of court proceeding against the prime minister and all the members of the federal cabinet.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Verdict reserved on appeal over Zahir’s sentence in Noor case,"The court asks lawyers to submit written arguments, if they want, within seven days.","ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday reserved verdict on a plea challenging the death sentence of Zahir Jaffer in Noor Mukadam murder case.
The two-member division bench comprising IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Sardar Ijaz Ishaq Khan reserved the verdict after the lawyers completed their arguments.
Jaffer’s lawyer, Usman Khosa, in his argument on the last day of hearing on Wednesday, said one of the reasons for giving the death sentence to his client could be to set an example that there was a lesson for others to not take such a step. 
He added that such a punishment was awarded to habitual criminals to create deterrence.
He said there was pressure on Pakistan at an international level to abolish the death penalty, adding that his client was an American citizen and a resident of New Jersey, where there was no concept of capital punishment. He urged the court to take this point into consideration.
Chief Justice Aamer Farooq remarked that abolishing the death penalty was a matter of legislation and only legislators could view this subject, however, he added that Pakistan was an independent country and it had its own law. 
The lawyer of the plaintiff, Shaukat Mukadam, said Jameel, Jaffer’s cook, worked during the day and had no role in the crime.
While the court inquired whether any drugs were recovered from the crime scene, Mr Mukadam’s lawyer Babar Hayat said no drug was recovered and the relevant report had been attached with the record.
The court also inquired about Noor’s handbag, which was not part of the record but it was visible in the CCTV footage.
Mr Hayat said only the prosecution could talk about the bag. After the two sides concluded their arguments, the bench reserved its judgement.
The court asked the lawyers to submit written arguments, if they wanted, within seven days.
The trial court in Islamabad had awarded death penalty to Jaffer in February 2022 for killing Noor Mukadam. Her body was found in Jaffer’s residence in F-7 on July 20, 2021.

ISLAMABAD: One of the top paediatricians of Pakistan, Dr Tabish Hazir, who served at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) for over three decades, breathed his last at the same hospital on Tuesday night, leaving his family, friends, and those whose children are in good health because of his efforts saddened.
His funeral prayers were offered at 4pm in B Block Model Town, Lahore, on Wednesday which were attended by a large number people including politicians, academics and medical practitioners. The deceased was later laid to rest in a local graveyard in Model Town.
Dr Hazir, 74, was the husband of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leader Dr Shireen Mazari and was suffering from colon cancer for the last two years. He had been under treatment at Pims.
Former Pims executive director Dr Ijaz Qadeer, while talking to Dawn, said Dr Hazir was a top paediatrician of Pakistan and his services for Pims would always be remembered.

Top paediatrician laid to rest in Lahore

He said the deceased established the paediatric department at the hospital and headed the neonatology department.
It is worth mentioning here that neonatology is a sub-specialty of paediatrics that focuses on medical care of newborns, especially those who are ill or premature.
“He believed in research and never stopped learning new fields while he was in the hospital. He was expert on issues related to reasons of death in newborn and also reasons of infection in children,” Dr Qadeer said.
Talking to Dawn, former vice chancellor of Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Medical University Prof Dr Javed Akram said he had frequent interaction with Dr Hazir as Pims was the affiliated hospital of the university.
“He was a thorough gentleman and professional. He was supportive of academics and was a supporter of the university. He was eager to do research, which is why I consider him as one of my best friends,” he said.
Dr Tabish Hazir’s sister Tamkinet Karim, while talking to Dawn, said her brother was born on May 31, 1958 in Lahore.
“He did his initial schooling in Sialkot and MBBS from Allama Iqbal Medical College, Lahore. He also did a number of courses and specialisation and joined Pims which he served till his retirement. He was under treatment at Pims at the time of his death. We shifted the body on Wednesday morning to his house in Islamabad and then to Lahore,” she said.
Ms Karim said the deceased had worked in collaboration with the World Health Organisation and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for the welfare of the children of Pakistan.
She said Dr Tabish Hazir and Dr Shireen Mazari separated 12 years ago but it was not correct that the couple had divorce.
“The deceased has a daughter Imaan Mazari-Hazir and a son Sabeel Mazari-Hazir,” she said.
Tamkinet Karim said Dr Hazir was the son of renowned poet Taufiq Rafat and wanted to be laid besides his father’s grave, which was why his body was shifted to Lahore.
She said Qul would be held on Thursday (today) in Model Town Lahore between 1pm to 3pm.

2023-12-18,2022-12-22,Work on widening of Soan River bridge restarts finally,RAWALPINDI: Work on widening the Soan River Bridge finally commenced earlier this week. The project is anticipated...,"RAWALPINDI: Work on widening the Soan River Bridge finally commenced earlier this week.
The project is anticipated to be completed by the end of Dec 2023.
The Soan River Bridge was two lanes wide on each side, but after work, it will have four lanes on each side.
According to an official from the National Highway Authority (NHA), widening of the bridge had been suspended in April 2022 after the contractor was black-listed and now a fresh contract had been awarded to Frontier Works Organisation (FWO).
The widening of the bridge across Soan River was started in 2017 and was scheduled to be completed by January 2022. However, the bridge will now be completed by the end of 2023.
Due to left-over construction material scattered on the bridge and its adjoining area, hundreds of commuters entering the city have been facing problems.
Motorists, while proceeding towards Rawalpindi from Rawat, face difficulty as safety walls of the bridge have been demolished by the previous contractor and left abandoned.
More than 62,000 vehicles cross Soan Bridge every day, where widening of the bridge began about five years ago and is yet to be completed.
The former chief of army staff had taken strict notice of the delay in the construction of Soan Bridge project and the poor workmanship and directed the authorities concerned to complete it without wasting time.
“I have never seen such sheer negligence in public welfare/important projects while living abroad,” said an expatriate who recently came to Pakistan to spend vacations with his family.

Students of Al-Huda International School took part in creating awareness about global warming by organising a science exhibition under the title ‘Earth Matters’. 
They displayed over 60 projects to highlight the issues of global warming, urging that an organic life style and natural method in work was the only solution to save the planet.
Topics like bio gas, water, solar energy, green grills, hydroponic planting, collection of garbage, floods and mitigation, importance of birds and so on were well covered by students through their projects. 
These topics were connected with Islam and its teachings and in all stalls, related verses of the Quran were also highlighted.
“Through this exhibition, we are trying to create awareness as environment is a serious issue the world is facing today,” said Fareha Wasim, a teacher.
A seventh grader said that everyone will have to play a role towards reducing the impact of fast changing climate. Another teacher Fouzia Umar said that besides taking care of the climate and human beings, there is also need to protect birds.
Students from montessori to senior grades constructed and displayed their projects. Each project was presented in a distinctive way and the uniqueness of the event was that each child participated and the projects were made from recycled and eco-friendly material.
The exhibition comprised of different sub themes such as ‘Green Vibes Only’, ‘Air Care’, ‘Slow the Flow’, ‘Master the Disaster’, ‘Waste Wise’ and ‘Now and Never’. 
The student’s project display and demonstration of projects was an effort towards provoking thoughts and leave the audience inspired. Students had captured the attention and focus of the audience and visitors throughout the day. 
The message from all students was clear and crisp that this was high time that we have to take care of our planet.
They emphasised that according to the Quran, environmental conservation is a religious duty as well as a social obligation and not an optional matter. The event was graced by dignitaries and educationists from the twin cities, journalists and the kinsfolk of the students. 
Different schools and university students also made an appearance and interacted with students. The programme was spread over two days and was split into three slots of morning and evening.

According to an FIR, police officials had detained a merchant from Peshawar and released him after receiving Rs1 million from his heirs.
Javaid Ahmad had come to Rawalpindi on Dec 6 with Rs300,000 to purchase some goods. He was sitting in a hotel when a man in police uniform came and started interrogating him. In the meanwhile, two persons also joined and snatched Rs300,000 from him.
Ammad Akbar, employer of Javaid Ahmed, said in his FIR registered with Pirwadhai police on Wednesday that the accused shifted the victim to an undisclosed location after covering his face. The victim was detained in a room where he was tortured by the kidnappers who demanded money from him. 
On Dec 8, the kidnappers forced him to talk to his family asking him to arrange Rs600,000 more for his release.
Rahimullah, a friend of the victim, brought the money to Rawalpindi. When Mr Rahim arrived in Pirwadhai, the kidnappers detained him as well and took the money. Later, they started demanding more money from Rahimullah following which Rs50,000 were transferred twice in the bank account of one of the accomplices of the police official.
“Yes, Javaid was tortured by the kidnapper,” Ammad Akbar told Dawn while quoting Javaid.
He said after his release, Javaid approached the CTO Rawalpindi who ordered an inquiry which led to the registration of an FIR on charges of kidnapping and robbery and led to the arrest of one of the policemen.
A police spokesman said following a complaint against the constable, an FIR was registered against him and his two friends. The constable was arrested while raids were underway to detain his two accomplices.

The potential is endless for the digital public goods to be rolled out on the basis of a good ID system, he added.
The Nadra chairman said: “A good ID system helps build a strong democratic system, especially in developing countries. The ethos of democracy in ‘One Person, One Vote’ is better delivered through a national ID system that facilitates in development of computerised electoral rolls with negligible margins of voter fraud and other fraudulent practices.”
It is pertinent to mention here that under South-South cooperation, Nadra was assisting the governments of Nigeria, Sudan, Kenya and Somalia with regard to development of identity management and civil registration system.
The Somalian interior minister lauded the efforts of the incumbent Nadra chairman, Tariq Malik and his team.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Call to ensure ease of business in pharma sector,ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PPMA) Chairman Arshad Mahmood on Wednesday said...,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PPMA) Chairman Arshad Mahmood on Wednesday said Pakistan would become Nigeria if ease of business was not ensured in the pharmaceutical sector, fearing that the country would be left with no choice but to import medicines worth $20 billion every year.
“The foreign exchange starved Pakistan should be eyeing on the export of pharmaceutical products which is an $1,800 billion industry. Even if we capture the market of Africa, which is an $86 billion market, we would be able to bridge the gap between imports and exports of the country. If ease of business would not be ensured, investments will be shifted from Pakistan to Bangladesh, China, Iran and other countries,” he said while speaking to participants at an international conference on pharma and healthcare.
Mr Mahmood said once Nigeria used to manufacture medicines but with the passage of time, it implemented conditions of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and increased taxes and now it was importing 100pc of its medicines.
“On Wednesday morning, I was shocked to see in a newspaper that the per unit cost of the pharma sector is going to be increased by Rs32 due to which, each unit of electricity will be Rs93. Currently, the per month bill of my factory goes over Rs4 million, out of which electricity charges remain around Rs1.8 million and the rest are all taxes,” he said, adding Pakistan can export medicines to a number of countries of Africa and some countries of Asia including Myanmar, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan.
“A number of companies have been manufacturing medicines for people of Pakistan but when they get orders to export medicines to other countries, the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap) refuses to issue them a letter of good manufacturing practices (GMP) and insists on carrying out another inspection of the factory. The letter is mandatory to export medicines,” Mr Mahmood said.
“It is unfortunate that Drap allows companies to sell medicines to people of Pakistan but does not allow exporting the same medicine to other countries. That is why our exports are worth $269 million. On the other hand, India has been exporting medicines worth of $24 billion per annum. The local industry has been providing medicines worth $5 billion to people of Pakistan and if manufacturing would be stopped due to high cost of production, Pakistan will have to import medicines worth of $20 billion because in that case, foreign countries/companies will provide medicines on their cost and conditions,” he said.
“We cannot compete with international/foreign companies by importing raw material. The business community has been thinking about shifting investments abroad because over here, policies are made without taking the stakeholders onboard. The government needs to take steps for industrialisation rather than depending on remittances of overseas Pakistanis,” he added.
During a panel discussion, member of the PPMA Central Executive Committee Usman Shaukat said it was time to enforce an export emergency in Pakistan to tackle the current economic crisis and pharmaceuticals can play a vital role in earning precious foreign exchange for Pakistan.
“A pharma export council needs to be set up immediately to enhance the exports of pharmaceuticals which has immense potential. The stakeholders such as Drap and Ministry of Commerce have already principally agreed to formulate the pharma export council and the industry requests the process to be expedited in order to facilitate exports,” he added.
It was high time that Pakistan pharmaceutical products reach developed markets such as the United States and Europe.
Drap Chief Executive Officer Dr Asim Rauf, who also attended the conference, said that all possible steps would be taken to facilitate the pharmaceutical sector and ensure increase in export of medicines from Pakistan.

2022-12-22,2022-12-22,CDA plans housing projects for expats to attract dollars,Auction of commercial plots also on the cards.,"ISLAMABAD: In a bid to attract foreign investment into the country, the federal government is looking towards the Capital Development Authority (CDA) to launch new housing schemes for expatriates to boost country’s dollar reserves.
The civic body has prepared a presentation which would likely be given to the prime minister on Thursday (today) in light of his directives pertaining to these housing projects.
Sources said the CDA was planning to develop Gandhara Enclave – a housing project which falls in Zone I and partially in Zone III – and the Kuri housing scheme. Similarly, the civic body will also brief the government about the revenue potential from the under-construction Nilor Heights housing project.
CDA Chairman Mohammad Usman and his team will give a presentation on the schemes, sources said, adding that the auction of some commercial plots will also come under discussion. They said both schemes have the potential to generate billions of rupees in revenue.

Auction of commercial plots also on the cards

In its briefing, the CDA would also inform the federal government that if it wanted to develop Gandhara Enclave on more than 5,000 kanals, then the civic body would need to acquire more land falling in Zone III. Under the current zoning regulations, construction in Zone III is not allowed. However, the CDA is reportedly working on amending these regulations.
Similarly, the sources said in the first phase, the Kuri housing scheme could be developed on 10,000 kanals. They said it would be one of the largest schemes if everything went as per the plan. Sources said the Kuri scheme could turn out to be a “complicated matter because of chronic and unsettled issues with the locals” also known as affected persons.
The CDA had acquired the land decades ago but after announcing the award, no serious step was taken for the development of the Kuri model village. The civic body officials said thousands of housing units could be constructed as part of this scheme.
The officials said after paying compensation and built-up property claims, the civic agency would have around 2,000 acres of land worth billions of rupees. However, the civic agency never made any serious effort to settle issues with locals to get land’s possession. The officials said an initial survey had shown 1,100 occupants on the said land, but in 2011 the number had risen to 7,000.
At that time, the CDA officials in connivance with locals added many bogus cases to the list of land ownership claims. Later, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) probed the matter and cleared 3,422 ownership cases.
The CDA officials said the civic agency had acquired the land in 1968 while the built-up-property award was announced in 1971. But the CDA failed to take possession of the land after removing the objections raised by locals. In 2009, the civic agency announced a revised built-up property award, but due to allegations of bogus claims, it could not resolve the issue.
“Since the federal government has been supporting CDA, we will deliver and will launch at least two housing schemes, with a focus on apartments,” a CDA official said. He added that the plots would be sold to developers and investors who will be asked to build apartments.

Health Services Academy (HSA) Vice Chancellor Prof Shahzad Ali Khan said majority of the Pakistani population is either depressed, experiencing stress or anxiety and are not very optimistic about the country’s future.
He was addressing the launch of the 24th Thematic Calendar by Jahan-i-Maseeha Adbi Forum (JMAF). The theme of the 2023 calendar is, under these circumstances, Allama Iqbal’s message of ‘Khudi’.
Prof Khan said that hopelessness and despair has spread among the youth and under these circumstances, Iqbal’s message of self-hood can lift the spirits of the Pakistani nation again.
He added that the Pakistani youth now consider everybody as corrupt and incompetent, adding that majority of youngsters are desperate to leave the country although the entire world is facing similar issues and problems like inflation, joblessness and recession.
“Initially, teachers and academia of our society was targeted and they were defamed, later, character assassination of physicians and healthcare professionals was carried out and the same treatment was met out to politicians,” Prof Khan said, adding that things were not as bad as they were being portrayed.
He lauded the philosophy of Iqbal, adding that he was able to turn youngsters from a minority group in the Indian subcontinent into a united force by teaching them lessons of optimism, enthusiasm and encouragement.
The event was organised in collaboration with pharmaceutical firm Pharmevo that has been promoting Iqbal’s philosophy among healthcare professionals throughout the country.
Syed Jamshaid Ahmed of Pharmevo stressed on establishing and creating a healthier society in Pakistan and said that for a healthier society, not just medicines but promotion of literary activities was essential like holding book fairs, mushairas and so on.
Renowned poet Ajmal Siraj said an advisory committee comprising educationists, writers and scholars selected life and literary works of Iqbal as the theme for the next year’s calendar.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Setback for MQM-P as ECP wants order to appoint administrators withdrawn,"PTI's Ali Zaidi claims the appointment of such officers around 20 days before LG polls is ""blatant pre-poll rigging"".","KARACHI: The Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan may suffer a setback as the Election Commission of Pakistan on Wednesday asked the Sindh government to reverse the appointment of three government officers, said to be party loyalists, as administrators of Hyderabad and Karachi’s East and Korangi districts.
On Dec 19, the provincial government had appointed Muhammad Farooque, Syed Shakeel Ahmed and Muhammad Sharif as the administrators of Hyderabad Municipal Corporation and district municipal corporations of Korangi and East districts in line with an agreement between the Pakistan Peoples Party and MQM-P.
Prior to their appointment, Mr Farooque and Mr Ahmed had been working as administrator of Worker Model School, SITE Hyderabad, and Korangi, respectively. Mr Sharif had earlier been working as director-charged parking at the DMC-Central.
However, their appointment is criticised by opposition parties, which termed it a pre-poll rigging attempt as local government elections in Karachi and Hyderabad divisions were scheduled to be held on Jan 15.
On Wednesday, the office of the provincial election commissioner in a letter addressed to the local government secretary said that ECP, through a notification issued on June 10, had imposed a ban on transfer/ posting during the conduct of local government elections.
It directed the local government secretary to either withdraw the order or kept it in abeyance till the culmination of the second phase of the local government elections in Karachi and Hyderabad divisions.
The letter reminded the government of an earlier ECP notification that states: “For Divisions in respect of which Election schedule of Local Government Elections has been issued no transfer / posting of the Government Officers and Officials including those of autonomous bodies/ Authorities shall be made without prior approval of the Commission till the publication of Election Results”.
Meanwhile, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leader Ali Zaidi said in a tweet that the ECP ordered withdrawal of the notification appointing administrators.

 





 
Earlier in the day, he told a press conference that his party had written a letter to the chief secretary and informed him that the newly-appointed administrators were affiliated with the MQM-P.
He said that the appointment of such officers as administrators around 20 days before the LG polls was blatant pre-poll rigging.
Also, the Sindh United Party (SUP) raised concerns over the appointment of administrators and Hyderabad commissioner before the LG polls.
SUP chairman and convener of the Sindh Action Committee Syed Jalal Mehmood Shah demanded that the ECP declare null and void the appointment orders of the new administrator and Hyderabad commissioner.

KARACHI: While police claimed to have killed two alleged robbers in Korangi in an encounter, in which two policemen also suffered bullet wounds, muggers’ criminal streak in the city continued with assaults, taking lives of a young man and a policeman in the same area on Wednesday.  
The SHO of Bin Qasim police station was also shot at and wounded by armed muggers in Gulshan-i-Maymar.  
In the first incident, the police said that Qayyum Umer, 24, was gunned down by robbers when he put up resistance near Ghousia Masjid in Korangi-3.  
Korangi-SSP Sajid Amir Sadozai said armed motorcyclists were looting his cousin at some distance. Qayyum was standing outside his home and saw the robbers looting his cousin. As he yelled at the robbers, the robbers opened fire on him and fled. He died on the spot.
The body was taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre to fulfil medico-legal formalities.  
Police Surgeon Summaiya Syed said that the victim sustained a gunshot injury to chest and arm. His family members did not allow doctors to complete medico-legal formalities and took away the body, she added.  
The relatives told media that the victim was an orphaned child who sold vegetables in the area to earn his living. Hailing from Mansehra, he also played football at a local club in Korangi.  
Later, police intensified patrol and snap-checking in the area in search of the killers.  
DIG-East Muqaddas Haider told Dawn that two policemen of ‘Shaheen Force’ indicated two suspects to stop in Zaman Town. However, the suspects opened fire on them and an exchange of gunfire took place in which Head Constable Manzoor Ahmed, 38, was killed and the suspects managed to speed away.
However, after an interval of around 30 minutes, the Korangi Industrial Area police spotted two suspects and another encounter ensued in Mehran Town.  
After an exchange of gunfire, two alleged robbers were shot dead while two policemen, Khan Razik and Sajid, were wounded.
The DIG East said that one of the injured policemen had identified both the deceased as the same criminals who had killed the head constable during the earlier encounter.  
He said they were also probing the possibility as to whether the same suspects had gunned down Qayyum over resistance as these three incidents took place in the same vicinity of Korangi. 
The deceased suspects’ involvement in the three incidents would be verified with witnesses’ accounts and matching of spent bullet casings found from the crime scenes, the officials added.  
SHO, friend wounded by robbers 
The Bin Qasim SHO and his friend were shot at and wounded by robbers off Superhighway on Wednesday.  
The SITE-Superhighway Industrial Area (SSIA) police said that SHO Irdees Bangash and citizen Asif Ibrahim, 36, got injured in the firing at an estate agency in Ahsanabad.  
East-SSP Syed Abdul Rahim Shirazi said that the SHO had gone there for some personal work. He was sitting with his friends when armed muggers arrived and attempted to snatch cash and other valuables from them.  
The SHO overpowered one suspect, but his accomplice opened fire resulting in bullet injuries to the police officer and his friend.  
One suspect, later identified as Nadeem, was also wounded by the firing of the SHO and arrested by a police patrol that reached the scene after hearing gunshots.
The SHO was taken to the Aga Khan University Hospital. SSP Shirazi said he suffered a bullet wound near the abdomen.
Bangash had served as SHO of the SITE-Superhighway Industrial Area police station and was recently transferred to the Bin Qasim police station.

The officer stated this in a report submitted in compliance with the bench’s directive to verify employees lists and find out if there were any ghost employees in the departments of education, health and police. 
The division bench, comprising Justices Shamsuddin Abbasi and Amajad Ali Sahito, had issued the directives while hearing a petition filed by advocate Mumtaz Ali Jesar. 
The director general of the Sindh monitoring and evaluation cell was directed to appear in person and file a detailed report regarding procuring the attendance of teachers and the process of issuance of form-II to stop the salaries of the absentees. 
But he was called absent while the deputy director of the cell said he had received the direction in late hours; therefore, the DG did not turn up. At this juncture, the director of school education said the DG was in contact with them.
The bench observed: “We [bench] are noticing this act of the DG with dismay, as he is deliberately avoiding appearing before this court and warn him to remain careful in future.” 
The medical superintendent of Chandka Medical College Hospital said he had issued a letter to the Larkana DAO for blocking the IDs’ of the ghost employees. 
“We have also noted with dismay that the secretary education, Sindh IGP and health department secretary, who were asked to upload the lists of their employees with names, parentage and CNICs on their official website but still compliance had not been made by them,” the two judges bench observed. “Once again we are directing them to upload the list of the employees and furnish report within a month’s time,” it added.
The court found the replies of the show-cause notices issued to the project director (PD) and registrar of Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Medical University (SMBBMU), for not appearing in hearing on Dec 14, satisfactory and vacated the notices, directing them to remain careful in future. 
The PD in his report said that the Higher Education Commission (HEC) and Sindh government were approached for a grant-in-aid of Rs1,820.124 million to complete their (varsity) projects, but they did not receive any response yet. 
The bench directed the HEC and Sindh government to provide required funds to the university for completion of their projects. 
Larkana Additional Deputy Commissioner-I Ms Rabia Siyal appeared on behalf of the deputy commissioner and submitted that technical assistance from the planning and development department was required to finalise the PC-I for the construction of a sewerage scheme for Larkana. 
The case was adjourned for Dec 28.

The commission’s member judicial-I retired Justice Arshad Noor Khan said at a press conference held at Darbar hall here the other day that it was regrettable that despite passage of five months to heavy rainfall, rainwater had still not receded from talukas of Sindhri, Jhuddo, Digri, Kot Ghulam Mohammad etc.
He said that similar flood situation might recur over succeeding years due to climate change. “We should therefore adopt a procedure to save population from big disaster in future and in this connection the district administration should perform its duties towards people with honesty and sincerity,” he said.
He said that even if they succeeded to persuade 50 per cent people they could save a large population from disaster. “We have discussed problems of masses particularly flood victims,” he said.
He urged the commission officers to go into the field to listen to grievances of masses and flood victims and resolve their problems by taking drastic measures within available resources.
Later, he held an open kachehry where social workers and villagers alleged that relief goods, ration, tents and food were distributed on the directives of political personalities and elected representatives while genuine victims, who were still living in makeshift huts along roads under open sky, were deprived of all government help.
They deplored that officers concerned of the district administration did not visit many flood hit areas to assess damage from the disaster and meet flood victim families. Most school buildings had suffered damage after flood and heavy rainfall, he said.
They claimed that blankets meant for flood victims were supplied to bungalows of feudal lords and were not distributed among flood victims.
They said that saline water was being drained with heavy pumping machines into West Jamrao canal, which was causing different diseases among masses.
They objected to a survey of damage to houses and crops carried out under supervision of army and revenue officials.
They accused deputy commissioner and other officers concerned of obeying orders of local ruling party MNAs and demanded authorities launch rehabilitation work and distribute wheat seed among victims without any discrimination.
They demanded the government immediately remove illegal encroachments from all waterways.
The kachehry was also attended by Mirpurkhas deputy commissioner Zainul Abideen Memon, SSP Asad Chaudhry, Zaheer Hussain and the commission member Noor Ahmad Narejo.

They were addressing a seminar on the “Strategic and Economic Dimensions of Pakistan and China Relations Amid Deepening Global Geopolitical Divide” at Sindh University on Wednesday. 
SU Thatta campus Pro-Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Rafique Ahmed Memon in his presidential address said that there were vast opportunities for cooperation in the field of higher education and research in China. 
He said that Chinese varsities could admit a large number of Pakistani students. Chinese educational institutions should register themselves with Pakistan accreditation bodies to resolve problems faced by Pakistani students on their return after obtaining higher degrees from various Chinese varsities. 
Pakistan Ambassador to China Moinul Haque said China’s production of Al-Khalid tanks and GF-17 Thunder fighter jets with Pakistan was actually a great proof of extraordinary defense cooperation between the two countries. 
He said that a cynical propaganda was being spread that the CPEC project would push Pakistan deeper into the debt mire, but it was not the case at all. 
Mr Haque said that it was important to open the CPEC project to public so that no propaganda could affect the friendship between the two countries. 
The two countries would soon start working on an important project to prepare submarines for Pakistan Navy and China would ensure access of Pakistani engineers to its manufacturing plant. 
He announced that the SU would be provided with opportunities to enter into educational agreements with top varsities of China so that it could advance in the field of higher education and research being an old varsity of Pakistan. 
Centre for International Strategic Studies Sindh (CSSS) Executive Director and former ambassador Kazi M. Khalilullah said: “Pakistan has a successful foreign policy, which we have to trust,” he said. Both countries had supported each other in testing times while in terms of defense, China had always helped Pakistan to stand on its own feet, he added. 
Former Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) chairman Dr Ansar Pervez said that Pakistan initially bought a nuclear power plant from Canada, but due to Canada’s coldness, the project could not go ahead and then China started the same project and it assisted Pakistan. 
He said that 325 megawatt nuclear power plant provided by China was successfully operationalized, adding that China’s cooperation was continuing to meet energy needs of Pakistan. 
Federal Minister Ahsan Iqbal, Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed and others also made speeches online.

This civilisation is far ahead of all explored civilisations of the world.  
These views have been expressed by German research scholar Ms. Karola Schmidt, who is doing her doctorate-level research on Corpus English in collaboration with the University of Sahiwal.
It is learnt Ms. Schmidt collected research data on Corpus English during her stay. Talking to Dawn, Ms. Schmidt says she is specifically interested in the status of spoken English in Pakistan and “I am here to collect the primary data for my doctorate research.”  
Ms. Schmidt says she is engaged in an academic pursuit to examine the manner in which the English language is utilised in society within Pakistan.
“For the last two weeks as part of my dissertation work, I obtained primary data from university students, faculty members and public officials,” she says.  
Ms. Schmidt has conducted a couple of seminars and workshops at the universities of Okara and Sahiwal. She has made an appearance at 1st PAK TOSEL conference hosted by the University of Okara.

2022-12-22,2022-12-22,Irregularities in Daska by-poll: LHC sets aside ECP action against election officials,"Court says after poll, duty staff no longer remains within ECP purview.","LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has set aside the proceedings against more than a dozen officials of the provincial departments initiated by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for their role in the alleged rigging committed in the 2021 by-poll of NA-75, Daska.  
“Despite repeated queries, learned counsel for the commission has not been able to convince this court that as to what is cavil with the commission to refer the matters of the petitioners for disciplinary action against them by their parent departments, especially, when they do not fall within the definition of election officials,” Justice Shujaat Ali Khan observed in his verdict allowing the writ petitions filed by Asif Hussain and 20 other officials.  
The petitioners challenged the show-cause notices and the subsequent proceedings against them by the ECP.
Senior lawyer Hafiz Tariq Naseem mainly represented the petitioners while other counsels adopted his arguments with little additions.

Court says after poll, duty staff no longer remains within ECP purview

The main argument presented by the petitioner’s counsel was against the competence of the ECP to issue the show-cause notices.  
Justice Khan observes that a person, who has been assigned any election duty, does not remain under the control and superintendence of the ECP upon declaration of fate of an election in a constituency simply for the reason that once fate of an election is declared the hiring staff lose their status as election official and the ECP does not enjoy jurisdiction to proceed against them.
He states that according to section 55(1) of the Election Act, 2017, a person can be deemed to be under the control, superintendence and discipline of the ECP for the period commencing from his date of appointment or deputation till publication of name of the returned candidate in the official gazette.  
“A cursory glance over section 55 of the Act, 2017 shows that the ECP has been empowered to proceed against an election official under the applicable disciplinary law,” he adds.  
The judge says it is very ironical on the one hand the counsel for the ECP took a specific plea that matters pertaining to pre- and post-election issues, including initiation of departmental proceedings against any delinquent official, are to be seen in the light of the referred provisions of the Constitution but has not been able to give any justification as to why impugned show-cause notices have been issued while relying on section 55 of the Act, 2017.  
Commenting on the case of one of the petitioners, the judge notes that the departmental proceedings against a government servant stand abated in the event of his retirement but initiation of the proceedings against the petitioner by the ECP, despite his retirement, speaks volumes about the fact that it proceeded to initiate proceedings against the petitioner without affirming as to whether he is in service or not.
Justice Khan maintains that upon declaration of fate of the election in the constituency, the petitioners no more remained the election officials, hence, the ECP has no jurisdiction to initiate proceedings against them.
“Resultantly, all these writ petitions are accepted and impugned disciplinary proceedings initiated by the Commission against the petitioners are declared coram-non-judice, thus, set aside,” the verdict reads.  
However, the judge, before parting with the judgment, observes that if the ECP thinks that the petitioners were involved in any subversive activities during their deployment in election duty, it would be at liberty to refer their matter to their parent departments for initiation of proceedings under the relevant law.

2022-12-22,2022-12-22,LHC’s power to review SC judgement on JIT questioned,The LHC bench will resume the case hearing today.,"LAHORE: Barrister Syed Ali Zafar, who represents the daughter of a woman killed in the Model Town firing, argued on Wednesday before a Lahore High Court larger bench that it did not have jurisdiction to review a judgment of the Supreme Court to constitute a joint investigation team (JIT) to reinvestigate the 2014 incident.
He contended that the merits of the case were discussed before the apex court.
He argued that the reinvestigation can indeed occur because the law makes no prohibition whatsoever on the extent or number of JITs that can be constituted, and therefore, a new independent investigation could be initiated to ensure that justice is served.
The bench is headed by Chief Justice Muhammad Ameer Bhatti with Justice Malik Shahzad Ahmad Khan, Justice Aalia Neelum, Justice Syed Shahbaz Ali Rizvi, Justice Mirza Viqas Rauf and Justice Tariq Saleem Sheikh.
Barrister Zafar pleaded before the bench that it had been impossible for the victims to expect justice when the investigating agencies were all headed by those who were directly linked to the perpetrators of the heinous act.
He alleged that as the ruling party at the time (i.e., PML-N) was directly involved in the Model Town massacre, its failure to hold anyone to account for this heinous crime must not be ignored.
The bench would resume further hearing on Thursday (today).
Khurram Rafiq and several other police officials facing trial in the private complaint by the PAT challenged the new JIT formed by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf-led provincial government. 
A three-judge bench had on March 22, 2019, suspended the new JIT.

Since then, the Punjab government has given look-after charge of the top administrative office to Mr Sumbal which was extended thrice. The PTI-PMLQ’s coalition government in Punjab views the development as a “serious move” at this critical juncture. However, it believes that the new chief secretary now commanding all administrative powers would not denotify chief minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi if the governor asks him to do so since Mr Elahi did not take vote of confidence on the advice of the Punjab governor.
However, sources in the bureaucracy say the chief secretary is bound to do what the law says, regardless how stakeholders interpret the constitutional provisions.
Earlier, the federal government notified the transfer of Kamran Ali Afzal, who is currently on 130-day ex-Pakistan leave, and transferred Abdulah Khan Sumbal from the Chairmanship of Punjab Planning and Development Board and posted him as regular chief secretary.Mr Afzal had earlier this month requested the Establishment Division to grant him 130-day ex-Pakistan leave as he wanted to travel to Australia. Eventually, the federal government accepted his request and assigned Mr Sumbal current charge of the office for three months with effect from Dec 7.
Mr Sumbal’s name was on the three-member panel sent by the PTI-PMLQ government to the federal government for the posting a regular chief secretary.
Meanwhile, the Punjab government transferred finance secretary Dr Wasif Khurshid and posted him as P&D Board chairman in his own pay and scale against a vacant post – after the posting of Mr Sumbal as chief secretary.
Punjab communications and works secretary Mujahid Sherdil has been transferred and posted as finance secretary. The additional charge of the C&W department has been assigned to Punjab housing urban development and public health engineering secretary Ahmed Mustajab Karamat in addition to his own duties till further order.

FIA Gujrat Deputy Director Ghulam Sarwar Warraich confirmed the registration of a case and said at least two of the suspects had been detained and an investigation was under way.  
The passport office’s former AD Saeed Abbas, data entry operator Zaheer Sial, clerk Shakoor Haider, a citizen Abid Hussain of Nankana Sahib and some other officials were among those booked under different sections of the PPC.  
The officials allegedly issued passports to Abid Hussain and his three children on the basis of fake documents. Using those passports, Hussain had flown abroad along with his children to avoid their possible handing over to their mother while a case was being heard in court.  
The Lahore High Court had ordered the FIA to investigate the matter and take legal action on the application of the children’s mother.  
Mr Warraich said the scope of investigation had been broadened to probe more officials.  
Hussain had first got registration documents of his children issued through the National Database and Registration Authority by showing someone else as his wife on an address in Gujrat, and later managed to get their passports processed with the alleged abetment of passport officials.  
A few weeks ago, the Interior Ministry had removed the entire staff of the passport office on charges of corruption and malpractices, and posted their replacements.  
The incumbent assistant director at the passport office, Hayat Tarrar, said his office had nothing to do with the case as the matter was already being investigated by the FIA.  
The next date of hearing of the case is Thursday (today) where the FIA officials would present the details of the investigation and action taken so far.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Amir Zulfiqar appointed Punjab IGP,"LAHORE: Ending the uncertainty with regard to the appointment of new head of Punjab police, the federal government...","LAHORE: Ending the uncertainty with regard to the appointment of new head of Punjab police, the federal government late on Wednesday posted Muhammad Amir Zulfiqar Khan as provincial police chief.
The federal government has issued the notification for appointment of Mr Zulfiqar as Punjab inspector general of police, who was deputy director general of the Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF). He has previously held the posts of National Highways & Motorway Police IG, Islamabad police IG and Additional IG Operations, CPO Punjab, Lahore.  
Mr Zulfiqar, as an assistant superintendent of police (ASP), won both top police honours -- the Quaid-e-Azam Police Medal and the Pakistan Police Medal. He belongs to Lahore and joined the Police Service of Pakistan (PSP) in 1991 and belonged to 19th Common.
He also served as Toba Tek Singh SSP, Special Branch Punjab SSP and Special Branch Lahore Region SSP, besides serving as Lahore DIG operations, Multan regional police officer (RPO), CTD Punjab DIG. He has served in Sindh, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and federal government.Earlier, a summary of seven police officers was forwarded to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for considering one of the officers for the Punjab IGP slot.
The BS-22 police officers who made a ‘late entry’ in the race for the Punjab’s top police slot are AD Khwaja, Rao Musthaq Ahmed Mehr, Rao Sardar Ali Khan and Ali Aamir Malik.The Punjab government had recommended the names of Fayyaz Ahmad Dev, Amir Zulfiqar and Ghulam Mahmood Dogar, all BS-21 officers for the Punjab IGP post.  
An  official privy to the process says the posting of regular IGP in Punjab was delayed because of the persisting political crisis in the  province. 
He  says that earlier the PML-N had almost agreed on the name of former Lahore capital  city police officer (CCPO) Fayyaz Ahmad Dev for the Punjab IGP slot as  PML-Q leader Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain, who recently joined hands with  the Shehbaz-led federal government, favoured the officer. Punjab Chief  Minister Parvez Elahi had also not objected to Dev’s posting, he adds.       
The official says that when the appointment of Mr Dev was  about to be made, suddenly the political situation in the province  became volatile in the aftermath of the PTI’s announcement to dissolve  the Punjab Assembly.
Meanwhile, he says, some of the BS-22 police  officers also geared up their efforts, using their political  connections, to be considered for the Punjab police’s top slot.  
Consequently, the PML-N government halted the process and added the  names of four senior police officers to the summary to the premier.
The  official source says the issue of appointment of regular IGP in Punjab  has been in the limelight since the PTI came into power in the Centre  and frequently changed provincial police chiefs during its more  than three-year long tenure.  
The crisis further  deepened when another provincial police chief, Faisal Shahkar, refused  to serve in Punjab in the wake of the political tussle between the PML-N  and the PTI-PMLQ governments in the Centre and Punjab, respectively. Mr  Shahkar had sent a written request  to the Establishment  Division to transfer him to the federal government, saying he was unable  to perform his duties in Punjab due to “personal reasons”. 
However, the  federal government asked him to retain his posting till the appointment  of new provincial police chief.
On Tuesday last, Mr Shahkar relinquished his charge as Punjab IGP, as he has to leave Pakistan for the United Nation where he has been selected for the top police slot.
The Punjab government had on Wednesday appointed BS-21 police officer Ghulam Rasool  Zahid, an officer of 19th Common, as acting police chief of the province.

The event, jointly organised by the Punjab University (PU) and GCU, received an enthusiastic and overwhelming response from the students of both varsities. Hundreds of graduates and final-year students flocked to the expo to explore employment and internship opportunities in reputed international and national companies.
Besides software houses and clothing brands, a large number of banks and student start-ups also set up their stall and interviewed the students for different jobs. Special recruitment information stalls set up by the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) and the Pakistan Navy remained the centre of attraction for the youth.
GCU Vice Chancellor (VC) Prof Dr Asghar Zaidi said career expos are usually underrated and misunderstood in Pakistani universities, adding that such events have a wider scope than only offering jobs and internship opportunities. “I urge even my first-year students to spend time with their future employers as they can help you network with people in the industry and you become more aware of the skills your industry values in an employee,” he said.
He said multiple job fairs are held in top universities of the world where students are encouraged to meet their future employers.
Information Technology University VC Dr Sarfraz Khurshid advised the students to never fear rejection, especially in job interviews, saying that many students don’t even try or appear for interviews just because of this fear.
Later, Prof Zaidi visited stalls of different companies and discussed with the executives their recruitment policies and criteria. He told the company executives that GCU not only focused on theoretical teaching, but also laid particular stress on the confidence and character building of its students so that they could perform exceptionally well in their professional lives.
Symposium: The Fatima Jinnah Medical University (FJMU) concluded its annual international scientific symposium on Wednesday. Prof Yasmin Rashid, Punjab health minister, said the occasion allowed teachers and graduate and undergraduate students learn more about current scientific research, which will ultimately help patients.
According to her, the FJMU and the associated Sir Ganga Ram Hospital effectively ran a number of health programmes.
For the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of genetic and hereditary blood illnesses, she claimed that the Punjab Thalassemia and Other Genetic Disorder Prevention and Research Institute, which was created here, offered the best resources.
The Fatima Jinnah Institute of Mother and Child Health, she insisted, was running smoothly.
The facility treats mothers and children, she said, adding that it would undoubtedly help reduce the province’s maternal and child mortality rate.
Health Secretary Dr Ahmad Javed Qazi, Federal Secretary Dr Ijaz Munir, FJMU Alumni Association of North America president Dr Fizza Zahid Rafique, King Edward Medical College Alumni Association of North America Dr Muhammad Fateh Shahzad, Allama Iqbal Medical College Alumni Association of North America president Dr Nusrum Iqbal, vice chancellor of the King Edward Medical University Prof Mehmood Ayaz, Allama Iqbal Medical College principal Prof Nadeem Hafeez Butt and Post-Graduate Medical Institute principal Prof Sardar Farid Al-Zafar were present.

— Dawn

 
RAHIM YAR KHAN: ‘Illegal’ fishing in different sections of the Indus in Rahim Yar Khan district continues due to non-issuance of tenders by the Punjab Fisheries Department (PFD).
According to sources in the PFD, the limits of the district starts from Panjnad and ends at Machka near Guddo, a long strip of almost 178 kms. The tenders for fishing in four sections of the Indus, including Samakka in Liaqatpur tehsil, Chachran Sharaif in Khanpur, Bangla Dilkusha in Rahim Yar Khan and Machka in Sadiqabad tehsil, are issued after a bidding process
The fisheries department issues tenders for permission of fishing to contractors in August every year but the PFD banned fishing this year to save the rare species of fish in the Indus. But many people started fishing in these sections of the river despite ban.  
Sources say the department [in Rahim Yar Khan] earns almost Rs20 million revenue from contractors by issuing tenders but current year tenders have not been issued as a result locals continued with ‘illegal’ fishing.  
After some complaints from the locals, the department has lifted the ban from fishing. Fisheries Assistant Director Ameer Nawaz Khan told Dawn that the secretary had banned fishing in August 2022 for 10 years but later due to some ‘unknown reasons’ he removed the restriction.  
He said during the ban, he along with his vigilance team raided different locations in the Indus and confiscated two hunting boats, four nets and six trappers. 
He said when his team tried to arrest illegal hunters, they escaped to the other side of the Indus but “my team always continues patrolling.”  
He said tenders would be issued from Dec 26, 2022 and after a bidding process successful contractors would start fishing in these sections.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,FIA court rejects Swati’s post-arrest bail,ISLAMABAD: A special court of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on Wednesday rejected the post-arrest bail of...,"ISLAMABAD: A special court of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on Wednesday rejected the post-arrest bail of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Senator Azam Khan Swati in a case registered against him over anti-establishment tweets.
Special Judge (Central) Azam Khan observed that Senator Swati had repeated the same crime in which he was already on a post-arrest bail.
During the course of the hearing, FIA’s special prosecutor Raja Rizwan Abbasi argued that Mr Swati operated a verified Twitter account and he was being followed by politicians, journalists and the public at large. He said Mr Swati never contested the ownership of his Twitter handle and used it to build an anti-army narrative.
Mr Abbasi claimed this was a deliberate attempt to incite mutiny among personnel of the armed forces. He said the PTI leader misused the relief of bail and tweeted the same text for which he was facing a case before the FIA’s Cybercrimes Wing.
Mr Swati’s counsel Babar Awan argued that the complainant, who had lodged the first information report (FIR) against his client, was not an aggrieved party.
He said the case had been registered by the FIA and it was not on a par with the complaint filed under defamation laws.
Mr Awan argued that the court could impose a maximum penalty of Rs1,000 on Mr Swati over his tweet, but he was being moved from one province to another.
The FIA had earlier this month arrested Mr Swati for defamation, statement conducing to public mischief, and highly obnoxious campaign of intimidating tweets, after his fiery speech at a PTI long march in Rawalpindi in which he lashed out at the senior military leadership.

2022-12-20,2022-12-22,‘TTP is Pakistan’s absolute red line’,Bilawal says Islamabad willing to consider all options to ensure citizens’ safety and security.,"WASHINGTON: Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has suggested letting neighbouring countries know that the outlawed TTP is an “absolute red line” for Pakistan and it would not allow anyone to cross that line.
“As far as the TTP (Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan) is concerned, it’s absolutely our red line. It is something that we will not tolerate,” said the foreign minister while speaking at the Atlantic Council, Washington, on Tuesday evening. 
“And absolutely we will be willing to consider each and every single option to ensure the safety and security of our people.” 

 





 
As the foreign minister stressed the need for combating militants in his Washington talk, Pakistan’s UN Ambassador Munir Akram told the UN Security Council in New York that engagement with the Taliban was the best option to stabilise the region.
“Coercion and isolation have not proved successful in the past; they will prove to be counter-productive now and in the future,” said Ambassador Akram while participating in a UN debate on the situation in Afghanistan. “We need a coherent and practical plan to realise the objectives of the international community through patient engagement with the interim government,” the Pakistani envoy told the 15-member Council.

Bilawal says Islamabad willing to consider all options to ensure citizens’ safety and security

Mr Bhutto-Zardari made a similar observation in his talk at the Atlantic Council, urging world powers to work with Afghanistan’s de facto rulers to stabilise the region. When the moderator, Uzair Younus, asked if Pakistan could deploy troops inside Afghanistan or on the border to stop attacks by Afghanistan-based militant groups, the minister suggested using the “hammer and anvil” strategy, with Kabul’s cooperation, to eliminate militancy.
The chief Pakistani diplomat pointed out that despite these border and cross-border attacks, the situation was far more secure and stable now than it was in 2007, when Pakistan launched a series of operations against the TTP and other militants.
“But those things can be put at risk if this goes unchecked. And obviously that would undermine any hope, whether it is CPEC or any other form of economic activity. Nobody wants to put lives at risk in order to conduct business,” he warned.
“That’s why I have been particularly hawkish on the issue of the TTP, and on the issue of terrorism in general. I believe that recent events in the region are alarming, not only the border incidents but the recent Bannu incident, which our security commanders have very bravely managed to overcome,” he said.
The foreign minister, however, stressed the need to “impress on our neighbours, particularly Afghan­istan” that they have to demonstrate the will and the capacity to take on the TTP or other groups functioning from there.
He acknowledged that there’s room for improvement in Pakistan’s Afghan policy — as there’s in America’s — and “we need to be serious about what we can do going forward”.
“Are we going learn from our mistakes to ensure that we do not repeat them,” he asked. “The answer to that question is going to define the safety and stability of Afghanistan, the safety and stability of Pakistan and the safety and stability of our region.” 
Pakistan’s number one option, he said, was to get the Afghan interim government to demonstrate that they had the capacity to deal with this issue.
Separately, the foreign minister also met Deputy Secretary of State Wendy R. Sherman where they discussed Pakistan’s efforts to recover from devastating floods and the upcoming Jan 9 International Con­ference on Climate Resilient Pakistan in Geneva. 
According to a readout issued by the State Department, the US official expressed condolences for Pakistani lives lost in recent terrorist attacks, and they committed to strengthen cooperation between the two countries.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,ECC defers PSO’s request for Rs17bn,Receivables of embattled national fuel supplier cross Rs612bn.,"ISLAMABAD: The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet was informed on Wednesday that receivables of the national fuel supplier – Pakistan State Oil (PSO) had crossed Rs612 billion and it was struggling to manage remittances to its foreign suppliers.
The meeting of the ECC presided over by Finance Minister Ishaq Dar, however, did not immediately approve Rs17bn urgently demanded by the PSO to honour its liabilities to international firms, particularly its long-term fuel supplier Kuwait Petroleum Company (KPC).
“The ECC deferred a summary submitted by the Ministry of Energy (Petroleum Division) for foreign exchange coverage to PSO and directed the Ministry of Energy to resubmit the summary after reviewing the numbers”, said an official statement.
The Petroleum Division reported that under a credit facility provided by KPC since 2000 and extended annually for the supply of diesel, a joint account of the federal government and KPC had been set up with the National Bank of Pakistan in which PSO keeps on depositing rupee equivalent funds after 30 days of the bill of lading for each shipment.
After 90 days from the bill of lading, the NBP has to transfer the cargo cost to KPC and exchange cover for an additional 60 days is borne by the federal government.
However, the account facility started to face huge shortfalls in April 2020 on account of exchange losses, posing a default situation in remittances to KPC.
At the time the ECC approved a supplementary grant of Rs12bn which helped PSO avoid an international default. The facility worked well for another two years but then suffered a shortfall again and now this shortfall stood at Rs17bn owing to “prevalent upheaval” in the rupee-dollar parity.

Receivables of embattled national fuel supplier cross Rs612bn

The Petroleum Division said the PSO had been defaulting even on rupee deposits in the NBP account because of its liquidity challenges as its receivables reached Rs612bn and “it urgently required adequate funds so that liabilities are met on time”. 
The Petroleum Division and PSO have been trying to manage the situation for avoiding international default by depositing required funds on due dates but the situation was “too critical” now.
It also complained that the Petroleum Division had been submitting budget requirements for exchange loss on this facility every year but the Ministry of Finance did not make separate provisions which led to exposure to international default.
The finance ministry, however, argued that the government had already released Rs30bn to address PSO’s liquidity position under the foreign exchange head in September and arranged another Rs50bn through market financing. Also, the government was now trying to ensure PSO recoveries through power companies and gas companies.
The Petroleum Division, however, insisted that the matter related to actual foreign exchange loss of over Rs17bn so far on the KPC’s credit facility up to Dec 2, which has to be paid by the government sooner or later.
“PSO has made all outstanding payments delayed due to liquidity position. Exchange loss, however, is the liability of the government”, Petroleum Division was quoted but a decision was deferred.
Supplementary grants
The ECC approved a summary of the Ministry of Energy (Petroleum Division) on the transfer of 30pc working interests in exploration licences/block – Margala Block – owned by M/s MOL of Hungary to M/s Mari Petroleum Company Ltd. 
It was apprised that Margala Block was governed by Pakistan Petroleum Exploration and Production Rules 2001 and the acquiring company MPCL was operating in Pakistan since 1954 and has working interests in 23 exploration licences and 15 development & production leases. The ECC was further informed that M/s MOL had cleared all its financial obligations.
The ECC also approved a Rs823m technical supplementary grant to the Ministry of Maritime Affairs, enabling Gwadar Port Authority (GPA) to disburse the amount of Rs250,000 per head to 3,291 fishermen registered with Balochistan Fisheries Department for the purchase of boat engines.
The ECC also approved another Rs200mn Technical Supplementary Grant to the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulation and Coordination for Ghurki Trust Teaching Hospital (GTTH), Lahore. Ghurki Trust Teaching Hospital (GTTH) is a tertiary care non-profit organisation providing “State of the Art” health facilities to needy and poor patients.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,"China willing to provide ‘all kinds of assistance’, envoy assures Dar","Both sides deliberate on several avenues for expanding bilateral relations, especially in the economic and financial sectors.","ISLAMABAD: China assured Pakistan on Wednesday that it is ready to help Islamabad in every possible way following its request for about $8.75 billion in an additional financial package, including the rollover of debt, bank deposits and currency swaps.
Chinese Ambassador in Islamabad Nong Rong called on Finance Minister Ishaq Dar on Wednesday and “assured continuous support of the Chinese government to Pakistan”, the finance ministry said in a statement.
The “government of China stands with the people of Pakistan and is willing to provide all kinds of assistance”, the statement added.
Mr Dar told reporters last month that Pakistan had sought about $9bn in additional financial support from China during the visit of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to Beijing, and that the Chinese leadership had promised to “roll over $4bn in sovereign loans, refinance $3.3bn commercial bank loans and increase currency swap by about $1.45bn — from 30bn yuan to 40bn yuan”. The total worked out at $8.75bn.
Pakistan needs at least $34bn until June 30, 2023, to meet its international liabilities, including debt and trade payments. Pakistan is banking on about $13bn in additional support from China and Saudi Arabia.
The statement said Mr Dar “thanked the Chinese ambassador for their continuous support and assistance” and praised the long-standing and deep-rooted friendly relations between the two countries.
Both sides deliberated on several avenues for expanding bilateral relations, especially in the economic and financial sectors. The ambassador appreciated the government’s policy initiatives to sustain and boost fiscal and monetary stability.
Mr Dar had earlier said that the Chinese president and prime minister had assured Prime Minister Sharif that his government would stand by Pakistan and “will not let you down”.
He had then separately taken up the issue of refinancing $3bn in China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) deposit and about $3.3bn debt rollover. Both these heads are due for maturity on different dates before June 30.

• Interior ministry asks Rangers, FC to perform security duties in Punjab
LAHORE: In a tit-for-tat move, Governor Balighur Rehman on Wednesday termed the ruling of Punjab Assembly Speaker Sibtain Khan disposing of his directives regarding the vote of confidence “unconstitutional”, whereas the coalition government hinted at the imposition of governor’s rule in Pakistan’s largest province.
The PML-N government initially hinted that governor’s rule could be imposed for two months through a resolution in a joint session of parliament, but the period could be extended to six months.
“Since the chief minister on Wednesday failed to take the trust vote in the Punjab Assembly in compliance with the governor’s order, legally he ceases to hold his office. And now any time... probably on Thursday (today), the governor can issue an order de-notifying the CM,” Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah said earlier in the day.
This view was echoed by SAPM Attaullah Tarrar, who told reporters late on Wednesday night that the governor had discretionary powers to de-notify the CM and it was up to him whether he wanted to do it “tomorrow or the day after”.
Another option, Mr Sanaullah said, is governor’s rule by the Centre. “In the wake of the constitutional crisis, the government may get a resolution passed from the National Assembly and Senate to impose governor’s rule in Punjab for two months initially — the period can be extended to six months as well,” the minister added.
He was of the view that “all was not well” in the camp of Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Punjab parliamentary party. “Had the PTI been confident that CM Elahi could secure the support of 186 MPAs in the PA he would have gone for the trust vote on Wednesday in compliance with the governor’s order,” he said, adding that the CM could have gone for PA’s dissolution after the vote in line with Imran Khan’s plan for the dissolution of assemblies. “But the PTI chose otherwise because it knew it did not have the required number,” Mr Sanaullah claimed.
Governor’s order on PA speaker ruling
In the late evening, Governor Rehman wrote a three-page order in response to PA Speaker Sibtain Khan’s ruling which had termed Mr Rehman’s order seeking vote of confidence from Mr Elahi ‘illegal’.
In his order, the governor said under Article 130(7) of the Constitution that PA speaker’s ruling had no bearing on his order and termed it unconstitutional. The governor said the speaker’s ruling was also in violation of Rule 209 of the Rules of Procedure of the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab, 1997.
“The speaker’s ruling, consequent acts and omissions constitute and result in enabling the chief minister to refrain from obtaining a vote of confidence in terms of Article 130(7). Helping and aiding the CM in refraining from fulfilling his duty and preventing the constitutional process from proceeding to its logical end leads to the consequences stipulated in Rule 22 (7) of the Rules of Procedure of the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab, 1997.”
Meanwhile, taking a screenshot of the governor’s reply, PTI senior leader Fawad Chaudhry, in a tweet, asked Mr Rehman not to make a mockery of his office. “Dear Governor! Do not make a mockery of your office, the speaker’s ruling is final as far affairs of the Assembly are concerned and do not expose yourself to misconduct proceedings. Respect the Constitution,” he added.
Earlier in the day, the governor held a meeting with the PML-N and PPP leaders and legal experts to discuss the strategy of the federal government. Federal ministers Rana Sanaullah and Saad Rafique, premier’s special assistants Attaullah Tarar and Malik Ahmed Khan, and PPP Punjab parliamentary party leader Hasan Murtaza were present in the meeting.
Separately, the federal government on Wednesday decided to deploy Pakistan Rangers and Frontier Constabulary (FC) across Punjab, interior ministry sources said, adding that the federal agencies would ensure law and order in the province and work for implementation of laws and Constitution.
Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah directed the Punjab chief secretary and inspector general of police to maintain law and order, protection of the life and property of the people, and perform their duties as per law and Constitution, sources said.
The interior minister also warned officials not to become part of any process that was against the law and Constitution.

2022-12-22,2022-12-22,‘Unconstitutional’ removal of chief minister to be opposed: PTI,Imran to announce party’s future course of action at protest today.,"• Imran to announce party’s future course of action at protest today
• Fawad claims Zardari offered PTI women MPAs Rs50m each to abstain from voting
• As per agreement with PTI, PML-Q to get 30 PA, 15 NA seats 
LAHORE: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has announced that it will challenge any “unconstitutional” move of de-notifying Punjab Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi, and asked its leadership, parliamentarians and party workers to reach the Governor House at 5pm on Thursday (today) to ‘block’ the governor from taking any such action.
PTI Chairman Imran Khan will address the protesters through video link and announce the party’s next line of action in the face of the provincial opposition’s moves to save the Punjab Assembly.
Earlier on Wednesday, Governor Balighur Rehman had declared Punjab Assembly Speaker Sibtain Khan’s ruling regarding CM Elahi’s vote of confidence “unconstitutional” and “illegal”.
On Tuesday, the speaker had termed the governor’s orders — to the CM to obtain a vote of confidence from the provincial assembly by 4pm on Wednesday — as “illegal, against the provisions of the Constitution and thus stand disposed of”, and issued a ruling in this regard.
The PTI leadership on Wednesday maintained the speaker had ruled that the assembly was in session and until the session was prorogued, the governor could not summon a fresh session, citing a 1997 ruling by the Lahore High Court. They said the court had ruled that “not less than 10 clear days” must be granted to the chief minister to obtain a vote of confidence.
PTI Central Punjab General Secretary Hammad Azhar gave a call to PTI leaders, lawmakers and party workers and supporters to reach outside the Governor House at 5pm on Thursday (today).
“The masses can no longer remain silent spectators while an unconstitutional game is being played,” he remarked.
Meanwhile, the federal government has sought deployment of Rangers to beef up security of the Governor House “till further orders under sections 7(b) and 10 of the Pakistan Rangers Ordinance, 1959 and Section 4(3)(i) of Anti-Terrorism Act 1997”.
“The Pakistan Rangers (Punjab) is requested to immediate necessary action with regard to beefing up the security at the Governor’s House, Lahore, in coordination with the office of the governor,” said the Interior Ministry.
PTI senior leader Fawad Chaudhry told the media outside party chief Imran Khan’s Zaman Park residence that the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) parties were ‘scared of’ holding general elections, adding they would be violating the Constitution’s Article 109 by asking the chief minister to take a vote of confidence immediately. 
He said the governor should give 10 clear days for the vote or challenge the Punjab Assembly speaker’s ruling in court.
He further said the PTI had called its parliamentary party meeting on Thursday (today) and stressed its 177 as well as the PML-Q’s 10 MPAs were available to foil a no-confidence motion submitted by the PML-N and the PPP separately against the chief minister as well as the Punjab Assembly speaker and deputy speaker.
Mr Chaudhry also claimed that the party’s women MPAs had told Mr Khan that they were receiving offers from former president Asif Zardari to abstain from voting for Rs50 million each.
“The people of Sindh should know that Asif Zardari is spending their welfare money to buy loyalties of PTI MPAs,” he said.
Claiming that some other MPAs had also received threatening calls to abstain from voting, he demanded the superior courts take notice and identify those who were trying to terrify the party legislators.
“As soon as the vote of no-confidence fails, the Punjab Assembly will be dissolved and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly will follow suit,” he declared.
On the other hand, a three-member committee of the PTI held a meeting with CM Elahi and his party members and discussed seat adjustment prospects in detail.
As part of a formula, sources said, the PTI agreed to offer 30 Punjab Assembly and 15 National Assembly seats to the PML-Q. The party of the Chaudhrys had sought seats in the newly created Gujrat division – their hometown -- that included Gujrat, Mandi Bahauddin, Wazirabad and Hafizabad districts, some parts of south Punjab as well as Sialkot.
PTI leader Shafqat Mahmood later confirmed that both the allied parties had mutually agreed over giving 30 Punjab and 15 National Assembly seats to Mr Elahi’s party.
Meanwhile, the PML-Q held its parliamentary party meeting, chaired by CM Elahi and parliamentary leader Sajid Bhatti, and discussed the current political situation and decided their future course of action.
The chief minister has also called the provincial cabinet’s seventh meeting at his office on Thursday (today) at 1:30pm with 21 items on the agenda.
Soon afterwards, PML-Q MNA Hussain Elahi tweeted that all 10 PML-Q MPAs had announced complete support for PTI chief Imran Khan and Chief Minister Parvez Elahi in the meeting.
Responding to the PDM government’s claim that it had won the loyalties of six PML-Q MPAs, Mr Hussain asserted that the federal ruling coalition would not be able to fool anyone with its propaganda, and commented: “They (PDM) talk about six MPAs when they can’t even break one.”
A PML-Q spokesman said the parliamentary party had delegated complete authority of making all the decisions to CM Elahi and resolved to vote in favour of the CM, speaker and deputy speaker when a vote of no-confidence was taken up in the house.
Mr Elahi also asserted that the PML-Q would continue standing by Imran Khan and that his party was united and would remain so to bulldoze any propaganda or rumours being spread by the PDM government in the Centre.
Earlier in the day, as Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah had claimed he would seal the Chief Minister House if Mr Elahi didn’t take a vote of confidence, the CM’s son, Moonis, said he had “reached 8-Club CM House and waiting for you”. A few hours later, he tweeted: “Rana sb am bored now. Heading home but pls do let me know when you plan to come.”

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,"PTI set to approach SC, not speaker, for resignations’ acceptance","“We are dealing with those people who do not have any moral standing,” says Senator Shibli Faraz.","ISLAMABAD: Contra­dicting the announcement it made only days ago that PTI members of National Assembly are ready to appear before Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf for verification of their resignations, the party on Wednesday changed its stance as senior party leader Senator Shibli Faraz declared that the lawmakers would not go to the Parliament House, and instead, the PTI would approach the Supreme Court to seek acceptance of the mass resignations.
“We had decided to go to the assembly for acceptance of our resignations. But this is not the way and MNAs, who are elected by the people, cannot be asked to keep standing in a queue for acceptance of their resignations … The government is doing all this [handling the resignation issue] with a mala fide intention,” said Mr Faraz, alleging that the speaker wanted to “humiliate” the PTI lawmakers by treating them as “charity seekers”.
Talking to Dawn, Mr Faraz said they would approach the Supreme Court and ask it to direct the speaker to accept the resignations submitted some eight months ago.
“We will go to the SC in a day or two,” he said.
The party is going to the apex court where this issue has already been discussed during the hearing of various petitions and even the judges had observed that PTI should reconsider its decision of quitting the assembly.
When asked if it was not a U-turn as PTI Vice Chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi had written a letter to the speaker only six days back, asking him to allocate some time for the party’s MNAs to verify their resignations, Mr Faraz said they wanted to do so, but the government did not seem to be serious which was evident from the fact that it had convened a session of the National Assembly on Thursday (today) on a one-day notice despite the fact that the speaker was not even present in the country.
“This is not a U-turn. Look at the spirit of the matter. Why is the government delaying acceptance of our resignations? Why has the speaker adopted a pick-and-choose policy by accepting the resignations of only 11 members?” he said, adding that submission of mass resignations was part of the party strategy to force the government to hold early elections in the country. Otherwise, he said, the party MNAs could have been asked to submit resignations in groups.
When his attention was drawn to the assembly rules under which the speaker is required to individually call the members for verification of resignations, Mr Faraz posed a valid counter-question, saying: “Under which law did the speaker accept the resignations of the 11 MNAs who had also not appeared before him for verification [of their resignations]?”
“We are dealing with those people who do not have any moral standing,” the PTI senator alleged, questioning the logic behind the speaker’s decision to accept the resignations of 11 members out of 123 who had submitted the resignations en masse at the time of the election of Shehbaz Sharif as the prime minister in April.
On Dec 15, while talking to reporters in Lahore, Mr Qureshi had expressed his party’s resolve to dissolve the assemblies of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and get the MNAs’ resignations accepted after appearing before the speaker.
“We have already made our decision. We will execute it,” he had stated, adding that party Chairman Imran Khan had given him the letter for sending it to the speaker.
He also waved the ‘letter’ bearing the subject “Resignations of MNAs of PTI” to the media and chided the speaker for being “selective” while accepting the resignations of 11 MNAs “illegally”.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,"Onus on Centre to fight militancy, says KP",KP govt's spokesperson says the police’s job is to counter routine crimes and ‘national security’ is beyond their mandate.,"PESHAWAR: As some semblance of normalcy returned to Bannu on Wednesday, a day after an operation against terrorists, the under-fire KP government refused to accept the blame for the resurgence of terrorism, saying it was the responsibility of the Centre to tackle the issue.
Chief Minister Mahmood Khan in a media talk declared that ‘fighting militancy’ was the mandate of the federal government.
Meanwhile, President Arif Alvi, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Army chief Gen Syed Asim Munir, separately, paid tribute to the soldiers who took part in the operation at the CTD centre in Bannu on Tuesday.
The KP chief minister explained that it was the Centre’s job to fight militancy since the institutions fighting [against militants] fell within the jurisdiction of the federal government.
“Crime and law and order situation is the provincial government’s job but militancy falls within their [federal government’s] domain and hence this is their responsibility,” he maintained.
Besides, the chief minister claimed that the federal government was reluctant to release funds for both current and developmental expenditures. “Neither do we receive the current nor the developmental expenditures [funding],” he said and alleged that the funds were being diverted to the federal government’s members of parliament.
Endorsing the CM’s views, the KP government’s spokesperson told a press briefing that the police’s job was to counter routine crimes and ‘national security’ was beyond its mandate.
He said the incident that took place inside the Bannu CTD centre fell within the definition of ‘national security’ which was the federal the government’s domain.
“This is not something about general law and order…it falls within the domain of the national security which is the responsibility of the federal government,” CM Adviser on Information Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif said.
In reply to a question about the recently held talks with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Afghanistan, the special assistant said that war had never ended since 2001 and dialogue was an attempt to further improve the situation but a permanent solution [to militancy] could not be found.
“The reason for dialogue with them [TTP] was to improve the situation,” Mr Saif said, adding that war never ended, though its intensity fluctuated. “We wanted a permanent solution but it did not happen,” he said while explaining the reason for holding talks with the Taliban.
A KP minister, however, appeared to have a different stance, reported APP.
Kamran Bangash at a presser reiterated the provincial government’s resolve to eliminate terrorism and extremism in all its forms and manifestations and said the government was taking pragmatic steps to improve the capacity of police and the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD).
Referring to the terrorist attack on the CTD compound, he said police and security forces had already shared information about the possible terrorist attacks.
Meanwhile, Chief of Army Staff Gen Syed Asim Munir met the officers and soldiers, who were injured during the Bannu operation, at the CMH Rawalpindi, according to an Inter-Services Public Relations release.
The COAS remained with them for some time and inquired about their well-being.
He appreciated their high spirit and morale and lauded their professionalism during the operation against the terrorists.
Pledge against terrorism
President Alvi lauded the security forces for carrying out a successful operation against terrorists in Bannu and expressed the resolve to eliminate terrorism from the country’s soil, APP reported.
The president, in a statement, termed the success a result of the professionalism of security forces and their unwavering commitment against terrorism.
In separate remarks, Prime Minister Sharif said the state would not surrender to any terrorist group or organisation and vowed that militants would be dealt with according to the Constitution and law.
Strongly condemning the activities of terrorists, he said such attempts would be crushed.
“We will not let the sacrifices of the martyrs go to waste,” he said and mentioned the military operations of Raddul Fasaad and Zarb-i-Azb as significant measures to eradicate terrorism.
The prime minister said that though main responsibility for law and order lies with the provinces, the federation could not turn a blind eye to such problems.
He assured the provinces that the federal government would work along with them in fighting terrorism and vowed to fully implement the National Action Plan to eliminate terrorism.
PM Shehbaz said the federal government would assist the provinces in improving the professional capacity of the anti-terrorism force and departments.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,SC overturns verdicts in favour of khula,"Husband’s claim of conjugal rights seemed to be motivated by his intention to avoid payment of dower amount, judge observes.","ISLAMABAD: In a family suit, the Supreme Court on Wednesday set aside the Peshawar High Court (PHC) and appellate court decisions for dissolution of a marriage by way of khula and restored the decree of a family court to dissolve the marriage on the basis of cruelty inflicted by a man on his wife.
While the family court after recording of evidence and hearing both sides had dissolved the marriage due to cruelty on a suit moved by Tayyeba Ambareen against her husband Shafqat Ali Kiyani demanding dower amount, dowry articles, medical expenses and maintenance for herself and their daughter, the appellate court on Nov 10, 2015 overturned the decree and converted it into khula with the direction to the woman to refund five-tola gold to her husband. The high court also upheld the appellate court decision.
Headed by Justice Sardar Tariq Masood, a three-judge Supreme Court bench then took up an appeal against the PHC verdict.
In its decision, the apex court observed that husband’s claim of conjugal rights — despite his ‘ruthless, tyrannical and oppressive’ conduct or behaviour — seemed to be motivated by the sole intention to avoid paying maintenance allowance and the dower amount and he ultimately succeeded in his effort when the appellate court dissolved the marriage by way of khula with the direction to the wife to refund the dower amount.

Husband’s claim of conjugal rights seemed to be motivated by his intention to avoid payment of dower amount, judge observes

Justice Mohammad Ali Mazhar, a member of the SC bench, in a judgment he wrote, observed the main disagreement or source of discord between the parties was whether petitioner Tayyeba Ambareen was entitled to claim a decree for dissolution of marriage on the ground of cruelty and whether the appellate forum rightly converted the dissolution of marriage on the ground of cruelty to dissolution by way of khula.
The SC noted that the family court unequivocally articulated that the petitioner discharged the burden of proving cruelty on part of the husband by quoting many incidents while her evidence was not shattered during her cross-examination and thus the family court rightly dissolved the marriage on account of cruelty after a thorough examination and consideration of evidence.
Justice Mazhar observed that the appellate court could modify or set aside the judgment of the family court if it was found contrary to the evidence since the purpose of appellate jurisdiction was to reappraise whether the lower court committed any error. Likewise, he noted, the high court affirmed the findings of the appellate court without realizing that the allegations of maltreatment and cruelty had been satisfactorily proved by the petitioner during the trial.
The matrimonial bond between a man and woman is a pious relationship that plays an important part and also nurtures between the husband and wife happiness and compassion, the lineage and family heredity also depends on it, Justice Mazhar observed, adding the connubial affairs are based on gentle, human and emotional affiliation which requires mutual trust, regard, respect, love and affection and the relationship should also be in accordance with social norms.
As Islam ordains husbands to provide food, clothing, accommodation and all other necessities of life to the best of his capability and capacity, a man is expected to treat his wife nicely, with love and affection, Justice Mazhar observed. A conduct or behaviour that inflicts upon the wife mental pain and anguish makes it impossible for her to continue matrimonial relationship, the verdict explained.
Justice Mazhar recalled how the family court decision depicted different acts which caused mental anguish and torture to the wife, as only a week after their marriage, the husband started pressurising his wife to arrange money to get a house on rent. The husband and his family members also levelled false accusations at her, alleging that his daughter was not their child, with the result that the petitioner suffered severe mental agony, the court noted.
While she was in the family way, the man left her instead of supporting his wife, the court observed. He did not turn up at the crucial time; neither did he pay any maintenance allowance nor delivery expenses, it was recalled.
Also, the husband and his family members imposed a harsh condition on her that she should deposit her salary into a joint account with her husband and seek his permission for personal use.
Despite filing the family suit, the husband’s behaviour did not change rather he caused more mental anguish and started levelling false accusations, imposing condition that the amount for the house purchased by the wife be reimbursed by her father to the husband.
But the apex court noted that the appellate court, instead of considering the evidence reached a conclusion without any reason that no solid piece of evidence was brought to show physical torture or mental agony and held the allegation was exaggerated, adding that the “acts of cruelty were common” in nature and were “found in every family”.
On the basis of the observations, the Supreme Court set aside the judgments of the high court and the appellate court and restored the decree passed by the family court.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,SBP slashes GDP growth forecast to below 3-4pc,"Cuts FY23 outlook after considering flood-induced destruction, policy focus on stabilisation.","KARACHI: The central bank has lowered its projected GDP growth from the previously announced range of 3-4 per cent for the current fiscal year, citing flood-induced destruction and the stabilisation policy as major factors in its flagship economic health report released on Wednesday.
However, in its Annual Report on the State of Pakistan’s Economy, which mostly discussed the previous financial year that ended on June 30, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said economic growth was stronger than expected in the 2021-22 fiscal year as real GDP increased by 6pc compared to 5.7pc a year ago.
The primary drivers of this growth were a broad-based expansion in large-scale manufacturing (LSM) and improved agricultural output, the report said.
“A combination of adverse global and domestic developments led to the re-emergence of macroeconomic imbalances during FY22,” it said.

Cuts FY23 outlook after considering flood-induced destruction, policy focus on stabilisation

The SBP said that the economy was already in a stabilisation phase when widespread flooding hit a large part of the country at the start of the current fiscal year.
It said the flooding was likely to impinge on the country’s real economic activity through various channels, fearing that losses in agriculture emerging from the damages to crops and livestock were likely to transmit to the rest of the economy through various backward and forward linkages.
 
 

The large-scale destruction of infrastructure in the affected provinces might also undermine the country’s growth prospects during the year, the bank said.
The SBP avoided providing any range for the growth rate of the current financial year apparently due to the worsening economic situation. Industries have either shut down or drastically cut their production due to high inflation and the unavailability of gas and electricity.
One major reason is the cork put by the SBP on the opening of letters of credit (LCs) for imports in an attempt to save dollars.
The All-Pakistan Textile Mills Association has threatened to announce lay-offs within days if the gas supply is not restored and LCs are not opened.
The textile industry claims that up to 500,000 people, who were associated with the sector directly or indirectly, have lost their jobs. No official data is available in this regard.
International credit rating agencies have slashed the credit rating of Pakistan and predicted an economic growth rate of around 2pc for the current fiscal year.
The SBP report said that several corrective and other measures were likely to slow the momentum of economic activity during FY23, including a hike of 675 basis points in the policy rate, demand management measures announced in the previous fiscal year, and the government’s decision to unwind the fiscal package for fuel and electricity subsidies towards the end of FY22.
The report noted that the expansionary fiscal stance in FY22, an upsurge in global commodity prices, and the fallout of the Russia-Ukraine conflict led to a marked deterioration in the current account deficit.
 
 

In addition, the delay in the resumption of the IMF loan programme and political instability exacerbated the country’s vulnerability through the depletion of foreign exchange reserves.
The resulting rupee depreciation “amplified inflationary pressures by magnifying the effect of global price increase”, the SBP report said.
It said the experience from FY22 brought to the fore once again the need to address the country’s structural weaknesses, such as a narrow base of foreign exchange earnings and meagre inflows of foreign investment.
“A concerted approach is required to encourage increased localisation of the manufacturing base, along with the lowering of energy intensity of the economy by ensuring energy efficiency and conservation,” the report said.
Moreover, amid the growing issues related to climate change and inadequate food security situation, there is an urgent need to formulate a well-thought-out strategy to meet these challenges, it said.
It stressed that priority should be given to producing new varieties of seeds that are suitable to varying weather conditions and to devise a framework that emphasises water management strategies to increase agricultural productivity.
“The losses to agriculture produce induced by the recent floods is likely to step up the import of agriculture commodities, particularly cotton,” the report said.
It said the government has targeted to reduce the fiscal deficit to 4.9pc of GDP in FY23 from 7.9pc in FY22. “This outcome would be achieved through both revenue and expenditure measures,” it said.
In fact, the fiscal deficit exceeded in the first quarter of FY23, annoying the IMF, which demanded more measures to reduce the gap.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,PM promises Rs5bn to reconstruct flood-hit homes,Govt launches ‘4RF’ comprehensive plan for rehabilitation of millions of survivors.,"SUKKUR/ISLAMABAD: As he assured Sindh that the federal government would not leave flood survivors in a lurch, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the Centre would spend at least Rs5 billion to construct houses for flood victims in the province.
After his visit to rain-hit areas in Khairpur on Wednesday, the prime minister said that Rs4.80 billion had been donated to the prime minister’s account for flood survivors and added that more funds were expected to be donated.
According to PM Sharif, the rehabilitation process was already underway across the country, but there were still several areas in Khairpur and Dadu which were underwater. 
He added that the government would move towards reconstruction and rehabilitation works, but at present, at least eight million families were rain-affected. 
He elaborated that at least 20m people, including nine million children, were waiting for the government to help them.

Govt launches ‘4RF’ comprehensive plan for rehabilitation of millions of survivors

Drainage plan
He said that the government would build houses for the affected people and added that the chief minister would provide plots for the construction and the same process would be followed in other provinces as well.
“A donors conference is going to be held in Geneva next month,” said PM Sharif and added that he would go to the moot fully prepared to present Pakistan’s case for aid in light of massive destruction due to floods. The PM also announced the establishment of a campus of COMSATS University in Khairpur.
Speaking at the residence of PPP leader Manzoor Wassan in Khairpur, Shehbaz Sharif said that his government would “positively consider” the master plan for drainage on the left bank of the River Indus proposed by a foreign consultant, Louis Berger.
Mr Sharif said that the scale of the disaster was massive so Pakistan would require plenty of resources to tackle this challenge.
During the visit, the premier was also briefed by Chief Engineer Development Region-I Mansoor Memon in Pir Gaddo, Kot Diji about inundated areas in the province.
The chief engineer said that out of 3.3m acres of area, 2m acres were inundated on the right bank and 1.3m acres on the left bank of the Indus till Aug 31.
In Khairpur, 141,000 acres of land was submerged till Aug 31 but now only 7,800 acres of land needed to be dewatered, Mr Memon informed. He maintained that field drains on an area of 200 square kms were created to drain rainwater.
According to the chief engineer, Khairpur was a victim of a “poor drainage network” and the only drainage system that existed in the area pertained to salinity control and water-logging issue. He informed when the Sukkur barrage was built, the flow of natural watercourses in the area was obstructed. 
“Even this area where we are standing is an old waterway,” Mr Memon said while showing the site on a satellite image.
He said that floodwater from the mountainous range stretching over 75,000 sq kms in Balochistan reached Qambar Shahdadkot and Dadu districts in recent floods and 600,000 acres and 400,000 acres of the area was inundated respectively in Qambar and Dadu districts. This meant that out of 2m acres, 50pc of the area was affected in these two districts, he added.
Speaking about the Berger plan regarding drainage, the engineer urged that the scheme was of paramount importance for left bank areas. CM Murad agreed. The Sindh CM said the provincial government wanted to use funds deposited with the apex court in the Bahria Town case for the execution of this scheme.
‘4RF plan’
Separately, the government launched a comprehensive plan prepared by the planning and development division for the rehabilitation of flood victims. 
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, Prime Minister Shehbaz launched the ‘Resilient, Recovery, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Framework’ (4RF) which envisaged short, medium, and long-term strategies to rehabilitate the survivors.
A copy of the 4RF report was presented to the prime minister by Ahsan Iqbal, Minister for Planning Development and Special Initiatives (MoPD&SI) during a meeting. 
Mr Iqbal apprised the prime minister that the document was based on the loss and damage estimated in the post-disaster needs assessment report, which was launched in October this year.
PM Sharif directed that necessary efforts must be made for the effective pitching of this framework in the upcoming donors’ conference, scheduled to be held on January 9, 2023, in Geneva, Switzerland.
He directed that the planning ministry in coordination with the foreign ministry, climate change ministry, and economic affairs division may take necessary steps for the effective dissemination of the document to all the stakeholders at home and abroad.

The stranded boat was approached by five Indian ships late on Tuesday, a source said.
A spokesperson for the Indian Navy said he did not have any details to share. A spokesperson for the Coast Guard did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters.
“We estimate that probably as many as 20 have died some from hunger and thirst, and others jumped overboard in desperation. This is absolutely awful and outrageous,” said Chris Lewa, director of the Arakan Project which works to support Myanmar’s Rohingyas.
Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Networks Rohingya Working Group said the group had been adrift for more than two weeks.
“We heard late last night that there were some Indian vessels approaching the boat so we are awaiting updates now, said Lilianne Fan, chair of Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Networks Rohingya Working Group.
“We hope that the Indian Navy or Coastguard will manage to rescue and disembark the boat as soon as possible. These people have been adrift on a damaged boat for more than 2 weeks without food and water. We have heard that up to 16 people may have already died.”  Another boat, carrying more than a hundred Rohingya was rescued by Sri Lanka’s navy on the weekend.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Nepal court orders release of serial killer Charles Sobhraj,"“Keeping him in the prison continuously is not in line with the prisoner’s human rights,” says court.","KATHMANDU: Nepal’s top court ordered on Wednesday the release and deportation of Charles Sobhraj, the French serial killer portrayed in the Netflix series  “The Serpent” who was responsible for a string of murders across Asia in the 1970s.
The Supreme Court ruled Sobhraj, 78, who has been in prison in the Himalayan republic since 2003 for murdering two North American tourists, should be freed on health grounds.
“Keeping him in the prison continuously is not in line with the prisoner’s human rights,” read a copy of the verdict.
“If there is not any other pending cases against him to keep him in the prison, this court orders his release by today and... the return to his country within 15 days.” Sobhraj needed open heart surgery and his release was in keeping with the law allowing the compassionate discharge of bedridden prisoners who had already served three-quarters of their sentence, the verdict added.
The notorious murderer underwent a five-hour cardiac operation in 2017 and the verdict said he remained in regular treatment for heart disease. Sobhraj will likely be freed from Kathmandu’s Central Jail on Thursday, an official at the prison said.
He will first have to appear in a lower court for administrative formalities before he can walk free, the official added.
Backpacker murders 
After a troubled childhood and several prison terms in France for petty crimes, Sobhraj began travelling the world in the early 1970s and wound up in the Thai capital Bangkok.
His modus operandi was to charm and befriend his victims — many of them starry-eyed Western backpackers on a quest for spirituality — before drugging, robbing and murdering them.
Suave and sophisticated, he was implicated in his first murder, that of a young American woman whose body was found on a beach in Pattaya wearing a bikini, in 1975. He was eventually linked to more than 20 killings.
His victims were strangled, beaten or burned, and he often used the passports of his male victims to travel to his next destination.
Sobhraj’s sobriquet,  “The Serpent”, came from his ability to assume other identities in order to evade justice. It became the title of a hit series made by the BBC and Netflix that was based on his life.
He was arrested in India in 1976 and ultimately spent 21 years in jail there, with a brief break in 1986 when he escaped and was caught again in the Indian coastal state of Goa.
Released in 1997, Sobhraj retired to Paris but resurfaced in 2003 in Nepal, where he was spotted in Kathmandu’s tourist district and arrested.
A court there handed him a life sentence the following year for killing US tourist Connie Jo Bronzich in 1975. A decade later he was also found guilty of killing Bronzich’s Canadian companion. In prison in 2008, Sobhraj married Nihita Biswas, who is 44 years his junior and the daughter of his Nepalese lawyer.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Ambulance workers walk out in strike-hit UK,Employees across the UK economy demand salary rises to match or beat decades-high inflation.,"LONDON: Striking ambulance workers in England and Wales manned picket lines on Wednesday, escalating a pay dispute between the government and a host of public-sector staff.
A series of stoppages are causing misery across Britain in the run-up to Christmas, with railway workers and passport control officers set to hinder festive holiday getaways as the government resists the growing pay demands.
Employees across the UK economy are demanding salary rises to match or beat decades-high inflation — currently running at nearly 11 percent — which is spurring the worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation.
“We’re not paid enough for what we deserve,” 24-year-old paramedic Kirsten Reid said in Crawley, southern England.  “Secondly, patient safety is a huge thing... our response times are shocking, and they need to be better.”  “We do 12-hour shifts with a 30-minute break, but they’re rarely ever 12-hour shifts. We’re usually overrun,” she added.
The government and unions continue to trade blame over the strikes amid fears of possible loss of life, as healthcare leaders warned about straining a system already in crisis.
On Tuesday, thousands of members of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) in England, Wales and Northern Ireland took to picket lines, five days after their first strike in its 106-year history.
Health Secretary Steve Barclay, writing in the Daily Telegraph newspaper, accused the unions of making a  “conscious decision” to  “inflict harm” on patients. GMB union national secretary, Rachel Harrison, hit back calling his comments  “insulting”.
“Ambulance workers are seething at such a crude, insulting attempt to divert attention from the government’s continued chaos in the NHS,” she said.
Around a dozen staff formed the picket line outside the ambulance base in Crawley.
“My members are striking today for fair pay. At the end of the day, they’ve had a 20 percent pay cut over the last 10 years, and they can no longer afford to keep going with that,” GMB union representative Lib Whitfield said.
Outside the West Midlands Ambulance Services’ hub in Longford in central England, striking staff stood behind a banner reading  “our NHS is under siege”.
As passing ambulances sounded their horns in support, union representative Steve Thompson called on the government to  “wake up and realise that this situation is serious”.

2022-12-22,2022-12-22,Govt calls emergency NA session today to approve controversial LG law,PML-N candidate seeks delay in polls; PTI leader files contempt petition against PM for changes in law.,"ISLAMABAD: The government has summoned an emergency session of the National Assembly on Thursday (today) to get Islamabad’s local government amendment bill passed, with an aim to increase the number of union councils and seek direct election for the post of mayor.
The session has been convened by President Dr Arif Alvi at a time when political parties are already busy campaigning for the local government polls scheduled for Dec 31.
In a related development, a ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) candidate and a senior member of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) filed separate petitions before the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on the issue with the former seeking postponement of the polls and the latter desiring initiation of contempt proceedings against Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his “cabinet” for making changes in the law which could cause a delay in the elections.
The National Assembly Secretariat on Wednesday issued a 10-point agenda which shows the Islamabad Capital Territory Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2022 standing in the name of Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah Khan.

PML-N candidate seeks delay in polls; PTI leader files contempt petition against PM for changes in law

The minister will also present a motion seeking to suspend the rules of the assembly to enable the members to pass the bill on the same day without referring it to the concerned committee and following the parliamentary procedure.
After passage of the bill from the lower house of the parliament, it will also have to be passed by the Senate before getting the president’s ceremonial assent.
It may be recalled that the National Assembly had been prorogued by the president only on Tuesday after passing the Foreign Investment (Promotion and Protection) Bill in a similar fashion and after suspending the rules. 
The federal cabinet has already approved the amendments to the law through a circular on Dec 19 after which the interior ministry issued a letter increasing the number of seats from 101 to 125. 
Moreover, the federal cabinet has also approved a summary for direct election of Islamabad’s mayor and for this necessary amendment, the bill is being tabled before the National Assembly.
Despite these developments, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), however, refused to defer the LG elections and vowed to conduct it in accordance with the already announced schedule.
Since the PML-N and PTI have brought this matter before the IHC, the fate of LG elections now depends upon the judicial verdict.
In the petition, PML-N candidate from Tarlai Union Council Shahzad Aurangzeb defended the government’s decision of increasing the number of UCs.
The petition stated that Islamabad districtfor the most part has been administered without a local government comprising elected representatives of the people until the passing of the 18th Amendment in the Constitution on April 19, 2010.
It said the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) Local Government Act 2015 in sections 5 & 6 of the Act, empowered the federal government to declare any area as union council and to divide an existing area of one union council into two and to notify the number of union councils in Islamabad, adding that the federal government had recently increased the number of union councils to 125.
The petitioner pointed out anomalies in the voters’ lists of different areas and said “in such conditions any election that is held would be disputed and cannot be declared as a free and fair election”.
It requested the court to set aside the ECP’s decision of conducting elections in 101 UCs.
On the other hand, PTI leader Ali Nawaz Awan asserted in the petition that the ECP in the light of the judgements of the superior courts announced schedule for local government elections in 101 UCs to be held on Dec 31.
“However, the federal government with utmost mala fide, has yet again in its bid to frustrate the process has done exactly what had been apprehended,” the petition said, adding that the act of federal government of increasing the number of UCs is a “clear attempt at frustrating the process and holding of elections, which is clear cut violation of the judgement of this court”.
According to the petition, the federal government was “well aware” of court’s directions, “however, the action of yet again increasing the number of UCs, merely 11 days prior to the elections…is a blatant disregard to the dictum laid down exhaustively by the court.”
The petition termed it a deliberate attempt to frustrate the judgement of the IHC.
Subsequently, it requested the court to initiate contempt of court proceeding against the prime minister and all the members of the federal cabinet.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Verdict reserved on appeal over Zahir’s sentence in Noor case,"The court asks lawyers to submit written arguments, if they want, within seven days.","ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday reserved verdict on a plea challenging the death sentence of Zahir Jaffer in Noor Mukadam murder case.
The two-member division bench comprising IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Sardar Ijaz Ishaq Khan reserved the verdict after the lawyers completed their arguments.
Jaffer’s lawyer, Usman Khosa, in his argument on the last day of hearing on Wednesday, said one of the reasons for giving the death sentence to his client could be to set an example that there was a lesson for others to not take such a step. 
He added that such a punishment was awarded to habitual criminals to create deterrence.
He said there was pressure on Pakistan at an international level to abolish the death penalty, adding that his client was an American citizen and a resident of New Jersey, where there was no concept of capital punishment. He urged the court to take this point into consideration.
Chief Justice Aamer Farooq remarked that abolishing the death penalty was a matter of legislation and only legislators could view this subject, however, he added that Pakistan was an independent country and it had its own law. 
The lawyer of the plaintiff, Shaukat Mukadam, said Jameel, Jaffer’s cook, worked during the day and had no role in the crime.
While the court inquired whether any drugs were recovered from the crime scene, Mr Mukadam’s lawyer Babar Hayat said no drug was recovered and the relevant report had been attached with the record.
The court also inquired about Noor’s handbag, which was not part of the record but it was visible in the CCTV footage.
Mr Hayat said only the prosecution could talk about the bag. After the two sides concluded their arguments, the bench reserved its judgement.
The court asked the lawyers to submit written arguments, if they wanted, within seven days.
The trial court in Islamabad had awarded death penalty to Jaffer in February 2022 for killing Noor Mukadam. Her body was found in Jaffer’s residence in F-7 on July 20, 2021.

IHC division bench comprising Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan took up the petition seeking protective bail for Aziz.
His counsel Amjad Pervaiz advocate argued before the court that Aziz was scheduled to arrive at Islamabad International Airport via Qatar Airways at 7:35pm on Dec 21.
He said Haroon Yousaf Aziz intended to surrender before the Accountability Court of Lahore in connection with assets reference case.
In the petition, Mr Aziz cited the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) chairman, NAB Lahore director general and Accountability Court Lahore judge as respondents.
He requested the court for grant of protective bail, enabling him to surrender before the competent court of law.
Mr Aziz is a co-accused in the assets reference.
According to NAB, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s family members received foreign funds through alleged fake transactions.
These transactions had been made through the company, allegedly owned by Shehbaz Sharif’s son-in-law Haroon Yousaf Aziz. 
The maximum numbers of fake transactions to the Shehbaz family had been made through Al-Zarooni Exchange of Dubai.
After hearing preliminary arguments, the IHC bench restrained the LEAs from arresting Aziz till Dec 22 and ordered him to appear in person on Thursday.
Further hearing in this matter has been adjourned till today.

ISLAMABAD: One of the top paediatricians of Pakistan, Dr Tabish Hazir, who served at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) for over three decades, breathed his last at the same hospital on Tuesday night, leaving his family, friends, and those whose children are in good health because of his efforts saddened.
His funeral prayers were offered at 4pm in B Block Model Town, Lahore, on Wednesday which were attended by a large number people including politicians, academics and medical practitioners. The deceased was later laid to rest in a local graveyard in Model Town.
Dr Hazir, 74, was the husband of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leader Dr Shireen Mazari and was suffering from colon cancer for the last two years. He had been under treatment at Pims.
Former Pims executive director Dr Ijaz Qadeer, while talking to Dawn, said Dr Hazir was a top paediatrician of Pakistan and his services for Pims would always be remembered.

Top paediatrician laid to rest in Lahore

He said the deceased established the paediatric department at the hospital and headed the neonatology department.
It is worth mentioning here that neonatology is a sub-specialty of paediatrics that focuses on medical care of newborns, especially those who are ill or premature.
“He believed in research and never stopped learning new fields while he was in the hospital. He was expert on issues related to reasons of death in newborn and also reasons of infection in children,” Dr Qadeer said.
Talking to Dawn, former vice chancellor of Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Medical University Prof Dr Javed Akram said he had frequent interaction with Dr Hazir as Pims was the affiliated hospital of the university.
“He was a thorough gentleman and professional. He was supportive of academics and was a supporter of the university. He was eager to do research, which is why I consider him as one of my best friends,” he said.
Dr Tabish Hazir’s sister Tamkinet Karim, while talking to Dawn, said her brother was born on May 31, 1958 in Lahore.
“He did his initial schooling in Sialkot and MBBS from Allama Iqbal Medical College, Lahore. He also did a number of courses and specialisation and joined Pims which he served till his retirement. He was under treatment at Pims at the time of his death. We shifted the body on Wednesday morning to his house in Islamabad and then to Lahore,” she said.
Ms Karim said the deceased had worked in collaboration with the World Health Organisation and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for the welfare of the children of Pakistan.
She said Dr Tabish Hazir and Dr Shireen Mazari separated 12 years ago but it was not correct that the couple had divorce.
“The deceased has a daughter Imaan Mazari-Hazir and a son Sabeel Mazari-Hazir,” she said.
Tamkinet Karim said Dr Hazir was the son of renowned poet Taufiq Rafat and wanted to be laid besides his father’s grave, which was why his body was shifted to Lahore.
She said Qul would be held on Thursday (today) in Model Town Lahore between 1pm to 3pm.

2023-12-18,2022-12-22,Work on widening of Soan River bridge restarts finally,RAWALPINDI: Work on widening the Soan River Bridge finally commenced earlier this week. The project is anticipated...,"RAWALPINDI: Work on widening the Soan River Bridge finally commenced earlier this week.
The project is anticipated to be completed by the end of Dec 2023.
The Soan River Bridge was two lanes wide on each side, but after work, it will have four lanes on each side.
According to an official from the National Highway Authority (NHA), widening of the bridge had been suspended in April 2022 after the contractor was black-listed and now a fresh contract had been awarded to Frontier Works Organisation (FWO).
The widening of the bridge across Soan River was started in 2017 and was scheduled to be completed by January 2022. However, the bridge will now be completed by the end of 2023.
Due to left-over construction material scattered on the bridge and its adjoining area, hundreds of commuters entering the city have been facing problems.
Motorists, while proceeding towards Rawalpindi from Rawat, face difficulty as safety walls of the bridge have been demolished by the previous contractor and left abandoned.
More than 62,000 vehicles cross Soan Bridge every day, where widening of the bridge began about five years ago and is yet to be completed.
The former chief of army staff had taken strict notice of the delay in the construction of Soan Bridge project and the poor workmanship and directed the authorities concerned to complete it without wasting time.
“I have never seen such sheer negligence in public welfare/important projects while living abroad,” said an expatriate who recently came to Pakistan to spend vacations with his family.

Students of Al-Huda International School took part in creating awareness about global warming by organising a science exhibition under the title ‘Earth Matters’. 
They displayed over 60 projects to highlight the issues of global warming, urging that an organic life style and natural method in work was the only solution to save the planet.
Topics like bio gas, water, solar energy, green grills, hydroponic planting, collection of garbage, floods and mitigation, importance of birds and so on were well covered by students through their projects. 
These topics were connected with Islam and its teachings and in all stalls, related verses of the Quran were also highlighted.
“Through this exhibition, we are trying to create awareness as environment is a serious issue the world is facing today,” said Fareha Wasim, a teacher.
A seventh grader said that everyone will have to play a role towards reducing the impact of fast changing climate. Another teacher Fouzia Umar said that besides taking care of the climate and human beings, there is also need to protect birds.
Students from montessori to senior grades constructed and displayed their projects. Each project was presented in a distinctive way and the uniqueness of the event was that each child participated and the projects were made from recycled and eco-friendly material.
The exhibition comprised of different sub themes such as ‘Green Vibes Only’, ‘Air Care’, ‘Slow the Flow’, ‘Master the Disaster’, ‘Waste Wise’ and ‘Now and Never’. 
The student’s project display and demonstration of projects was an effort towards provoking thoughts and leave the audience inspired. Students had captured the attention and focus of the audience and visitors throughout the day. 
The message from all students was clear and crisp that this was high time that we have to take care of our planet.
They emphasised that according to the Quran, environmental conservation is a religious duty as well as a social obligation and not an optional matter. The event was graced by dignitaries and educationists from the twin cities, journalists and the kinsfolk of the students. 
Different schools and university students also made an appearance and interacted with students. The programme was spread over two days and was split into three slots of morning and evening.

According to an FIR, police officials had detained a merchant from Peshawar and released him after receiving Rs1 million from his heirs.
Javaid Ahmad had come to Rawalpindi on Dec 6 with Rs300,000 to purchase some goods. He was sitting in a hotel when a man in police uniform came and started interrogating him. In the meanwhile, two persons also joined and snatched Rs300,000 from him.
Ammad Akbar, employer of Javaid Ahmed, said in his FIR registered with Pirwadhai police on Wednesday that the accused shifted the victim to an undisclosed location after covering his face. The victim was detained in a room where he was tortured by the kidnappers who demanded money from him. 
On Dec 8, the kidnappers forced him to talk to his family asking him to arrange Rs600,000 more for his release.
Rahimullah, a friend of the victim, brought the money to Rawalpindi. When Mr Rahim arrived in Pirwadhai, the kidnappers detained him as well and took the money. Later, they started demanding more money from Rahimullah following which Rs50,000 were transferred twice in the bank account of one of the accomplices of the police official.
“Yes, Javaid was tortured by the kidnapper,” Ammad Akbar told Dawn while quoting Javaid.

Headed by Interior Minister Ahmed Moallim Fiqi the delegation comprised Deputy Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs Ahmed Abdirahman Hassan, Deputy Minister of Interior-Puntland State Abdiwali Mire Hirsi, Deputy Minister of Interior-Galmudug State Ahmed Osman Adan, Minister of Interior of Southwest State Abdulahi Hassan, Adviser to Office of President Hoden Aden Osman, NIRA Director General Abduallahi Bihi Hussenand Ambassador Somalia Shirwa Abdullahi Ibrahim.
Tariq Malik said following Pakistani government’s ‘Look Africa Policy’, Nadra was poised to work closely with the Somalian government.
He assured the high-powered delegation that Nadra would surely extend all possible G2G support in ID-related projects and urged the visiting dignitaries to develop an ID ecosystem that would bring about ‘Single Version of Truth’.
The potential is endless for the digital public goods to be rolled out on the basis of a good ID system, he added.
The Nadra chairman said: “A good ID system helps build a strong democratic system, especially in developing countries. The ethos of democracy in ‘One Person, One Vote’ is better delivered through a national ID system that facilitates in development of computerised electoral rolls with negligible margins of voter fraud and other fraudulent practices.”
It is pertinent to mention here that under South-South cooperation, Nadra was assisting the governments of Nigeria, Sudan, Kenya and Somalia with regard to development of identity management and civil registration system.
The Somalian interior minister lauded the efforts of the incumbent Nadra chairman, Tariq Malik and his team. He showed his desire to get Nadra’s assistance for the Somalian government to develop a robust identity management system and its linkage with other disparate systems operating in Somalia and its states.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Call to ensure ease of business in pharma sector,ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PPMA) Chairman Arshad Mahmood on Wednesday said...,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PPMA) Chairman Arshad Mahmood on Wednesday said Pakistan would become Nigeria if ease of business was not ensured in the pharmaceutical sector, fearing that the country would be left with no choice but to import medicines worth $20 billion every year.
“The foreign exchange starved Pakistan should be eyeing on the export of pharmaceutical products which is an $1,800 billion industry. Even if we capture the market of Africa, which is an $86 billion market, we would be able to bridge the gap between imports and exports of the country. If ease of business would not be ensured, investments will be shifted from Pakistan to Bangladesh, China, Iran and other countries,” he said while speaking to participants at an international conference on pharma and healthcare.
Mr Mahmood said once Nigeria used to manufacture medicines but with the passage of time, it implemented conditions of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and increased taxes and now it was importing 100pc of its medicines.
“On Wednesday morning, I was shocked to see in a newspaper that the per unit cost of the pharma sector is going to be increased by Rs32 due to which, each unit of electricity will be Rs93. Currently, the per month bill of my factory goes over Rs4 million, out of which electricity charges remain around Rs1.8 million and the rest are all taxes,” he said, adding Pakistan can export medicines to a number of countries of Africa and some countries of Asia including Myanmar, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan.
“A number of companies have been manufacturing medicines for people of Pakistan but when they get orders to export medicines to other countries, the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap) refuses to issue them a letter of good manufacturing practices (GMP) and insists on carrying out another inspection of the factory. The letter is mandatory to export medicines,” Mr Mahmood said.
“It is unfortunate that Drap allows companies to sell medicines to people of Pakistan but does not allow exporting the same medicine to other countries. That is why our exports are worth $269 million. On the other hand, India has been exporting medicines worth of $24 billion per annum. The local industry has been providing medicines worth $5 billion to people of Pakistan and if manufacturing would be stopped due to high cost of production, Pakistan will have to import medicines worth of $20 billion because in that case, foreign countries/companies will provide medicines on their cost and conditions,” he said.
“We cannot compete with international/foreign companies by importing raw material. The business community has been thinking about shifting investments abroad because over here, policies are made without taking the stakeholders onboard. The government needs to take steps for industrialisation rather than depending on remittances of overseas Pakistanis,” he added.
During a panel discussion, member of the PPMA Central Executive Committee Usman Shaukat said it was time to enforce an export emergency in Pakistan to tackle the current economic crisis and pharmaceuticals can play a vital role in earning precious foreign exchange for Pakistan.
“A pharma export council needs to be set up immediately to enhance the exports of pharmaceuticals which has immense potential. The stakeholders such as Drap and Ministry of Commerce have already principally agreed to formulate the pharma export council and the industry requests the process to be expedited in order to facilitate exports,” he added.
It was high time that Pakistan pharmaceutical products reach developed markets such as the United States and Europe.
Drap Chief Executive Officer Dr Asim Rauf, who also attended the conference, said that all possible steps would be taken to facilitate the pharmaceutical sector and ensure increase in export of medicines from Pakistan.

2022-12-22,2022-12-22,CDA plans housing projects for expats to attract dollars,Auction of commercial plots also on the cards.,"ISLAMABAD: In a bid to attract foreign investment into the country, the federal government is looking towards the Capital Development Authority (CDA) to launch new housing schemes for expatriates to boost country’s dollar reserves.
The civic body has prepared a presentation which would likely be given to the prime minister on Thursday (today) in light of his directives pertaining to these housing projects.
Sources said the CDA was planning to develop Gandhara Enclave – a housing project which falls in Zone I and partially in Zone III – and the Kuri housing scheme. Similarly, the civic body will also brief the government about the revenue potential from the under-construction Nilor Heights housing project.
CDA Chairman Mohammad Usman and his team will give a presentation on the schemes, sources said, adding that the auction of some commercial plots will also come under discussion. They said both schemes have the potential to generate billions of rupees in revenue.

Auction of commercial plots also on the cards

In its briefing, the CDA would also inform the federal government that if it wanted to develop Gandhara Enclave on more than 5,000 kanals, then the civic body would need to acquire more land falling in Zone III. Under the current zoning regulations, construction in Zone III is not allowed. However, the CDA is reportedly working on amending these regulations.
Similarly, the sources said in the first phase, the Kuri housing scheme could be developed on 10,000 kanals. They said it would be one of the largest schemes if everything went as per the plan. Sources said the Kuri scheme could turn out to be a “complicated matter because of chronic and unsettled issues with the locals” also known as affected persons.
The CDA had acquired the land decades ago but after announcing the award, no serious step was taken for the development of the Kuri model village. The civic body officials said thousands of housing units could be constructed as part of this scheme.
The officials said after paying compensation and built-up property claims, the civic agency would have around 2,000 acres of land worth billions of rupees. However, the civic agency never made any serious effort to settle issues with locals to get land’s possession. The officials said an initial survey had shown 1,100 occupants on the said land, but in 2011 the number had risen to 7,000.
At that time, the CDA officials in connivance with locals added many bogus cases to the list of land ownership claims. Later, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) probed the matter and cleared 3,422 ownership cases.
The CDA officials said the civic agency had acquired the land in 1968 while the built-up-property award was announced in 1971. But the CDA failed to take possession of the land after removing the objections raised by locals. In 2009, the civic agency announced a revised built-up property award, but due to allegations of bogus claims, it could not resolve the issue.
“Since the federal government has been supporting CDA, we will deliver and will launch at least two housing schemes, with a focus on apartments,” a CDA official said. He added that the plots would be sold to developers and investors who will be asked to build apartments.

Health Services Academy (HSA) Vice Chancellor Prof Shahzad Ali Khan said majority of the Pakistani population is either depressed, experiencing stress or anxiety and are not very optimistic about the country’s future.
He was addressing the launch of the 24th Thematic Calendar by Jahan-i-Maseeha Adbi Forum (JMAF). The theme of the 2023 calendar is, under these circumstances, Allama Iqbal’s message of ‘Khudi’.
Prof Khan said that hopelessness and despair has spread among the youth and under these circumstances, Iqbal’s message of self-hood can lift the spirits of the Pakistani nation again.
He added that the Pakistani youth now consider everybody as corrupt and incompetent, adding that majority of youngsters are desperate to leave the country although the entire world is facing similar issues and problems like inflation, joblessness and recession.
“Initially, teachers and academia of our society was targeted and they were defamed, later, character assassination of physicians and healthcare professionals was carried out and the same treatment was met out to politicians,” Prof Khan said, adding that things were not as bad as they were being portrayed.
He lauded the philosophy of Iqbal, adding that he was able to turn youngsters from a minority group in the Indian subcontinent into a united force by teaching them lessons of optimism, enthusiasm and encouragement.
The event was organised in collaboration with pharmaceutical firm Pharmevo that has been promoting Iqbal’s philosophy among healthcare professionals throughout the country.
Syed Jamshaid Ahmed of Pharmevo stressed on establishing and creating a healthier society in Pakistan and said that for a healthier society, not just medicines but promotion of literary activities was essential like holding book fairs, mushairas and so on.
Renowned poet Ajmal Siraj said an advisory committee comprising educationists, writers and scholars selected life and literary works of Iqbal as the theme for the next year’s calendar.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Setback for MQM-P as ECP wants order to appoint administrators withdrawn,"PTI's Ali Zaidi claims the appointment of such officers around 20 days before LG polls is ""blatant pre-poll rigging"".","KARACHI: The Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan may suffer a setback as the Election Commission of Pakistan on Wednesday asked the Sindh government to reverse the appointment of three government officers, said to be party loyalists, as administrators of Hyderabad and Karachi’s East and Korangi districts.
On Dec 19, the provincial government had appointed Muhammad Farooque, Syed Shakeel Ahmed and Muhammad Sharif as the administrators of Hyderabad Municipal Corporation and district municipal corporations of Korangi and East districts in line with an agreement between the Pakistan Peoples Party and MQM-P.
Prior to their appointment, Mr Farooque and Mr Ahmed had been working as administrator of Worker Model School, SITE Hyderabad, and Korangi, respectively. Mr Sharif had earlier been working as director-charged parking at the DMC-Central.
However, their appointment is criticised by opposition parties, which termed it a pre-poll rigging attempt as local government elections in Karachi and Hyderabad divisions were scheduled to be held on Jan 15.
On Wednesday, the office of the provincial election commissioner in a letter addressed to the local government secretary said that ECP, through a notification issued on June 10, had imposed a ban on transfer/ posting during the conduct of local government elections.
It directed the local government secretary to either withdraw the order or kept it in abeyance till the culmination of the second phase of the local government elections in Karachi and Hyderabad divisions.
The letter reminded the government of an earlier ECP notification that states: “For Divisions in respect of which Election schedule of Local Government Elections has been issued no transfer / posting of the Government Officers and Officials including those of autonomous bodies/ Authorities shall be made without prior approval of the Commission till the publication of Election Results”.
Meanwhile, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leader Ali Zaidi said in a tweet that the ECP ordered withdrawal of the notification appointing administrators.

 





 
Earlier in the day, he told a press conference that his party had written a letter to the chief secretary and informed him that the newly-appointed administrators were affiliated with the MQM-P.
He said that the appointment of such officers as administrators around 20 days before the LG polls was blatant pre-poll rigging.
Also, the Sindh United Party (SUP) raised concerns over the appointment of administrators and Hyderabad commissioner before the LG polls.
SUP chairman and convener of the Sindh Action Committee Syed Jalal Mehmood Shah demanded that the ECP declare null and void the appointment orders of the new administrator and Hyderabad commissioner.

• Muggers shoot Bin Qasim SHO, friend over resistance
KARACHI: While police claimed to have killed two alleged robbers in Korangi in an encounter, in which two policemen also suffered bullet wounds, muggers’ criminal streak in the city continued with assaults, taking lives of a young man and a policeman in the same area on Wednesday.  
The SHO of Bin Qasim police station was also shot at and wounded by armed muggers in Gulshan-i-Maymar.  
In the first incident, the police said that Qayyum Umer, 24, was gunned down by robbers when he put up resistance near Ghousia Masjid in Korangi-3.  
Korangi-SSP Sajid Amir Sadozai said armed motorcyclists were looting his cousin at some distance. Qayyum was standing outside his home and saw the robbers looting his cousin. As he yelled at the robbers, the robbers opened fire on him and fled. He died on the spot.
The body was taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre to fulfil medico-legal formalities.  
Police Surgeon Summaiya Syed said that the victim sustained a gunshot injury to chest and arm. His family members did not allow doctors to complete medico-legal formalities and took away the body, she added.  
The relatives told media that the victim was an orphaned child who sold vegetables in the area to earn his living. Hailing from Mansehra, he also played football at a local club in Korangi.  
Later, police intensified patrol and snap-checking in the area in search of the killers.  
DIG-East Muqaddas Haider told Dawn that two policemen of ‘Shaheen Force’ indicated two suspects to stop in Zaman Town. However, the suspects opened fire on them and an exchange of gunfire took place in which Head Constable Manzoor Ahmed, 38, was killed and the suspects managed to speed away.
However, after an interval of around 30 minutes, the Korangi Industrial Area police spotted two suspects and another encounter ensued in Mehran Town.  
After an exchange of gunfire, two alleged robbers were shot dead while two policemen, Khan Razik and Sajid, were wounded.
The DIG East said that one of the injured policemen had identified both the deceased as the same criminals who had killed the head constable during the earlier encounter.  
He said they were also probing the possibility as to whether the same suspects had gunned down Qayyum over resistance as these three incidents took place in the same vicinity of Korangi. 
The deceased suspects’ involvement in the three incidents would be verified with witnesses’ accounts and matching of spent bullet casings found from the crime scenes, the officials added.  
SHO, friend wounded by robbers 
The Bin Qasim SHO and his friend were shot at and wounded by robbers off Superhighway on Wednesday.  
The SITE-Superhighway Industrial Area (SSIA) police said that SHO Irdees Bangash and citizen Asif Ibrahim, 36, got injured in the firing at an estate agency in Ahsanabad.  
East-SSP Syed Abdul Rahim Shirazi said that the SHO had gone there for some personal work. He was sitting with his friends when armed muggers arrived and attempted to snatch cash and other valuables from them.  
The SHO overpowered one suspect, but his accomplice opened fire resulting in bullet injuries to the police officer and his friend.  
One suspect, later identified as Nadeem, was also wounded by the firing of the SHO and arrested by a police patrol that reached the scene after hearing gunshots.
The SHO was taken to the Aga Khan University Hospital. SSP Shirazi said he suffered a bullet wound near the abdomen.
Bangash had served as SHO of the SITE-Superhighway Industrial Area police station and was recently transferred to the Bin Qasim police station.

The officer stated this in a report submitted in compliance with the bench’s directive to verify employees lists and find out if there were any ghost employees in the departments of education, health and police. 
The division bench, comprising Justices Shamsuddin Abbasi and Amajad Ali Sahito, had issued the directives while hearing a petition filed by advocate Mumtaz Ali Jesar. 
The director general of the Sindh monitoring and evaluation cell was directed to appear in person and file a detailed report regarding procuring the attendance of teachers and the process of issuance of form-II to stop the salaries of the absentees. 
But he was called absent while the deputy director of the cell said he had received the direction in late hours; therefore, the DG did not turn up. At this juncture, the director of school education said the DG was in contact with them.
The bench observed: “We [bench] are noticing this act of the DG with dismay, as he is deliberately avoiding appearing before this court and warn him to remain careful in future.” 
The medical superintendent of Chandka Medical College Hospital said he had issued a letter to the Larkana DAO for blocking the IDs’ of the ghost employees. 
“We have also noted with dismay that the secretary education, Sindh IGP and health department secretary, who were asked to upload the lists of their employees with names, parentage and CNICs on their official website but still compliance had not been made by them,” the two judges bench observed. “Once again we are directing them to upload the list of the employees and furnish report within a month’s time,” it added.
The court found the replies of the show-cause notices issued to the project director (PD) and registrar of Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Medical University (SMBBMU), for not appearing in hearing on Dec 14, satisfactory and vacated the notices, directing them to remain careful in future. 
The PD in his report said that the Higher Education Commission (HEC) and Sindh government were approached for a grant-in-aid of Rs1,820.124 million to complete their (varsity) projects, but they did not receive any response yet. 
The bench directed the HEC and Sindh government to provide required funds to the university for completion of their projects. 
Larkana Additional Deputy Commissioner-I Ms Rabia Siyal appeared on behalf of the deputy commissioner and submitted that technical assistance from the planning and development department was required to finalise the PC-I for the construction of a sewerage scheme for Larkana.

The commission’s member judicial-I retired Justice Arshad Noor Khan said at a press conference held at Darbar hall here the other day that it was regrettable that despite passage of five months to heavy rainfall, rainwater had still not receded from talukas of Sindhri, Jhuddo, Digri, Kot Ghulam Mohammad etc.
He said that similar flood situation might recur over succeeding years due to climate change. “We should therefore adopt a procedure to save population from big disaster in future and in this connection the district administration should perform its duties towards people with honesty and sincerity,” he said.
He said that even if they succeeded to persuade 50 per cent people they could save a large population from disaster. “We have discussed problems of masses particularly flood victims,” he said.
He urged the commission officers to go into the field to listen to grievances of masses and flood victims and resolve their problems by taking drastic measures within available resources.
Later, he held an open kachehry where social workers and villagers alleged that relief goods, ration, tents and food were distributed on the directives of political personalities and elected representatives while genuine victims, who were still living in makeshift huts along roads under open sky, were deprived of all government help.
They deplored that officers concerned of the district administration did not visit many flood hit areas to assess damage from the disaster and meet flood victim families. Most school buildings had suffered damage after flood and heavy rainfall, he said.
They claimed that blankets meant for flood victims were supplied to bungalows of feudal lords and were not distributed among flood victims.
They said that saline water was being drained with heavy pumping machines into West Jamrao canal, which was causing different diseases among masses.
They objected to a survey of damage to houses and crops carried out under supervision of army and revenue officials.
They accused deputy commissioner and other officers concerned of obeying orders of local ruling party MNAs and demanded authorities launch rehabilitation work and distribute wheat seed among victims without any discrimination.
They demanded the government immediately remove illegal encroachments from all waterways.
The kachehry was also attended by Mirpurkhas deputy commissioner Zainul Abideen Memon, SSP Asad Chaudhry, Zaheer Hussain and the commission member Noor Ahmad Narejo.

They were addressing a seminar on the “Strategic and Economic Dimensions of Pakistan and China Relations Amid Deepening Global Geopolitical Divide” at Sindh University on Wednesday. 
SU Thatta campus Pro-Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Rafique Ahmed Memon in his presidential address said that there were vast opportunities for cooperation in the field of higher education and research in China. 
He said that Chinese varsities could admit a large number of Pakistani students. Chinese educational institutions should register themselves with Pakistan accreditation bodies to resolve problems faced by Pakistani students on their return after obtaining higher degrees from various Chinese varsities. 
Pakistan Ambassador to China Moinul Haque said China’s production of Al-Khalid tanks and GF-17 Thunder fighter jets with Pakistan was actually a great proof of extraordinary defense cooperation between the two countries. 
He said that a cynical propaganda was being spread that the CPEC project would push Pakistan deeper into the debt mire, but it was not the case at all. 
Mr Haque said that it was important to open the CPEC project to public so that no propaganda could affect the friendship between the two countries. 
The two countries would soon start working on an important project to prepare submarines for Pakistan Navy and China would ensure access of Pakistani engineers to its manufacturing plant. 
He announced that the SU would be provided with opportunities to enter into educational agreements with top varsities of China so that it could advance in the field of higher education and research being an old varsity of Pakistan. 
Centre for International Strategic Studies Sindh (CSSS) Executive Director and former ambassador Kazi M. Khalilullah said: “Pakistan has a successful foreign policy, which we have to trust,” he said. Both countries had supported each other in testing times while in terms of defense, China had always helped Pakistan to stand on its own feet, he added. 
Former Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) chairman Dr Ansar Pervez said that Pakistan initially bought a nuclear power plant from Canada, but due to Canada’s coldness, the project could not go ahead and then China started the same project and it assisted Pakistan. 
He said that 325 megawatt nuclear power plant provided by China was successfully operationalized, adding that China’s cooperation was continuing to meet energy needs of Pakistan. 
Federal Minister Ahsan Iqbal, Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed and others also made speeches online.

The DC instructed Healthg CEO Dr Khalid Javed to suspend the missing employees from work and file a Peeda Act complaint against them. The department sought a reply from Dr Muhammad Naeem, in-charge of the Kunjrur BHU, Dr Qandeel Mughal, in-charge of the Chandrake Rajputan BHU, Dr Muhammad Owais Joya, in-charge of Chanduwal Kalan BHU, and Dr Amar Yasir, in-charge of the Shah Gharib RHC. 
Up to 47 health workers are subject to disciplinary action for missing work at government hospitals.
Health deputy district officer Dr. Muhammad Adnan was also suspended from service by the DC for carelessness and incompetence. As a result of the closure of government hospitals and the lack of staff, the DC also sent a letter to the Health Department requesting that the CEO be held accountable.
The Narowal DHQ Hospital’s shelter staff was also suspended for skipping work. Those residing there said they were awaiting breakfast when the DC came to assess the shelter in the morning.

2022-12-22,2022-12-22,Irregularities in Daska by-poll: LHC sets aside ECP action against election officials,"Court says after poll, duty staff no longer remains within ECP purview.","LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has set aside the proceedings against more than a dozen officials of the provincial departments initiated by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for their role in the alleged rigging committed in the 2021 by-poll of NA-75, Daska.  
“Despite repeated queries, learned counsel for the commission has not been able to convince this court that as to what is cavil with the commission to refer the matters of the petitioners for disciplinary action against them by their parent departments, especially, when they do not fall within the definition of election officials,” Justice Shujaat Ali Khan observed in his verdict allowing the writ petitions filed by Asif Hussain and 20 other officials.  
The petitioners challenged the show-cause notices and the subsequent proceedings against them by the ECP.
Senior lawyer Hafiz Tariq Naseem mainly represented the petitioners while other counsels adopted his arguments with little additions.

Court says after poll, duty staff no longer remains within ECP purview

The main argument presented by the petitioner’s counsel was against the competence of the ECP to issue the show-cause notices.  
Justice Khan observes that a person, who has been assigned any election duty, does not remain under the control and superintendence of the ECP upon declaration of fate of an election in a constituency simply for the reason that once fate of an election is declared the hiring staff lose their status as election official and the ECP does not enjoy jurisdiction to proceed against them.
He states that according to section 55(1) of the Election Act, 2017, a person can be deemed to be under the control, superintendence and discipline of the ECP for the period commencing from his date of appointment or deputation till publication of name of the returned candidate in the official gazette.  
“A cursory glance over section 55 of the Act, 2017 shows that the ECP has been empowered to proceed against an election official under the applicable disciplinary law,” he adds.  
The judge says it is very ironical on the one hand the counsel for the ECP took a specific plea that matters pertaining to pre- and post-election issues, including initiation of departmental proceedings against any delinquent official, are to be seen in the light of the referred provisions of the Constitution but has not been able to give any justification as to why impugned show-cause notices have been issued while relying on section 55 of the Act, 2017.  
Commenting on the case of one of the petitioners, the judge notes that the departmental proceedings against a government servant stand abated in the event of his retirement but initiation of the proceedings against the petitioner by the ECP, despite his retirement, speaks volumes about the fact that it proceeded to initiate proceedings against the petitioner without affirming as to whether he is in service or not.
Justice Khan maintains that upon declaration of fate of the election in the constituency, the petitioners no more remained the election officials, hence, the ECP has no jurisdiction to initiate proceedings against them.
“Resultantly, all these writ petitions are accepted and impugned disciplinary proceedings initiated by the Commission against the petitioners are declared coram-non-judice, thus, set aside,” the verdict reads.  
However, the judge, before parting with the judgment, observes that if the ECP thinks that the petitioners were involved in any subversive activities during their deployment in election duty, it would be at liberty to refer their matter to their parent departments for initiation of proceedings under the relevant law.

2022-12-22,2022-12-22,LHC’s power to review SC judgement on JIT questioned,The LHC bench will resume the case hearing today.,"LAHORE: Barrister Syed Ali Zafar, who represents the daughter of a woman killed in the Model Town firing, argued on Wednesday before a Lahore High Court larger bench that it did not have jurisdiction to review a judgment of the Supreme Court to constitute a joint investigation team (JIT) to reinvestigate the 2014 incident.
He contended that the merits of the case were discussed before the apex court.
He argued that the reinvestigation can indeed occur because the law makes no prohibition whatsoever on the extent or number of JITs that can be constituted, and therefore, a new independent investigation could be initiated to ensure that justice is served.
The bench is headed by Chief Justice Muhammad Ameer Bhatti with Justice Malik Shahzad Ahmad Khan, Justice Aalia Neelum, Justice Syed Shahbaz Ali Rizvi, Justice Mirza Viqas Rauf and Justice Tariq Saleem Sheikh.
Barrister Zafar pleaded before the bench that it had been impossible for the victims to expect justice when the investigating agencies were all headed by those who were directly linked to the perpetrators of the heinous act.
He alleged that as the ruling party at the time (i.e., PML-N) was directly involved in the Model Town massacre, its failure to hold anyone to account for this heinous crime must not be ignored.
The bench would resume further hearing on Thursday (today).
Khurram Rafiq and several other police officials facing trial in the private complaint by the PAT challenged the new JIT formed by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf-led provincial government. 
A three-judge bench had on March 22, 2019, suspended the new JIT.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Abdullah Sumbal posted as regular chief secretary,LAHORE: The federal government on Wednesday posted Abdullah Khan Sumbal as the Punjab chief secretary after a delay...,"LAHORE: The federal government on Wednesday posted Abdullah Khan Sumbal as the Punjab chief secretary after a delay of over three months when sitting CS Kamran Ali Afzal went on leave.  
Since then, the Punjab government has given look-after charge of the top administrative office to Mr Sumbal which was extended thrice. The PTI-PMLQ’s coalition government in Punjab views the development as a “serious move” at this critical juncture. However, it believes that the new chief secretary now commanding all administrative powers would not denotify chief minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi if the governor asks him to do so since Mr Elahi did not take vote of confidence on the advice of the Punjab governor.
However, sources in the bureaucracy say the chief secretary is bound to do what the law says, regardless how stakeholders interpret the constitutional provisions.
Earlier, the federal government notified the transfer of Kamran Ali Afzal, who is currently on 130-day ex-Pakistan leave, and transferred Abdulah Khan Sumbal from the Chairmanship of Punjab Planning and Development Board and posted him as regular chief secretary.Mr Afzal had earlier this month requested the Establishment Division to grant him 130-day ex-Pakistan leave as he wanted to travel to Australia. Eventually, the federal government accepted his request and assigned Mr Sumbal current charge of the office for three months with effect from Dec 7.
Mr Sumbal’s name was on the three-member panel sent by the PTI-PMLQ government to the federal government for the posting a regular chief secretary.
Meanwhile, the Punjab government transferred finance secretary Dr Wasif Khurshid and posted him as P&D Board chairman in his own pay and scale against a vacant post – after the posting of Mr Sumbal as chief secretary.
Punjab communications and works secretary Mujahid Sherdil has been transferred and posted as finance secretary. The additional charge of the C&W department has been assigned to Punjab housing urban development and public health engineering secretary Ahmed Mustajab Karamat in addition to his own duties till further order.

FIA Gujrat Deputy Director Ghulam Sarwar Warraich confirmed the registration of a case and said at least two of the suspects had been detained and an investigation was under way.  
The passport office’s former AD Saeed Abbas, data entry operator Zaheer Sial, clerk Shakoor Haider, a citizen Abid Hussain of Nankana Sahib and some other officials were among those booked under different sections of the PPC.  
The officials allegedly issued passports to Abid Hussain and his three children on the basis of fake documents. Using those passports, Hussain had flown abroad along with his children to avoid their possible handing over to their mother while a case was being heard in court.  
The Lahore High Court had ordered the FIA to investigate the matter and take legal action on the application of the children’s mother.  
Mr Warraich said the scope of investigation had been broadened to probe more officials.  
Hussain had first got registration documents of his children issued through the National Database and Registration Authority by showing someone else as his wife on an address in Gujrat, and later managed to get their passports processed with the alleged abetment of passport officials.  
A few weeks ago, the Interior Ministry had removed the entire staff of the passport office on charges of corruption and malpractices, and posted their replacements.  
The incumbent assistant director at the passport office, Hayat Tarrar, said his office had nothing to do with the case as the matter was already being investigated by the FIA.  
The next date of hearing of the case is Thursday (today) where the FIA officials would present the details of the investigation and action taken so far.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Amir Zulfiqar appointed Punjab IGP,"LAHORE: Ending the uncertainty with regard to the appointment of new head of Punjab police, the federal government...","LAHORE: Ending the uncertainty with regard to the appointment of new head of Punjab police, the federal government late on Wednesday posted Muhammad Amir Zulfiqar Khan as provincial police chief.
The federal government has issued the notification for appointment of Mr Zulfiqar as Punjab inspector general of police, who was deputy director general of the Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF). He has previously held the posts of National Highways & Motorway Police IG, Islamabad police IG and Additional IG Operations, CPO Punjab, Lahore.  
Mr Zulfiqar, as an assistant superintendent of police (ASP), won both top police honours -- the Quaid-e-Azam Police Medal and the Pakistan Police Medal. He belongs to Lahore and joined the Police Service of Pakistan (PSP) in 1991 and belonged to 19th Common.
He also served as Toba Tek Singh SSP, Special Branch Punjab SSP and Special Branch Lahore Region SSP, besides serving as Lahore DIG operations, Multan regional police officer (RPO), CTD Punjab DIG. He has served in Sindh, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and federal government.Earlier, a summary of seven police officers was forwarded to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for considering one of the officers for the Punjab IGP slot.
The BS-22 police officers who made a ‘late entry’ in the race for the Punjab’s top police slot are AD Khwaja, Rao Musthaq Ahmed Mehr, Rao Sardar Ali Khan and Ali Aamir Malik.The Punjab government had recommended the names of Fayyaz Ahmad Dev, Amir Zulfiqar and Ghulam Mahmood Dogar, all BS-21 officers for the Punjab IGP post.  
An  official privy to the process says the posting of regular IGP in Punjab was delayed because of the persisting political crisis in the  province. 
He  says that earlier the PML-N had almost agreed on the name of former Lahore capital  city police officer (CCPO) Fayyaz Ahmad Dev for the Punjab IGP slot as  PML-Q leader Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain, who recently joined hands with  the Shehbaz-led federal government, favoured the officer. Punjab Chief  Minister Parvez Elahi had also not objected to Dev’s posting, he adds.       
The official says that when the appointment of Mr Dev was  about to be made, suddenly the political situation in the province  became volatile in the aftermath of the PTI’s announcement to dissolve  the Punjab Assembly.
Meanwhile, he says, some of the BS-22 police  officers also geared up their efforts, using their political  connections, to be considered for the Punjab police’s top slot.  
Consequently, the PML-N government halted the process and added the  names of four senior police officers to the summary to the premier.
The  official source says the issue of appointment of regular IGP in Punjab  has been in the limelight since the PTI came into power in the Centre  and frequently changed provincial police chiefs during its more  than three-year long tenure.  
The crisis further  deepened when another provincial police chief, Faisal Shahkar, refused  to serve in Punjab in the wake of the political tussle between the PML-N  and the PTI-PMLQ governments in the Centre and Punjab, respectively. Mr  Shahkar had sent a written request  to the Establishment  Division to transfer him to the federal government, saying he was unable  to perform his duties in Punjab due to “personal reasons”. 
However, the  federal government asked him to retain his posting till the appointment  of new provincial police chief.
On Tuesday last, Mr Shahkar relinquished his charge as Punjab IGP, as he has to leave Pakistan for the United Nation where he has been selected for the top police slot.
The Punjab government had on Wednesday appointed BS-21 police officer Ghulam Rasool  Zahid, an officer of 19th Common, as acting police chief of the province.

The event, jointly organised by the Punjab University (PU) and GCU, received an enthusiastic and overwhelming response from the students of both varsities. Hundreds of graduates and final-year students flocked to the expo to explore employment and internship opportunities in reputed international and national companies.
Besides software houses and clothing brands, a large number of banks and student start-ups also set up their stall and interviewed the students for different jobs. Special recruitment information stalls set up by the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) and the Pakistan Navy remained the centre of attraction for the youth.
GCU Vice Chancellor (VC) Prof Dr Asghar Zaidi said career expos are usually underrated and misunderstood in Pakistani universities, adding that such events have a wider scope than only offering jobs and internship opportunities. “I urge even my first-year students to spend time with their future employers as they can help you network with people in the industry and you become more aware of the skills your industry values in an employee,” he said.
He said multiple job fairs are held in top universities of the world where students are encouraged to meet their future employers.
Information Technology University VC Dr Sarfraz Khurshid advised the students to never fear rejection, especially in job interviews, saying that many students don’t even try or appear for interviews just because of this fear.
Later, Prof Zaidi visited stalls of different companies and discussed with the executives their recruitment policies and criteria. He told the company executives that GCU not only focused on theoretical teaching, but also laid particular stress on the confidence and character building of its students so that they could perform exceptionally well in their professional lives.
Symposium: The Fatima Jinnah Medical University (FJMU) concluded its annual international scientific symposium on Wednesday. Prof Yasmin Rashid, Punjab health minister, said the occasion allowed teachers and graduate and undergraduate students learn more about current scientific research, which will ultimately help patients.
According to her, the FJMU and the associated Sir Ganga Ram Hospital effectively ran a number of health programmes.
For the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of genetic and hereditary blood illnesses, she claimed that the Punjab Thalassemia and Other Genetic Disorder Prevention and Research Institute, which was created here, offered the best resources.
The Fatima Jinnah Institute of Mother and Child Health, she insisted, was running smoothly.
The facility treats mothers and children, she said, adding that it would undoubtedly help reduce the province’s maternal and child mortality rate.
Health Secretary Dr Ahmad Javed Qazi, Federal Secretary Dr Ijaz Munir, FJMU Alumni Association of North America president Dr Fizza Zahid Rafique, King Edward Medical College Alumni Association of North America Dr Muhammad Fateh Shahzad, Allama Iqbal Medical College Alumni Association of North America president Dr Nusrum Iqbal, vice chancellor of the King Edward Medical University Prof Mehmood Ayaz, Allama Iqbal Medical College principal Prof Nadeem Hafeez Butt and Post-Graduate Medical Institute principal Prof Sardar Farid Al-Zafar were present.

— Dawn

 
RAHIM YAR KHAN: ‘Illegal’ fishing in different sections of the Indus in Rahim Yar Khan district continues due to non-issuance of tenders by the Punjab Fisheries Department (PFD).
According to sources in the PFD, the limits of the district starts from Panjnad and ends at Machka near Guddo, a long strip of almost 178 kms. The tenders for fishing in four sections of the Indus, including Samakka in Liaqatpur tehsil, Chachran Sharaif in Khanpur, Bangla Dilkusha in Rahim Yar Khan and Machka in Sadiqabad tehsil, are issued after a bidding process
The fisheries department issues tenders for permission of fishing to contractors in August every year but the PFD banned fishing this year to save the rare species of fish in the Indus. But many people started fishing in these sections of the river despite ban.  
Sources say the department [in Rahim Yar Khan] earns almost Rs20 million revenue from contractors by issuing tenders but current year tenders have not been issued as a result locals continued with ‘illegal’ fishing.  
After some complaints from the locals, the department has lifted the ban from fishing. Fisheries Assistant Director Ameer Nawaz Khan told Dawn that the secretary had banned fishing in August 2022 for 10 years but later due to some ‘unknown reasons’ he removed the restriction.  
He said during the ban, he along with his vigilance team raided different locations in the Indus and confiscated two hunting boats, four nets and six trappers. 
He said when his team tried to arrest illegal hunters, they escaped to the other side of the Indus but “my team always continues patrolling.”  
He said tenders would be issued from Dec 26, 2022 and after a bidding process successful contractors would start fishing in these sections.

2022-06-18,2022-12-22,ANALYSIS: ‘Constitutional battle’ likely to land in court,Legal experts believe that a legal battle appears to be the only way forward for resolution of the current crisis in Punjab.,"LAHORE: The ongoing ‘constitutional battle’ between the federal and Punjab governments is likely to land in courts as some questions of law have arisen after Governor Balighur Rehman asked Chief Minister Parvez Elahi to seek a “vote of confidence” in a special assembly session.
The dispute over the previous runoff election of the chief minister was also settled by the courts after the Supreme Court observed in June that a ruling passed by the presiding officer (deputy speaker) regarding the rejection of 10 votes of the Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid (PML-Q), polled in favour of Elahi, was in violation of its judgement and Article 63-A of the Constitution.
Punjab has not seen political stability since the ouster of prime minister Imran Khan through a “vote of no confidence” in April and several petitions are still pending before the courts relating to the chief minister’s election.
If a media statement of Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah Khan is to be believed, the coalition government in the centre is mulling over the imposition of “governor rule” in Punjab since Chief Minister Elahi has not taken a vote of confidence, as asked by the governor.
A source in Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) suggested that the governor, after denotifying the chief minister, could also ask him, under Article 133 of the Constitution, to continue to hold the office until the election of his successor.
Although the lawyers reached by Dawn for their comments differ on the governor’s orders issued to the chief minister, they are unanimous that a legal battle appears to be the only way forward for resolution of the current crisis in Punjab.
Shahzad Shaukat, a former advocate general of the province, believes that any party which feels aggrieved over the actions by the governor or the assembly Speaker is certainly going to knock at the door of the Lahore High Court as a first remedy.
He does not buy the Speaker’s argument that the governor cannot summon a fresh session when the house is already in session. He says the Constitution is superior to all the laws or rules in the country and it does not put such embargo on the governor.
Shaukat argued that the validity of ongoing sessions of the assembly summoned by the speaker can also be questioned since the session called by the governor, which was held in Aiwan-i-Iqbal, has not been prorogued.
However, Safdar Shaheen Pirzada, an advocate of the Supreme Court, disagrees and argues that clause 7 of Article 130 does not allow the governor to summon a fresh session when the house is in session.
He admitted that it is not a constitutional requirement that the speaker keep the house in session only to frustrate, on technical grounds, the governor’s directive to the chief minister to seek a vote of confidence.
According to Pirzada, the Punjab Assembly’s rules and the Constitution do not cater for a situation the province faces at present.
Misunderstanding
Talking to Geo News, retired Justice Shaiq Usmani said the Speaker had misunderstood the constitutional provisions while giving his ruling on the governor’s order.
He said Article 130 (7) says the governor can summon a session if he believes that the CM has lost majority in the house.
He argued that the Constitution has given powers to the governor to summon a session and ask the CM to show that he enjoys confidence of the house.
In reply to a question what would happen if the chief minister did not take a vote of confidence, he said the CM would cease to hold office and a new incumbent should be elected.
In another Geo News programme, a senior lawyer of the Supreme Court, Salman Akram Raja, said it is debatable that clause 7 of Article 130 says the governor shall summon the provincial assembly and require the chief minister to obtain a vote of confidence.
It means, he added, the present assembly is not in session and the governor has specially summoned the assembly for a vote of confidence. “And a new session could be called for this specific purpose.”
He said the rules of the Punjab Assembly, which speak about the vote of confidence, were made before the 18th Amendment. He believed confusion abounded and the speaker could explain through ruling whether he needs a new session for the vote of confidence or not, following the 18th Amendment.
Rule 22 of the Punjab Assembly (rules of procedure) says: “If, on the day fixed by the Governor for obtaining a vote of confidence from the Assembly under clause 7 of Article 130 of the Constitution, the Chief Minister refrains from doing so, it shall be deemed that he does not command the confidence of the majority of the members.”
In the same television programme, a former president of the Supreme Court Bar Association, Hamid Khan, said when an assembly is already in session, the governor is unable to call a new sitting under Article 130.

2022-12-22,2022-12-22,Lahore fog forces PIA to partly shift operations,All international PIA flights between 10pm and 11am to use Islamabad airport.,"RAWALPINDI: Due to poor visibility and fog in Lahore, Pakistan International Airlines on Wednes­day decided to shift all international flight operations between 10pm and 11am from the capital of Punjab to Islamabad.
The rescheduling of flights during these hours is temporary and will be restored as soon as the foggy conditions improve, according to the national flag carrier.
A PIA spokesman said, in a press release issued on Wednesday, the in­­ternational flight operations between 10pm and 11am was moved from Allama Iqbal Inter­national Airport to Islamabad due to foggy weather conditions. The move was aimed at ensuring air safety and saving long waiting time for passengers, he claimed.
 






For timely information of flights, air travellers, as well as those visiting the airport to pick or drop passengers, have been requested to contact PIA call centre at 786786111. PIA passengers have also been requested to record their correct contact number at the time of booking so that they can be provided with timely information about changes in flight timings through call or SMS.

All international PIA flights between 10pm and 11am to use Islamabad airport

The PIA spokesman made it clear that the arrangement for shifting the flight operations had been made temporarily in order to avoid inconvenience of ‘prolonged wait’ to travellers. As soon as the foggy conditions improved, the operations would be restored at Lahore, he added.
Motorway closure
Not only air travellers but also motorists using GT Road and motorway were facing problems due to the foggy weather.
The motorway section from Kot Momin to Faisalabad was closed due to the severity of the fog, which started to increase at around 6pm on Wednesday, DIG Motorway Police (North Zone), told Dawn.
He said the motorway’s closure depended on visibility usually affected by fog.
Heavy fog also caused problems on the Peshawar-Burhan highway, he said.
The Swat Expressway had already been closed for all types of traffic from Colonel Sher Khan to Ismaila due to fog, according to a motorway police spokesman.
He said the public had been requested to avoid unnecessary travel in foggy weather.
In case of necessary travel, however, drivers should use fog lights and ensure the functioning of backlights and wipers and seek assistance from helpline 130 before starting the journey.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Special JIT records statement of Arshad Sharif’s mother,Unsolved cases cast shadow over suitability of officer investigating journalist’s high-profile murder.,"ISLAMABAD: The Spe­c­ial Joint Investi­ga­tion Team (SJIT) on Wednesday visited slain journalist Arshad Sharif’s residence to record his mother’s statement.
In addition, it was learnt that members of the probe team are planning to head to Karachi to record the statements of family members of the two brothers Khurram and Waqar, who accompanied Sharif while he was in Kenya.
The government is also said to be considering the repatriation of the two men from Kenya, Interior Minis­ter Rana Sanaullah has already indicated that the journalist was murdered and the incident requires further investigation.
Separately, questions have been raised on the suitability of an individual who was part of the SJIT to probe the high-profile killing, as one of the officers on the team has previously failed to adequately probe two high profile murders that happened on his watch.

Unsolved cases cast shadow over suitability of officer investigating journalist’s high-profile murder

The capabilities of the official, who has served on the key posts of SSP and DIG Operations in Islamabad, was leading the capital police’s investigations into the Jan 2021 murder of 22-year-old Osama Satti, who was shot in his car by police officials, as well as the rape and murder of 10-year-old Farishta, whose family were allegedly subjected to humiliating treatment by the officials tasked with probing her initial disappearance.
The inquiry conducted to probe these killings blamed the SSP and DIG Operations for failing to “observe their legal responsibility”. 
An inquiry into the 2019 murder of Farishta held the SSP Operations and DIG Operations — both posts were held by the same person at the time — responsible, along with the capital police chief, since they “failed to meticulously observe their legal responsibility”.
Since the official in question held both positions concurrently, the inquiry report said, it was his responsibility to ensure the timely registration of the case and to post efficient SHOs. 
As per the record, the report notes, neither the inspector general or the DIG (Operations) conducted even a single inspection of the police station where the maltreatment took place. It further said the spirit of Chapter 22 of Police Rules 1934 “requires the supervisory officers to personally inspect the police station and note down their remakes in register No 13”.
A judicial inquiry into the murder of Osama Satti also blamed top Islamabad police officials for deploying the “Anti-Terrorism Squad/Crises Response Team, [a] highly skilled force that was not trained to restrain itself” in areas like Srinagar Highway.
It also revealed the Rescue 1122 team was given a “wrong address” and subsequently told to go back through wireless control as if “nothing had happened”.
**Dawn* reached out to the officer in question several times for comment, but he chose not to respond.*

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Flood-hit areas exposed to harsh winter: UN,ISLAMABAD: The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in an interim report on flood damage severity...,"ISLAMABAD: The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in an interim report on flood damage severity and propensity for severe weather says 14 districts of Sindh, 10 districts of Balochistan, nine districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and two of Punjab have been identified as the most exposed to difficult winter conditions.
The UNOCHA report, made available on Wed­nes­day, says that with the onset of winter season, stagnant receding water, displacements at inadequate and makeshift sites, damaged shelters and the lack of appropriate winter clothing, basic household items and safe heating supplies, are contributing to placing millions of people at risk of illness, disease and protection concerns, especially gender-based violence.
Currently, an estimated 14.6 million people need food assistance, while over seven million children and women need immediate access to nutrition services. This includes over 520,000 children facing severe acute malnutrition (SAM) requiring immediate treatment, and close to 80,000 children needing urgent medical interventions due to SAM-related medical complications, the report says.
Preliminary estimates indicate an increase in the national poverty rate of 3.7 per cent to 4pc as a direct result of the floods, placing between 8.4m and 9.1m people into abject poverty.
The report says the losses in food production are compounded by disruption of income and livelihood and the rising prices amid national and global inflation.
An estimated 4.4m acres of crop area, enough to cultivate crop for 14.6m people remain damaged, and more than 800,000 livestock lost.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Nawaz becomes latest beneficiary of amended NAB law,"Case against PML-N supremo, Zardari, Gilani about Toshakhana vehicles returned; court also lacks jurisdiction to try ex-president.","ISLAMABAD: PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif got the first benefit from the recent amendment in the accountability law when a court on Wednesday returned a Toshakhana reference to the anti-graft watchdog that had implicated him as well as PPP leader Asif Zardari and former premier Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani as accused.
The reference, relating to vehicles obtained by the two leaders from the state treasury with the help of Mr Gilani by paying small sums of money as is required by law, was returned by the accountability court to the NAB chairman citing lack of jurisdiction because of the National Accountability (2nd amendment) Act, 2022, that set Rs500 million threshold to make it triable as a NAB case.
Judge Mohammad Bashir returned another reference against Mr Zardari involving a Rs8.3 billion suspicious transaction between the account of Bahria Town and the account of an aide to the ex-president.
In the Toshakhana reference, the court had declared former prime minister Nawaz Sharif a proclaimed offender in September 2020.

Case against PML-N supremo, Zardari, Gilani about Toshakhana vehicles returned; court also lacks jurisdiction to try ex-president in reference involving Rs8.3bn

According to the reference, Mr Sharif and Mr Zardari obtained vehicles from Toshakhana by paying only 15 per cent of the price of the luxury vehicles.
NAB alleged that ex-PM Gilani had facilitated the allotment of vehicles to Mr Zardari and Mr Sharif by “dishonestly and illegally” relaxing the procedure for acceptance and disposal of state gifts vide a Cabinet Division memorandum issued in 2007.
Farooq H. Naek, counsel for Mr Zardari and Mr Gilani, argued before the court that the investigation report worked out that the national exchequer had suffered a loss of Rs118.52m whereas amendments to Section 9 and Section 10 of the National Accountability Ordinance (NAO), 1999, made earlier this year, had set Rs500m minimum value for a case to be investigated by NAB.
Moreover, he said, Sections 3-4 of the Anti-Money Laundering Act (AMLA), 2010, are not applicable to the case against Mr Zardari and Mr Gilani as there is no predicate offence that has been alleged against them, he said.
Mr Naek argued that since NAB lacks jurisdiction in the matter, the court has no jurisdiction in respect of the predicate offence under the NAO.
NAB prosecutor Sohail Arif, on the other hand, argued that the value of predicate offence as per the charge framed by the court is Rs118.52m, which is less than Rs500m as required under Section 5(o) of the NAO for having jurisdiction in the matter.
The court ruled: “In view of Section 5(o) of the NAO, 1999, when the value of the alleged offence under NAO is less than Rs500 million, the case is beyond the domain of NAB and trial under section 3-4 of AMLA, 2010 cannot be continued.”
It declared: “The jurisdiction of this court is as such ousted”.
The judge then returned the reference to the NAB chairman with the directive to the court staff to “return the reference books to the chairman through the investigation officer of the case”.
Suspicious transaction
The reference book pertaining to the Rs8.3bn suspicious transaction was also returned to the NAB chairman by the court.
The NAB had accused Mr Zardari of constructing his house in Clifton, Karachi, with the ill-gotten money. According to details mentioned in the reference, Mushtaq Ahmed, another accused, had provided Rs150m for the construction of the house.
The reference said that Mr Zardari could not provide proof of his claim that he had built the house through legal means.
According to the reference, an illegal transaction of Rs8.3bn was made via Mushtaq Ahmed’s bank account with the money being paid to M/s Bahria Town (Pvt) Limited.
Mushtaq Ahmed worked as a government employee in the President House from 2009 to 2013. He was recruited as a stenographer on the recommendation of Senator Rukhsana Bangash.
Another accused is Zain Malik, son-in-law of Bahria Town’s owner Malik Riaz.
Mr Naek argued that NAB had no jurisdiction to investigate this case since the “value of the offence is Rs150 million which is less than Rs500 million as required under Section 5(o) of NAO added through the NAO 2nd amendment Act 2022 and is given retrospective effect”.
The court noted that it lacks jurisdiction in this matter as well and directed the court staff to return the case file to the NAB chairman.

2022-12-22,2022-12-22,Federal govt consulting provinces on plan to save energy: Asif,QUETTA: The federal government has thrashed out a strategy for energy conservation and started consultations with...,"QUETTA: The federal government has thrashed out a strategy for energy conservation and started consultations with provincial governments in order to remove its flaws before implementation, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said during a meeting at the Quetta Airport on Wednesday.
Petroleum Minister Musadik Malik, Prime Minister’s Adviser Qamar Zaman Kaira, Maulana Abdul Wasey of the JUI-F and Energy Secretary Rashid Mahmood Langaryal accompanied Khawaja Asif.
The defence minister said the government was determined to save energy consumption by adopting drastic measures that would require the nation to make “radical changes in lifestyle”. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had directed the cabinet to share recommendations of a special committee for energy conservation with the provincial governments, the minister said.
The present government inherited a host of problems after taking over in April, a lack of money among them. “But the floods made matters worse by rendering millions of people homeless and financially vulnerable,” the defence minister observed.
Khawaja Asif said the entire world, except Pakistan, opens for business in the morning and downs shutters by sunset. “But the situation is starkly different in our country as markets remain open till late in the night, causing a colossal waste of energy.”
The minister said the special committee had suggested closure of markets and business establishments by 8pm and restaurants by 10pm. “The panel has also suggested changing the working hours of government offices.”
He expressed confidence that the nation would cooperate with the government in implementing the energy conservation strategy.
Khawaja Asif and other members of his delegation stayed at Quetta airport for several hours before returning to Islamabad. Senator Manzoor Kakar, Balochistan’s Finance Minister Zamarak Khan Achakzai and representatives of the Traders and Farmers Action Committee had a meeting with Khawaja Asif at the airport and offered suggestions for resolving the energy crisis.

• Party also elects central and provincial office-bearers
QUETTA: The seventh National Con­gress of the Pashtoonkhwah Milli Aw­a­mi Party (PkMAP) on Wednesday re-elected Mahmood Khan Achakzai as the party’s chairman, Arshad Khan Sw­­abi as senior deputy chairman and Abdul Rahim Ziaratwal as general secretary.
The three-day congress, which concluded on Wednesday night, also elected central and provincial office-bearers, including Abdur Rauf Lala as deputy chairman, and Attal Khan Achakzai as senior deputy secretary.
Among the central secretaries elected were Nawab Ayaz Khan Jogezai, Jumma Gul, Rasan Safi, Nazir Jan Lala, Malik Shaukat, Talimand Khan, Dr Kaleemullah, Fazal Qadir Sherani, Dr Hamid Khan Achakzai, Musa Bacha, Jabbar Khan and Dr Jamil Khan Panizai.
The provincial presidents elected by the party congress included Abdul Qahar Wadan for Balochistan, Dr Mohammad Ali for Khyber Pakhtu­nkhwa, Janan Afghan for Punjab, and Saleem Tareen for Sindh.
The congress also elected national and four provincial Qaumi Jirgas as an electoral college to elect central, provincial executives or cabinets and working committees, respectively.
The congress, attended by delegates from all provinces, discussed organisational affairs, structure and constitution, and endorsed decisions taken by the party chairman in the interim period between the sixth and seventh congresses.
Speaking on the occasion, Mr Achakzai highlighted the egalitarianism of the Pakhtun society in which the noble and a commoner could eat at the same table without any discrimination.
He said Pakhtuns had contributed to human civilisation and politics by constituting states, kingdoms and governance systems on Pakhtun-Afghan land as well as in the subcontinent in various periods of history. For instance, he said, the Sher Shah Suri model of governance and administration was still a point of reference for a welfare system.
“Foreigners’ travelogues have recorded that in Pakhtuns’ land, food and boarding are free for travellers and strangers, as hospitality is enshrined in the codes of ‘Pashtoonwali’,” Mr Achakzai said and wondered how such a society could breed terrorists and terrorism.
The PkMAP chairman said that terrorism and ensuing physical, political and economic sufferings inflicted on Pakhtuns and Afghans living on both sides of the Durand Line were the direct outcome of the international and regional powers’ policies and they pursued their nefarious strategic and economic interests.
He said if the prevailing situation in Afghanistan was not handled humanely and according to principles of international justice and peaceful co-existence, its seismic effects could be felt across the region and beyond.
He said that several superpowers entered as aggressors to conquer Afghanistan, but they never succeeded in their designs.
He urged Pakhtuns to forge unity in their ranks to counter the existential threats that they currently face.

Special Judge (Central) Azam Khan observed that Senator Swati had repeated the same crime in which he was already on a post-arrest bail.
During the course of the hearing, FIA’s special prosecutor Raja Rizwan Abbasi argued that Mr Swati operated a verified Twitter account and he was being followed by politicians, journalists and the public at large. He said Mr Swati never contested the ownership of his Twitter handle and used it to build an anti-army narrative.
Mr Abbasi claimed this was a deliberate attempt to incite mutiny among personnel of the armed forces. He said the PTI leader misused the relief of bail and tweeted the same text for which he was facing a case before the FIA’s Cybercrimes Wing.
Mr Swati’s counsel Babar Awan argued that the complainant, who had lodged the first information report (FIR) against his client, was not an aggrieved party.
He said the case had been registered by the FIA and it was not on a par with the complaint filed under defamation laws.
Mr Awan argued that the court could impose a maximum penalty of Rs1,000 on Mr Swati over his tweet, but he was being moved from one province to another.
The FIA had earlier this month arrested Mr Swati for defamation, statement conducing to public mischief, and highly obnoxious campaign of intimidating tweets, after his fiery speech at a PTI long march in Rawalpindi in which he lashed out at the senior military leadership.

2022-12-20,2022-12-22,‘TTP is Pakistan’s absolute red line’,Bilawal says Islamabad willing to consider all options to ensure citizens’ safety and security.,"WASHINGTON: Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has suggested letting neighbouring countries know that the outlawed TTP is an “absolute red line” for Pakistan and it would not allow anyone to cross that line.
“As far as the TTP (Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan) is concerned, it’s absolutely our red line. It is something that we will not tolerate,” said the foreign minister while speaking at the Atlantic Council, Washington, on Tuesday evening. 
“And absolutely we will be willing to consider each and every single option to ensure the safety and security of our people.” 

 





 
As the foreign minister stressed the need for combating militants in his Washington talk, Pakistan’s UN Ambassador Munir Akram told the UN Security Council in New York that engagement with the Taliban was the best option to stabilise the region.
“Coercion and isolation have not proved successful in the past; they will prove to be counter-productive now and in the future,” said Ambassador Akram while participating in a UN debate on the situation in Afghanistan. “We need a coherent and practical plan to realise the objectives of the international community through patient engagement with the interim government,” the Pakistani envoy told the 15-member Council.

Bilawal says Islamabad willing to consider all options to ensure citizens’ safety and security

Mr Bhutto-Zardari made a similar observation in his talk at the Atlantic Council, urging world powers to work with Afghanistan’s de facto rulers to stabilise the region. When the moderator, Uzair Younus, asked if Pakistan could deploy troops inside Afghanistan or on the border to stop attacks by Afghanistan-based militant groups, the minister suggested using the “hammer and anvil” strategy, with Kabul’s cooperation, to eliminate militancy.
The chief Pakistani diplomat pointed out that despite these border and cross-border attacks, the situation was far more secure and stable now than it was in 2007, when Pakistan launched a series of operations against the TTP and other militants.
“But those things can be put at risk if this goes unchecked. And obviously that would undermine any hope, whether it is CPEC or any other form of economic activity. Nobody wants to put lives at risk in order to conduct business,” he warned.
“That’s why I have been particularly hawkish on the issue of the TTP, and on the issue of terrorism in general. I believe that recent events in the region are alarming, not only the border incidents but the recent Bannu incident, which our security commanders have very bravely managed to overcome,” he said.
The foreign minister, however, stressed the need to “impress on our neighbours, particularly Afghan­istan” that they have to demonstrate the will and the capacity to take on the TTP or other groups functioning from there.
He acknowledged that there’s room for improvement in Pakistan’s Afghan policy — as there’s in America’s — and “we need to be serious about what we can do going forward”.
“Are we going learn from our mistakes to ensure that we do not repeat them,” he asked. “The answer to that question is going to define the safety and stability of Afghanistan, the safety and stability of Pakistan and the safety and stability of our region.” 
Pakistan’s number one option, he said, was to get the Afghan interim government to demonstrate that they had the capacity to deal with this issue.
Separately, the foreign minister also met Deputy Secretary of State Wendy R. Sherman where they discussed Pakistan’s efforts to recover from devastating floods and the upcoming Jan 9 International Con­ference on Climate Resilient Pakistan in Geneva. 
According to a readout issued by the State Department, the US official expressed condolences for Pakistani lives lost in recent terrorist attacks, and they committed to strengthen cooperation between the two countries.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,ECC defers PSO’s request for Rs17bn,Receivables of embattled national fuel supplier cross Rs612bn.,"ISLAMABAD: The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet was informed on Wednesday that receivables of the national fuel supplier – Pakistan State Oil (PSO) had crossed Rs612 billion and it was struggling to manage remittances to its foreign suppliers.
The meeting of the ECC presided over by Finance Minister Ishaq Dar, however, did not immediately approve Rs17bn urgently demanded by the PSO to honour its liabilities to international firms, particularly its long-term fuel supplier Kuwait Petroleum Company (KPC).
“The ECC deferred a summary submitted by the Ministry of Energy (Petroleum Division) for foreign exchange coverage to PSO and directed the Ministry of Energy to resubmit the summary after reviewing the numbers”, said an official statement.
The Petroleum Division reported that under a credit facility provided by KPC since 2000 and extended annually for the supply of diesel, a joint account of the federal government and KPC had been set up with the National Bank of Pakistan in which PSO keeps on depositing rupee equivalent funds after 30 days of the bill of lading for each shipment.
After 90 days from the bill of lading, the NBP has to transfer the cargo cost to KPC and exchange cover for an additional 60 days is borne by the federal government.
However, the account facility started to face huge shortfalls in April 2020 on account of exchange losses, posing a default situation in remittances to KPC.
At the time the ECC approved a supplementary grant of Rs12bn which helped PSO avoid an international default. The facility worked well for another two years but then suffered a shortfall again and now this shortfall stood at Rs17bn owing to “prevalent upheaval” in the rupee-dollar parity.

Receivables of embattled national fuel supplier cross Rs612bn

The Petroleum Division said the PSO had been defaulting even on rupee deposits in the NBP account because of its liquidity challenges as its receivables reached Rs612bn and “it urgently required adequate funds so that liabilities are met on time”. 
The Petroleum Division and PSO have been trying to manage the situation for avoiding international default by depositing required funds on due dates but the situation was “too critical” now.
It also complained that the Petroleum Division had been submitting budget requirements for exchange loss on this facility every year but the Ministry of Finance did not make separate provisions which led to exposure to international default.
The finance ministry, however, argued that the government had already released Rs30bn to address PSO’s liquidity position under the foreign exchange head in September and arranged another Rs50bn through market financing. Also, the government was now trying to ensure PSO recoveries through power companies and gas companies.
The Petroleum Division, however, insisted that the matter related to actual foreign exchange loss of over Rs17bn so far on the KPC’s credit facility up to Dec 2, which has to be paid by the government sooner or later.
“PSO has made all outstanding payments delayed due to liquidity position. Exchange loss, however, is the liability of the government”, Petroleum Division was quoted but a decision was deferred.
Supplementary grants
The ECC approved a summary of the Ministry of Energy (Petroleum Division) on the transfer of 30pc working interests in exploration licences/block – Margala Block – owned by M/s MOL of Hungary to M/s Mari Petroleum Company Ltd. 
It was apprised that Margala Block was governed by Pakistan Petroleum Exploration and Production Rules 2001 and the acquiring company MPCL was operating in Pakistan since 1954 and has working interests in 23 exploration licences and 15 development & production leases. The ECC was further informed that M/s MOL had cleared all its financial obligations.
The ECC also approved a Rs823m technical supplementary grant to the Ministry of Maritime Affairs, enabling Gwadar Port Authority (GPA) to disburse the amount of Rs250,000 per head to 3,291 fishermen registered with Balochistan Fisheries Department for the purchase of boat engines.
The ECC also approved another Rs200mn Technical Supplementary Grant to the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulation and Coordination for Ghurki Trust Teaching Hospital (GTTH), Lahore. Ghurki Trust Teaching Hospital (GTTH) is a tertiary care non-profit organisation providing “State of the Art” health facilities to needy and poor patients.

Chinese Ambassador in Islamabad Nong Rong called on Finance Minister Ishaq Dar on Wednesday and “assured continuous support of the Chinese government to Pakistan”, the finance ministry said in a statement.
The “government of China stands with the people of Pakistan and is willing to provide all kinds of assistance”, the statement added.
Mr Dar told reporters last month that Pakistan had sought about $9bn in additional financial support from China during the visit of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to Beijing, and that the Chinese leadership had promised to “roll over $4bn in sovereign loans, refinance $3.3bn commercial bank loans and increase currency swap by about $1.45bn — from 30bn yuan to 40bn yuan”. The total worked out at $8.75bn.
Pakistan needs at least $34bn until June 30, 2023, to meet its international liabilities, including debt and trade payments. Pakistan is banking on about $13bn in additional support from China and Saudi Arabia.
The statement said Mr Dar “thanked the Chinese ambassador for their continuous support and assistance” and praised the long-standing and deep-rooted friendly relations between the two countries.
Both sides deliberated on several avenues for expanding bilateral relations, especially in the economic and financial sectors. The ambassador appreciated the government’s policy initiatives to sustain and boost fiscal and monetary stability.
Mr Dar had earlier said that the Chinese president and prime minister had assured Prime Minister Sharif that his government would stand by Pakistan and “will not let you down”.
He had then separately taken up the issue of refinancing $3bn in China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) deposit and about $3.3bn debt rollover. Both these heads are due for maturity on different dates before June 30.

Locally known as a term finance certificate (TFC), the debt instrument will contribute towards the bank’s Additional Tier 1 Capital for the capital adequacy ratio (CAR). This category of capital consists of instruments that aren’t equity but can be converted into shares in case a trigger event occurs.
The bank, which is mainly owned by the Punjab government, will use the funds in its regular business operations, the lender said in the term sheet of the issue.
The bond is perpetual in nature, which means there’s no redemption date and bondholders can liquidate their investments in the secondary market at the time of their choosing.
The investment will offer a floating rate of six-month Karachi interbank offered rate (Kibor) plus 200 basis points if the bank is compliant with CAR, minimum capital requirement (MCR) and leverage ratio (LR) at the end of a given period.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,CM Elahi on thin ice after ruling by speaker ‘rejected’,"• Sana hints at governor’s rule in Punjab, says Elahi’s de-notification imminent • Interior ministry asks Rangers, FC to perform","• Sana hints at governor’s rule in Punjab, says Elahi’s de-notification imminent
• Interior ministry asks Rangers, FC to perform security duties in Punjab
LAHORE: In a tit-for-tat move, Governor Balighur Rehman on Wednesday termed the ruling of Punjab Assembly Speaker Sibtain Khan disposing of his directives regarding the vote of confidence “unconstitutional”, whereas the coalition government hinted at the imposition of governor’s rule in Pakistan’s largest province.
The PML-N government initially hinted that governor’s rule could be imposed for two months through a resolution in a joint session of parliament, but the period could be extended to six months.
“Since the chief minister on Wednesday failed to take the trust vote in the Punjab Assembly in compliance with the governor’s order, legally he ceases to hold his office. And now any time... probably on Thursday (today), the governor can issue an order de-notifying the CM,” Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah said earlier in the day.
This view was echoed by SAPM Attaullah Tarrar, who told reporters late on Wednesday night that the governor had discretionary powers to de-notify the CM and it was up to him whether he wanted to do it “tomorrow or the day after”.
Another option, Mr Sanaullah said, is governor’s rule by the Centre. “In the wake of the constitutional crisis, the government may get a resolution passed from the National Assembly and Senate to impose governor’s rule in Punjab for two months initially — the period can be extended to six months as well,” the minister added.
He was of the view that “all was not well” in the camp of Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Punjab parliamentary party. “Had the PTI been confident that CM Elahi could secure the support of 186 MPAs in the PA he would have gone for the trust vote on Wednesday in compliance with the governor’s order,” he said, adding that the CM could have gone for PA’s dissolution after the vote in line with Imran Khan’s plan for the dissolution of assemblies. “But the PTI chose otherwise because it knew it did not have the required number,” Mr Sanaullah claimed.
Governor’s order on PA speaker ruling
In the late evening, Governor Rehman wrote a three-page order in response to PA Speaker Sibtain Khan’s ruling which had termed Mr Rehman’s order seeking vote of confidence from Mr Elahi ‘illegal’.
In his order, the governor said under Article 130(7) of the Constitution that PA speaker’s ruling had no bearing on his order and termed it unconstitutional. The governor said the speaker’s ruling was also in violation of Rule 209 of the Rules of Procedure of the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab, 1997.
“The speaker’s ruling, consequent acts and omissions constitute and result in enabling the chief minister to refrain from obtaining a vote of confidence in terms of Article 130(7). Helping and aiding the CM in refraining from fulfilling his duty and preventing the constitutional process from proceeding to its logical end leads to the consequences stipulated in Rule 22 (7) of the Rules of Procedure of the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab, 1997.”
Meanwhile, taking a screenshot of the governor’s reply, PTI senior leader Fawad Chaudhry, in a tweet, asked Mr Rehman not to make a mockery of his office. “Dear Governor! Do not make a mockery of your office, the speaker’s ruling is final as far affairs of the Assembly are concerned and do not expose yourself to misconduct proceedings. Respect the Constitution,” he added.
Earlier in the day, the governor held a meeting with the PML-N and PPP leaders and legal experts to discuss the strategy of the federal government. Federal ministers Rana Sanaullah and Saad Rafique, premier’s special assistants Attaullah Tarar and Malik Ahmed Khan, and PPP Punjab parliamentary party leader Hasan Murtaza were present in the meeting.
Separately, the federal government on Wednesday decided to deploy Pakistan Rangers and Frontier Constabulary (FC) across Punjab, interior ministry sources said, adding that the federal agencies would ensure law and order in the province and work for implementation of laws and Constitution.
Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah directed the Punjab chief secretary and inspector general of police to maintain law and order, protection of the life and property of the people, and perform their duties as per law and Constitution, sources said.
The interior minister also warned officials not to become part of any process that was against the law and Constitution.

2022-12-22,2022-12-22,‘Unconstitutional’ removal of chief minister to be opposed: PTI,Imran to announce party’s future course of action at protest today.,"• Imran to announce party’s future course of action at protest today
• Fawad claims Zardari offered PTI women MPAs Rs50m each to abstain from voting
• As per agreement with PTI, PML-Q to get 30 PA, 15 NA seats 
LAHORE: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has announced that it will challenge any “unconstitutional” move of de-notifying Punjab Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi, and asked its leadership, parliamentarians and party workers to reach the Governor House at 5pm on Thursday (today) to ‘block’ the governor from taking any such action.
PTI Chairman Imran Khan will address the protesters through video link and announce the party’s next line of action in the face of the provincial opposition’s moves to save the Punjab Assembly.
Earlier on Wednesday, Governor Balighur Rehman had declared Punjab Assembly Speaker Sibtain Khan’s ruling regarding CM Elahi’s vote of confidence “unconstitutional” and “illegal”.
On Tuesday, the speaker had termed the governor’s orders — to the CM to obtain a vote of confidence from the provincial assembly by 4pm on Wednesday — as “illegal, against the provisions of the Constitution and thus stand disposed of”, and issued a ruling in this regard.
The PTI leadership on Wednesday maintained the speaker had ruled that the assembly was in session and until the session was prorogued, the governor could not summon a fresh session, citing a 1997 ruling by the Lahore High Court. They said the court had ruled that “not less than 10 clear days” must be granted to the chief minister to obtain a vote of confidence.
PTI Central Punjab General Secretary Hammad Azhar gave a call to PTI leaders, lawmakers and party workers and supporters to reach outside the Governor House at 5pm on Thursday (today).
“The masses can no longer remain silent spectators while an unconstitutional game is being played,” he remarked.
Meanwhile, the federal government has sought deployment of Rangers to beef up security of the Governor House “till further orders under sections 7(b) and 10 of the Pakistan Rangers Ordinance, 1959 and Section 4(3)(i) of Anti-Terrorism Act 1997”.
“The Pakistan Rangers (Punjab) is requested to immediate necessary action with regard to beefing up the security at the Governor’s House, Lahore, in coordination with the office of the governor,” said the Interior Ministry.
PTI senior leader Fawad Chaudhry told the media outside party chief Imran Khan’s Zaman Park residence that the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) parties were ‘scared of’ holding general elections, adding they would be violating the Constitution’s Article 109 by asking the chief minister to take a vote of confidence immediately. 
He said the governor should give 10 clear days for the vote or challenge the Punjab Assembly speaker’s ruling in court.
He further said the PTI had called its parliamentary party meeting on Thursday (today) and stressed its 177 as well as the PML-Q’s 10 MPAs were available to foil a no-confidence motion submitted by the PML-N and the PPP separately against the chief minister as well as the Punjab Assembly speaker and deputy speaker.
Mr Chaudhry also claimed that the party’s women MPAs had told Mr Khan that they were receiving offers from former president Asif Zardari to abstain from voting for Rs50 million each.
“The people of Sindh should know that Asif Zardari is spending their welfare money to buy loyalties of PTI MPAs,” he said.
Claiming that some other MPAs had also received threatening calls to abstain from voting, he demanded the superior courts take notice and identify those who were trying to terrify the party legislators.
“As soon as the vote of no-confidence fails, the Punjab Assembly will be dissolved and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly will follow suit,” he declared.
On the other hand, a three-member committee of the PTI held a meeting with CM Elahi and his party members and discussed seat adjustment prospects in detail.
As part of a formula, sources said, the PTI agreed to offer 30 Punjab Assembly and 15 National Assembly seats to the PML-Q. The party of the Chaudhrys had sought seats in the newly created Gujrat division – their hometown -- that included Gujrat, Mandi Bahauddin, Wazirabad and Hafizabad districts, some parts of south Punjab as well as Sialkot.
PTI leader Shafqat Mahmood later confirmed that both the allied parties had mutually agreed over giving 30 Punjab and 15 National Assembly seats to Mr Elahi’s party.
Meanwhile, the PML-Q held its parliamentary party meeting, chaired by CM Elahi and parliamentary leader Sajid Bhatti, and discussed the current political situation and decided their future course of action.
The chief minister has also called the provincial cabinet’s seventh meeting at his office on Thursday (today) at 1:30pm with 21 items on the agenda.
Soon afterwards, PML-Q MNA Hussain Elahi tweeted that all 10 PML-Q MPAs had announced complete support for PTI chief Imran Khan and Chief Minister Parvez Elahi in the meeting.
Responding to the PDM government’s claim that it had won the loyalties of six PML-Q MPAs, Mr Hussain asserted that the federal ruling coalition would not be able to fool anyone with its propaganda, and commented: “They (PDM) talk about six MPAs when they can’t even break one.”
A PML-Q spokesman said the parliamentary party had delegated complete authority of making all the decisions to CM Elahi and resolved to vote in favour of the CM, speaker and deputy speaker when a vote of no-confidence was taken up in the house.
Mr Elahi also asserted that the PML-Q would continue standing by Imran Khan and that his party was united and would remain so to bulldoze any propaganda or rumours being spread by the PDM government in the Centre.
Earlier in the day, as Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah had claimed he would seal the Chief Minister House if Mr Elahi didn’t take a vote of confidence, the CM’s son, Moonis, said he had “reached 8-Club CM House and waiting for you”. A few hours later, he tweeted: “Rana sb am bored now. Heading home but pls do let me know when you plan to come.”

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,"PTI set to approach SC, not speaker, for resignations’ acceptance","“We are dealing with those people who do not have any moral standing,” says Senator Shibli Faraz.","ISLAMABAD: Contra­dicting the announcement it made only days ago that PTI members of National Assembly are ready to appear before Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf for verification of their resignations, the party on Wednesday changed its stance as senior party leader Senator Shibli Faraz declared that the lawmakers would not go to the Parliament House, and instead, the PTI would approach the Supreme Court to seek acceptance of the mass resignations.
“We had decided to go to the assembly for acceptance of our resignations. But this is not the way and MNAs, who are elected by the people, cannot be asked to keep standing in a queue for acceptance of their resignations … The government is doing all this [handling the resignation issue] with a mala fide intention,” said Mr Faraz, alleging that the speaker wanted to “humiliate” the PTI lawmakers by treating them as “charity seekers”.
Talking to Dawn, Mr Faraz said they would approach the Supreme Court and ask it to direct the speaker to accept the resignations submitted some eight months ago.
“We will go to the SC in a day or two,” he said.
The party is going to the apex court where this issue has already been discussed during the hearing of various petitions and even the judges had observed that PTI should reconsider its decision of quitting the assembly.
When asked if it was not a U-turn as PTI Vice Chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi had written a letter to the speaker only six days back, asking him to allocate some time for the party’s MNAs to verify their resignations, Mr Faraz said they wanted to do so, but the government did not seem to be serious which was evident from the fact that it had convened a session of the National Assembly on Thursday (today) on a one-day notice despite the fact that the speaker was not even present in the country.
“This is not a U-turn. Look at the spirit of the matter. Why is the government delaying acceptance of our resignations? Why has the speaker adopted a pick-and-choose policy by accepting the resignations of only 11 members?” he said, adding that submission of mass resignations was part of the party strategy to force the government to hold early elections in the country. Otherwise, he said, the party MNAs could have been asked to submit resignations in groups.
When his attention was drawn to the assembly rules under which the speaker is required to individually call the members for verification of resignations, Mr Faraz posed a valid counter-question, saying: “Under which law did the speaker accept the resignations of the 11 MNAs who had also not appeared before him for verification [of their resignations]?”
“We are dealing with those people who do not have any moral standing,” the PTI senator alleged, questioning the logic behind the speaker’s decision to accept the resignations of 11 members out of 123 who had submitted the resignations en masse at the time of the election of Shehbaz Sharif as the prime minister in April.
On Dec 15, while talking to reporters in Lahore, Mr Qureshi had expressed his party’s resolve to dissolve the assemblies of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and get the MNAs’ resignations accepted after appearing before the speaker.
“We have already made our decision. We will execute it,” he had stated, adding that party Chairman Imran Khan had given him the letter for sending it to the speaker.
He also waved the ‘letter’ bearing the subject “Resignations of MNAs of PTI” to the media and chided the speaker for being “selective” while accepting the resignations of 11 MNAs “illegally”.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,"Onus on Centre to fight militancy, says KP",KP govt's spokesperson says the police’s job is to counter routine crimes and ‘national security’ is beyond their mandate.,"PESHAWAR: As some semblance of normalcy returned to Bannu on Wednesday, a day after an operation against terrorists, the under-fire KP government refused to accept the blame for the resurgence of terrorism, saying it was the responsibility of the Centre to tackle the issue.
Chief Minister Mahmood Khan in a media talk declared that ‘fighting militancy’ was the mandate of the federal government.
Meanwhile, President Arif Alvi, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Army chief Gen Syed Asim Munir, separately, paid tribute to the soldiers who took part in the operation at the CTD centre in Bannu on Tuesday.
The KP chief minister explained that it was the Centre’s job to fight militancy since the institutions fighting [against militants] fell within the jurisdiction of the federal government.
“Crime and law and order situation is the provincial government’s job but militancy falls within their [federal government’s] domain and hence this is their responsibility,” he maintained.
Besides, the chief minister claimed that the federal government was reluctant to release funds for both current and developmental expenditures. “Neither do we receive the current nor the developmental expenditures [funding],” he said and alleged that the funds were being diverted to the federal government’s members of parliament.
Endorsing the CM’s views, the KP government’s spokesperson told a press briefing that the police’s job was to counter routine crimes and ‘national security’ was beyond its mandate.
He said the incident that took place inside the Bannu CTD centre fell within the definition of ‘national security’ which was the federal the government’s domain.
“This is not something about general law and order…it falls within the domain of the national security which is the responsibility of the federal government,” CM Adviser on Information Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif said.
In reply to a question about the recently held talks with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Afghanistan, the special assistant said that war had never ended since 2001 and dialogue was an attempt to further improve the situation but a permanent solution [to militancy] could not be found.
“The reason for dialogue with them [TTP] was to improve the situation,” Mr Saif said, adding that war never ended, though its intensity fluctuated. “We wanted a permanent solution but it did not happen,” he said while explaining the reason for holding talks with the Taliban.
A KP minister, however, appeared to have a different stance, reported APP.
Kamran Bangash at a presser reiterated the provincial government’s resolve to eliminate terrorism and extremism in all its forms and manifestations and said the government was taking pragmatic steps to improve the capacity of police and the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD).
Referring to the terrorist attack on the CTD compound, he said police and security forces had already shared information about the possible terrorist attacks.
Meanwhile, Chief of Army Staff Gen Syed Asim Munir met the officers and soldiers, who were injured during the Bannu operation, at the CMH Rawalpindi, according to an Inter-Services Public Relations release.
The COAS remained with them for some time and inquired about their well-being.
He appreciated their high spirit and morale and lauded their professionalism during the operation against the terrorists.
Pledge against terrorism
President Alvi lauded the security forces for carrying out a successful operation against terrorists in Bannu and expressed the resolve to eliminate terrorism from the country’s soil, APP reported.
The president, in a statement, termed the success a result of the professionalism of security forces and their unwavering commitment against terrorism.
In separate remarks, Prime Minister Sharif said the state would not surrender to any terrorist group or organisation and vowed that militants would be dealt with according to the Constitution and law.
Strongly condemning the activities of terrorists, he said such attempts would be crushed.
“We will not let the sacrifices of the martyrs go to waste,” he said and mentioned the military operations of Raddul Fasaad and Zarb-i-Azb as significant measures to eradicate terrorism.
The prime minister said that though main responsibility for law and order lies with the provinces, the federation could not turn a blind eye to such problems.
He assured the provinces that the federal government would work along with them in fighting terrorism and vowed to fully implement the National Action Plan to eliminate terrorism.
PM Shehbaz said the federal government would assist the provinces in improving the professional capacity of the anti-terrorism force and departments.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,SC overturns verdicts in favour of khula,"Husband’s claim of conjugal rights seemed to be motivated by his intention to avoid payment of dower amount, judge observes.","ISLAMABAD: In a family suit, the Supreme Court on Wednesday set aside the Peshawar High Court (PHC) and appellate court decisions for dissolution of a marriage by way of khula and restored the decree of a family court to dissolve the marriage on the basis of cruelty inflicted by a man on his wife.
While the family court after recording of evidence and hearing both sides had dissolved the marriage due to cruelty on a suit moved by Tayyeba Ambareen against her husband Shafqat Ali Kiyani demanding dower amount, dowry articles, medical expenses and maintenance for herself and their daughter, the appellate court on Nov 10, 2015 overturned the decree and converted it into khula with the direction to the woman to refund five-tola gold to her husband. The high court also upheld the appellate court decision.
Headed by Justice Sardar Tariq Masood, a three-judge Supreme Court bench then took up an appeal against the PHC verdict.
In its decision, the apex court observed that husband’s claim of conjugal rights — despite his ‘ruthless, tyrannical and oppressive’ conduct or behaviour — seemed to be motivated by the sole intention to avoid paying maintenance allowance and the dower amount and he ultimately succeeded in his effort when the appellate court dissolved the marriage by way of khula with the direction to the wife to refund the dower amount.

Husband’s claim of conjugal rights seemed to be motivated by his intention to avoid payment of dower amount, judge observes

Justice Mohammad Ali Mazhar, a member of the SC bench, in a judgment he wrote, observed the main disagreement or source of discord between the parties was whether petitioner Tayyeba Ambareen was entitled to claim a decree for dissolution of marriage on the ground of cruelty and whether the appellate forum rightly converted the dissolution of marriage on the ground of cruelty to dissolution by way of khula.
The SC noted that the family court unequivocally articulated that the petitioner discharged the burden of proving cruelty on part of the husband by quoting many incidents while her evidence was not shattered during her cross-examination and thus the family court rightly dissolved the marriage on account of cruelty after a thorough examination and consideration of evidence.
Justice Mazhar observed that the appellate court could modify or set aside the judgment of the family court if it was found contrary to the evidence since the purpose of appellate jurisdiction was to reappraise whether the lower court committed any error. Likewise, he noted, the high court affirmed the findings of the appellate court without realizing that the allegations of maltreatment and cruelty had been satisfactorily proved by the petitioner during the trial.
The matrimonial bond between a man and woman is a pious relationship that plays an important part and also nurtures between the husband and wife happiness and compassion, the lineage and family heredity also depends on it, Justice Mazhar observed, adding the connubial affairs are based on gentle, human and emotional affiliation which requires mutual trust, regard, respect, love and affection and the relationship should also be in accordance with social norms.
As Islam ordains husbands to provide food, clothing, accommodation and all other necessities of life to the best of his capability and capacity, a man is expected to treat his wife nicely, with love and affection, Justice Mazhar observed. A conduct or behaviour that inflicts upon the wife mental pain and anguish makes it impossible for her to continue matrimonial relationship, the verdict explained.
Justice Mazhar recalled how the family court decision depicted different acts which caused mental anguish and torture to the wife, as only a week after their marriage, the husband started pressurising his wife to arrange money to get a house on rent. The husband and his family members also levelled false accusations at her, alleging that his daughter was not their child, with the result that the petitioner suffered severe mental agony, the court noted.
While she was in the family way, the man left her instead of supporting his wife, the court observed. He did not turn up at the crucial time; neither did he pay any maintenance allowance nor delivery expenses, it was recalled.
Also, the husband and his family members imposed a harsh condition on her that she should deposit her salary into a joint account with her husband and seek his permission for personal use.
Despite filing the family suit, the husband’s behaviour did not change rather he caused more mental anguish and started levelling false accusations, imposing condition that the amount for the house purchased by the wife be reimbursed by her father to the husband.
But the apex court noted that the appellate court, instead of considering the evidence reached a conclusion without any reason that no solid piece of evidence was brought to show physical torture or mental agony and held the allegation was exaggerated, adding that the “acts of cruelty were common” in nature and were “found in every family”.
On the basis of the observations, the Supreme Court set aside the judgments of the high court and the appellate court and restored the decree passed by the family court.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,SBP slashes GDP growth forecast to below 3-4pc,"Cuts FY23 outlook after considering flood-induced destruction, policy focus on stabilisation.","KARACHI: The central bank has lowered its projected GDP growth from the previously announced range of 3-4 per cent for the current fiscal year, citing flood-induced destruction and the stabilisation policy as major factors in its flagship economic health report released on Wednesday.
However, in its Annual Report on the State of Pakistan’s Economy, which mostly discussed the previous financial year that ended on June 30, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said economic growth was stronger than expected in the 2021-22 fiscal year as real GDP increased by 6pc compared to 5.7pc a year ago.
The primary drivers of this growth were a broad-based expansion in large-scale manufacturing (LSM) and improved agricultural output, the report said.
“A combination of adverse global and domestic developments led to the re-emergence of macroeconomic imbalances during FY22,” it said.

Cuts FY23 outlook after considering flood-induced destruction, policy focus on stabilisation

The SBP said that the economy was already in a stabilisation phase when widespread flooding hit a large part of the country at the start of the current fiscal year.
It said the flooding was likely to impinge on the country’s real economic activity through various channels, fearing that losses in agriculture emerging from the damages to crops and livestock were likely to transmit to the rest of the economy through various backward and forward linkages.
 
 

The large-scale destruction of infrastructure in the affected provinces might also undermine the country’s growth prospects during the year, the bank said.
The SBP avoided providing any range for the growth rate of the current financial year apparently due to the worsening economic situation. Industries have either shut down or drastically cut their production due to high inflation and the unavailability of gas and electricity.
One major reason is the cork put by the SBP on the opening of letters of credit (LCs) for imports in an attempt to save dollars.
The All-Pakistan Textile Mills Association has threatened to announce lay-offs within days if the gas supply is not restored and LCs are not opened.
The textile industry claims that up to 500,000 people, who were associated with the sector directly or indirectly, have lost their jobs. No official data is available in this regard.
International credit rating agencies have slashed the credit rating of Pakistan and predicted an economic growth rate of around 2pc for the current fiscal year.
The SBP report said that several corrective and other measures were likely to slow the momentum of economic activity during FY23, including a hike of 675 basis points in the policy rate, demand management measures announced in the previous fiscal year, and the government’s decision to unwind the fiscal package for fuel and electricity subsidies towards the end of FY22.
The report noted that the expansionary fiscal stance in FY22, an upsurge in global commodity prices, and the fallout of the Russia-Ukraine conflict led to a marked deterioration in the current account deficit.
 
 

In addition, the delay in the resumption of the IMF loan programme and political instability exacerbated the country’s vulnerability through the depletion of foreign exchange reserves.
The resulting rupee depreciation “amplified inflationary pressures by magnifying the effect of global price increase”, the SBP report said.
It said the experience from FY22 brought to the fore once again the need to address the country’s structural weaknesses, such as a narrow base of foreign exchange earnings and meagre inflows of foreign investment.
“A concerted approach is required to encourage increased localisation of the manufacturing base, along with the lowering of energy intensity of the economy by ensuring energy efficiency and conservation,” the report said.
Moreover, amid the growing issues related to climate change and inadequate food security situation, there is an urgent need to formulate a well-thought-out strategy to meet these challenges, it said.
It stressed that priority should be given to producing new varieties of seeds that are suitable to varying weather conditions and to devise a framework that emphasises water management strategies to increase agricultural productivity.
“The losses to agriculture produce induced by the recent floods is likely to step up the import of agriculture commodities, particularly cotton,” the report said.
It said the government has targeted to reduce the fiscal deficit to 4.9pc of GDP in FY23 from 7.9pc in FY22. “This outcome would be achieved through both revenue and expenditure measures,” it said.
In fact, the fiscal deficit exceeded in the first quarter of FY23, annoying the IMF, which demanded more measures to reduce the gap.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,PM promises Rs5bn to reconstruct flood-hit homes,Govt launches ‘4RF’ comprehensive plan for rehabilitation of millions of survivors.,"SUKKUR/ISLAMABAD: As he assured Sindh that the federal government would not leave flood survivors in a lurch, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the Centre would spend at least Rs5 billion to construct houses for flood victims in the province.
After his visit to rain-hit areas in Khairpur on Wednesday, the prime minister said that Rs4.80 billion had been donated to the prime minister’s account for flood survivors and added that more funds were expected to be donated.
According to PM Sharif, the rehabilitation process was already underway across the country, but there were still several areas in Khairpur and Dadu which were underwater. 
He added that the government would move towards reconstruction and rehabilitation works, but at present, at least eight million families were rain-affected. 
He elaborated that at least 20m people, including nine million children, were waiting for the government to help them.

Govt launches ‘4RF’ comprehensive plan for rehabilitation of millions of survivors

Drainage plan
He said that the government would build houses for the affected people and added that the chief minister would provide plots for the construction and the same process would be followed in other provinces as well.
“A donors conference is going to be held in Geneva next month,” said PM Sharif and added that he would go to the moot fully prepared to present Pakistan’s case for aid in light of massive destruction due to floods. The PM also announced the establishment of a campus of COMSATS University in Khairpur.
Speaking at the residence of PPP leader Manzoor Wassan in Khairpur, Shehbaz Sharif said that his government would “positively consider” the master plan for drainage on the left bank of the River Indus proposed by a foreign consultant, Louis Berger.
Mr Sharif said that the scale of the disaster was massive so Pakistan would require plenty of resources to tackle this challenge.
During the visit, the premier was also briefed by Chief Engineer Development Region-I Mansoor Memon in Pir Gaddo, Kot Diji about inundated areas in the province.
The chief engineer said that out of 3.3m acres of area, 2m acres were inundated on the right bank and 1.3m acres on the left bank of the Indus till Aug 31.
In Khairpur, 141,000 acres of land was submerged till Aug 31 but now only 7,800 acres of land needed to be dewatered, Mr Memon informed. He maintained that field drains on an area of 200 square kms were created to drain rainwater.
According to the chief engineer, Khairpur was a victim of a “poor drainage network” and the only drainage system that existed in the area pertained to salinity control and water-logging issue. He informed when the Sukkur barrage was built, the flow of natural watercourses in the area was obstructed. 
“Even this area where we are standing is an old waterway,” Mr Memon said while showing the site on a satellite image.
He said that floodwater from the mountainous range stretching over 75,000 sq kms in Balochistan reached Qambar Shahdadkot and Dadu districts in recent floods and 600,000 acres and 400,000 acres of the area was inundated respectively in Qambar and Dadu districts. This meant that out of 2m acres, 50pc of the area was affected in these two districts, he added.
Speaking about the Berger plan regarding drainage, the engineer urged that the scheme was of paramount importance for left bank areas. CM Murad agreed. The Sindh CM said the provincial government wanted to use funds deposited with the apex court in the Bahria Town case for the execution of this scheme.
‘4RF plan’
Separately, the government launched a comprehensive plan prepared by the planning and development division for the rehabilitation of flood victims. 
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, Prime Minister Shehbaz launched the ‘Resilient, Recovery, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Framework’ (4RF) which envisaged short, medium, and long-term strategies to rehabilitate the survivors.
A copy of the 4RF report was presented to the prime minister by Ahsan Iqbal, Minister for Planning Development and Special Initiatives (MoPD&SI) during a meeting. 
Mr Iqbal apprised the prime minister that the document was based on the loss and damage estimated in the post-disaster needs assessment report, which was launched in October this year.
PM Sharif directed that necessary efforts must be made for the effective pitching of this framework in the upcoming donors’ conference, scheduled to be held on January 9, 2023, in Geneva, Switzerland.
He directed that the planning ministry in coordination with the foreign ministry, climate change ministry, and economic affairs division may take necessary steps for the effective dissemination of the document to all the stakeholders at home and abroad.

2023-05-20,2022-12-22,Over 100 Rohingya stranded in boat off India’s coast,MUMBAI: At least 100 ethnic Rohingya are stranded in a boat off India’s Andaman Islands and as many as 16-20 may...,"MUMBAI: At least 100 ethnic Rohingya are stranded in a boat off India’s Andaman Islands and as many as 16-20 may have have died of thirst, hunger or drowned, said two Myanmar Rohingya activist groups.
Each year many Rohingya, members of a Muslim minority, risk their lives boarding rickety vessels to escape violence in Myanmar and squalor in Bangladesh refugee camps. Many attempt to reach Malaysia.
The stranded boat was approached by five Indian ships late on Tuesday, a source said.
A spokesperson for the Indian Navy said he did not have any details to share. A spokesperson for the Coast Guard did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters.
“We estimate that probably as many as 20 have died some from hunger and thirst, and others jumped overboard in desperation. This is absolutely awful and outrageous,” said Chris Lewa, director of the Arakan Project which works to support Myanmar’s Rohingyas.
Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Networks Rohingya Working Group said the group had been adrift for more than two weeks.
“We heard late last night that there were some Indian vessels approaching the boat so we are awaiting updates now, said Lilianne Fan, chair of Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Networks Rohingya Working Group.
“We hope that the Indian Navy or Coastguard will manage to rescue and disembark the boat as soon as possible. These people have been adrift on a damaged boat for more than 2 weeks without food and water. We have heard that up to 16 people may have already died.”  Another boat, carrying more than a hundred Rohingya was rescued by Sri Lanka’s navy on the weekend.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Nepal court orders release of serial killer Charles Sobhraj,"“Keeping him in the prison continuously is not in line with the prisoner’s human rights,” says court.","KATHMANDU: Nepal’s top court ordered on Wednesday the release and deportation of Charles Sobhraj, the French serial killer portrayed in the Netflix series  “The Serpent” who was responsible for a string of murders across Asia in the 1970s.
The Supreme Court ruled Sobhraj, 78, who has been in prison in the Himalayan republic since 2003 for murdering two North American tourists, should be freed on health grounds.
“Keeping him in the prison continuously is not in line with the prisoner’s human rights,” read a copy of the verdict.
“If there is not any other pending cases against him to keep him in the prison, this court orders his release by today and... the return to his country within 15 days.” Sobhraj needed open heart surgery and his release was in keeping with the law allowing the compassionate discharge of bedridden prisoners who had already served three-quarters of their sentence, the verdict added.
The notorious murderer underwent a five-hour cardiac operation in 2017 and the verdict said he remained in regular treatment for heart disease. Sobhraj will likely be freed from Kathmandu’s Central Jail on Thursday, an official at the prison said.
He will first have to appear in a lower court for administrative formalities before he can walk free, the official added.
Backpacker murders 
After a troubled childhood and several prison terms in France for petty crimes, Sobhraj began travelling the world in the early 1970s and wound up in the Thai capital Bangkok.
His modus operandi was to charm and befriend his victims — many of them starry-eyed Western backpackers on a quest for spirituality — before drugging, robbing and murdering them.
Suave and sophisticated, he was implicated in his first murder, that of a young American woman whose body was found on a beach in Pattaya wearing a bikini, in 1975. He was eventually linked to more than 20 killings.
His victims were strangled, beaten or burned, and he often used the passports of his male victims to travel to his next destination.
Sobhraj’s sobriquet,  “The Serpent”, came from his ability to assume other identities in order to evade justice. It became the title of a hit series made by the BBC and Netflix that was based on his life.
He was arrested in India in 1976 and ultimately spent 21 years in jail there, with a brief break in 1986 when he escaped and was caught again in the Indian coastal state of Goa.
Released in 1997, Sobhraj retired to Paris but resurfaced in 2003 in Nepal, where he was spotted in Kathmandu’s tourist district and arrested.
A court there handed him a life sentence the following year for killing US tourist Connie Jo Bronzich in 1975. A decade later he was also found guilty of killing Bronzich’s Canadian companion. In prison in 2008, Sobhraj married Nihita Biswas, who is 44 years his junior and the daughter of his Nepalese lawyer.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Ambulance workers walk out in strike-hit UK,Employees across the UK economy demand salary rises to match or beat decades-high inflation.,"LONDON: Striking ambulance workers in England and Wales manned picket lines on Wednesday, escalating a pay dispute between the government and a host of public-sector staff.
A series of stoppages are causing misery across Britain in the run-up to Christmas, with railway workers and passport control officers set to hinder festive holiday getaways as the government resists the growing pay demands.
Employees across the UK economy are demanding salary rises to match or beat decades-high inflation — currently running at nearly 11 percent — which is spurring the worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation.
“We’re not paid enough for what we deserve,” 24-year-old paramedic Kirsten Reid said in Crawley, southern England.  “Secondly, patient safety is a huge thing... our response times are shocking, and they need to be better.”  “We do 12-hour shifts with a 30-minute break, but they’re rarely ever 12-hour shifts. We’re usually overrun,” she added.
The government and unions continue to trade blame over the strikes amid fears of possible loss of life, as healthcare leaders warned about straining a system already in crisis.
On Tuesday, thousands of members of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) in England, Wales and Northern Ireland took to picket lines, five days after their first strike in its 106-year history.
Health Secretary Steve Barclay, writing in the Daily Telegraph newspaper, accused the unions of making a  “conscious decision” to  “inflict harm” on patients. GMB union national secretary, Rachel Harrison, hit back calling his comments  “insulting”.
“Ambulance workers are seething at such a crude, insulting attempt to divert attention from the government’s continued chaos in the NHS,” she said.
Around a dozen staff formed the picket line outside the ambulance base in Crawley.
“My members are striking today for fair pay. At the end of the day, they’ve had a 20 percent pay cut over the last 10 years, and they can no longer afford to keep going with that,” GMB union representative Lib Whitfield said.
Outside the West Midlands Ambulance Services’ hub in Longford in central England, striking staff stood behind a banner reading  “our NHS is under siege”.
As passing ambulances sounded their horns in support, union representative Steve Thompson called on the government to  “wake up and realise that this situation is serious”.

2022-12-22,2022-12-22,Govt calls emergency NA session today to approve controversial LG law,PML-N candidate seeks delay in polls; PTI leader files contempt petition against PM for changes in law.,"ISLAMABAD: The government has summoned an emergency session of the National Assembly on Thursday (today) to get Islamabad’s local government amendment bill passed, with an aim to increase the number of union councils and seek direct election for the post of mayor.
The session has been convened by President Dr Arif Alvi at a time when political parties are already busy campaigning for the local government polls scheduled for Dec 31.
In a related development, a ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) candidate and a senior member of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) filed separate petitions before the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on the issue with the former seeking postponement of the polls and the latter desiring initiation of contempt proceedings against Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his “cabinet” for making changes in the law which could cause a delay in the elections.
The National Assembly Secretariat on Wednesday issued a 10-point agenda which shows the Islamabad Capital Territory Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2022 standing in the name of Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah Khan.

PML-N candidate seeks delay in polls; PTI leader files contempt petition against PM for changes in law

The minister will also present a motion seeking to suspend the rules of the assembly to enable the members to pass the bill on the same day without referring it to the concerned committee and following the parliamentary procedure.
After passage of the bill from the lower house of the parliament, it will also have to be passed by the Senate before getting the president’s ceremonial assent.
It may be recalled that the National Assembly had been prorogued by the president only on Tuesday after passing the Foreign Investment (Promotion and Protection) Bill in a similar fashion and after suspending the rules. 
The federal cabinet has already approved the amendments to the law through a circular on Dec 19 after which the interior ministry issued a letter increasing the number of seats from 101 to 125. 
Moreover, the federal cabinet has also approved a summary for direct election of Islamabad’s mayor and for this necessary amendment, the bill is being tabled before the National Assembly.
Despite these developments, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), however, refused to defer the LG elections and vowed to conduct it in accordance with the already announced schedule.
Since the PML-N and PTI have brought this matter before the IHC, the fate of LG elections now depends upon the judicial verdict.
In the petition, PML-N candidate from Tarlai Union Council Shahzad Aurangzeb defended the government’s decision of increasing the number of UCs.
The petition stated that Islamabad districtfor the most part has been administered without a local government comprising elected representatives of the people until the passing of the 18th Amendment in the Constitution on April 19, 2010.
It said the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) Local Government Act 2015 in sections 5 & 6 of the Act, empowered the federal government to declare any area as union council and to divide an existing area of one union council into two and to notify the number of union councils in Islamabad, adding that the federal government had recently increased the number of union councils to 125.
The petitioner pointed out anomalies in the voters’ lists of different areas and said “in such conditions any election that is held would be disputed and cannot be declared as a free and fair election”.
It requested the court to set aside the ECP’s decision of conducting elections in 101 UCs.
On the other hand, PTI leader Ali Nawaz Awan asserted in the petition that the ECP in the light of the judgements of the superior courts announced schedule for local government elections in 101 UCs to be held on Dec 31.
“However, the federal government with utmost mala fide, has yet again in its bid to frustrate the process has done exactly what had been apprehended,” the petition said, adding that the act of federal government of increasing the number of UCs is a “clear attempt at frustrating the process and holding of elections, which is clear cut violation of the judgement of this court”.
According to the petition, the federal government was “well aware” of court’s directions, “however, the action of yet again increasing the number of UCs, merely 11 days prior to the elections…is a blatant disregard to the dictum laid down exhaustively by the court.”
The petition termed it a deliberate attempt to frustrate the judgement of the IHC.
Subsequently, it requested the court to initiate contempt of court proceeding against the prime minister and all the members of the federal cabinet.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Verdict reserved on appeal over Zahir’s sentence in Noor case,"The court asks lawyers to submit written arguments, if they want, within seven days.","ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday reserved verdict on a plea challenging the death sentence of Zahir Jaffer in Noor Mukadam murder case.
The two-member division bench comprising IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Sardar Ijaz Ishaq Khan reserved the verdict after the lawyers completed their arguments.
Jaffer’s lawyer, Usman Khosa, in his argument on the last day of hearing on Wednesday, said one of the reasons for giving the death sentence to his client could be to set an example that there was a lesson for others to not take such a step. 
He added that such a punishment was awarded to habitual criminals to create deterrence.
He said there was pressure on Pakistan at an international level to abolish the death penalty, adding that his client was an American citizen and a resident of New Jersey, where there was no concept of capital punishment. He urged the court to take this point into consideration.
Chief Justice Aamer Farooq remarked that abolishing the death penalty was a matter of legislation and only legislators could view this subject, however, he added that Pakistan was an independent country and it had its own law. 
The lawyer of the plaintiff, Shaukat Mukadam, said Jameel, Jaffer’s cook, worked during the day and had no role in the crime.
While the court inquired whether any drugs were recovered from the crime scene, Mr Mukadam’s lawyer Babar Hayat said no drug was recovered and the relevant report had been attached with the record.
The court also inquired about Noor’s handbag, which was not part of the record but it was visible in the CCTV footage.
Mr Hayat said only the prosecution could talk about the bag. After the two sides concluded their arguments, the bench reserved its judgement.
The court asked the lawyers to submit written arguments, if they wanted, within seven days.
The trial court in Islamabad had awarded death penalty to Jaffer in February 2022 for killing Noor Mukadam. Her body was found in Jaffer’s residence in F-7 on July 20, 2021.

He said Haroon Yousaf Aziz intended to surrender before the Accountability Court of Lahore in connection with assets reference case.
In the petition, Mr Aziz cited the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) chairman, NAB Lahore director general and Accountability Court Lahore judge as respondents.
He requested the court for grant of protective bail, enabling him to surrender before the competent court of law.
Mr Aziz is a co-accused in the assets reference.
According to NAB, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s family members received foreign funds through alleged fake transactions.
These transactions had been made through the company, allegedly owned by Shehbaz Sharif’s son-in-law Haroon Yousaf Aziz. 
The maximum numbers of fake transactions to the Shehbaz family had been made through Al-Zarooni Exchange of Dubai.
After hearing preliminary arguments, the IHC bench restrained the LEAs from arresting Aziz till Dec 22 and ordered him to appear in person on Thursday.
Further hearing in this matter has been adjourned till today.

ISLAMABAD: One of the top paediatricians of Pakistan, Dr Tabish Hazir, who served at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) for over three decades, breathed his last at the same hospital on Tuesday night, leaving his family, friends, and those whose children are in good health because of his efforts saddened.
His funeral prayers were offered at 4pm in B Block Model Town, Lahore, on Wednesday which were attended by a large number people including politicians, academics and medical practitioners. The deceased was later laid to rest in a local graveyard in Model Town.
Dr Hazir, 74, was the husband of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leader Dr Shireen Mazari and was suffering from colon cancer for the last two years. He had been under treatment at Pims.
Former Pims executive director Dr Ijaz Qadeer, while talking to Dawn, said Dr Hazir was a top paediatrician of Pakistan and his services for Pims would always be remembered.

Top paediatrician laid to rest in Lahore

He said the deceased established the paediatric department at the hospital and headed the neonatology department.
It is worth mentioning here that neonatology is a sub-specialty of paediatrics that focuses on medical care of newborns, especially those who are ill or premature.
“He believed in research and never stopped learning new fields while he was in the hospital. He was expert on issues related to reasons of death in newborn and also reasons of infection in children,” Dr Qadeer said.
Talking to Dawn, former vice chancellor of Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Medical University Prof Dr Javed Akram said he had frequent interaction with Dr Hazir as Pims was the affiliated hospital of the university.
“He was a thorough gentleman and professional. He was supportive of academics and was a supporter of the university. He was eager to do research, which is why I consider him as one of my best friends,” he said.
Dr Tabish Hazir’s sister Tamkinet Karim, while talking to Dawn, said her brother was born on May 31, 1958 in Lahore.
“He did his initial schooling in Sialkot and MBBS from Allama Iqbal Medical College, Lahore. He also did a number of courses and specialisation and joined Pims which he served till his retirement. He was under treatment at Pims at the time of his death. We shifted the body on Wednesday morning to his house in Islamabad and then to Lahore,” she said.
Ms Karim said the deceased had worked in collaboration with the World Health Organisation and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for the welfare of the children of Pakistan.

The project is anticipated to be completed by the end of Dec 2023.
The Soan River Bridge was two lanes wide on each side, but after work, it will have four lanes on each side.
According to an official from the National Highway Authority (NHA), widening of the bridge had been suspended in April 2022 after the contractor was black-listed and now a fresh contract had been awarded to Frontier Works Organisation (FWO).
The widening of the bridge across Soan River was started in 2017 and was scheduled to be completed by January 2022. However, the bridge will now be completed by the end of 2023.
Due to left-over construction material scattered on the bridge and its adjoining area, hundreds of commuters entering the city have been facing problems.
Motorists, while proceeding towards Rawalpindi from Rawat, face difficulty as safety walls of the bridge have been demolished by the previous contractor and left abandoned.
More than 62,000 vehicles cross Soan Bridge every day, where widening of the bridge began about five years ago and is yet to be completed.
The former chief of army staff had taken strict notice of the delay in the construction of Soan Bridge project and the poor workmanship and directed the authorities concerned to complete it without wasting time.
“I have never seen such sheer negligence in public welfare/important projects while living abroad,” said an expatriate who recently came to Pakistan to spend vacations with his family.

Students of Al-Huda International School took part in creating awareness about global warming by organising a science exhibition under the title ‘Earth Matters’. 
They displayed over 60 projects to highlight the issues of global warming, urging that an organic life style and natural method in work was the only solution to save the planet.
Topics like bio gas, water, solar energy, green grills, hydroponic planting, collection of garbage, floods and mitigation, importance of birds and so on were well covered by students through their projects. 
These topics were connected with Islam and its teachings and in all stalls, related verses of the Quran were also highlighted.
“Through this exhibition, we are trying to create awareness as environment is a serious issue the world is facing today,” said Fareha Wasim, a teacher.
A seventh grader said that everyone will have to play a role towards reducing the impact of fast changing climate. Another teacher Fouzia Umar said that besides taking care of the climate and human beings, there is also need to protect birds.
Students from montessori to senior grades constructed and displayed their projects. Each project was presented in a distinctive way and the uniqueness of the event was that each child participated and the projects were made from recycled and eco-friendly material.
The exhibition comprised of different sub themes such as ‘Green Vibes Only’, ‘Air Care’, ‘Slow the Flow’, ‘Master the Disaster’, ‘Waste Wise’ and ‘Now and Never’. 
The student’s project display and demonstration of projects was an effort towards provoking thoughts and leave the audience inspired. Students had captured the attention and focus of the audience and visitors throughout the day. 
The message from all students was clear and crisp that this was high time that we have to take care of our planet.
They emphasised that according to the Quran, environmental conservation is a religious duty as well as a social obligation and not an optional matter. The event was graced by dignitaries and educationists from the twin cities, journalists and the kinsfolk of the students. 
Different schools and university students also made an appearance and interacted with students. The programme was spread over two days and was split into three slots of morning and evening.

According to an FIR, police officials had detained a merchant from Peshawar and released him after receiving Rs1 million from his heirs.
Javaid Ahmad had come to Rawalpindi on Dec 6 with Rs300,000 to purchase some goods. He was sitting in a hotel when a man in police uniform came and started interrogating him. In the meanwhile, two persons also joined and snatched Rs300,000 from him.

Headed by Interior Minister Ahmed Moallim Fiqi the delegation comprised Deputy Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs Ahmed Abdirahman Hassan, Deputy Minister of Interior-Puntland State Abdiwali Mire Hirsi, Deputy Minister of Interior-Galmudug State Ahmed Osman Adan, Minister of Interior of Southwest State Abdulahi Hassan, Adviser to Office of President Hoden Aden Osman, NIRA Director General Abduallahi Bihi Hussenand Ambassador Somalia Shirwa Abdullahi Ibrahim.
Tariq Malik said following Pakistani government’s ‘Look Africa Policy’, Nadra was poised to work closely with the Somalian government.
He assured the high-powered delegation that Nadra would surely extend all possible G2G support in ID-related projects and urged the visiting dignitaries to develop an ID ecosystem that would bring about ‘Single Version of Truth’.
The potential is endless for the digital public goods to be rolled out on the basis of a good ID system, he added.
The Nadra chairman said: “A good ID system helps build a strong democratic system, especially in developing countries. The ethos of democracy in ‘One Person, One Vote’ is better delivered through a national ID system that facilitates in development of computerised electoral rolls with negligible margins of voter fraud and other fraudulent practices.”
It is pertinent to mention here that under South-South cooperation, Nadra was assisting the governments of Nigeria, Sudan, Kenya and Somalia with regard to development of identity management and civil registration system.
The Somalian interior minister lauded the efforts of the incumbent Nadra chairman, Tariq Malik and his team. He showed his desire to get Nadra’s assistance for the Somalian government to develop a robust identity management system and its linkage with other disparate systems operating in Somalia and its states.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Call to ensure ease of business in pharma sector,ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PPMA) Chairman Arshad Mahmood on Wednesday said...,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PPMA) Chairman Arshad Mahmood on Wednesday said Pakistan would become Nigeria if ease of business was not ensured in the pharmaceutical sector, fearing that the country would be left with no choice but to import medicines worth $20 billion every year.
“The foreign exchange starved Pakistan should be eyeing on the export of pharmaceutical products which is an $1,800 billion industry. Even if we capture the market of Africa, which is an $86 billion market, we would be able to bridge the gap between imports and exports of the country. If ease of business would not be ensured, investments will be shifted from Pakistan to Bangladesh, China, Iran and other countries,” he said while speaking to participants at an international conference on pharma and healthcare.
Mr Mahmood said once Nigeria used to manufacture medicines but with the passage of time, it implemented conditions of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and increased taxes and now it was importing 100pc of its medicines.
“On Wednesday morning, I was shocked to see in a newspaper that the per unit cost of the pharma sector is going to be increased by Rs32 due to which, each unit of electricity will be Rs93. Currently, the per month bill of my factory goes over Rs4 million, out of which electricity charges remain around Rs1.8 million and the rest are all taxes,” he said, adding Pakistan can export medicines to a number of countries of Africa and some countries of Asia including Myanmar, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan.
“A number of companies have been manufacturing medicines for people of Pakistan but when they get orders to export medicines to other countries, the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap) refuses to issue them a letter of good manufacturing practices (GMP) and insists on carrying out another inspection of the factory. The letter is mandatory to export medicines,” Mr Mahmood said.
“It is unfortunate that Drap allows companies to sell medicines to people of Pakistan but does not allow exporting the same medicine to other countries. That is why our exports are worth $269 million. On the other hand, India has been exporting medicines worth of $24 billion per annum. The local industry has been providing medicines worth $5 billion to people of Pakistan and if manufacturing would be stopped due to high cost of production, Pakistan will have to import medicines worth of $20 billion because in that case, foreign countries/companies will provide medicines on their cost and conditions,” he said.
“We cannot compete with international/foreign companies by importing raw material. The business community has been thinking about shifting investments abroad because over here, policies are made without taking the stakeholders onboard. The government needs to take steps for industrialisation rather than depending on remittances of overseas Pakistanis,” he added.
During a panel discussion, member of the PPMA Central Executive Committee Usman Shaukat said it was time to enforce an export emergency in Pakistan to tackle the current economic crisis and pharmaceuticals can play a vital role in earning precious foreign exchange for Pakistan.
“A pharma export council needs to be set up immediately to enhance the exports of pharmaceuticals which has immense potential. The stakeholders such as Drap and Ministry of Commerce have already principally agreed to formulate the pharma export council and the industry requests the process to be expedited in order to facilitate exports,” he added.
It was high time that Pakistan pharmaceutical products reach developed markets such as the United States and Europe.
Drap Chief Executive Officer Dr Asim Rauf, who also attended the conference, said that all possible steps would be taken to facilitate the pharmaceutical sector and ensure increase in export of medicines from Pakistan.

2022-12-22,2022-12-22,CDA plans housing projects for expats to attract dollars,Auction of commercial plots also on the cards.,"ISLAMABAD: In a bid to attract foreign investment into the country, the federal government is looking towards the Capital Development Authority (CDA) to launch new housing schemes for expatriates to boost country’s dollar reserves.
The civic body has prepared a presentation which would likely be given to the prime minister on Thursday (today) in light of his directives pertaining to these housing projects.
Sources said the CDA was planning to develop Gandhara Enclave – a housing project which falls in Zone I and partially in Zone III – and the Kuri housing scheme. Similarly, the civic body will also brief the government about the revenue potential from the under-construction Nilor Heights housing project.
CDA Chairman Mohammad Usman and his team will give a presentation on the schemes, sources said, adding that the auction of some commercial plots will also come under discussion. They said both schemes have the potential to generate billions of rupees in revenue.

Auction of commercial plots also on the cards

In its briefing, the CDA would also inform the federal government that if it wanted to develop Gandhara Enclave on more than 5,000 kanals, then the civic body would need to acquire more land falling in Zone III. Under the current zoning regulations, construction in Zone III is not allowed. However, the CDA is reportedly working on amending these regulations.
Similarly, the sources said in the first phase, the Kuri housing scheme could be developed on 10,000 kanals. They said it would be one of the largest schemes if everything went as per the plan. Sources said the Kuri scheme could turn out to be a “complicated matter because of chronic and unsettled issues with the locals” also known as affected persons.
The CDA had acquired the land decades ago but after announcing the award, no serious step was taken for the development of the Kuri model village. The civic body officials said thousands of housing units could be constructed as part of this scheme.
The officials said after paying compensation and built-up property claims, the civic agency would have around 2,000 acres of land worth billions of rupees. However, the civic agency never made any serious effort to settle issues with locals to get land’s possession. The officials said an initial survey had shown 1,100 occupants on the said land, but in 2011 the number had risen to 7,000.
At that time, the CDA officials in connivance with locals added many bogus cases to the list of land ownership claims. Later, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) probed the matter and cleared 3,422 ownership cases.
The CDA officials said the civic agency had acquired the land in 1968 while the built-up-property award was announced in 1971. But the CDA failed to take possession of the land after removing the objections raised by locals. In 2009, the civic agency announced a revised built-up property award, but due to allegations of bogus claims, it could not resolve the issue.
“Since the federal government has been supporting CDA, we will deliver and will launch at least two housing schemes, with a focus on apartments,” a CDA official said. He added that the plots would be sold to developers and investors who will be asked to build apartments.

Health Services Academy (HSA) Vice Chancellor Prof Shahzad Ali Khan said majority of the Pakistani population is either depressed, experiencing stress or anxiety and are not very optimistic about the country’s future.
He was addressing the launch of the 24th Thematic Calendar by Jahan-i-Maseeha Adbi Forum (JMAF). The theme of the 2023 calendar is, under these circumstances, Allama Iqbal’s message of ‘Khudi’.
Prof Khan said that hopelessness and despair has spread among the youth and under these circumstances, Iqbal’s message of self-hood can lift the spirits of the Pakistani nation again.
He added that the Pakistani youth now consider everybody as corrupt and incompetent, adding that majority of youngsters are desperate to leave the country although the entire world is facing similar issues and problems like inflation, joblessness and recession.
“Initially, teachers and academia of our society was targeted and they were defamed, later, character assassination of physicians and healthcare professionals was carried out and the same treatment was met out to politicians,” Prof Khan said, adding that things were not as bad as they were being portrayed.
He lauded the philosophy of Iqbal, adding that he was able to turn youngsters from a minority group in the Indian subcontinent into a united force by teaching them lessons of optimism, enthusiasm and encouragement.
The event was organised in collaboration with pharmaceutical firm Pharmevo that has been promoting Iqbal’s philosophy among healthcare professionals throughout the country.
Syed Jamshaid Ahmed of Pharmevo stressed on establishing and creating a healthier society in Pakistan and said that for a healthier society, not just medicines but promotion of literary activities was essential like holding book fairs, mushairas and so on.
Renowned poet Ajmal Siraj said an advisory committee comprising educationists, writers and scholars selected life and literary works of Iqbal as the theme for the next year’s calendar.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Setback for MQM-P as ECP wants order to appoint administrators withdrawn,"PTI's Ali Zaidi claims the appointment of such officers around 20 days before LG polls is ""blatant pre-poll rigging"".","KARACHI: The Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan may suffer a setback as the Election Commission of Pakistan on Wednesday asked the Sindh government to reverse the appointment of three government officers, said to be party loyalists, as administrators of Hyderabad and Karachi’s East and Korangi districts.
On Dec 19, the provincial government had appointed Muhammad Farooque, Syed Shakeel Ahmed and Muhammad Sharif as the administrators of Hyderabad Municipal Corporation and district municipal corporations of Korangi and East districts in line with an agreement between the Pakistan Peoples Party and MQM-P.
Prior to their appointment, Mr Farooque and Mr Ahmed had been working as administrator of Worker Model School, SITE Hyderabad, and Korangi, respectively. Mr Sharif had earlier been working as director-charged parking at the DMC-Central.
However, their appointment is criticised by opposition parties, which termed it a pre-poll rigging attempt as local government elections in Karachi and Hyderabad divisions were scheduled to be held on Jan 15.
On Wednesday, the office of the provincial election commissioner in a letter addressed to the local government secretary said that ECP, through a notification issued on June 10, had imposed a ban on transfer/ posting during the conduct of local government elections.
It directed the local government secretary to either withdraw the order or kept it in abeyance till the culmination of the second phase of the local government elections in Karachi and Hyderabad divisions.
The letter reminded the government of an earlier ECP notification that states: “For Divisions in respect of which Election schedule of Local Government Elections has been issued no transfer / posting of the Government Officers and Officials including those of autonomous bodies/ Authorities shall be made without prior approval of the Commission till the publication of Election Results”.
Meanwhile, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leader Ali Zaidi said in a tweet that the ECP ordered withdrawal of the notification appointing administrators.

 





 
Earlier in the day, he told a press conference that his party had written a letter to the chief secretary and informed him that the newly-appointed administrators were affiliated with the MQM-P.
He said that the appointment of such officers as administrators around 20 days before the LG polls was blatant pre-poll rigging.
Also, the Sindh United Party (SUP) raised concerns over the appointment of administrators and Hyderabad commissioner before the LG polls.
SUP chairman and convener of the Sindh Action Committee Syed Jalal Mehmood Shah demanded that the ECP declare null and void the appointment orders of the new administrator and Hyderabad commissioner.

• Muggers shoot Bin Qasim SHO, friend over resistance
KARACHI: While police claimed to have killed two alleged robbers in Korangi in an encounter, in which two policemen also suffered bullet wounds, muggers’ criminal streak in the city continued with assaults, taking lives of a young man and a policeman in the same area on Wednesday.  
The SHO of Bin Qasim police station was also shot at and wounded by armed muggers in Gulshan-i-Maymar.  
In the first incident, the police said that Qayyum Umer, 24, was gunned down by robbers when he put up resistance near Ghousia Masjid in Korangi-3.  
Korangi-SSP Sajid Amir Sadozai said armed motorcyclists were looting his cousin at some distance. Qayyum was standing outside his home and saw the robbers looting his cousin. As he yelled at the robbers, the robbers opened fire on him and fled. He died on the spot.
The body was taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre to fulfil medico-legal formalities.  
Police Surgeon Summaiya Syed said that the victim sustained a gunshot injury to chest and arm. His family members did not allow doctors to complete medico-legal formalities and took away the body, she added.  
The relatives told media that the victim was an orphaned child who sold vegetables in the area to earn his living. Hailing from Mansehra, he also played football at a local club in Korangi.  
Later, police intensified patrol and snap-checking in the area in search of the killers.  
DIG-East Muqaddas Haider told Dawn that two policemen of ‘Shaheen Force’ indicated two suspects to stop in Zaman Town. However, the suspects opened fire on them and an exchange of gunfire took place in which Head Constable Manzoor Ahmed, 38, was killed and the suspects managed to speed away.
However, after an interval of around 30 minutes, the Korangi Industrial Area police spotted two suspects and another encounter ensued in Mehran Town.  
After an exchange of gunfire, two alleged robbers were shot dead while two policemen, Khan Razik and Sajid, were wounded.
The DIG East said that one of the injured policemen had identified both the deceased as the same criminals who had killed the head constable during the earlier encounter.  
He said they were also probing the possibility as to whether the same suspects had gunned down Qayyum over resistance as these three incidents took place in the same vicinity of Korangi. 
The deceased suspects’ involvement in the three incidents would be verified with witnesses’ accounts and matching of spent bullet casings found from the crime scenes, the officials added.  
SHO, friend wounded by robbers 
The Bin Qasim SHO and his friend were shot at and wounded by robbers off Superhighway on Wednesday.  
The SITE-Superhighway Industrial Area (SSIA) police said that SHO Irdees Bangash and citizen Asif Ibrahim, 36, got injured in the firing at an estate agency in Ahsanabad.  
East-SSP Syed Abdul Rahim Shirazi said that the SHO had gone there for some personal work. He was sitting with his friends when armed muggers arrived and attempted to snatch cash and other valuables from them.  
The SHO overpowered one suspect, but his accomplice opened fire resulting in bullet injuries to the police officer and his friend.  
One suspect, later identified as Nadeem, was also wounded by the firing of the SHO and arrested by a police patrol that reached the scene after hearing gunshots.
The SHO was taken to the Aga Khan University Hospital. SSP Shirazi said he suffered a bullet wound near the abdomen.
Bangash had served as SHO of the SITE-Superhighway Industrial Area police station and was recently transferred to the Bin Qasim police station.

The officer stated this in a report submitted in compliance with the bench’s directive to verify employees lists and find out if there were any ghost employees in the departments of education, health and police. 
The division bench, comprising Justices Shamsuddin Abbasi and Amajad Ali Sahito, had issued the directives while hearing a petition filed by advocate Mumtaz Ali Jesar. 
The director general of the Sindh monitoring and evaluation cell was directed to appear in person and file a detailed report regarding procuring the attendance of teachers and the process of issuance of form-II to stop the salaries of the absentees. 
But he was called absent while the deputy director of the cell said he had received the direction in late hours; therefore, the DG did not turn up. At this juncture, the director of school education said the DG was in contact with them.
The bench observed: “We [bench] are noticing this act of the DG with dismay, as he is deliberately avoiding appearing before this court and warn him to remain careful in future.” 
The medical superintendent of Chandka Medical College Hospital said he had issued a letter to the Larkana DAO for blocking the IDs’ of the ghost employees. 
“We have also noted with dismay that the secretary education, Sindh IGP and health department secretary, who were asked to upload the lists of their employees with names, parentage and CNICs on their official website but still compliance had not been made by them,” the two judges bench observed. “Once again we are directing them to upload the list of the employees and furnish report within a month’s time,” it added.
The court found the replies of the show-cause notices issued to the project director (PD) and registrar of Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Medical University (SMBBMU), for not appearing in hearing on Dec 14, satisfactory and vacated the notices, directing them to remain careful in future. 
The PD in his report said that the Higher Education Commission (HEC) and Sindh government were approached for a grant-in-aid of Rs1,820.124 million to complete their (varsity) projects, but they did not receive any response yet. 
The bench directed the HEC and Sindh government to provide required funds to the university for completion of their projects. 
Larkana Additional Deputy Commissioner-I Ms Rabia Siyal appeared on behalf of the deputy commissioner and submitted that technical assistance from the planning and development department was required to finalise the PC-I for the construction of a sewerage scheme for Larkana.

The commission’s member judicial-I retired Justice Arshad Noor Khan said at a press conference held at Darbar hall here the other day that it was regrettable that despite passage of five months to heavy rainfall, rainwater had still not receded from talukas of Sindhri, Jhuddo, Digri, Kot Ghulam Mohammad etc.
He said that similar flood situation might recur over succeeding years due to climate change. “We should therefore adopt a procedure to save population from big disaster in future and in this connection the district administration should perform its duties towards people with honesty and sincerity,” he said.
He said that even if they succeeded to persuade 50 per cent people they could save a large population from disaster. “We have discussed problems of masses particularly flood victims,” he said.
He urged the commission officers to go into the field to listen to grievances of masses and flood victims and resolve their problems by taking drastic measures within available resources.
Later, he held an open kachehry where social workers and villagers alleged that relief goods, ration, tents and food were distributed on the directives of political personalities and elected representatives while genuine victims, who were still living in makeshift huts along roads under open sky, were deprived of all government help.
They deplored that officers concerned of the district administration did not visit many flood hit areas to assess damage from the disaster and meet flood victim families. Most school buildings had suffered damage after flood and heavy rainfall, he said.
They claimed that blankets meant for flood victims were supplied to bungalows of feudal lords and were not distributed among flood victims.
They said that saline water was being drained with heavy pumping machines into West Jamrao canal, which was causing different diseases among masses.
They objected to a survey of damage to houses and crops carried out under supervision of army and revenue officials.
They accused deputy commissioner and other officers concerned of obeying orders of local ruling party MNAs and demanded authorities launch rehabilitation work and distribute wheat seed among victims without any discrimination.
They demanded the government immediately remove illegal encroachments from all waterways.
The kachehry was also attended by Mirpurkhas deputy commissioner Zainul Abideen Memon, SSP Asad Chaudhry, Zaheer Hussain and the commission member Noor Ahmad Narejo.

They were addressing a seminar on the “Strategic and Economic Dimensions of Pakistan and China Relations Amid Deepening Global Geopolitical Divide” at Sindh University on Wednesday. 
SU Thatta campus Pro-Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Rafique Ahmed Memon in his presidential address said that there were vast opportunities for cooperation in the field of higher education and research in China. 
He said that Chinese varsities could admit a large number of Pakistani students. Chinese educational institutions should register themselves with Pakistan accreditation bodies to resolve problems faced by Pakistani students on their return after obtaining higher degrees from various Chinese varsities. 
Pakistan Ambassador to China Moinul Haque said China’s production of Al-Khalid tanks and GF-17 Thunder fighter jets with Pakistan was actually a great proof of extraordinary defense cooperation between the two countries. 
He said that a cynical propaganda was being spread that the CPEC project would push Pakistan deeper into the debt mire, but it was not the case at all. 
Mr Haque said that it was important to open the CPEC project to public so that no propaganda could affect the friendship between the two countries. 
The two countries would soon start working on an important project to prepare submarines for Pakistan Navy and China would ensure access of Pakistani engineers to its manufacturing plant. 
He announced that the SU would be provided with opportunities to enter into educational agreements with top varsities of China so that it could advance in the field of higher education and research being an old varsity of Pakistan. 
Centre for International Strategic Studies Sindh (CSSS) Executive Director and former ambassador Kazi M. Khalilullah said: “Pakistan has a successful foreign policy, which we have to trust,” he said. Both countries had supported each other in testing times while in terms of defense, China had always helped Pakistan to stand on its own feet, he added. 
Former Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) chairman Dr Ansar Pervez said that Pakistan initially bought a nuclear power plant from Canada, but due to Canada’s coldness, the project could not go ahead and then China started the same project and it assisted Pakistan. 
He said that 325 megawatt nuclear power plant provided by China was successfully operationalized, adding that China’s cooperation was continuing to meet energy needs of Pakistan. 
Federal Minister Ahsan Iqbal, Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed and others also made speeches online.

2022-12-22,2022-12-22,Irregularities in Daska by-poll: LHC sets aside ECP action against election officials,"Court says after poll, duty staff no longer remains within ECP purview.","LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has set aside the proceedings against more than a dozen officials of the provincial departments initiated by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for their role in the alleged rigging committed in the 2021 by-poll of NA-75, Daska.  
“Despite repeated queries, learned counsel for the commission has not been able to convince this court that as to what is cavil with the commission to refer the matters of the petitioners for disciplinary action against them by their parent departments, especially, when they do not fall within the definition of election officials,” Justice Shujaat Ali Khan observed in his verdict allowing the writ petitions filed by Asif Hussain and 20 other officials.  
The petitioners challenged the show-cause notices and the subsequent proceedings against them by the ECP.
Senior lawyer Hafiz Tariq Naseem mainly represented the petitioners while other counsels adopted his arguments with little additions.

Court says after poll, duty staff no longer remains within ECP purview

The main argument presented by the petitioner’s counsel was against the competence of the ECP to issue the show-cause notices.  
Justice Khan observes that a person, who has been assigned any election duty, does not remain under the control and superintendence of the ECP upon declaration of fate of an election in a constituency simply for the reason that once fate of an election is declared the hiring staff lose their status as election official and the ECP does not enjoy jurisdiction to proceed against them.
He states that according to section 55(1) of the Election Act, 2017, a person can be deemed to be under the control, superintendence and discipline of the ECP for the period commencing from his date of appointment or deputation till publication of name of the returned candidate in the official gazette.  
“A cursory glance over section 55 of the Act, 2017 shows that the ECP has been empowered to proceed against an election official under the applicable disciplinary law,” he adds.  
The judge says it is very ironical on the one hand the counsel for the ECP took a specific plea that matters pertaining to pre- and post-election issues, including initiation of departmental proceedings against any delinquent official, are to be seen in the light of the referred provisions of the Constitution but has not been able to give any justification as to why impugned show-cause notices have been issued while relying on section 55 of the Act, 2017.  
Commenting on the case of one of the petitioners, the judge notes that the departmental proceedings against a government servant stand abated in the event of his retirement but initiation of the proceedings against the petitioner by the ECP, despite his retirement, speaks volumes about the fact that it proceeded to initiate proceedings against the petitioner without affirming as to whether he is in service or not.
Justice Khan maintains that upon declaration of fate of the election in the constituency, the petitioners no more remained the election officials, hence, the ECP has no jurisdiction to initiate proceedings against them.
“Resultantly, all these writ petitions are accepted and impugned disciplinary proceedings initiated by the Commission against the petitioners are declared coram-non-judice, thus, set aside,” the verdict reads.  
However, the judge, before parting with the judgment, observes that if the ECP thinks that the petitioners were involved in any subversive activities during their deployment in election duty, it would be at liberty to refer their matter to their parent departments for initiation of proceedings under the relevant law.

2022-12-22,2022-12-22,LHC’s power to review SC judgement on JIT questioned,The LHC bench will resume the case hearing today.,"LAHORE: Barrister Syed Ali Zafar, who represents the daughter of a woman killed in the Model Town firing, argued on Wednesday before a Lahore High Court larger bench that it did not have jurisdiction to review a judgment of the Supreme Court to constitute a joint investigation team (JIT) to reinvestigate the 2014 incident.
He contended that the merits of the case were discussed before the apex court.
He argued that the reinvestigation can indeed occur because the law makes no prohibition whatsoever on the extent or number of JITs that can be constituted, and therefore, a new independent investigation could be initiated to ensure that justice is served.
The bench is headed by Chief Justice Muhammad Ameer Bhatti with Justice Malik Shahzad Ahmad Khan, Justice Aalia Neelum, Justice Syed Shahbaz Ali Rizvi, Justice Mirza Viqas Rauf and Justice Tariq Saleem Sheikh.
Barrister Zafar pleaded before the bench that it had been impossible for the victims to expect justice when the investigating agencies were all headed by those who were directly linked to the perpetrators of the heinous act.
He alleged that as the ruling party at the time (i.e., PML-N) was directly involved in the Model Town massacre, its failure to hold anyone to account for this heinous crime must not be ignored.
The bench would resume further hearing on Thursday (today).
Khurram Rafiq and several other police officials facing trial in the private complaint by the PAT challenged the new JIT formed by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf-led provincial government. 
A three-judge bench had on March 22, 2019, suspended the new JIT.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Abdullah Sumbal posted as regular chief secretary,LAHORE: The federal government on Wednesday posted Abdullah Khan Sumbal as the Punjab chief secretary after a delay...,"LAHORE: The federal government on Wednesday posted Abdullah Khan Sumbal as the Punjab chief secretary after a delay of over three months when sitting CS Kamran Ali Afzal went on leave.  
Since then, the Punjab government has given look-after charge of the top administrative office to Mr Sumbal which was extended thrice. The PTI-PMLQ’s coalition government in Punjab views the development as a “serious move” at this critical juncture. However, it believes that the new chief secretary now commanding all administrative powers would not denotify chief minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi if the governor asks him to do so since Mr Elahi did not take vote of confidence on the advice of the Punjab governor.
However, sources in the bureaucracy say the chief secretary is bound to do what the law says, regardless how stakeholders interpret the constitutional provisions.
Earlier, the federal government notified the transfer of Kamran Ali Afzal, who is currently on 130-day ex-Pakistan leave, and transferred Abdulah Khan Sumbal from the Chairmanship of Punjab Planning and Development Board and posted him as regular chief secretary.Mr Afzal had earlier this month requested the Establishment Division to grant him 130-day ex-Pakistan leave as he wanted to travel to Australia. Eventually, the federal government accepted his request and assigned Mr Sumbal current charge of the office for three months with effect from Dec 7.
Mr Sumbal’s name was on the three-member panel sent by the PTI-PMLQ government to the federal government for the posting a regular chief secretary.
Meanwhile, the Punjab government transferred finance secretary Dr Wasif Khurshid and posted him as P&D Board chairman in his own pay and scale against a vacant post – after the posting of Mr Sumbal as chief secretary.
Punjab communications and works secretary Mujahid Sherdil has been transferred and posted as finance secretary. The additional charge of the C&W department has been assigned to Punjab housing urban development and public health engineering secretary Ahmed Mustajab Karamat in addition to his own duties till further order.

FIA Gujrat Deputy Director Ghulam Sarwar Warraich confirmed the registration of a case and said at least two of the suspects had been detained and an investigation was under way.  
The passport office’s former AD Saeed Abbas, data entry operator Zaheer Sial, clerk Shakoor Haider, a citizen Abid Hussain of Nankana Sahib and some other officials were among those booked under different sections of the PPC.  
The officials allegedly issued passports to Abid Hussain and his three children on the basis of fake documents. Using those passports, Hussain had flown abroad along with his children to avoid their possible handing over to their mother while a case was being heard in court.  
The Lahore High Court had ordered the FIA to investigate the matter and take legal action on the application of the children’s mother.  
Mr Warraich said the scope of investigation had been broadened to probe more officials.  
Hussain had first got registration documents of his children issued through the National Database and Registration Authority by showing someone else as his wife on an address in Gujrat, and later managed to get their passports processed with the alleged abetment of passport officials.  
A few weeks ago, the Interior Ministry had removed the entire staff of the passport office on charges of corruption and malpractices, and posted their replacements.  
The incumbent assistant director at the passport office, Hayat Tarrar, said his office had nothing to do with the case as the matter was already being investigated by the FIA.  
The next date of hearing of the case is Thursday (today) where the FIA officials would present the details of the investigation and action taken so far.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Amir Zulfiqar appointed Punjab IGP,"LAHORE: Ending the uncertainty with regard to the appointment of new head of Punjab police, the federal government...","LAHORE: Ending the uncertainty with regard to the appointment of new head of Punjab police, the federal government late on Wednesday posted Muhammad Amir Zulfiqar Khan as provincial police chief.
The federal government has issued the notification for appointment of Mr Zulfiqar as Punjab inspector general of police, who was deputy director general of the Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF). He has previously held the posts of National Highways & Motorway Police IG, Islamabad police IG and Additional IG Operations, CPO Punjab, Lahore.  
Mr Zulfiqar, as an assistant superintendent of police (ASP), won both top police honours -- the Quaid-e-Azam Police Medal and the Pakistan Police Medal. He belongs to Lahore and joined the Police Service of Pakistan (PSP) in 1991 and belonged to 19th Common.
He also served as Toba Tek Singh SSP, Special Branch Punjab SSP and Special Branch Lahore Region SSP, besides serving as Lahore DIG operations, Multan regional police officer (RPO), CTD Punjab DIG. He has served in Sindh, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and federal government.Earlier, a summary of seven police officers was forwarded to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for considering one of the officers for the Punjab IGP slot.
The BS-22 police officers who made a ‘late entry’ in the race for the Punjab’s top police slot are AD Khwaja, Rao Musthaq Ahmed Mehr, Rao Sardar Ali Khan and Ali Aamir Malik.The Punjab government had recommended the names of Fayyaz Ahmad Dev, Amir Zulfiqar and Ghulam Mahmood Dogar, all BS-21 officers for the Punjab IGP post.  
An  official privy to the process says the posting of regular IGP in Punjab was delayed because of the persisting political crisis in the  province. 
He  says that earlier the PML-N had almost agreed on the name of former Lahore capital  city police officer (CCPO) Fayyaz Ahmad Dev for the Punjab IGP slot as  PML-Q leader Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain, who recently joined hands with  the Shehbaz-led federal government, favoured the officer. Punjab Chief  Minister Parvez Elahi had also not objected to Dev’s posting, he adds.       
The official says that when the appointment of Mr Dev was  about to be made, suddenly the political situation in the province  became volatile in the aftermath of the PTI’s announcement to dissolve  the Punjab Assembly.
Meanwhile, he says, some of the BS-22 police  officers also geared up their efforts, using their political  connections, to be considered for the Punjab police’s top slot.  
Consequently, the PML-N government halted the process and added the  names of four senior police officers to the summary to the premier.
The  official source says the issue of appointment of regular IGP in Punjab  has been in the limelight since the PTI came into power in the Centre  and frequently changed provincial police chiefs during its more  than three-year long tenure.  
The crisis further  deepened when another provincial police chief, Faisal Shahkar, refused  to serve in Punjab in the wake of the political tussle between the PML-N  and the PTI-PMLQ governments in the Centre and Punjab, respectively. Mr  Shahkar had sent a written request  to the Establishment  Division to transfer him to the federal government, saying he was unable  to perform his duties in Punjab due to “personal reasons”. 
However, the  federal government asked him to retain his posting till the appointment  of new provincial police chief.
On Tuesday last, Mr Shahkar relinquished his charge as Punjab IGP, as he has to leave Pakistan for the United Nation where he has been selected for the top police slot.
The Punjab government had on Wednesday appointed BS-21 police officer Ghulam Rasool  Zahid, an officer of 19th Common, as acting police chief of the province.

The event, jointly organised by the Punjab University (PU) and GCU, received an enthusiastic and overwhelming response from the students of both varsities. Hundreds of graduates and final-year students flocked to the expo to explore employment and internship opportunities in reputed international and national companies.
Besides software houses and clothing brands, a large number of banks and student start-ups also set up their stall and interviewed the students for different jobs. Special recruitment information stalls set up by the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) and the Pakistan Navy remained the centre of attraction for the youth.
GCU Vice Chancellor (VC) Prof Dr Asghar Zaidi said career expos are usually underrated and misunderstood in Pakistani universities, adding that such events have a wider scope than only offering jobs and internship opportunities. “I urge even my first-year students to spend time with their future employers as they can help you network with people in the industry and you become more aware of the skills your industry values in an employee,” he said.
He said multiple job fairs are held in top universities of the world where students are encouraged to meet their future employers.
Information Technology University VC Dr Sarfraz Khurshid advised the students to never fear rejection, especially in job interviews, saying that many students don’t even try or appear for interviews just because of this fear.
Later, Prof Zaidi visited stalls of different companies and discussed with the executives their recruitment policies and criteria. He told the company executives that GCU not only focused on theoretical teaching, but also laid particular stress on the confidence and character building of its students so that they could perform exceptionally well in their professional lives.
Symposium: The Fatima Jinnah Medical University (FJMU) concluded its annual international scientific symposium on Wednesday. Prof Yasmin Rashid, Punjab health minister, said the occasion allowed teachers and graduate and undergraduate students learn more about current scientific research, which will ultimately help patients.
According to her, the FJMU and the associated Sir Ganga Ram Hospital effectively ran a number of health programmes.
For the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of genetic and hereditary blood illnesses, she claimed that the Punjab Thalassemia and Other Genetic Disorder Prevention and Research Institute, which was created here, offered the best resources.
The Fatima Jinnah Institute of Mother and Child Health, she insisted, was running smoothly.
The facility treats mothers and children, she said, adding that it would undoubtedly help reduce the province’s maternal and child mortality rate.

— Dawn

 
RAHIM YAR KHAN: ‘Illegal’ fishing in different sections of the Indus in Rahim Yar Khan district continues due to non-issuance of tenders by the Punjab Fisheries Department (PFD).
According to sources in the PFD, the limits of the district starts from Panjnad and ends at Machka near Guddo, a long strip of almost 178 kms. The tenders for fishing in four sections of the Indus, including Samakka in Liaqatpur tehsil, Chachran Sharaif in Khanpur, Bangla Dilkusha in Rahim Yar Khan and Machka in Sadiqabad tehsil, are issued after a bidding process
The fisheries department issues tenders for permission of fishing to contractors in August every year but the PFD banned fishing this year to save the rare species of fish in the Indus. But many people started fishing in these sections of the river despite ban.  
Sources say the department [in Rahim Yar Khan] earns almost Rs20 million revenue from contractors by issuing tenders but current year tenders have not been issued as a result locals continued with ‘illegal’ fishing.  
After some complaints from the locals, the department has lifted the ban from fishing. Fisheries Assistant Director Ameer Nawaz Khan told Dawn that the secretary had banned fishing in August 2022 for 10 years but later due to some ‘unknown reasons’ he removed the restriction.  
He said during the ban, he along with his vigilance team raided different locations in the Indus and confiscated two hunting boats, four nets and six trappers. 
He said when his team tried to arrest illegal hunters, they escaped to the other side of the Indus but “my team always continues patrolling.”  
He said tenders would be issued from Dec 26, 2022 and after a bidding process successful contractors would start fishing in these sections.

2022-06-18,2022-12-22,ANALYSIS: ‘Constitutional battle’ likely to land in court,Legal experts believe that a legal battle appears to be the only way forward for resolution of the current crisis in Punjab.,"LAHORE: The ongoing ‘constitutional battle’ between the federal and Punjab governments is likely to land in courts as some questions of law have arisen after Governor Balighur Rehman asked Chief Minister Parvez Elahi to seek a “vote of confidence” in a special assembly session.
The dispute over the previous runoff election of the chief minister was also settled by the courts after the Supreme Court observed in June that a ruling passed by the presiding officer (deputy speaker) regarding the rejection of 10 votes of the Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid (PML-Q), polled in favour of Elahi, was in violation of its judgement and Article 63-A of the Constitution.
Punjab has not seen political stability since the ouster of prime minister Imran Khan through a “vote of no confidence” in April and several petitions are still pending before the courts relating to the chief minister’s election.
If a media statement of Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah Khan is to be believed, the coalition government in the centre is mulling over the imposition of “governor rule” in Punjab since Chief Minister Elahi has not taken a vote of confidence, as asked by the governor.
A source in Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) suggested that the governor, after denotifying the chief minister, could also ask him, under Article 133 of the Constitution, to continue to hold the office until the election of his successor.
Although the lawyers reached by Dawn for their comments differ on the governor’s orders issued to the chief minister, they are unanimous that a legal battle appears to be the only way forward for resolution of the current crisis in Punjab.
Shahzad Shaukat, a former advocate general of the province, believes that any party which feels aggrieved over the actions by the governor or the assembly Speaker is certainly going to knock at the door of the Lahore High Court as a first remedy.
He does not buy the Speaker’s argument that the governor cannot summon a fresh session when the house is already in session. He says the Constitution is superior to all the laws or rules in the country and it does not put such embargo on the governor.
Shaukat argued that the validity of ongoing sessions of the assembly summoned by the speaker can also be questioned since the session called by the governor, which was held in Aiwan-i-Iqbal, has not been prorogued.
However, Safdar Shaheen Pirzada, an advocate of the Supreme Court, disagrees and argues that clause 7 of Article 130 does not allow the governor to summon a fresh session when the house is in session.
He admitted that it is not a constitutional requirement that the speaker keep the house in session only to frustrate, on technical grounds, the governor’s directive to the chief minister to seek a vote of confidence.
According to Pirzada, the Punjab Assembly’s rules and the Constitution do not cater for a situation the province faces at present.
Misunderstanding
Talking to Geo News, retired Justice Shaiq Usmani said the Speaker had misunderstood the constitutional provisions while giving his ruling on the governor’s order.
He said Article 130 (7) says the governor can summon a session if he believes that the CM has lost majority in the house.
He argued that the Constitution has given powers to the governor to summon a session and ask the CM to show that he enjoys confidence of the house.
In reply to a question what would happen if the chief minister did not take a vote of confidence, he said the CM would cease to hold office and a new incumbent should be elected.
In another Geo News programme, a senior lawyer of the Supreme Court, Salman Akram Raja, said it is debatable that clause 7 of Article 130 says the governor shall summon the provincial assembly and require the chief minister to obtain a vote of confidence.
It means, he added, the present assembly is not in session and the governor has specially summoned the assembly for a vote of confidence. “And a new session could be called for this specific purpose.”
He said the rules of the Punjab Assembly, which speak about the vote of confidence, were made before the 18th Amendment. He believed confusion abounded and the speaker could explain through ruling whether he needs a new session for the vote of confidence or not, following the 18th Amendment.
Rule 22 of the Punjab Assembly (rules of procedure) says: “If, on the day fixed by the Governor for obtaining a vote of confidence from the Assembly under clause 7 of Article 130 of the Constitution, the Chief Minister refrains from doing so, it shall be deemed that he does not command the confidence of the majority of the members.”
In the same television programme, a former president of the Supreme Court Bar Association, Hamid Khan, said when an assembly is already in session, the governor is unable to call a new sitting under Article 130.

2022-12-22,2022-12-22,Lahore fog forces PIA to partly shift operations,All international PIA flights between 10pm and 11am to use Islamabad airport.,"RAWALPINDI: Due to poor visibility and fog in Lahore, Pakistan International Airlines on Wednes­day decided to shift all international flight operations between 10pm and 11am from the capital of Punjab to Islamabad.
The rescheduling of flights during these hours is temporary and will be restored as soon as the foggy conditions improve, according to the national flag carrier.
A PIA spokesman said, in a press release issued on Wednesday, the in­­ternational flight operations between 10pm and 11am was moved from Allama Iqbal Inter­national Airport to Islamabad due to foggy weather conditions. The move was aimed at ensuring air safety and saving long waiting time for passengers, he claimed.
 






For timely information of flights, air travellers, as well as those visiting the airport to pick or drop passengers, have been requested to contact PIA call centre at 786786111. PIA passengers have also been requested to record their correct contact number at the time of booking so that they can be provided with timely information about changes in flight timings through call or SMS.

All international PIA flights between 10pm and 11am to use Islamabad airport

The PIA spokesman made it clear that the arrangement for shifting the flight operations had been made temporarily in order to avoid inconvenience of ‘prolonged wait’ to travellers. As soon as the foggy conditions improved, the operations would be restored at Lahore, he added.
Motorway closure
Not only air travellers but also motorists using GT Road and motorway were facing problems due to the foggy weather.
The motorway section from Kot Momin to Faisalabad was closed due to the severity of the fog, which started to increase at around 6pm on Wednesday, DIG Motorway Police (North Zone), told Dawn.
He said the motorway’s closure depended on visibility usually affected by fog.
Heavy fog also caused problems on the Peshawar-Burhan highway, he said.
The Swat Expressway had already been closed for all types of traffic from Colonel Sher Khan to Ismaila due to fog, according to a motorway police spokesman.
He said the public had been requested to avoid unnecessary travel in foggy weather.
In case of necessary travel, however, drivers should use fog lights and ensure the functioning of backlights and wipers and seek assistance from helpline 130 before starting the journey.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Special JIT records statement of Arshad Sharif’s mother,Unsolved cases cast shadow over suitability of officer investigating journalist’s high-profile murder.,"ISLAMABAD: The Spe­c­ial Joint Investi­ga­tion Team (SJIT) on Wednesday visited slain journalist Arshad Sharif’s residence to record his mother’s statement.
In addition, it was learnt that members of the probe team are planning to head to Karachi to record the statements of family members of the two brothers Khurram and Waqar, who accompanied Sharif while he was in Kenya.
The government is also said to be considering the repatriation of the two men from Kenya, Interior Minis­ter Rana Sanaullah has already indicated that the journalist was murdered and the incident requires further investigation.
Separately, questions have been raised on the suitability of an individual who was part of the SJIT to probe the high-profile killing, as one of the officers on the team has previously failed to adequately probe two high profile murders that happened on his watch.

Unsolved cases cast shadow over suitability of officer investigating journalist’s high-profile murder

The capabilities of the official, who has served on the key posts of SSP and DIG Operations in Islamabad, was leading the capital police’s investigations into the Jan 2021 murder of 22-year-old Osama Satti, who was shot in his car by police officials, as well as the rape and murder of 10-year-old Farishta, whose family were allegedly subjected to humiliating treatment by the officials tasked with probing her initial disappearance.
The inquiry conducted to probe these killings blamed the SSP and DIG Operations for failing to “observe their legal responsibility”. 
An inquiry into the 2019 murder of Farishta held the SSP Operations and DIG Operations — both posts were held by the same person at the time — responsible, along with the capital police chief, since they “failed to meticulously observe their legal responsibility”.
Since the official in question held both positions concurrently, the inquiry report said, it was his responsibility to ensure the timely registration of the case and to post efficient SHOs. 
As per the record, the report notes, neither the inspector general or the DIG (Operations) conducted even a single inspection of the police station where the maltreatment took place. It further said the spirit of Chapter 22 of Police Rules 1934 “requires the supervisory officers to personally inspect the police station and note down their remakes in register No 13”.
A judicial inquiry into the murder of Osama Satti also blamed top Islamabad police officials for deploying the “Anti-Terrorism Squad/Crises Response Team, [a] highly skilled force that was not trained to restrain itself” in areas like Srinagar Highway.
It also revealed the Rescue 1122 team was given a “wrong address” and subsequently told to go back through wireless control as if “nothing had happened”.
**Dawn* reached out to the officer in question several times for comment, but he chose not to respond.*

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Flood-hit areas exposed to harsh winter: UN,ISLAMABAD: The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in an interim report on flood damage severity...,"ISLAMABAD: The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in an interim report on flood damage severity and propensity for severe weather says 14 districts of Sindh, 10 districts of Balochistan, nine districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and two of Punjab have been identified as the most exposed to difficult winter conditions.
The UNOCHA report, made available on Wed­nes­day, says that with the onset of winter season, stagnant receding water, displacements at inadequate and makeshift sites, damaged shelters and the lack of appropriate winter clothing, basic household items and safe heating supplies, are contributing to placing millions of people at risk of illness, disease and protection concerns, especially gender-based violence.
Currently, an estimated 14.6 million people need food assistance, while over seven million children and women need immediate access to nutrition services. This includes over 520,000 children facing severe acute malnutrition (SAM) requiring immediate treatment, and close to 80,000 children needing urgent medical interventions due to SAM-related medical complications, the report says.
Preliminary estimates indicate an increase in the national poverty rate of 3.7 per cent to 4pc as a direct result of the floods, placing between 8.4m and 9.1m people into abject poverty.
The report says the losses in food production are compounded by disruption of income and livelihood and the rising prices amid national and global inflation.
An estimated 4.4m acres of crop area, enough to cultivate crop for 14.6m people remain damaged, and more than 800,000 livestock lost.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Nawaz becomes latest beneficiary of amended NAB law,"Case against PML-N supremo, Zardari, Gilani about Toshakhana vehicles returned; court also lacks jurisdiction to try ex-president.","ISLAMABAD: PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif got the first benefit from the recent amendment in the accountability law when a court on Wednesday returned a Toshakhana reference to the anti-graft watchdog that had implicated him as well as PPP leader Asif Zardari and former premier Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani as accused.
The reference, relating to vehicles obtained by the two leaders from the state treasury with the help of Mr Gilani by paying small sums of money as is required by law, was returned by the accountability court to the NAB chairman citing lack of jurisdiction because of the National Accountability (2nd amendment) Act, 2022, that set Rs500 million threshold to make it triable as a NAB case.
Judge Mohammad Bashir returned another reference against Mr Zardari involving a Rs8.3 billion suspicious transaction between the account of Bahria Town and the account of an aide to the ex-president.
In the Toshakhana reference, the court had declared former prime minister Nawaz Sharif a proclaimed offender in September 2020.

Case against PML-N supremo, Zardari, Gilani about Toshakhana vehicles returned; court also lacks jurisdiction to try ex-president in reference involving Rs8.3bn

According to the reference, Mr Sharif and Mr Zardari obtained vehicles from Toshakhana by paying only 15 per cent of the price of the luxury vehicles.
NAB alleged that ex-PM Gilani had facilitated the allotment of vehicles to Mr Zardari and Mr Sharif by “dishonestly and illegally” relaxing the procedure for acceptance and disposal of state gifts vide a Cabinet Division memorandum issued in 2007.
Farooq H. Naek, counsel for Mr Zardari and Mr Gilani, argued before the court that the investigation report worked out that the national exchequer had suffered a loss of Rs118.52m whereas amendments to Section 9 and Section 10 of the National Accountability Ordinance (NAO), 1999, made earlier this year, had set Rs500m minimum value for a case to be investigated by NAB.
Moreover, he said, Sections 3-4 of the Anti-Money Laundering Act (AMLA), 2010, are not applicable to the case against Mr Zardari and Mr Gilani as there is no predicate offence that has been alleged against them, he said.
Mr Naek argued that since NAB lacks jurisdiction in the matter, the court has no jurisdiction in respect of the predicate offence under the NAO.
NAB prosecutor Sohail Arif, on the other hand, argued that the value of predicate offence as per the charge framed by the court is Rs118.52m, which is less than Rs500m as required under Section 5(o) of the NAO for having jurisdiction in the matter.
The court ruled: “In view of Section 5(o) of the NAO, 1999, when the value of the alleged offence under NAO is less than Rs500 million, the case is beyond the domain of NAB and trial under section 3-4 of AMLA, 2010 cannot be continued.”
It declared: “The jurisdiction of this court is as such ousted”.
The judge then returned the reference to the NAB chairman with the directive to the court staff to “return the reference books to the chairman through the investigation officer of the case”.
Suspicious transaction
The reference book pertaining to the Rs8.3bn suspicious transaction was also returned to the NAB chairman by the court.
The NAB had accused Mr Zardari of constructing his house in Clifton, Karachi, with the ill-gotten money. According to details mentioned in the reference, Mushtaq Ahmed, another accused, had provided Rs150m for the construction of the house.
The reference said that Mr Zardari could not provide proof of his claim that he had built the house through legal means.
According to the reference, an illegal transaction of Rs8.3bn was made via Mushtaq Ahmed’s bank account with the money being paid to M/s Bahria Town (Pvt) Limited.
Mushtaq Ahmed worked as a government employee in the President House from 2009 to 2013. He was recruited as a stenographer on the recommendation of Senator Rukhsana Bangash.
Another accused is Zain Malik, son-in-law of Bahria Town’s owner Malik Riaz.
Mr Naek argued that NAB had no jurisdiction to investigate this case since the “value of the offence is Rs150 million which is less than Rs500 million as required under Section 5(o) of NAO added through the NAO 2nd amendment Act 2022 and is given retrospective effect”.
The court noted that it lacks jurisdiction in this matter as well and directed the court staff to return the case file to the NAB chairman.

2022-12-22,2022-12-22,Federal govt consulting provinces on plan to save energy: Asif,QUETTA: The federal government has thrashed out a strategy for energy conservation and started consultations with...,"QUETTA: The federal government has thrashed out a strategy for energy conservation and started consultations with provincial governments in order to remove its flaws before implementation, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said during a meeting at the Quetta Airport on Wednesday.
Petroleum Minister Musadik Malik, Prime Minister’s Adviser Qamar Zaman Kaira, Maulana Abdul Wasey of the JUI-F and Energy Secretary Rashid Mahmood Langaryal accompanied Khawaja Asif.
The defence minister said the government was determined to save energy consumption by adopting drastic measures that would require the nation to make “radical changes in lifestyle”. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had directed the cabinet to share recommendations of a special committee for energy conservation with the provincial governments, the minister said.
The present government inherited a host of problems after taking over in April, a lack of money among them. “But the floods made matters worse by rendering millions of people homeless and financially vulnerable,” the defence minister observed.
Khawaja Asif said the entire world, except Pakistan, opens for business in the morning and downs shutters by sunset. “But the situation is starkly different in our country as markets remain open till late in the night, causing a colossal waste of energy.”
The minister said the special committee had suggested closure of markets and business establishments by 8pm and restaurants by 10pm. “The panel has also suggested changing the working hours of government offices.”
He expressed confidence that the nation would cooperate with the government in implementing the energy conservation strategy.
Khawaja Asif and other members of his delegation stayed at Quetta airport for several hours before returning to Islamabad. Senator Manzoor Kakar, Balochistan’s Finance Minister Zamarak Khan Achakzai and representatives of the Traders and Farmers Action Committee had a meeting with Khawaja Asif at the airport and offered suggestions for resolving the energy crisis.

• Party also elects central and provincial office-bearers
QUETTA: The seventh National Con­gress of the Pashtoonkhwah Milli Aw­a­mi Party (PkMAP) on Wednesday re-elected Mahmood Khan Achakzai as the party’s chairman, Arshad Khan Sw­­abi as senior deputy chairman and Abdul Rahim Ziaratwal as general secretary.
The three-day congress, which concluded on Wednesday night, also elected central and provincial office-bearers, including Abdur Rauf Lala as deputy chairman, and Attal Khan Achakzai as senior deputy secretary.
Among the central secretaries elected were Nawab Ayaz Khan Jogezai, Jumma Gul, Rasan Safi, Nazir Jan Lala, Malik Shaukat, Talimand Khan, Dr Kaleemullah, Fazal Qadir Sherani, Dr Hamid Khan Achakzai, Musa Bacha, Jabbar Khan and Dr Jamil Khan Panizai.
The provincial presidents elected by the party congress included Abdul Qahar Wadan for Balochistan, Dr Mohammad Ali for Khyber Pakhtu­nkhwa, Janan Afghan for Punjab, and Saleem Tareen for Sindh.
The congress also elected national and four provincial Qaumi Jirgas as an electoral college to elect central, provincial executives or cabinets and working committees, respectively.
The congress, attended by delegates from all provinces, discussed organisational affairs, structure and constitution, and endorsed decisions taken by the party chairman in the interim period between the sixth and seventh congresses.
Speaking on the occasion, Mr Achakzai highlighted the egalitarianism of the Pakhtun society in which the noble and a commoner could eat at the same table without any discrimination.
He said Pakhtuns had contributed to human civilisation and politics by constituting states, kingdoms and governance systems on Pakhtun-Afghan land as well as in the subcontinent in various periods of history. For instance, he said, the Sher Shah Suri model of governance and administration was still a point of reference for a welfare system.
“Foreigners’ travelogues have recorded that in Pakhtuns’ land, food and boarding are free for travellers and strangers, as hospitality is enshrined in the codes of ‘Pashtoonwali’,” Mr Achakzai said and wondered how such a society could breed terrorists and terrorism.
The PkMAP chairman said that terrorism and ensuing physical, political and economic sufferings inflicted on Pakhtuns and Afghans living on both sides of the Durand Line were the direct outcome of the international and regional powers’ policies and they pursued their nefarious strategic and economic interests.
He said if the prevailing situation in Afghanistan was not handled humanely and according to principles of international justice and peaceful co-existence, its seismic effects could be felt across the region and beyond.
He said that several superpowers entered as aggressors to conquer Afghanistan, but they never succeeded in their designs.
He urged Pakhtuns to forge unity in their ranks to counter the existential threats that they currently face.

2022-12-22,2022-12-22,"Plan afoot to merge units for health sector reforms, monitoring in KP",Concept paper to be put up to minister next week for consent.,"PESHAWAR: The health department has planned to merge the Health Sector Reforms Unit and Independent Monitoring Unit to “ensure evidence-based approach for policy-making and make recommendations for its implementation on health-related issues”in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, say officials.
They told Dawn that a concept paper for the initiative was being developed for approval by the health minister that was likely to come next week.
Officials said that the HSRU was established in 2003 to carry out research on the province’s health matters backed by statistics and formulate policies to improve patient care, while the IMU was set up in 2016 to monitor health facilities and point out missing facilities, including manpower, medical supplies, equipment and toilets.
They said that the health secretariat had recommended a combined structure for both units provided with data and insights to devise policies and implement them for improving patient care in the province.

Concept paper to be put up to minister next week for consent

The officials said that it had been realised making these units into one was needed because it would strengthen policy-making, implementation, health economics, human resources and other aspects of the department.
They said the IMU had all data of health facilities and the HSRU that of the policy-making and coordination with the centre and donor agencies about healthcare in the province.
The officials said that the proposed Health Sector Reform and Monitoring Unit (HSRMU) would suggest broad-based policies to the government and recommend implementation.
They said that a BPS-20 doctor from the administrative cadre would head the unit, which was to operate as an advisory body driven by scientific researches to develop policies for the provision of better care to patients in line with the deficiencies to be recorded by current IMU staff members, who were set to become part of the proposed entity.
The officials said that the IMU inspected public sector health facilities and prepared monthly and quarterly reports about missing facilities.
They said that the proposed HSRMU would be responsible for the overall leadership, supervision, management, and monitoring affairs to achieve the objectives.
According to officials, the health department wants to come up with innovative healthcare measures as suggested by the proposed body.
They said that the HSRMU would lead, supervise and contribute in all technical areas ranging from identification of policy issues to guiding towards drafting of policy documents in the areas identified in project documents and would convene and direct technical meetings as required.
The officials also said that the unit would play the overall leadership and supervisory roles besides performing communication functions in addition to scrutinising the quality of reports for accuracy and present the monthly and quarterly progress reports to the health secretary and minister as well as the chief minister.
They said that the HSRMU would examine matters relating to policy and strategic planning and advice on policy, strategy frameworks and health systems at provincial and district levels, and would plan, manage and implement the overall procurement strategy for the health department.
The officials said that the proposed body would prepare a policy implementation roadmap and monitor progress of all policy changes and human resource strategy for the department, including standardisation of recruitment process and term of reference of all personnel.
They also said that the HSRMU would have the services of primary and secondary healthcare specialists to give technical support on designing and implementation of primary and secondary healthcare reforms, and get the services of infrastructure specialists for infrastructure revamp strategy, oversee implementation and budget utilisation.
The officials said that the proposed unit would have broader responsibilities which included legal drafting for reviewing contracts besides carrying out economic evaluation of health interventions, formulating recommendations, and liaising with partner organisations for implementation.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,KP ministers blame ‘regime change’ for security issue,Taimur Saleem Jhagra says security challenges surfaced in KP after the removal of Imran Khan from office.,"PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government on Wednesday blamed the security issue in the province on the ouster of Prime Minister Imran Khan’s government in April this year.
It also flayed Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s administration on the criticism of the province’s police and counter-terrorism department over the seizure of the CTD centre in Bannu.
Accompanied by adviser to the chief minister on home Babar Salim Swati and higher education minister Kamran Bangash, finance minister Taimur Saleem Jhagra told reporters here that security challenges surfaced in the province after the removal of Prime Minister Imran Khan from power and that the “regime change” was responsible for the current law and order situation in the province.
He said a comparison of the security situation before and after the Shehbaz-government in the centre was enough to confirm his assertion.
The minister said terrorist activities on the country’s western borders began in 2001.
He said the post-2001 deaths in the province’s tribal districts (erstwhile Fata) outnumbered those reported nationwide during the period showing how ‘ignorant’ interior minister Rana Sanaullah and defence minister Khwaja Asif were about such casualties.
“It’s very sad to hear [remarks of members of the federal cabinet],” he said.
Mr Jhagra said the security situation had improved after the fencing of western borders and that was maintained by the centre and not KP.
He blamed Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s administration for the province’s financial challenges.
The minister said in the third letter to former adviser to PM Shehbaz Sharif on finance Miftah Ismail, he had warned that the continued denial of funds by the centre to the province could lead to security challenges in the province.
He said his government had to make “compromises on different things” due to those funding denial.
Aide to the chief minister Babar Saleem Swati said the “regime change” had led to “security pressure”, so he wondered why the state institutions continued to support Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s administration.
“What is happening right now [in the province] is just because of the regime change in the country,” he insisted.
He said KP acted as a buffer zone on the Western border.
Mr Swati said the sacrifices rendered by the province showed that its forces and residents continued to stand firm against militancy.
He said the provincial government had established CTD regional offices and would set up a few more soon.
Minister Kamran Bangash said there was a huge difference between the law and order situation in the province before and after 2013.
He said the federation should behave like a federation.
Mr Bangash said the provincial government, police and CTD were vigilant and were taking all necessary steps to maintain the law and order situation in the province.
‘We will fight militancy together,” he said.

“The man stated to be the owner of the house was burnt to death in his room. We have retrieved his charred body from the rubble and shifted it to hospital for autopsy,” Amir Khadam, a Rescue 1122 official, told reporters. 
The fire, which according to conflicting reports broke out either due to electricity short-circuiting or gas heater leakage, engulfed the double-storey house within no time, reducing household goods, including cash, gold ornaments and other valuables, to ashes. 
Fire tenders and ambulances of Rescue 1122 and tehsil municipal administration, Baffa-Pakhal, immediately responded to calls made by a women living in the adjacent house, and put out the flames after hectic efforts of many hours.  
The family of house owner, Mohammad Ijaz, had gone to his in-laws’ house, and he was alone there, sleeping in a room, Mr Khadam said, adding the charred body was shifted to the King Abdullah Teaching Hospital. 
The police, after registering an FIR, started investigation to ascertain the exact cause of the fire.  
Meanwhile, unknown assailants killed a young boy, namely Mohammad Rizwan, in Kirpai area of Oghi. 
The police said the boy was standing outside his cattle pen when assailants showed up there and opened indiscriminate fire on him, leaving him seriously injured. He was rushed to a nearby hospital, where doctors pronounced him dead. 
The police, after lodging FIR, started making efforts to arrest the culprits. 
Separately, the people on Wednesday complained millers were selling low quality wheat flour to them under the government’s subsidised flour scheme. 
“The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government is providing subsidy to millers to supply wheat flour at subsidised rate, but the latter are selling inferior quality commodity to consumers,” Mohammad Ajmal, a local, told reporters. 
He said the food department should check the quality of wheat flour being sold in Mansehra under the government’s relief package. 
“The subsidy being provided by the government on wheat to millers is only meant to provide relief to people, but millers are fleecing consumers,” he said.

When contacted, Mr Rashid Advocate confirmed to Dawn the receipt of such a letter, saying he had informed the district police about it.
However, an advisory note issued to him by DSP Swabi tehsil says he should take precautionary measures for his security. He has been told to avoid unnecessary movement; keep a licensed weapon, if any, for his defense/protection and maintain security on his part. The note, however, said policemen in plainclothes ‘will frequently be active in the surroundings of his house’.
He has been asked to contact immediately the Swabi district police officer, DSP headquarters, SHO Swabi city police station and the police control room in case he spots any suspect around.

Talking to mediapersons, he said the former PTI government in the centre had pushed the country’s economy into deep crisis.
Mr Younus insisted Imran Khan did not have sustainability in his policies and changed his positions repeatedly, harming the nation and future of younger generation.
He claimed the nation was no longer interested in following the former prime minister. He said Pakistan needed ‘serious’ leaders to tackle the issues in a prudent manner.

Talking to mediapersons at the inauguration of several projects in the provincial capital, Mr Khan said that they would also take the matter of denial of the province’s share in federal resources to the Supreme Court. 
He said that the ‘imported government’ wanted to create financial instability in the province by withholding the budgeted shares of KP. He regretted that the development funds of the province were being distributed among MNAs of the ‘imported government’, adding that this public money would go into their pockets instead of being spent on the welfare of people. 
Responding to a question regarding the possible dissolution of the provincial assembly, he made it clear that Imran Khan was the chairman of the party. “Whatever decision he takes; we will ensure its implementation,” he said. 

CM threatens sit-in outside NA over ‘denial’ of dues by centre

The chief minister said that his government had initiated multiple projects for beautification of the provincial capital. 
He inaugurated the newly-established Institute of Criminology and Forensic Sciences at the University of Peshawar and performed the groundbreaking of various projects worth Rs3.23 billion under the Peshawar Uplift Programme Phase-II. 
He also inaugurated construction work on the establishment of Technology Development Centre in Agriculture University, Peshawar.

He asked the government to review its Afghan policy and remove the shortcomings from its security policy. 

Calls for review of Afghan policy

Commenting on the Bannu incident, he said the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government had failed to build the capability of the police and other law-enforcement agencies.

Though schools’ heads claimed canteens in their respective institutions were selling quality products, the assistant commissioner said he had received reports that such places were selling substandard food items to students, thus compromising their health.
He said health issues were rising among the school going children due to use of substandard edible items, particularly snacks, chips and biscuits.
Mr Asif told Dawn that he had given two days to the private schools management to improve quality of foods being sold at their canteens.

Addressing a protest rally and later speaking at a press conference in Timergara Press Club, the representatives of the affected people, including Mushtaq Ali, Inam Khan, Mian Gul Zahoor, Aftab Utmani and others, said they had got a stay order from the court against razing the shops, but the administration violated that order and started destroying the structures at night using the state force. 
They clarified that they had invested millions of rupees on building plazas and shops on both sides of the Khwar (stream) at a reasonable distance from it and would not let the administration to raze them. 
The owners complained that the administration had not taken them into confidence before demolishing their plazas and shops along the stream. 
They rejected the administration’s claim to implement the Timergara city beautification project, saying the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government had no funds even for paying salaries of its employees. 
Deputy commissioner Zubair Niazi had claimed the other day that a total of 257 shops, two plazas and one hotel built on the watercourse had been demolished. He had said the administration would not accept any pressure for stopping the anti-encroachment campaign.

Special Judge (Central) Azam Khan observed that Senator Swati had repeated the same crime in which he was already on a post-arrest bail.
During the course of the hearing, FIA’s special prosecutor Raja Rizwan Abbasi argued that Mr Swati operated a verified Twitter account and he was being followed by politicians, journalists and the public at large. He said Mr Swati never contested the ownership of his Twitter handle and used it to build an anti-army narrative.
Mr Abbasi claimed this was a deliberate attempt to incite mutiny among personnel of the armed forces. He said the PTI leader misused the relief of bail and tweeted the same text for which he was facing a case before the FIA’s Cybercrimes Wing.
Mr Swati’s counsel Babar Awan argued that the complainant, who had lodged the first information report (FIR) against his client, was not an aggrieved party.
He said the case had been registered by the FIA and it was not on a par with the complaint filed under defamation laws.
Mr Awan argued that the court could impose a maximum penalty of Rs1,000 on Mr Swati over his tweet, but he was being moved from one province to another.
The FIA had earlier this month arrested Mr Swati for defamation, statement conducing to public mischief, and highly obnoxious campaign of intimidating tweets, after his fiery speech at a PTI long march in Rawalpindi in which he lashed out at the senior military leadership.

2022-12-20,2022-12-22,‘TTP is Pakistan’s absolute red line’,Bilawal says Islamabad willing to consider all options to ensure citizens’ safety and security.,"WASHINGTON: Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has suggested letting neighbouring countries know that the outlawed TTP is an “absolute red line” for Pakistan and it would not allow anyone to cross that line.
“As far as the TTP (Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan) is concerned, it’s absolutely our red line. It is something that we will not tolerate,” said the foreign minister while speaking at the Atlantic Council, Washington, on Tuesday evening. 
“And absolutely we will be willing to consider each and every single option to ensure the safety and security of our people.” 

 





 
As the foreign minister stressed the need for combating militants in his Washington talk, Pakistan’s UN Ambassador Munir Akram told the UN Security Council in New York that engagement with the Taliban was the best option to stabilise the region.
“Coercion and isolation have not proved successful in the past; they will prove to be counter-productive now and in the future,” said Ambassador Akram while participating in a UN debate on the situation in Afghanistan. “We need a coherent and practical plan to realise the objectives of the international community through patient engagement with the interim government,” the Pakistani envoy told the 15-member Council.

Bilawal says Islamabad willing to consider all options to ensure citizens’ safety and security

Mr Bhutto-Zardari made a similar observation in his talk at the Atlantic Council, urging world powers to work with Afghanistan’s de facto rulers to stabilise the region. When the moderator, Uzair Younus, asked if Pakistan could deploy troops inside Afghanistan or on the border to stop attacks by Afghanistan-based militant groups, the minister suggested using the “hammer and anvil” strategy, with Kabul’s cooperation, to eliminate militancy.
The chief Pakistani diplomat pointed out that despite these border and cross-border attacks, the situation was far more secure and stable now than it was in 2007, when Pakistan launched a series of operations against the TTP and other militants.
“But those things can be put at risk if this goes unchecked. And obviously that would undermine any hope, whether it is CPEC or any other form of economic activity. Nobody wants to put lives at risk in order to conduct business,” he warned.
“That’s why I have been particularly hawkish on the issue of the TTP, and on the issue of terrorism in general. I believe that recent events in the region are alarming, not only the border incidents but the recent Bannu incident, which our security commanders have very bravely managed to overcome,” he said.
The foreign minister, however, stressed the need to “impress on our neighbours, particularly Afghan­istan” that they have to demonstrate the will and the capacity to take on the TTP or other groups functioning from there.
He acknowledged that there’s room for improvement in Pakistan’s Afghan policy — as there’s in America’s — and “we need to be serious about what we can do going forward”.
“Are we going learn from our mistakes to ensure that we do not repeat them,” he asked. “The answer to that question is going to define the safety and stability of Afghanistan, the safety and stability of Pakistan and the safety and stability of our region.” 
Pakistan’s number one option, he said, was to get the Afghan interim government to demonstrate that they had the capacity to deal with this issue.
Separately, the foreign minister also met Deputy Secretary of State Wendy R. Sherman where they discussed Pakistan’s efforts to recover from devastating floods and the upcoming Jan 9 International Con­ference on Climate Resilient Pakistan in Geneva. 
According to a readout issued by the State Department, the US official expressed condolences for Pakistani lives lost in recent terrorist attacks, and they committed to strengthen cooperation between the two countries.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,ECC defers PSO’s request for Rs17bn,Receivables of embattled national fuel supplier cross Rs612bn.,"ISLAMABAD: The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet was informed on Wednesday that receivables of the national fuel supplier – Pakistan State Oil (PSO) had crossed Rs612 billion and it was struggling to manage remittances to its foreign suppliers.
The meeting of the ECC presided over by Finance Minister Ishaq Dar, however, did not immediately approve Rs17bn urgently demanded by the PSO to honour its liabilities to international firms, particularly its long-term fuel supplier Kuwait Petroleum Company (KPC).
“The ECC deferred a summary submitted by the Ministry of Energy (Petroleum Division) for foreign exchange coverage to PSO and directed the Ministry of Energy to resubmit the summary after reviewing the numbers”, said an official statement.
The Petroleum Division reported that under a credit facility provided by KPC since 2000 and extended annually for the supply of diesel, a joint account of the federal government and KPC had been set up with the National Bank of Pakistan in which PSO keeps on depositing rupee equivalent funds after 30 days of the bill of lading for each shipment.
After 90 days from the bill of lading, the NBP has to transfer the cargo cost to KPC and exchange cover for an additional 60 days is borne by the federal government.
However, the account facility started to face huge shortfalls in April 2020 on account of exchange losses, posing a default situation in remittances to KPC.
At the time the ECC approved a supplementary grant of Rs12bn which helped PSO avoid an international default. The facility worked well for another two years but then suffered a shortfall again and now this shortfall stood at Rs17bn owing to “prevalent upheaval” in the rupee-dollar parity.

Receivables of embattled national fuel supplier cross Rs612bn

The Petroleum Division said the PSO had been defaulting even on rupee deposits in the NBP account because of its liquidity challenges as its receivables reached Rs612bn and “it urgently required adequate funds so that liabilities are met on time”. 
The Petroleum Division and PSO have been trying to manage the situation for avoiding international default by depositing required funds on due dates but the situation was “too critical” now.
It also complained that the Petroleum Division had been submitting budget requirements for exchange loss on this facility every year but the Ministry of Finance did not make separate provisions which led to exposure to international default.
The finance ministry, however, argued that the government had already released Rs30bn to address PSO’s liquidity position under the foreign exchange head in September and arranged another Rs50bn through market financing. Also, the government was now trying to ensure PSO recoveries through power companies and gas companies.
The Petroleum Division, however, insisted that the matter related to actual foreign exchange loss of over Rs17bn so far on the KPC’s credit facility up to Dec 2, which has to be paid by the government sooner or later.
“PSO has made all outstanding payments delayed due to liquidity position. Exchange loss, however, is the liability of the government”, Petroleum Division was quoted but a decision was deferred.
Supplementary grants
The ECC approved a summary of the Ministry of Energy (Petroleum Division) on the transfer of 30pc working interests in exploration licences/block – Margala Block – owned by M/s MOL of Hungary to M/s Mari Petroleum Company Ltd. 
It was apprised that Margala Block was governed by Pakistan Petroleum Exploration and Production Rules 2001 and the acquiring company MPCL was operating in Pakistan since 1954 and has working interests in 23 exploration licences and 15 development & production leases. The ECC was further informed that M/s MOL had cleared all its financial obligations.
The ECC also approved a Rs823m technical supplementary grant to the Ministry of Maritime Affairs, enabling Gwadar Port Authority (GPA) to disburse the amount of Rs250,000 per head to 3,291 fishermen registered with Balochistan Fisheries Department for the purchase of boat engines.
The ECC also approved another Rs200mn Technical Supplementary Grant to the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulation and Coordination for Ghurki Trust Teaching Hospital (GTTH), Lahore. Ghurki Trust Teaching Hospital (GTTH) is a tertiary care non-profit organisation providing “State of the Art” health facilities to needy and poor patients.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,"China willing to provide ‘all kinds of assistance’, envoy assures Dar","Both sides deliberate on several avenues for expanding bilateral relations, especially in the economic and financial sectors.","ISLAMABAD: China assured Pakistan on Wednesday that it is ready to help Islamabad in every possible way following its request for about $8.75 billion in an additional financial package, including the rollover of debt, bank deposits and currency swaps.
Chinese Ambassador in Islamabad Nong Rong called on Finance Minister Ishaq Dar on Wednesday and “assured continuous support of the Chinese government to Pakistan”, the finance ministry said in a statement.
The “government of China stands with the people of Pakistan and is willing to provide all kinds of assistance”, the statement added.
Mr Dar told reporters last month that Pakistan had sought about $9bn in additional financial support from China during the visit of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to Beijing, and that the Chinese leadership had promised to “roll over $4bn in sovereign loans, refinance $3.3bn commercial bank loans and increase currency swap by about $1.45bn — from 30bn yuan to 40bn yuan”. The total worked out at $8.75bn.
Pakistan needs at least $34bn until June 30, 2023, to meet its international liabilities, including debt and trade payments. Pakistan is banking on about $13bn in additional support from China and Saudi Arabia.
The statement said Mr Dar “thanked the Chinese ambassador for their continuous support and assistance” and praised the long-standing and deep-rooted friendly relations between the two countries.
Both sides deliberated on several avenues for expanding bilateral relations, especially in the economic and financial sectors. The ambassador appreciated the government’s policy initiatives to sustain and boost fiscal and monetary stability.
Mr Dar had earlier said that the Chinese president and prime minister had assured Prime Minister Sharif that his government would stand by Pakistan and “will not let you down”.
He had then separately taken up the issue of refinancing $3bn in China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) deposit and about $3.3bn debt rollover. Both these heads are due for maturity on different dates before June 30.

• Interior ministry asks Rangers, FC to perform security duties in Punjab
LAHORE: In a tit-for-tat move, Governor Balighur Rehman on Wednesday termed the ruling of Punjab Assembly Speaker Sibtain Khan disposing of his directives regarding the vote of confidence “unconstitutional”, whereas the coalition government hinted at the imposition of governor’s rule in Pakistan’s largest province.
The PML-N government initially hinted that governor’s rule could be imposed for two months through a resolution in a joint session of parliament, but the period could be extended to six months.
“Since the chief minister on Wednesday failed to take the trust vote in the Punjab Assembly in compliance with the governor’s order, legally he ceases to hold his office. And now any time... probably on Thursday (today), the governor can issue an order de-notifying the CM,” Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah said earlier in the day.
This view was echoed by SAPM Attaullah Tarrar, who told reporters late on Wednesday night that the governor had discretionary powers to de-notify the CM and it was up to him whether he wanted to do it “tomorrow or the day after”.
Another option, Mr Sanaullah said, is governor’s rule by the Centre. “In the wake of the constitutional crisis, the government may get a resolution passed from the National Assembly and Senate to impose governor’s rule in Punjab for two months initially — the period can be extended to six months as well,” the minister added.
He was of the view that “all was not well” in the camp of Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Punjab parliamentary party. “Had the PTI been confident that CM Elahi could secure the support of 186 MPAs in the PA he would have gone for the trust vote on Wednesday in compliance with the governor’s order,” he said, adding that the CM could have gone for PA’s dissolution after the vote in line with Imran Khan’s plan for the dissolution of assemblies. “But the PTI chose otherwise because it knew it did not have the required number,” Mr Sanaullah claimed.
Governor’s order on PA speaker ruling
In the late evening, Governor Rehman wrote a three-page order in response to PA Speaker Sibtain Khan’s ruling which had termed Mr Rehman’s order seeking vote of confidence from Mr Elahi ‘illegal’.
In his order, the governor said under Article 130(7) of the Constitution that PA speaker’s ruling had no bearing on his order and termed it unconstitutional. The governor said the speaker’s ruling was also in violation of Rule 209 of the Rules of Procedure of the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab, 1997.
“The speaker’s ruling, consequent acts and omissions constitute and result in enabling the chief minister to refrain from obtaining a vote of confidence in terms of Article 130(7). Helping and aiding the CM in refraining from fulfilling his duty and preventing the constitutional process from proceeding to its logical end leads to the consequences stipulated in Rule 22 (7) of the Rules of Procedure of the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab, 1997.”
Meanwhile, taking a screenshot of the governor’s reply, PTI senior leader Fawad Chaudhry, in a tweet, asked Mr Rehman not to make a mockery of his office. “Dear Governor! Do not make a mockery of your office, the speaker’s ruling is final as far affairs of the Assembly are concerned and do not expose yourself to misconduct proceedings. Respect the Constitution,” he added.
Earlier in the day, the governor held a meeting with the PML-N and PPP leaders and legal experts to discuss the strategy of the federal government. Federal ministers Rana Sanaullah and Saad Rafique, premier’s special assistants Attaullah Tarar and Malik Ahmed Khan, and PPP Punjab parliamentary party leader Hasan Murtaza were present in the meeting.
Separately, the federal government on Wednesday decided to deploy Pakistan Rangers and Frontier Constabulary (FC) across Punjab, interior ministry sources said, adding that the federal agencies would ensure law and order in the province and work for implementation of laws and Constitution.
Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah directed the Punjab chief secretary and inspector general of police to maintain law and order, protection of the life and property of the people, and perform their duties as per law and Constitution, sources said.
The interior minister also warned officials not to become part of any process that was against the law and Constitution.

2022-12-22,2022-12-22,‘Unconstitutional’ removal of chief minister to be opposed: PTI,Imran to announce party’s future course of action at protest today.,"• Imran to announce party’s future course of action at protest today
• Fawad claims Zardari offered PTI women MPAs Rs50m each to abstain from voting
• As per agreement with PTI, PML-Q to get 30 PA, 15 NA seats 
LAHORE: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has announced that it will challenge any “unconstitutional” move of de-notifying Punjab Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi, and asked its leadership, parliamentarians and party workers to reach the Governor House at 5pm on Thursday (today) to ‘block’ the governor from taking any such action.
PTI Chairman Imran Khan will address the protesters through video link and announce the party’s next line of action in the face of the provincial opposition’s moves to save the Punjab Assembly.
Earlier on Wednesday, Governor Balighur Rehman had declared Punjab Assembly Speaker Sibtain Khan’s ruling regarding CM Elahi’s vote of confidence “unconstitutional” and “illegal”.
On Tuesday, the speaker had termed the governor’s orders — to the CM to obtain a vote of confidence from the provincial assembly by 4pm on Wednesday — as “illegal, against the provisions of the Constitution and thus stand disposed of”, and issued a ruling in this regard.
The PTI leadership on Wednesday maintained the speaker had ruled that the assembly was in session and until the session was prorogued, the governor could not summon a fresh session, citing a 1997 ruling by the Lahore High Court. They said the court had ruled that “not less than 10 clear days” must be granted to the chief minister to obtain a vote of confidence.
PTI Central Punjab General Secretary Hammad Azhar gave a call to PTI leaders, lawmakers and party workers and supporters to reach outside the Governor House at 5pm on Thursday (today).
“The masses can no longer remain silent spectators while an unconstitutional game is being played,” he remarked.
Meanwhile, the federal government has sought deployment of Rangers to beef up security of the Governor House “till further orders under sections 7(b) and 10 of the Pakistan Rangers Ordinance, 1959 and Section 4(3)(i) of Anti-Terrorism Act 1997”.
“The Pakistan Rangers (Punjab) is requested to immediate necessary action with regard to beefing up the security at the Governor’s House, Lahore, in coordination with the office of the governor,” said the Interior Ministry.
PTI senior leader Fawad Chaudhry told the media outside party chief Imran Khan’s Zaman Park residence that the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) parties were ‘scared of’ holding general elections, adding they would be violating the Constitution’s Article 109 by asking the chief minister to take a vote of confidence immediately. 
He said the governor should give 10 clear days for the vote or challenge the Punjab Assembly speaker’s ruling in court.
He further said the PTI had called its parliamentary party meeting on Thursday (today) and stressed its 177 as well as the PML-Q’s 10 MPAs were available to foil a no-confidence motion submitted by the PML-N and the PPP separately against the chief minister as well as the Punjab Assembly speaker and deputy speaker.
Mr Chaudhry also claimed that the party’s women MPAs had told Mr Khan that they were receiving offers from former president Asif Zardari to abstain from voting for Rs50 million each.
“The people of Sindh should know that Asif Zardari is spending their welfare money to buy loyalties of PTI MPAs,” he said.
Claiming that some other MPAs had also received threatening calls to abstain from voting, he demanded the superior courts take notice and identify those who were trying to terrify the party legislators.
“As soon as the vote of no-confidence fails, the Punjab Assembly will be dissolved and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly will follow suit,” he declared.
On the other hand, a three-member committee of the PTI held a meeting with CM Elahi and his party members and discussed seat adjustment prospects in detail.
As part of a formula, sources said, the PTI agreed to offer 30 Punjab Assembly and 15 National Assembly seats to the PML-Q. The party of the Chaudhrys had sought seats in the newly created Gujrat division – their hometown -- that included Gujrat, Mandi Bahauddin, Wazirabad and Hafizabad districts, some parts of south Punjab as well as Sialkot.
PTI leader Shafqat Mahmood later confirmed that both the allied parties had mutually agreed over giving 30 Punjab and 15 National Assembly seats to Mr Elahi’s party.
Meanwhile, the PML-Q held its parliamentary party meeting, chaired by CM Elahi and parliamentary leader Sajid Bhatti, and discussed the current political situation and decided their future course of action.
The chief minister has also called the provincial cabinet’s seventh meeting at his office on Thursday (today) at 1:30pm with 21 items on the agenda.
Soon afterwards, PML-Q MNA Hussain Elahi tweeted that all 10 PML-Q MPAs had announced complete support for PTI chief Imran Khan and Chief Minister Parvez Elahi in the meeting.
Responding to the PDM government’s claim that it had won the loyalties of six PML-Q MPAs, Mr Hussain asserted that the federal ruling coalition would not be able to fool anyone with its propaganda, and commented: “They (PDM) talk about six MPAs when they can’t even break one.”
A PML-Q spokesman said the parliamentary party had delegated complete authority of making all the decisions to CM Elahi and resolved to vote in favour of the CM, speaker and deputy speaker when a vote of no-confidence was taken up in the house.
Mr Elahi also asserted that the PML-Q would continue standing by Imran Khan and that his party was united and would remain so to bulldoze any propaganda or rumours being spread by the PDM government in the Centre.
Earlier in the day, as Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah had claimed he would seal the Chief Minister House if Mr Elahi didn’t take a vote of confidence, the CM’s son, Moonis, said he had “reached 8-Club CM House and waiting for you”. A few hours later, he tweeted: “Rana sb am bored now. Heading home but pls do let me know when you plan to come.”

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,"PTI set to approach SC, not speaker, for resignations’ acceptance","“We are dealing with those people who do not have any moral standing,” says Senator Shibli Faraz.","ISLAMABAD: Contra­dicting the announcement it made only days ago that PTI members of National Assembly are ready to appear before Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf for verification of their resignations, the party on Wednesday changed its stance as senior party leader Senator Shibli Faraz declared that the lawmakers would not go to the Parliament House, and instead, the PTI would approach the Supreme Court to seek acceptance of the mass resignations.
“We had decided to go to the assembly for acceptance of our resignations. But this is not the way and MNAs, who are elected by the people, cannot be asked to keep standing in a queue for acceptance of their resignations … The government is doing all this [handling the resignation issue] with a mala fide intention,” said Mr Faraz, alleging that the speaker wanted to “humiliate” the PTI lawmakers by treating them as “charity seekers”.
Talking to Dawn, Mr Faraz said they would approach the Supreme Court and ask it to direct the speaker to accept the resignations submitted some eight months ago.
“We will go to the SC in a day or two,” he said.
The party is going to the apex court where this issue has already been discussed during the hearing of various petitions and even the judges had observed that PTI should reconsider its decision of quitting the assembly.
When asked if it was not a U-turn as PTI Vice Chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi had written a letter to the speaker only six days back, asking him to allocate some time for the party’s MNAs to verify their resignations, Mr Faraz said they wanted to do so, but the government did not seem to be serious which was evident from the fact that it had convened a session of the National Assembly on Thursday (today) on a one-day notice despite the fact that the speaker was not even present in the country.
“This is not a U-turn. Look at the spirit of the matter. Why is the government delaying acceptance of our resignations? Why has the speaker adopted a pick-and-choose policy by accepting the resignations of only 11 members?” he said, adding that submission of mass resignations was part of the party strategy to force the government to hold early elections in the country. Otherwise, he said, the party MNAs could have been asked to submit resignations in groups.
When his attention was drawn to the assembly rules under which the speaker is required to individually call the members for verification of resignations, Mr Faraz posed a valid counter-question, saying: “Under which law did the speaker accept the resignations of the 11 MNAs who had also not appeared before him for verification [of their resignations]?”
“We are dealing with those people who do not have any moral standing,” the PTI senator alleged, questioning the logic behind the speaker’s decision to accept the resignations of 11 members out of 123 who had submitted the resignations en masse at the time of the election of Shehbaz Sharif as the prime minister in April.
On Dec 15, while talking to reporters in Lahore, Mr Qureshi had expressed his party’s resolve to dissolve the assemblies of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and get the MNAs’ resignations accepted after appearing before the speaker.
“We have already made our decision. We will execute it,” he had stated, adding that party Chairman Imran Khan had given him the letter for sending it to the speaker.
He also waved the ‘letter’ bearing the subject “Resignations of MNAs of PTI” to the media and chided the speaker for being “selective” while accepting the resignations of 11 MNAs “illegally”.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,"Onus on Centre to fight militancy, says KP",KP govt's spokesperson says the police’s job is to counter routine crimes and ‘national security’ is beyond their mandate.,"PESHAWAR: As some semblance of normalcy returned to Bannu on Wednesday, a day after an operation against terrorists, the under-fire KP government refused to accept the blame for the resurgence of terrorism, saying it was the responsibility of the Centre to tackle the issue.
Chief Minister Mahmood Khan in a media talk declared that ‘fighting militancy’ was the mandate of the federal government.
Meanwhile, President Arif Alvi, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Army chief Gen Syed Asim Munir, separately, paid tribute to the soldiers who took part in the operation at the CTD centre in Bannu on Tuesday.
The KP chief minister explained that it was the Centre’s job to fight militancy since the institutions fighting [against militants] fell within the jurisdiction of the federal government.
“Crime and law and order situation is the provincial government’s job but militancy falls within their [federal government’s] domain and hence this is their responsibility,” he maintained.
Besides, the chief minister claimed that the federal government was reluctant to release funds for both current and developmental expenditures. “Neither do we receive the current nor the developmental expenditures [funding],” he said and alleged that the funds were being diverted to the federal government’s members of parliament.
Endorsing the CM’s views, the KP government’s spokesperson told a press briefing that the police’s job was to counter routine crimes and ‘national security’ was beyond its mandate.
He said the incident that took place inside the Bannu CTD centre fell within the definition of ‘national security’ which was the federal the government’s domain.
“This is not something about general law and order…it falls within the domain of the national security which is the responsibility of the federal government,” CM Adviser on Information Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif said.
In reply to a question about the recently held talks with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Afghanistan, the special assistant said that war had never ended since 2001 and dialogue was an attempt to further improve the situation but a permanent solution [to militancy] could not be found.
“The reason for dialogue with them [TTP] was to improve the situation,” Mr Saif said, adding that war never ended, though its intensity fluctuated. “We wanted a permanent solution but it did not happen,” he said while explaining the reason for holding talks with the Taliban.
A KP minister, however, appeared to have a different stance, reported APP.
Kamran Bangash at a presser reiterated the provincial government’s resolve to eliminate terrorism and extremism in all its forms and manifestations and said the government was taking pragmatic steps to improve the capacity of police and the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD).
Referring to the terrorist attack on the CTD compound, he said police and security forces had already shared information about the possible terrorist attacks.
Meanwhile, Chief of Army Staff Gen Syed Asim Munir met the officers and soldiers, who were injured during the Bannu operation, at the CMH Rawalpindi, according to an Inter-Services Public Relations release.
The COAS remained with them for some time and inquired about their well-being.
He appreciated their high spirit and morale and lauded their professionalism during the operation against the terrorists.
Pledge against terrorism
President Alvi lauded the security forces for carrying out a successful operation against terrorists in Bannu and expressed the resolve to eliminate terrorism from the country’s soil, APP reported.
The president, in a statement, termed the success a result of the professionalism of security forces and their unwavering commitment against terrorism.
In separate remarks, Prime Minister Sharif said the state would not surrender to any terrorist group or organisation and vowed that militants would be dealt with according to the Constitution and law.
Strongly condemning the activities of terrorists, he said such attempts would be crushed.
“We will not let the sacrifices of the martyrs go to waste,” he said and mentioned the military operations of Raddul Fasaad and Zarb-i-Azb as significant measures to eradicate terrorism.
The prime minister said that though main responsibility for law and order lies with the provinces, the federation could not turn a blind eye to such problems.
He assured the provinces that the federal government would work along with them in fighting terrorism and vowed to fully implement the National Action Plan to eliminate terrorism.
PM Shehbaz said the federal government would assist the provinces in improving the professional capacity of the anti-terrorism force and departments.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,SC overturns verdicts in favour of khula,"Husband’s claim of conjugal rights seemed to be motivated by his intention to avoid payment of dower amount, judge observes.","ISLAMABAD: In a family suit, the Supreme Court on Wednesday set aside the Peshawar High Court (PHC) and appellate court decisions for dissolution of a marriage by way of khula and restored the decree of a family court to dissolve the marriage on the basis of cruelty inflicted by a man on his wife.
While the family court after recording of evidence and hearing both sides had dissolved the marriage due to cruelty on a suit moved by Tayyeba Ambareen against her husband Shafqat Ali Kiyani demanding dower amount, dowry articles, medical expenses and maintenance for herself and their daughter, the appellate court on Nov 10, 2015 overturned the decree and converted it into khula with the direction to the woman to refund five-tola gold to her husband. The high court also upheld the appellate court decision.
Headed by Justice Sardar Tariq Masood, a three-judge Supreme Court bench then took up an appeal against the PHC verdict.
In its decision, the apex court observed that husband’s claim of conjugal rights — despite his ‘ruthless, tyrannical and oppressive’ conduct or behaviour — seemed to be motivated by the sole intention to avoid paying maintenance allowance and the dower amount and he ultimately succeeded in his effort when the appellate court dissolved the marriage by way of khula with the direction to the wife to refund the dower amount.

Husband’s claim of conjugal rights seemed to be motivated by his intention to avoid payment of dower amount, judge observes

Justice Mohammad Ali Mazhar, a member of the SC bench, in a judgment he wrote, observed the main disagreement or source of discord between the parties was whether petitioner Tayyeba Ambareen was entitled to claim a decree for dissolution of marriage on the ground of cruelty and whether the appellate forum rightly converted the dissolution of marriage on the ground of cruelty to dissolution by way of khula.
The SC noted that the family court unequivocally articulated that the petitioner discharged the burden of proving cruelty on part of the husband by quoting many incidents while her evidence was not shattered during her cross-examination and thus the family court rightly dissolved the marriage on account of cruelty after a thorough examination and consideration of evidence.
Justice Mazhar observed that the appellate court could modify or set aside the judgment of the family court if it was found contrary to the evidence since the purpose of appellate jurisdiction was to reappraise whether the lower court committed any error. Likewise, he noted, the high court affirmed the findings of the appellate court without realizing that the allegations of maltreatment and cruelty had been satisfactorily proved by the petitioner during the trial.
The matrimonial bond between a man and woman is a pious relationship that plays an important part and also nurtures between the husband and wife happiness and compassion, the lineage and family heredity also depends on it, Justice Mazhar observed, adding the connubial affairs are based on gentle, human and emotional affiliation which requires mutual trust, regard, respect, love and affection and the relationship should also be in accordance with social norms.
As Islam ordains husbands to provide food, clothing, accommodation and all other necessities of life to the best of his capability and capacity, a man is expected to treat his wife nicely, with love and affection, Justice Mazhar observed. A conduct or behaviour that inflicts upon the wife mental pain and anguish makes it impossible for her to continue matrimonial relationship, the verdict explained.
Justice Mazhar recalled how the family court decision depicted different acts which caused mental anguish and torture to the wife, as only a week after their marriage, the husband started pressurising his wife to arrange money to get a house on rent. The husband and his family members also levelled false accusations at her, alleging that his daughter was not their child, with the result that the petitioner suffered severe mental agony, the court noted.
While she was in the family way, the man left her instead of supporting his wife, the court observed. He did not turn up at the crucial time; neither did he pay any maintenance allowance nor delivery expenses, it was recalled.
Also, the husband and his family members imposed a harsh condition on her that she should deposit her salary into a joint account with her husband and seek his permission for personal use.
Despite filing the family suit, the husband’s behaviour did not change rather he caused more mental anguish and started levelling false accusations, imposing condition that the amount for the house purchased by the wife be reimbursed by her father to the husband.
But the apex court noted that the appellate court, instead of considering the evidence reached a conclusion without any reason that no solid piece of evidence was brought to show physical torture or mental agony and held the allegation was exaggerated, adding that the “acts of cruelty were common” in nature and were “found in every family”.
On the basis of the observations, the Supreme Court set aside the judgments of the high court and the appellate court and restored the decree passed by the family court.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,SBP slashes GDP growth forecast to below 3-4pc,"Cuts FY23 outlook after considering flood-induced destruction, policy focus on stabilisation.","KARACHI: The central bank has lowered its projected GDP growth from the previously announced range of 3-4 per cent for the current fiscal year, citing flood-induced destruction and the stabilisation policy as major factors in its flagship economic health report released on Wednesday.
However, in its Annual Report on the State of Pakistan’s Economy, which mostly discussed the previous financial year that ended on June 30, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said economic growth was stronger than expected in the 2021-22 fiscal year as real GDP increased by 6pc compared to 5.7pc a year ago.
The primary drivers of this growth were a broad-based expansion in large-scale manufacturing (LSM) and improved agricultural output, the report said.
“A combination of adverse global and domestic developments led to the re-emergence of macroeconomic imbalances during FY22,” it said.

Cuts FY23 outlook after considering flood-induced destruction, policy focus on stabilisation

The SBP said that the economy was already in a stabilisation phase when widespread flooding hit a large part of the country at the start of the current fiscal year.
It said the flooding was likely to impinge on the country’s real economic activity through various channels, fearing that losses in agriculture emerging from the damages to crops and livestock were likely to transmit to the rest of the economy through various backward and forward linkages.
 
 

The large-scale destruction of infrastructure in the affected provinces might also undermine the country’s growth prospects during the year, the bank said.
The SBP avoided providing any range for the growth rate of the current financial year apparently due to the worsening economic situation. Industries have either shut down or drastically cut their production due to high inflation and the unavailability of gas and electricity.
One major reason is the cork put by the SBP on the opening of letters of credit (LCs) for imports in an attempt to save dollars.
The All-Pakistan Textile Mills Association has threatened to announce lay-offs within days if the gas supply is not restored and LCs are not opened.
The textile industry claims that up to 500,000 people, who were associated with the sector directly or indirectly, have lost their jobs. No official data is available in this regard.
International credit rating agencies have slashed the credit rating of Pakistan and predicted an economic growth rate of around 2pc for the current fiscal year.
The SBP report said that several corrective and other measures were likely to slow the momentum of economic activity during FY23, including a hike of 675 basis points in the policy rate, demand management measures announced in the previous fiscal year, and the government’s decision to unwind the fiscal package for fuel and electricity subsidies towards the end of FY22.
The report noted that the expansionary fiscal stance in FY22, an upsurge in global commodity prices, and the fallout of the Russia-Ukraine conflict led to a marked deterioration in the current account deficit.
 
 

In addition, the delay in the resumption of the IMF loan programme and political instability exacerbated the country’s vulnerability through the depletion of foreign exchange reserves.
The resulting rupee depreciation “amplified inflationary pressures by magnifying the effect of global price increase”, the SBP report said.
It said the experience from FY22 brought to the fore once again the need to address the country’s structural weaknesses, such as a narrow base of foreign exchange earnings and meagre inflows of foreign investment.
“A concerted approach is required to encourage increased localisation of the manufacturing base, along with the lowering of energy intensity of the economy by ensuring energy efficiency and conservation,” the report said.
Moreover, amid the growing issues related to climate change and inadequate food security situation, there is an urgent need to formulate a well-thought-out strategy to meet these challenges, it said.
It stressed that priority should be given to producing new varieties of seeds that are suitable to varying weather conditions and to devise a framework that emphasises water management strategies to increase agricultural productivity.
“The losses to agriculture produce induced by the recent floods is likely to step up the import of agriculture commodities, particularly cotton,” the report said.
It said the government has targeted to reduce the fiscal deficit to 4.9pc of GDP in FY23 from 7.9pc in FY22. “This outcome would be achieved through both revenue and expenditure measures,” it said.
In fact, the fiscal deficit exceeded in the first quarter of FY23, annoying the IMF, which demanded more measures to reduce the gap.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,PM promises Rs5bn to reconstruct flood-hit homes,Govt launches ‘4RF’ comprehensive plan for rehabilitation of millions of survivors.,"SUKKUR/ISLAMABAD: As he assured Sindh that the federal government would not leave flood survivors in a lurch, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the Centre would spend at least Rs5 billion to construct houses for flood victims in the province.
After his visit to rain-hit areas in Khairpur on Wednesday, the prime minister said that Rs4.80 billion had been donated to the prime minister’s account for flood survivors and added that more funds were expected to be donated.
According to PM Sharif, the rehabilitation process was already underway across the country, but there were still several areas in Khairpur and Dadu which were underwater. 
He added that the government would move towards reconstruction and rehabilitation works, but at present, at least eight million families were rain-affected. 
He elaborated that at least 20m people, including nine million children, were waiting for the government to help them.

Govt launches ‘4RF’ comprehensive plan for rehabilitation of millions of survivors

Drainage plan
He said that the government would build houses for the affected people and added that the chief minister would provide plots for the construction and the same process would be followed in other provinces as well.
“A donors conference is going to be held in Geneva next month,” said PM Sharif and added that he would go to the moot fully prepared to present Pakistan’s case for aid in light of massive destruction due to floods. The PM also announced the establishment of a campus of COMSATS University in Khairpur.
Speaking at the residence of PPP leader Manzoor Wassan in Khairpur, Shehbaz Sharif said that his government would “positively consider” the master plan for drainage on the left bank of the River Indus proposed by a foreign consultant, Louis Berger.
Mr Sharif said that the scale of the disaster was massive so Pakistan would require plenty of resources to tackle this challenge.
During the visit, the premier was also briefed by Chief Engineer Development Region-I Mansoor Memon in Pir Gaddo, Kot Diji about inundated areas in the province.
The chief engineer said that out of 3.3m acres of area, 2m acres were inundated on the right bank and 1.3m acres on the left bank of the Indus till Aug 31.
In Khairpur, 141,000 acres of land was submerged till Aug 31 but now only 7,800 acres of land needed to be dewatered, Mr Memon informed. He maintained that field drains on an area of 200 square kms were created to drain rainwater.
According to the chief engineer, Khairpur was a victim of a “poor drainage network” and the only drainage system that existed in the area pertained to salinity control and water-logging issue. He informed when the Sukkur barrage was built, the flow of natural watercourses in the area was obstructed. 
“Even this area where we are standing is an old waterway,” Mr Memon said while showing the site on a satellite image.
He said that floodwater from the mountainous range stretching over 75,000 sq kms in Balochistan reached Qambar Shahdadkot and Dadu districts in recent floods and 600,000 acres and 400,000 acres of the area was inundated respectively in Qambar and Dadu districts. This meant that out of 2m acres, 50pc of the area was affected in these two districts, he added.
Speaking about the Berger plan regarding drainage, the engineer urged that the scheme was of paramount importance for left bank areas. CM Murad agreed. The Sindh CM said the provincial government wanted to use funds deposited with the apex court in the Bahria Town case for the execution of this scheme.
‘4RF plan’
Separately, the government launched a comprehensive plan prepared by the planning and development division for the rehabilitation of flood victims. 
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, Prime Minister Shehbaz launched the ‘Resilient, Recovery, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Framework’ (4RF) which envisaged short, medium, and long-term strategies to rehabilitate the survivors.
A copy of the 4RF report was presented to the prime minister by Ahsan Iqbal, Minister for Planning Development and Special Initiatives (MoPD&SI) during a meeting. 
Mr Iqbal apprised the prime minister that the document was based on the loss and damage estimated in the post-disaster needs assessment report, which was launched in October this year.
PM Sharif directed that necessary efforts must be made for the effective pitching of this framework in the upcoming donors’ conference, scheduled to be held on January 9, 2023, in Geneva, Switzerland.
He directed that the planning ministry in coordination with the foreign ministry, climate change ministry, and economic affairs division may take necessary steps for the effective dissemination of the document to all the stakeholders at home and abroad.

Each year many Rohingya, members of a Muslim minority, risk their lives boarding rickety vessels to escape violence in Myanmar and squalor in Bangladesh refugee camps. Many attempt to reach Malaysia.
The stranded boat was approached by five Indian ships late on Tuesday, a source said.
A spokesperson for the Indian Navy said he did not have any details to share. A spokesperson for the Coast Guard did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters.
“We estimate that probably as many as 20 have died some from hunger and thirst, and others jumped overboard in desperation. This is absolutely awful and outrageous,” said Chris Lewa, director of the Arakan Project which works to support Myanmar’s Rohingyas.
Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Networks Rohingya Working Group said the group had been adrift for more than two weeks.
“We heard late last night that there were some Indian vessels approaching the boat so we are awaiting updates now, said Lilianne Fan, chair of Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Networks Rohingya Working Group.
“We hope that the Indian Navy or Coastguard will manage to rescue and disembark the boat as soon as possible. These people have been adrift on a damaged boat for more than 2 weeks without food and water.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Nepal court orders release of serial killer Charles Sobhraj,"“Keeping him in the prison continuously is not in line with the prisoner’s human rights,” says court.","KATHMANDU: Nepal’s top court ordered on Wednesday the release and deportation of Charles Sobhraj, the French serial killer portrayed in the Netflix series  “The Serpent” who was responsible for a string of murders across Asia in the 1970s.
The Supreme Court ruled Sobhraj, 78, who has been in prison in the Himalayan republic since 2003 for murdering two North American tourists, should be freed on health grounds.
“Keeping him in the prison continuously is not in line with the prisoner’s human rights,” read a copy of the verdict.
“If there is not any other pending cases against him to keep him in the prison, this court orders his release by today and... the return to his country within 15 days.” Sobhraj needed open heart surgery and his release was in keeping with the law allowing the compassionate discharge of bedridden prisoners who had already served three-quarters of their sentence, the verdict added.
The notorious murderer underwent a five-hour cardiac operation in 2017 and the verdict said he remained in regular treatment for heart disease. Sobhraj will likely be freed from Kathmandu’s Central Jail on Thursday, an official at the prison said.
He will first have to appear in a lower court for administrative formalities before he can walk free, the official added.
Backpacker murders 
After a troubled childhood and several prison terms in France for petty crimes, Sobhraj began travelling the world in the early 1970s and wound up in the Thai capital Bangkok.
His modus operandi was to charm and befriend his victims — many of them starry-eyed Western backpackers on a quest for spirituality — before drugging, robbing and murdering them.
Suave and sophisticated, he was implicated in his first murder, that of a young American woman whose body was found on a beach in Pattaya wearing a bikini, in 1975. He was eventually linked to more than 20 killings.
His victims were strangled, beaten or burned, and he often used the passports of his male victims to travel to his next destination.
Sobhraj’s sobriquet,  “The Serpent”, came from his ability to assume other identities in order to evade justice. It became the title of a hit series made by the BBC and Netflix that was based on his life.
He was arrested in India in 1976 and ultimately spent 21 years in jail there, with a brief break in 1986 when he escaped and was caught again in the Indian coastal state of Goa.
Released in 1997, Sobhraj retired to Paris but resurfaced in 2003 in Nepal, where he was spotted in Kathmandu’s tourist district and arrested.
A court there handed him a life sentence the following year for killing US tourist Connie Jo Bronzich in 1975. A decade later he was also found guilty of killing Bronzich’s Canadian companion. In prison in 2008, Sobhraj married Nihita Biswas, who is 44 years his junior and the daughter of his Nepalese lawyer.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Ambulance workers walk out in strike-hit UK,Employees across the UK economy demand salary rises to match or beat decades-high inflation.,"LONDON: Striking ambulance workers in England and Wales manned picket lines on Wednesday, escalating a pay dispute between the government and a host of public-sector staff.
A series of stoppages are causing misery across Britain in the run-up to Christmas, with railway workers and passport control officers set to hinder festive holiday getaways as the government resists the growing pay demands.
Employees across the UK economy are demanding salary rises to match or beat decades-high inflation — currently running at nearly 11 percent — which is spurring the worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation.
“We’re not paid enough for what we deserve,” 24-year-old paramedic Kirsten Reid said in Crawley, southern England.  “Secondly, patient safety is a huge thing... our response times are shocking, and they need to be better.”  “We do 12-hour shifts with a 30-minute break, but they’re rarely ever 12-hour shifts. We’re usually overrun,” she added.
The government and unions continue to trade blame over the strikes amid fears of possible loss of life, as healthcare leaders warned about straining a system already in crisis.
On Tuesday, thousands of members of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) in England, Wales and Northern Ireland took to picket lines, five days after their first strike in its 106-year history.
Health Secretary Steve Barclay, writing in the Daily Telegraph newspaper, accused the unions of making a  “conscious decision” to  “inflict harm” on patients. GMB union national secretary, Rachel Harrison, hit back calling his comments  “insulting”.
“Ambulance workers are seething at such a crude, insulting attempt to divert attention from the government’s continued chaos in the NHS,” she said.
Around a dozen staff formed the picket line outside the ambulance base in Crawley.
“My members are striking today for fair pay. At the end of the day, they’ve had a 20 percent pay cut over the last 10 years, and they can no longer afford to keep going with that,” GMB union representative Lib Whitfield said.
Outside the West Midlands Ambulance Services’ hub in Longford in central England, striking staff stood behind a banner reading  “our NHS is under siege”.
As passing ambulances sounded their horns in support, union representative Steve Thompson called on the government to  “wake up and realise that this situation is serious”.

2022-12-22,2022-12-22,Govt calls emergency NA session today to approve controversial LG law,PML-N candidate seeks delay in polls; PTI leader files contempt petition against PM for changes in law.,"ISLAMABAD: The government has summoned an emergency session of the National Assembly on Thursday (today) to get Islamabad’s local government amendment bill passed, with an aim to increase the number of union councils and seek direct election for the post of mayor.
The session has been convened by President Dr Arif Alvi at a time when political parties are already busy campaigning for the local government polls scheduled for Dec 31.
In a related development, a ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) candidate and a senior member of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) filed separate petitions before the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on the issue with the former seeking postponement of the polls and the latter desiring initiation of contempt proceedings against Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his “cabinet” for making changes in the law which could cause a delay in the elections.
The National Assembly Secretariat on Wednesday issued a 10-point agenda which shows the Islamabad Capital Territory Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2022 standing in the name of Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah Khan.

PML-N candidate seeks delay in polls; PTI leader files contempt petition against PM for changes in law

The minister will also present a motion seeking to suspend the rules of the assembly to enable the members to pass the bill on the same day without referring it to the concerned committee and following the parliamentary procedure.
After passage of the bill from the lower house of the parliament, it will also have to be passed by the Senate before getting the president’s ceremonial assent.
It may be recalled that the National Assembly had been prorogued by the president only on Tuesday after passing the Foreign Investment (Promotion and Protection) Bill in a similar fashion and after suspending the rules. 
The federal cabinet has already approved the amendments to the law through a circular on Dec 19 after which the interior ministry issued a letter increasing the number of seats from 101 to 125. 
Moreover, the federal cabinet has also approved a summary for direct election of Islamabad’s mayor and for this necessary amendment, the bill is being tabled before the National Assembly.
Despite these developments, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), however, refused to defer the LG elections and vowed to conduct it in accordance with the already announced schedule.
Since the PML-N and PTI have brought this matter before the IHC, the fate of LG elections now depends upon the judicial verdict.
In the petition, PML-N candidate from Tarlai Union Council Shahzad Aurangzeb defended the government’s decision of increasing the number of UCs.
The petition stated that Islamabad districtfor the most part has been administered without a local government comprising elected representatives of the people until the passing of the 18th Amendment in the Constitution on April 19, 2010.
It said the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) Local Government Act 2015 in sections 5 & 6 of the Act, empowered the federal government to declare any area as union council and to divide an existing area of one union council into two and to notify the number of union councils in Islamabad, adding that the federal government had recently increased the number of union councils to 125.
The petitioner pointed out anomalies in the voters’ lists of different areas and said “in such conditions any election that is held would be disputed and cannot be declared as a free and fair election”.
It requested the court to set aside the ECP’s decision of conducting elections in 101 UCs.
On the other hand, PTI leader Ali Nawaz Awan asserted in the petition that the ECP in the light of the judgements of the superior courts announced schedule for local government elections in 101 UCs to be held on Dec 31.
“However, the federal government with utmost mala fide, has yet again in its bid to frustrate the process has done exactly what had been apprehended,” the petition said, adding that the act of federal government of increasing the number of UCs is a “clear attempt at frustrating the process and holding of elections, which is clear cut violation of the judgement of this court”.
According to the petition, the federal government was “well aware” of court’s directions, “however, the action of yet again increasing the number of UCs, merely 11 days prior to the elections…is a blatant disregard to the dictum laid down exhaustively by the court.”
The petition termed it a deliberate attempt to frustrate the judgement of the IHC.
Subsequently, it requested the court to initiate contempt of court proceeding against the prime minister and all the members of the federal cabinet.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Verdict reserved on appeal over Zahir’s sentence in Noor case,"The court asks lawyers to submit written arguments, if they want, within seven days.","ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday reserved verdict on a plea challenging the death sentence of Zahir Jaffer in Noor Mukadam murder case.
The two-member division bench comprising IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Sardar Ijaz Ishaq Khan reserved the verdict after the lawyers completed their arguments.
Jaffer’s lawyer, Usman Khosa, in his argument on the last day of hearing on Wednesday, said one of the reasons for giving the death sentence to his client could be to set an example that there was a lesson for others to not take such a step. 
He added that such a punishment was awarded to habitual criminals to create deterrence.
He said there was pressure on Pakistan at an international level to abolish the death penalty, adding that his client was an American citizen and a resident of New Jersey, where there was no concept of capital punishment. He urged the court to take this point into consideration.
Chief Justice Aamer Farooq remarked that abolishing the death penalty was a matter of legislation and only legislators could view this subject, however, he added that Pakistan was an independent country and it had its own law. 
The lawyer of the plaintiff, Shaukat Mukadam, said Jameel, Jaffer’s cook, worked during the day and had no role in the crime.
While the court inquired whether any drugs were recovered from the crime scene, Mr Mukadam’s lawyer Babar Hayat said no drug was recovered and the relevant report had been attached with the record.
The court also inquired about Noor’s handbag, which was not part of the record but it was visible in the CCTV footage.
Mr Hayat said only the prosecution could talk about the bag. After the two sides concluded their arguments, the bench reserved its judgement.
The court asked the lawyers to submit written arguments, if they wanted, within seven days.
The trial court in Islamabad had awarded death penalty to Jaffer in February 2022 for killing Noor Mukadam. Her body was found in Jaffer’s residence in F-7 on July 20, 2021.

IHC division bench comprising Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan took up the petition seeking protective bail for Aziz.
His counsel Amjad Pervaiz advocate argued before the court that Aziz was scheduled to arrive at Islamabad International Airport via Qatar Airways at 7:35pm on Dec 21.
He said Haroon Yousaf Aziz intended to surrender before the Accountability Court of Lahore in connection with assets reference case.
In the petition, Mr Aziz cited the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) chairman, NAB Lahore director general and Accountability Court Lahore judge as respondents.
He requested the court for grant of protective bail, enabling him to surrender before the competent court of law.
Mr Aziz is a co-accused in the assets reference.
According to NAB, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s family members received foreign funds through alleged fake transactions.
These transactions had been made through the company, allegedly owned by Shehbaz Sharif’s son-in-law Haroon Yousaf Aziz. 
The maximum numbers of fake transactions to the Shehbaz family had been made through Al-Zarooni Exchange of Dubai.
After hearing preliminary arguments, the IHC bench restrained the LEAs from arresting Aziz till Dec 22 and ordered him to appear in person on Thursday.
Further hearing in this matter has been adjourned till today.

ISLAMABAD: One of the top paediatricians of Pakistan, Dr Tabish Hazir, who served at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) for over three decades, breathed his last at the same hospital on Tuesday night, leaving his family, friends, and those whose children are in good health because of his efforts saddened.
His funeral prayers were offered at 4pm in B Block Model Town, Lahore, on Wednesday which were attended by a large number people including politicians, academics and medical practitioners. The deceased was later laid to rest in a local graveyard in Model Town.
Dr Hazir, 74, was the husband of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leader Dr Shireen Mazari and was suffering from colon cancer for the last two years. He had been under treatment at Pims.
Former Pims executive director Dr Ijaz Qadeer, while talking to Dawn, said Dr Hazir was a top paediatrician of Pakistan and his services for Pims would always be remembered.

Top paediatrician laid to rest in Lahore

He said the deceased established the paediatric department at the hospital and headed the neonatology department.
It is worth mentioning here that neonatology is a sub-specialty of paediatrics that focuses on medical care of newborns, especially those who are ill or premature.
“He believed in research and never stopped learning new fields while he was in the hospital. He was expert on issues related to reasons of death in newborn and also reasons of infection in children,” Dr Qadeer said.
Talking to Dawn, former vice chancellor of Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Medical University Prof Dr Javed Akram said he had frequent interaction with Dr Hazir as Pims was the affiliated hospital of the university.
“He was a thorough gentleman and professional. He was supportive of academics and was a supporter of the university. He was eager to do research, which is why I consider him as one of my best friends,” he said.
Dr Tabish Hazir’s sister Tamkinet Karim, while talking to Dawn, said her brother was born on May 31, 1958 in Lahore.
“He did his initial schooling in Sialkot and MBBS from Allama Iqbal Medical College, Lahore. He also did a number of courses and specialisation and joined Pims which he served till his retirement. He was under treatment at Pims at the time of his death. We shifted the body on Wednesday morning to his house in Islamabad and then to Lahore,” she said.
Ms Karim said the deceased had worked in collaboration with the World Health Organisation and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for the welfare of the children of Pakistan.
She said Dr Tabish Hazir and Dr Shireen Mazari separated 12 years ago but it was not correct that the couple had divorce.
“The deceased has a daughter Imaan Mazari-Hazir and a son Sabeel Mazari-Hazir,” she said.
Tamkinet Karim said Dr Hazir was the son of renowned poet Taufiq Rafat and wanted to be laid besides his father’s grave, which was why his body was shifted to Lahore.
She said Qul would be held on Thursday (today) in Model Town Lahore between 1pm to 3pm.

2023-12-18,2022-12-22,Work on widening of Soan River bridge restarts finally,RAWALPINDI: Work on widening the Soan River Bridge finally commenced earlier this week. The project is anticipated...,"RAWALPINDI: Work on widening the Soan River Bridge finally commenced earlier this week.
The project is anticipated to be completed by the end of Dec 2023.
The Soan River Bridge was two lanes wide on each side, but after work, it will have four lanes on each side.
According to an official from the National Highway Authority (NHA), widening of the bridge had been suspended in April 2022 after the contractor was black-listed and now a fresh contract had been awarded to Frontier Works Organisation (FWO).
The widening of the bridge across Soan River was started in 2017 and was scheduled to be completed by January 2022. However, the bridge will now be completed by the end of 2023.
Due to left-over construction material scattered on the bridge and its adjoining area, hundreds of commuters entering the city have been facing problems.
Motorists, while proceeding towards Rawalpindi from Rawat, face difficulty as safety walls of the bridge have been demolished by the previous contractor and left abandoned.
More than 62,000 vehicles cross Soan Bridge every day, where widening of the bridge began about five years ago and is yet to be completed.
The former chief of army staff had taken strict notice of the delay in the construction of Soan Bridge project and the poor workmanship and directed the authorities concerned to complete it without wasting time.
“I have never seen such sheer negligence in public welfare/important projects while living abroad,” said an expatriate who recently came to Pakistan to spend vacations with his family.

Students of Al-Huda International School took part in creating awareness about global warming by organising a science exhibition under the title ‘Earth Matters’. 
They displayed over 60 projects to highlight the issues of global warming, urging that an organic life style and natural method in work was the only solution to save the planet.
Topics like bio gas, water, solar energy, green grills, hydroponic planting, collection of garbage, floods and mitigation, importance of birds and so on were well covered by students through their projects. 
These topics were connected with Islam and its teachings and in all stalls, related verses of the Quran were also highlighted.
“Through this exhibition, we are trying to create awareness as environment is a serious issue the world is facing today,” said Fareha Wasim, a teacher.
A seventh grader said that everyone will have to play a role towards reducing the impact of fast changing climate. Another teacher Fouzia Umar said that besides taking care of the climate and human beings, there is also need to protect birds.
Students from montessori to senior grades constructed and displayed their projects. Each project was presented in a distinctive way and the uniqueness of the event was that each child participated and the projects were made from recycled and eco-friendly material.
The exhibition comprised of different sub themes such as ‘Green Vibes Only’, ‘Air Care’, ‘Slow the Flow’, ‘Master the Disaster’, ‘Waste Wise’ and ‘Now and Never’. 
The student’s project display and demonstration of projects was an effort towards provoking thoughts and leave the audience inspired. Students had captured the attention and focus of the audience and visitors throughout the day. 
The message from all students was clear and crisp that this was high time that we have to take care of our planet.
They emphasised that according to the Quran, environmental conservation is a religious duty as well as a social obligation and not an optional matter. The event was graced by dignitaries and educationists from the twin cities, journalists and the kinsfolk of the students. 
Different schools and university students also made an appearance and interacted with students. The programme was spread over two days and was split into three slots of morning and evening.

According to an FIR, police officials had detained a merchant from Peshawar and released him after receiving Rs1 million from his heirs.
Javaid Ahmad had come to Rawalpindi on Dec 6 with Rs300,000 to purchase some goods. He was sitting in a hotel when a man in police uniform came and started interrogating him. In the meanwhile, two persons also joined and snatched Rs300,000 from him.
Ammad Akbar, employer of Javaid Ahmed, said in his FIR registered with Pirwadhai police on Wednesday that the accused shifted the victim to an undisclosed location after covering his face. The victim was detained in a room where he was tortured by the kidnappers who demanded money from him. 
On Dec 8, the kidnappers forced him to talk to his family asking him to arrange Rs600,000 more for his release.
Rahimullah, a friend of the victim, brought the money to Rawalpindi. When Mr Rahim arrived in Pirwadhai, the kidnappers detained him as well and took the money. Later, they started demanding more money from Rahimullah following which Rs50,000 were transferred twice in the bank account of one of the accomplices of the police official.

Headed by Interior Minister Ahmed Moallim Fiqi the delegation comprised Deputy Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs Ahmed Abdirahman Hassan, Deputy Minister of Interior-Puntland State Abdiwali Mire Hirsi, Deputy Minister of Interior-Galmudug State Ahmed Osman Adan, Minister of Interior of Southwest State Abdulahi Hassan, Adviser to Office of President Hoden Aden Osman, NIRA Director General Abduallahi Bihi Hussenand Ambassador Somalia Shirwa Abdullahi Ibrahim.
Tariq Malik said following Pakistani government’s ‘Look Africa Policy’, Nadra was poised to work closely with the Somalian government.
He assured the high-powered delegation that Nadra would surely extend all possible G2G support in ID-related projects and urged the visiting dignitaries to develop an ID ecosystem that would bring about ‘Single Version of Truth’.
The potential is endless for the digital public goods to be rolled out on the basis of a good ID system, he added.
The Nadra chairman said: “A good ID system helps build a strong democratic system, especially in developing countries. The ethos of democracy in ‘One Person, One Vote’ is better delivered through a national ID system that facilitates in development of computerised electoral rolls with negligible margins of voter fraud and other fraudulent practices.”
It is pertinent to mention here that under South-South cooperation, Nadra was assisting the governments of Nigeria, Sudan, Kenya and Somalia with regard to development of identity management and civil registration system.
The Somalian interior minister lauded the efforts of the incumbent Nadra chairman, Tariq Malik and his team.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Call to ensure ease of business in pharma sector,ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PPMA) Chairman Arshad Mahmood on Wednesday said...,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PPMA) Chairman Arshad Mahmood on Wednesday said Pakistan would become Nigeria if ease of business was not ensured in the pharmaceutical sector, fearing that the country would be left with no choice but to import medicines worth $20 billion every year.
“The foreign exchange starved Pakistan should be eyeing on the export of pharmaceutical products which is an $1,800 billion industry. Even if we capture the market of Africa, which is an $86 billion market, we would be able to bridge the gap between imports and exports of the country. If ease of business would not be ensured, investments will be shifted from Pakistan to Bangladesh, China, Iran and other countries,” he said while speaking to participants at an international conference on pharma and healthcare.
Mr Mahmood said once Nigeria used to manufacture medicines but with the passage of time, it implemented conditions of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and increased taxes and now it was importing 100pc of its medicines.
“On Wednesday morning, I was shocked to see in a newspaper that the per unit cost of the pharma sector is going to be increased by Rs32 due to which, each unit of electricity will be Rs93. Currently, the per month bill of my factory goes over Rs4 million, out of which electricity charges remain around Rs1.8 million and the rest are all taxes,” he said, adding Pakistan can export medicines to a number of countries of Africa and some countries of Asia including Myanmar, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan.
“A number of companies have been manufacturing medicines for people of Pakistan but when they get orders to export medicines to other countries, the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap) refuses to issue them a letter of good manufacturing practices (GMP) and insists on carrying out another inspection of the factory. The letter is mandatory to export medicines,” Mr Mahmood said.
“It is unfortunate that Drap allows companies to sell medicines to people of Pakistan but does not allow exporting the same medicine to other countries. That is why our exports are worth $269 million. On the other hand, India has been exporting medicines worth of $24 billion per annum. The local industry has been providing medicines worth $5 billion to people of Pakistan and if manufacturing would be stopped due to high cost of production, Pakistan will have to import medicines worth of $20 billion because in that case, foreign countries/companies will provide medicines on their cost and conditions,” he said.
“We cannot compete with international/foreign companies by importing raw material. The business community has been thinking about shifting investments abroad because over here, policies are made without taking the stakeholders onboard. The government needs to take steps for industrialisation rather than depending on remittances of overseas Pakistanis,” he added.
During a panel discussion, member of the PPMA Central Executive Committee Usman Shaukat said it was time to enforce an export emergency in Pakistan to tackle the current economic crisis and pharmaceuticals can play a vital role in earning precious foreign exchange for Pakistan.
“A pharma export council needs to be set up immediately to enhance the exports of pharmaceuticals which has immense potential. The stakeholders such as Drap and Ministry of Commerce have already principally agreed to formulate the pharma export council and the industry requests the process to be expedited in order to facilitate exports,” he added.
It was high time that Pakistan pharmaceutical products reach developed markets such as the United States and Europe.
Drap Chief Executive Officer Dr Asim Rauf, who also attended the conference, said that all possible steps would be taken to facilitate the pharmaceutical sector and ensure increase in export of medicines from Pakistan.

2022-12-22,2022-12-22,CDA plans housing projects for expats to attract dollars,Auction of commercial plots also on the cards.,"ISLAMABAD: In a bid to attract foreign investment into the country, the federal government is looking towards the Capital Development Authority (CDA) to launch new housing schemes for expatriates to boost country’s dollar reserves.
The civic body has prepared a presentation which would likely be given to the prime minister on Thursday (today) in light of his directives pertaining to these housing projects.
Sources said the CDA was planning to develop Gandhara Enclave – a housing project which falls in Zone I and partially in Zone III – and the Kuri housing scheme. Similarly, the civic body will also brief the government about the revenue potential from the under-construction Nilor Heights housing project.
CDA Chairman Mohammad Usman and his team will give a presentation on the schemes, sources said, adding that the auction of some commercial plots will also come under discussion. They said both schemes have the potential to generate billions of rupees in revenue.

Auction of commercial plots also on the cards

In its briefing, the CDA would also inform the federal government that if it wanted to develop Gandhara Enclave on more than 5,000 kanals, then the civic body would need to acquire more land falling in Zone III. Under the current zoning regulations, construction in Zone III is not allowed. However, the CDA is reportedly working on amending these regulations.
Similarly, the sources said in the first phase, the Kuri housing scheme could be developed on 10,000 kanals. They said it would be one of the largest schemes if everything went as per the plan. Sources said the Kuri scheme could turn out to be a “complicated matter because of chronic and unsettled issues with the locals” also known as affected persons.
The CDA had acquired the land decades ago but after announcing the award, no serious step was taken for the development of the Kuri model village. The civic body officials said thousands of housing units could be constructed as part of this scheme.
The officials said after paying compensation and built-up property claims, the civic agency would have around 2,000 acres of land worth billions of rupees. However, the civic agency never made any serious effort to settle issues with locals to get land’s possession. The officials said an initial survey had shown 1,100 occupants on the said land, but in 2011 the number had risen to 7,000.
At that time, the CDA officials in connivance with locals added many bogus cases to the list of land ownership claims. Later, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) probed the matter and cleared 3,422 ownership cases.
The CDA officials said the civic agency had acquired the land in 1968 while the built-up-property award was announced in 1971. But the CDA failed to take possession of the land after removing the objections raised by locals. In 2009, the civic agency announced a revised built-up property award, but due to allegations of bogus claims, it could not resolve the issue.
“Since the federal government has been supporting CDA, we will deliver and will launch at least two housing schemes, with a focus on apartments,” a CDA official said. He added that the plots would be sold to developers and investors who will be asked to build apartments.

Health Services Academy (HSA) Vice Chancellor Prof Shahzad Ali Khan said majority of the Pakistani population is either depressed, experiencing stress or anxiety and are not very optimistic about the country’s future.
He was addressing the launch of the 24th Thematic Calendar by Jahan-i-Maseeha Adbi Forum (JMAF). The theme of the 2023 calendar is, under these circumstances, Allama Iqbal’s message of ‘Khudi’.
Prof Khan said that hopelessness and despair has spread among the youth and under these circumstances, Iqbal’s message of self-hood can lift the spirits of the Pakistani nation again.
He added that the Pakistani youth now consider everybody as corrupt and incompetent, adding that majority of youngsters are desperate to leave the country although the entire world is facing similar issues and problems like inflation, joblessness and recession.
“Initially, teachers and academia of our society was targeted and they were defamed, later, character assassination of physicians and healthcare professionals was carried out and the same treatment was met out to politicians,” Prof Khan said, adding that things were not as bad as they were being portrayed.
He lauded the philosophy of Iqbal, adding that he was able to turn youngsters from a minority group in the Indian subcontinent into a united force by teaching them lessons of optimism, enthusiasm and encouragement.
The event was organised in collaboration with pharmaceutical firm Pharmevo that has been promoting Iqbal’s philosophy among healthcare professionals throughout the country.
Syed Jamshaid Ahmed of Pharmevo stressed on establishing and creating a healthier society in Pakistan and said that for a healthier society, not just medicines but promotion of literary activities was essential like holding book fairs, mushairas and so on.
Renowned poet Ajmal Siraj said an advisory committee comprising educationists, writers and scholars selected life and literary works of Iqbal as the theme for the next year’s calendar.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Setback for MQM-P as ECP wants order to appoint administrators withdrawn,"PTI's Ali Zaidi claims the appointment of such officers around 20 days before LG polls is ""blatant pre-poll rigging"".","KARACHI: The Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan may suffer a setback as the Election Commission of Pakistan on Wednesday asked the Sindh government to reverse the appointment of three government officers, said to be party loyalists, as administrators of Hyderabad and Karachi’s East and Korangi districts.
On Dec 19, the provincial government had appointed Muhammad Farooque, Syed Shakeel Ahmed and Muhammad Sharif as the administrators of Hyderabad Municipal Corporation and district municipal corporations of Korangi and East districts in line with an agreement between the Pakistan Peoples Party and MQM-P.
Prior to their appointment, Mr Farooque and Mr Ahmed had been working as administrator of Worker Model School, SITE Hyderabad, and Korangi, respectively. Mr Sharif had earlier been working as director-charged parking at the DMC-Central.
However, their appointment is criticised by opposition parties, which termed it a pre-poll rigging attempt as local government elections in Karachi and Hyderabad divisions were scheduled to be held on Jan 15.
On Wednesday, the office of the provincial election commissioner in a letter addressed to the local government secretary said that ECP, through a notification issued on June 10, had imposed a ban on transfer/ posting during the conduct of local government elections.
It directed the local government secretary to either withdraw the order or kept it in abeyance till the culmination of the second phase of the local government elections in Karachi and Hyderabad divisions.
The letter reminded the government of an earlier ECP notification that states: “For Divisions in respect of which Election schedule of Local Government Elections has been issued no transfer / posting of the Government Officers and Officials including those of autonomous bodies/ Authorities shall be made without prior approval of the Commission till the publication of Election Results”.
Meanwhile, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leader Ali Zaidi said in a tweet that the ECP ordered withdrawal of the notification appointing administrators.

 





 
Earlier in the day, he told a press conference that his party had written a letter to the chief secretary and informed him that the newly-appointed administrators were affiliated with the MQM-P.
He said that the appointment of such officers as administrators around 20 days before the LG polls was blatant pre-poll rigging.
Also, the Sindh United Party (SUP) raised concerns over the appointment of administrators and Hyderabad commissioner before the LG polls.
SUP chairman and convener of the Sindh Action Committee Syed Jalal Mehmood Shah demanded that the ECP declare null and void the appointment orders of the new administrator and Hyderabad commissioner.

• Muggers shoot Bin Qasim SHO, friend over resistance
KARACHI: While police claimed to have killed two alleged robbers in Korangi in an encounter, in which two policemen also suffered bullet wounds, muggers’ criminal streak in the city continued with assaults, taking lives of a young man and a policeman in the same area on Wednesday.  
The SHO of Bin Qasim police station was also shot at and wounded by armed muggers in Gulshan-i-Maymar.  
In the first incident, the police said that Qayyum Umer, 24, was gunned down by robbers when he put up resistance near Ghousia Masjid in Korangi-3.  
Korangi-SSP Sajid Amir Sadozai said armed motorcyclists were looting his cousin at some distance. Qayyum was standing outside his home and saw the robbers looting his cousin. As he yelled at the robbers, the robbers opened fire on him and fled. He died on the spot.
The body was taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre to fulfil medico-legal formalities.  
Police Surgeon Summaiya Syed said that the victim sustained a gunshot injury to chest and arm. His family members did not allow doctors to complete medico-legal formalities and took away the body, she added.  
The relatives told media that the victim was an orphaned child who sold vegetables in the area to earn his living. Hailing from Mansehra, he also played football at a local club in Korangi.  
Later, police intensified patrol and snap-checking in the area in search of the killers.  
DIG-East Muqaddas Haider told Dawn that two policemen of ‘Shaheen Force’ indicated two suspects to stop in Zaman Town. However, the suspects opened fire on them and an exchange of gunfire took place in which Head Constable Manzoor Ahmed, 38, was killed and the suspects managed to speed away.
However, after an interval of around 30 minutes, the Korangi Industrial Area police spotted two suspects and another encounter ensued in Mehran Town.  
After an exchange of gunfire, two alleged robbers were shot dead while two policemen, Khan Razik and Sajid, were wounded.
The DIG East said that one of the injured policemen had identified both the deceased as the same criminals who had killed the head constable during the earlier encounter.  
He said they were also probing the possibility as to whether the same suspects had gunned down Qayyum over resistance as these three incidents took place in the same vicinity of Korangi. 
The deceased suspects’ involvement in the three incidents would be verified with witnesses’ accounts and matching of spent bullet casings found from the crime scenes, the officials added.  
SHO, friend wounded by robbers 
The Bin Qasim SHO and his friend were shot at and wounded by robbers off Superhighway on Wednesday.  
The SITE-Superhighway Industrial Area (SSIA) police said that SHO Irdees Bangash and citizen Asif Ibrahim, 36, got injured in the firing at an estate agency in Ahsanabad.  
East-SSP Syed Abdul Rahim Shirazi said that the SHO had gone there for some personal work. He was sitting with his friends when armed muggers arrived and attempted to snatch cash and other valuables from them.  
The SHO overpowered one suspect, but his accomplice opened fire resulting in bullet injuries to the police officer and his friend.  
One suspect, later identified as Nadeem, was also wounded by the firing of the SHO and arrested by a police patrol that reached the scene after hearing gunshots.
The SHO was taken to the Aga Khan University Hospital. SSP Shirazi said he suffered a bullet wound near the abdomen.
Bangash had served as SHO of the SITE-Superhighway Industrial Area police station and was recently transferred to the Bin Qasim police station.

The officer stated this in a report submitted in compliance with the bench’s directive to verify employees lists and find out if there were any ghost employees in the departments of education, health and police. 
The division bench, comprising Justices Shamsuddin Abbasi and Amajad Ali Sahito, had issued the directives while hearing a petition filed by advocate Mumtaz Ali Jesar. 
The director general of the Sindh monitoring and evaluation cell was directed to appear in person and file a detailed report regarding procuring the attendance of teachers and the process of issuance of form-II to stop the salaries of the absentees. 
But he was called absent while the deputy director of the cell said he had received the direction in late hours; therefore, the DG did not turn up. At this juncture, the director of school education said the DG was in contact with them.
The bench observed: “We [bench] are noticing this act of the DG with dismay, as he is deliberately avoiding appearing before this court and warn him to remain careful in future.” 
The medical superintendent of Chandka Medical College Hospital said he had issued a letter to the Larkana DAO for blocking the IDs’ of the ghost employees. 
“We have also noted with dismay that the secretary education, Sindh IGP and health department secretary, who were asked to upload the lists of their employees with names, parentage and CNICs on their official website but still compliance had not been made by them,” the two judges bench observed. “Once again we are directing them to upload the list of the employees and furnish report within a month’s time,” it added.
The court found the replies of the show-cause notices issued to the project director (PD) and registrar of Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Medical University (SMBBMU), for not appearing in hearing on Dec 14, satisfactory and vacated the notices, directing them to remain careful in future. 
The PD in his report said that the Higher Education Commission (HEC) and Sindh government were approached for a grant-in-aid of Rs1,820.124 million to complete their (varsity) projects, but they did not receive any response yet. 
The bench directed the HEC and Sindh government to provide required funds to the university for completion of their projects. 
Larkana Additional Deputy Commissioner-I Ms Rabia Siyal appeared on behalf of the deputy commissioner and submitted that technical assistance from the planning and development department was required to finalise the PC-I for the construction of a sewerage scheme for Larkana. 
The case was adjourned for Dec 28.

The commission’s member judicial-I retired Justice Arshad Noor Khan said at a press conference held at Darbar hall here the other day that it was regrettable that despite passage of five months to heavy rainfall, rainwater had still not receded from talukas of Sindhri, Jhuddo, Digri, Kot Ghulam Mohammad etc.
He said that similar flood situation might recur over succeeding years due to climate change. “We should therefore adopt a procedure to save population from big disaster in future and in this connection the district administration should perform its duties towards people with honesty and sincerity,” he said.
He said that even if they succeeded to persuade 50 per cent people they could save a large population from disaster. “We have discussed problems of masses particularly flood victims,” he said.
He urged the commission officers to go into the field to listen to grievances of masses and flood victims and resolve their problems by taking drastic measures within available resources.
Later, he held an open kachehry where social workers and villagers alleged that relief goods, ration, tents and food were distributed on the directives of political personalities and elected representatives while genuine victims, who were still living in makeshift huts along roads under open sky, were deprived of all government help.
They deplored that officers concerned of the district administration did not visit many flood hit areas to assess damage from the disaster and meet flood victim families. Most school buildings had suffered damage after flood and heavy rainfall, he said.
They claimed that blankets meant for flood victims were supplied to bungalows of feudal lords and were not distributed among flood victims.
They said that saline water was being drained with heavy pumping machines into West Jamrao canal, which was causing different diseases among masses.
They objected to a survey of damage to houses and crops carried out under supervision of army and revenue officials.
They accused deputy commissioner and other officers concerned of obeying orders of local ruling party MNAs and demanded authorities launch rehabilitation work and distribute wheat seed among victims without any discrimination.
They demanded the government immediately remove illegal encroachments from all waterways.
The kachehry was also attended by Mirpurkhas deputy commissioner Zainul Abideen Memon, SSP Asad Chaudhry, Zaheer Hussain and the commission member Noor Ahmad Narejo.

They were addressing a seminar on the “Strategic and Economic Dimensions of Pakistan and China Relations Amid Deepening Global Geopolitical Divide” at Sindh University on Wednesday. 
SU Thatta campus Pro-Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Rafique Ahmed Memon in his presidential address said that there were vast opportunities for cooperation in the field of higher education and research in China. 
He said that Chinese varsities could admit a large number of Pakistani students. Chinese educational institutions should register themselves with Pakistan accreditation bodies to resolve problems faced by Pakistani students on their return after obtaining higher degrees from various Chinese varsities. 
Pakistan Ambassador to China Moinul Haque said China’s production of Al-Khalid tanks and GF-17 Thunder fighter jets with Pakistan was actually a great proof of extraordinary defense cooperation between the two countries. 
He said that a cynical propaganda was being spread that the CPEC project would push Pakistan deeper into the debt mire, but it was not the case at all. 
Mr Haque said that it was important to open the CPEC project to public so that no propaganda could affect the friendship between the two countries. 
The two countries would soon start working on an important project to prepare submarines for Pakistan Navy and China would ensure access of Pakistani engineers to its manufacturing plant. 
He announced that the SU would be provided with opportunities to enter into educational agreements with top varsities of China so that it could advance in the field of higher education and research being an old varsity of Pakistan. 
Centre for International Strategic Studies Sindh (CSSS) Executive Director and former ambassador Kazi M. Khalilullah said: “Pakistan has a successful foreign policy, which we have to trust,” he said. Both countries had supported each other in testing times while in terms of defense, China had always helped Pakistan to stand on its own feet, he added. 
Former Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) chairman Dr Ansar Pervez said that Pakistan initially bought a nuclear power plant from Canada, but due to Canada’s coldness, the project could not go ahead and then China started the same project and it assisted Pakistan. 
He said that 325 megawatt nuclear power plant provided by China was successfully operationalized, adding that China’s cooperation was continuing to meet energy needs of Pakistan. 
Federal Minister Ahsan Iqbal, Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed and others also made speeches online.

These views have been expressed by German research scholar Ms. Karola Schmidt, who is doing her doctorate-level research on Corpus English in collaboration with the University of Sahiwal.
It is learnt Ms. Schmidt collected research data on Corpus English during her stay. Talking to Dawn, Ms. Schmidt says she is specifically interested in the status of spoken English in Pakistan and “I am here to collect the primary data for my doctorate research.”  
Ms. Schmidt says she is engaged in an academic pursuit to examine the manner in which the English language is utilised in society within Pakistan.
“For the last two weeks as part of my dissertation work, I obtained primary data from university students, faculty members and public officials,” she says.  
Ms. Schmidt has conducted a couple of seminars and workshops at the universities of Okara and Sahiwal. She has made an appearance at 1st PAK TOSEL conference hosted by the University of Okara.

2022-12-22,2022-12-22,Irregularities in Daska by-poll: LHC sets aside ECP action against election officials,"Court says after poll, duty staff no longer remains within ECP purview.","LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has set aside the proceedings against more than a dozen officials of the provincial departments initiated by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for their role in the alleged rigging committed in the 2021 by-poll of NA-75, Daska.  
“Despite repeated queries, learned counsel for the commission has not been able to convince this court that as to what is cavil with the commission to refer the matters of the petitioners for disciplinary action against them by their parent departments, especially, when they do not fall within the definition of election officials,” Justice Shujaat Ali Khan observed in his verdict allowing the writ petitions filed by Asif Hussain and 20 other officials.  
The petitioners challenged the show-cause notices and the subsequent proceedings against them by the ECP.
Senior lawyer Hafiz Tariq Naseem mainly represented the petitioners while other counsels adopted his arguments with little additions.

Court says after poll, duty staff no longer remains within ECP purview

The main argument presented by the petitioner’s counsel was against the competence of the ECP to issue the show-cause notices.  
Justice Khan observes that a person, who has been assigned any election duty, does not remain under the control and superintendence of the ECP upon declaration of fate of an election in a constituency simply for the reason that once fate of an election is declared the hiring staff lose their status as election official and the ECP does not enjoy jurisdiction to proceed against them.
He states that according to section 55(1) of the Election Act, 2017, a person can be deemed to be under the control, superintendence and discipline of the ECP for the period commencing from his date of appointment or deputation till publication of name of the returned candidate in the official gazette.  
“A cursory glance over section 55 of the Act, 2017 shows that the ECP has been empowered to proceed against an election official under the applicable disciplinary law,” he adds.  
The judge says it is very ironical on the one hand the counsel for the ECP took a specific plea that matters pertaining to pre- and post-election issues, including initiation of departmental proceedings against any delinquent official, are to be seen in the light of the referred provisions of the Constitution but has not been able to give any justification as to why impugned show-cause notices have been issued while relying on section 55 of the Act, 2017.  
Commenting on the case of one of the petitioners, the judge notes that the departmental proceedings against a government servant stand abated in the event of his retirement but initiation of the proceedings against the petitioner by the ECP, despite his retirement, speaks volumes about the fact that it proceeded to initiate proceedings against the petitioner without affirming as to whether he is in service or not.
Justice Khan maintains that upon declaration of fate of the election in the constituency, the petitioners no more remained the election officials, hence, the ECP has no jurisdiction to initiate proceedings against them.
“Resultantly, all these writ petitions are accepted and impugned disciplinary proceedings initiated by the Commission against the petitioners are declared coram-non-judice, thus, set aside,” the verdict reads.  
However, the judge, before parting with the judgment, observes that if the ECP thinks that the petitioners were involved in any subversive activities during their deployment in election duty, it would be at liberty to refer their matter to their parent departments for initiation of proceedings under the relevant law.

2022-12-22,2022-12-22,LHC’s power to review SC judgement on JIT questioned,The LHC bench will resume the case hearing today.,"LAHORE: Barrister Syed Ali Zafar, who represents the daughter of a woman killed in the Model Town firing, argued on Wednesday before a Lahore High Court larger bench that it did not have jurisdiction to review a judgment of the Supreme Court to constitute a joint investigation team (JIT) to reinvestigate the 2014 incident.
He contended that the merits of the case were discussed before the apex court.
He argued that the reinvestigation can indeed occur because the law makes no prohibition whatsoever on the extent or number of JITs that can be constituted, and therefore, a new independent investigation could be initiated to ensure that justice is served.
The bench is headed by Chief Justice Muhammad Ameer Bhatti with Justice Malik Shahzad Ahmad Khan, Justice Aalia Neelum, Justice Syed Shahbaz Ali Rizvi, Justice Mirza Viqas Rauf and Justice Tariq Saleem Sheikh.
Barrister Zafar pleaded before the bench that it had been impossible for the victims to expect justice when the investigating agencies were all headed by those who were directly linked to the perpetrators of the heinous act.
He alleged that as the ruling party at the time (i.e., PML-N) was directly involved in the Model Town massacre, its failure to hold anyone to account for this heinous crime must not be ignored.
The bench would resume further hearing on Thursday (today).
Khurram Rafiq and several other police officials facing trial in the private complaint by the PAT challenged the new JIT formed by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf-led provincial government. 
A three-judge bench had on March 22, 2019, suspended the new JIT.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Abdullah Sumbal posted as regular chief secretary,LAHORE: The federal government on Wednesday posted Abdullah Khan Sumbal as the Punjab chief secretary after a delay...,"LAHORE: The federal government on Wednesday posted Abdullah Khan Sumbal as the Punjab chief secretary after a delay of over three months when sitting CS Kamran Ali Afzal went on leave.  
Since then, the Punjab government has given look-after charge of the top administrative office to Mr Sumbal which was extended thrice. The PTI-PMLQ’s coalition government in Punjab views the development as a “serious move” at this critical juncture. However, it believes that the new chief secretary now commanding all administrative powers would not denotify chief minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi if the governor asks him to do so since Mr Elahi did not take vote of confidence on the advice of the Punjab governor.
However, sources in the bureaucracy say the chief secretary is bound to do what the law says, regardless how stakeholders interpret the constitutional provisions.
Earlier, the federal government notified the transfer of Kamran Ali Afzal, who is currently on 130-day ex-Pakistan leave, and transferred Abdulah Khan Sumbal from the Chairmanship of Punjab Planning and Development Board and posted him as regular chief secretary.Mr Afzal had earlier this month requested the Establishment Division to grant him 130-day ex-Pakistan leave as he wanted to travel to Australia. Eventually, the federal government accepted his request and assigned Mr Sumbal current charge of the office for three months with effect from Dec 7.
Mr Sumbal’s name was on the three-member panel sent by the PTI-PMLQ government to the federal government for the posting a regular chief secretary.
Meanwhile, the Punjab government transferred finance secretary Dr Wasif Khurshid and posted him as P&D Board chairman in his own pay and scale against a vacant post – after the posting of Mr Sumbal as chief secretary.
Punjab communications and works secretary Mujahid Sherdil has been transferred and posted as finance secretary. The additional charge of the C&W department has been assigned to Punjab housing urban development and public health engineering secretary Ahmed Mustajab Karamat in addition to his own duties till further order.

FIA Gujrat Deputy Director Ghulam Sarwar Warraich confirmed the registration of a case and said at least two of the suspects had been detained and an investigation was under way.  
The passport office’s former AD Saeed Abbas, data entry operator Zaheer Sial, clerk Shakoor Haider, a citizen Abid Hussain of Nankana Sahib and some other officials were among those booked under different sections of the PPC.  
The officials allegedly issued passports to Abid Hussain and his three children on the basis of fake documents. Using those passports, Hussain had flown abroad along with his children to avoid their possible handing over to their mother while a case was being heard in court.  
The Lahore High Court had ordered the FIA to investigate the matter and take legal action on the application of the children’s mother.  
Mr Warraich said the scope of investigation had been broadened to probe more officials.  
Hussain had first got registration documents of his children issued through the National Database and Registration Authority by showing someone else as his wife on an address in Gujrat, and later managed to get their passports processed with the alleged abetment of passport officials.  
A few weeks ago, the Interior Ministry had removed the entire staff of the passport office on charges of corruption and malpractices, and posted their replacements.  
The incumbent assistant director at the passport office, Hayat Tarrar, said his office had nothing to do with the case as the matter was already being investigated by the FIA.  
The next date of hearing of the case is Thursday (today) where the FIA officials would present the details of the investigation and action taken so far.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Amir Zulfiqar appointed Punjab IGP,"LAHORE: Ending the uncertainty with regard to the appointment of new head of Punjab police, the federal government...","LAHORE: Ending the uncertainty with regard to the appointment of new head of Punjab police, the federal government late on Wednesday posted Muhammad Amir Zulfiqar Khan as provincial police chief.
The federal government has issued the notification for appointment of Mr Zulfiqar as Punjab inspector general of police, who was deputy director general of the Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF). He has previously held the posts of National Highways & Motorway Police IG, Islamabad police IG and Additional IG Operations, CPO Punjab, Lahore.  
Mr Zulfiqar, as an assistant superintendent of police (ASP), won both top police honours -- the Quaid-e-Azam Police Medal and the Pakistan Police Medal. He belongs to Lahore and joined the Police Service of Pakistan (PSP) in 1991 and belonged to 19th Common.
He also served as Toba Tek Singh SSP, Special Branch Punjab SSP and Special Branch Lahore Region SSP, besides serving as Lahore DIG operations, Multan regional police officer (RPO), CTD Punjab DIG. He has served in Sindh, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and federal government.Earlier, a summary of seven police officers was forwarded to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for considering one of the officers for the Punjab IGP slot.
The BS-22 police officers who made a ‘late entry’ in the race for the Punjab’s top police slot are AD Khwaja, Rao Musthaq Ahmed Mehr, Rao Sardar Ali Khan and Ali Aamir Malik.The Punjab government had recommended the names of Fayyaz Ahmad Dev, Amir Zulfiqar and Ghulam Mahmood Dogar, all BS-21 officers for the Punjab IGP post.  
An  official privy to the process says the posting of regular IGP in Punjab was delayed because of the persisting political crisis in the  province. 
He  says that earlier the PML-N had almost agreed on the name of former Lahore capital  city police officer (CCPO) Fayyaz Ahmad Dev for the Punjab IGP slot as  PML-Q leader Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain, who recently joined hands with  the Shehbaz-led federal government, favoured the officer. Punjab Chief  Minister Parvez Elahi had also not objected to Dev’s posting, he adds.       
The official says that when the appointment of Mr Dev was  about to be made, suddenly the political situation in the province  became volatile in the aftermath of the PTI’s announcement to dissolve  the Punjab Assembly.
Meanwhile, he says, some of the BS-22 police  officers also geared up their efforts, using their political  connections, to be considered for the Punjab police’s top slot.  
Consequently, the PML-N government halted the process and added the  names of four senior police officers to the summary to the premier.
The  official source says the issue of appointment of regular IGP in Punjab  has been in the limelight since the PTI came into power in the Centre  and frequently changed provincial police chiefs during its more  than three-year long tenure.  
The crisis further  deepened when another provincial police chief, Faisal Shahkar, refused  to serve in Punjab in the wake of the political tussle between the PML-N  and the PTI-PMLQ governments in the Centre and Punjab, respectively. Mr  Shahkar had sent a written request  to the Establishment  Division to transfer him to the federal government, saying he was unable  to perform his duties in Punjab due to “personal reasons”. 
However, the  federal government asked him to retain his posting till the appointment  of new provincial police chief.
On Tuesday last, Mr Shahkar relinquished his charge as Punjab IGP, as he has to leave Pakistan for the United Nation where he has been selected for the top police slot.
The Punjab government had on Wednesday appointed BS-21 police officer Ghulam Rasool  Zahid, an officer of 19th Common, as acting police chief of the province.

The event, jointly organised by the Punjab University (PU) and GCU, received an enthusiastic and overwhelming response from the students of both varsities. Hundreds of graduates and final-year students flocked to the expo to explore employment and internship opportunities in reputed international and national companies.
Besides software houses and clothing brands, a large number of banks and student start-ups also set up their stall and interviewed the students for different jobs. Special recruitment information stalls set up by the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) and the Pakistan Navy remained the centre of attraction for the youth.
GCU Vice Chancellor (VC) Prof Dr Asghar Zaidi said career expos are usually underrated and misunderstood in Pakistani universities, adding that such events have a wider scope than only offering jobs and internship opportunities. “I urge even my first-year students to spend time with their future employers as they can help you network with people in the industry and you become more aware of the skills your industry values in an employee,” he said.
He said multiple job fairs are held in top universities of the world where students are encouraged to meet their future employers.
Information Technology University VC Dr Sarfraz Khurshid advised the students to never fear rejection, especially in job interviews, saying that many students don’t even try or appear for interviews just because of this fear.
Later, Prof Zaidi visited stalls of different companies and discussed with the executives their recruitment policies and criteria. He told the company executives that GCU not only focused on theoretical teaching, but also laid particular stress on the confidence and character building of its students so that they could perform exceptionally well in their professional lives.
Symposium: The Fatima Jinnah Medical University (FJMU) concluded its annual international scientific symposium on Wednesday. Prof Yasmin Rashid, Punjab health minister, said the occasion allowed teachers and graduate and undergraduate students learn more about current scientific research, which will ultimately help patients.
According to her, the FJMU and the associated Sir Ganga Ram Hospital effectively ran a number of health programmes.
For the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of genetic and hereditary blood illnesses, she claimed that the Punjab Thalassemia and Other Genetic Disorder Prevention and Research Institute, which was created here, offered the best resources.
The Fatima Jinnah Institute of Mother and Child Health, she insisted, was running smoothly.
The facility treats mothers and children, she said, adding that it would undoubtedly help reduce the province’s maternal and child mortality rate.
Health Secretary Dr Ahmad Javed Qazi, Federal Secretary Dr Ijaz Munir, FJMU Alumni Association of North America president Dr Fizza Zahid Rafique, King Edward Medical College Alumni Association of North America Dr Muhammad Fateh Shahzad, Allama Iqbal Medical College Alumni Association of North America president Dr Nusrum Iqbal, vice chancellor of the King Edward Medical University Prof Mehmood Ayaz, Allama Iqbal Medical College principal Prof Nadeem Hafeez Butt and Post-Graduate Medical Institute principal Prof Sardar Farid Al-Zafar were present.

— Dawn

 
RAHIM YAR KHAN: ‘Illegal’ fishing in different sections of the Indus in Rahim Yar Khan district continues due to non-issuance of tenders by the Punjab Fisheries Department (PFD).
According to sources in the PFD, the limits of the district starts from Panjnad and ends at Machka near Guddo, a long strip of almost 178 kms. The tenders for fishing in four sections of the Indus, including Samakka in Liaqatpur tehsil, Chachran Sharaif in Khanpur, Bangla Dilkusha in Rahim Yar Khan and Machka in Sadiqabad tehsil, are issued after a bidding process
The fisheries department issues tenders for permission of fishing to contractors in August every year but the PFD banned fishing this year to save the rare species of fish in the Indus. But many people started fishing in these sections of the river despite ban.  
Sources say the department [in Rahim Yar Khan] earns almost Rs20 million revenue from contractors by issuing tenders but current year tenders have not been issued as a result locals continued with ‘illegal’ fishing.  
After some complaints from the locals, the department has lifted the ban from fishing. Fisheries Assistant Director Ameer Nawaz Khan told Dawn that the secretary had banned fishing in August 2022 for 10 years but later due to some ‘unknown reasons’ he removed the restriction.  
He said during the ban, he along with his vigilance team raided different locations in the Indus and confiscated two hunting boats, four nets and six trappers. 
He said when his team tried to arrest illegal hunters, they escaped to the other side of the Indus but “my team always continues patrolling.”  
He said tenders would be issued from Dec 26, 2022 and after a bidding process successful contractors would start fishing in these sections.

2022-06-18,2022-12-22,ANALYSIS: ‘Constitutional battle’ likely to land in court,Legal experts believe that a legal battle appears to be the only way forward for resolution of the current crisis in Punjab.,"LAHORE: The ongoing ‘constitutional battle’ between the federal and Punjab governments is likely to land in courts as some questions of law have arisen after Governor Balighur Rehman asked Chief Minister Parvez Elahi to seek a “vote of confidence” in a special assembly session.
The dispute over the previous runoff election of the chief minister was also settled by the courts after the Supreme Court observed in June that a ruling passed by the presiding officer (deputy speaker) regarding the rejection of 10 votes of the Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid (PML-Q), polled in favour of Elahi, was in violation of its judgement and Article 63-A of the Constitution.
Punjab has not seen political stability since the ouster of prime minister Imran Khan through a “vote of no confidence” in April and several petitions are still pending before the courts relating to the chief minister’s election.
If a media statement of Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah Khan is to be believed, the coalition government in the centre is mulling over the imposition of “governor rule” in Punjab since Chief Minister Elahi has not taken a vote of confidence, as asked by the governor.
A source in Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) suggested that the governor, after denotifying the chief minister, could also ask him, under Article 133 of the Constitution, to continue to hold the office until the election of his successor.
Although the lawyers reached by Dawn for their comments differ on the governor’s orders issued to the chief minister, they are unanimous that a legal battle appears to be the only way forward for resolution of the current crisis in Punjab.
Shahzad Shaukat, a former advocate general of the province, believes that any party which feels aggrieved over the actions by the governor or the assembly Speaker is certainly going to knock at the door of the Lahore High Court as a first remedy.
He does not buy the Speaker’s argument that the governor cannot summon a fresh session when the house is already in session. He says the Constitution is superior to all the laws or rules in the country and it does not put such embargo on the governor.
Shaukat argued that the validity of ongoing sessions of the assembly summoned by the speaker can also be questioned since the session called by the governor, which was held in Aiwan-i-Iqbal, has not been prorogued.
However, Safdar Shaheen Pirzada, an advocate of the Supreme Court, disagrees and argues that clause 7 of Article 130 does not allow the governor to summon a fresh session when the house is in session.
He admitted that it is not a constitutional requirement that the speaker keep the house in session only to frustrate, on technical grounds, the governor’s directive to the chief minister to seek a vote of confidence.
According to Pirzada, the Punjab Assembly’s rules and the Constitution do not cater for a situation the province faces at present.
Misunderstanding
Talking to Geo News, retired Justice Shaiq Usmani said the Speaker had misunderstood the constitutional provisions while giving his ruling on the governor’s order.
He said Article 130 (7) says the governor can summon a session if he believes that the CM has lost majority in the house.
He argued that the Constitution has given powers to the governor to summon a session and ask the CM to show that he enjoys confidence of the house.
In reply to a question what would happen if the chief minister did not take a vote of confidence, he said the CM would cease to hold office and a new incumbent should be elected.
In another Geo News programme, a senior lawyer of the Supreme Court, Salman Akram Raja, said it is debatable that clause 7 of Article 130 says the governor shall summon the provincial assembly and require the chief minister to obtain a vote of confidence.
It means, he added, the present assembly is not in session and the governor has specially summoned the assembly for a vote of confidence. “And a new session could be called for this specific purpose.”
He said the rules of the Punjab Assembly, which speak about the vote of confidence, were made before the 18th Amendment. He believed confusion abounded and the speaker could explain through ruling whether he needs a new session for the vote of confidence or not, following the 18th Amendment.
Rule 22 of the Punjab Assembly (rules of procedure) says: “If, on the day fixed by the Governor for obtaining a vote of confidence from the Assembly under clause 7 of Article 130 of the Constitution, the Chief Minister refrains from doing so, it shall be deemed that he does not command the confidence of the majority of the members.”
In the same television programme, a former president of the Supreme Court Bar Association, Hamid Khan, said when an assembly is already in session, the governor is unable to call a new sitting under Article 130.

2022-12-22,2022-12-22,Lahore fog forces PIA to partly shift operations,All international PIA flights between 10pm and 11am to use Islamabad airport.,"RAWALPINDI: Due to poor visibility and fog in Lahore, Pakistan International Airlines on Wednes­day decided to shift all international flight operations between 10pm and 11am from the capital of Punjab to Islamabad.
The rescheduling of flights during these hours is temporary and will be restored as soon as the foggy conditions improve, according to the national flag carrier.
A PIA spokesman said, in a press release issued on Wednesday, the in­­ternational flight operations between 10pm and 11am was moved from Allama Iqbal Inter­national Airport to Islamabad due to foggy weather conditions. The move was aimed at ensuring air safety and saving long waiting time for passengers, he claimed.
 






For timely information of flights, air travellers, as well as those visiting the airport to pick or drop passengers, have been requested to contact PIA call centre at 786786111. PIA passengers have also been requested to record their correct contact number at the time of booking so that they can be provided with timely information about changes in flight timings through call or SMS.

All international PIA flights between 10pm and 11am to use Islamabad airport

The PIA spokesman made it clear that the arrangement for shifting the flight operations had been made temporarily in order to avoid inconvenience of ‘prolonged wait’ to travellers. As soon as the foggy conditions improved, the operations would be restored at Lahore, he added.
Motorway closure
Not only air travellers but also motorists using GT Road and motorway were facing problems due to the foggy weather.
The motorway section from Kot Momin to Faisalabad was closed due to the severity of the fog, which started to increase at around 6pm on Wednesday, DIG Motorway Police (North Zone), told Dawn.
He said the motorway’s closure depended on visibility usually affected by fog.
Heavy fog also caused problems on the Peshawar-Burhan highway, he said.
The Swat Expressway had already been closed for all types of traffic from Colonel Sher Khan to Ismaila due to fog, according to a motorway police spokesman.
He said the public had been requested to avoid unnecessary travel in foggy weather.
In case of necessary travel, however, drivers should use fog lights and ensure the functioning of backlights and wipers and seek assistance from helpline 130 before starting the journey.

The capabilities of the official, who has served on the key posts of SSP and DIG Operations in Islamabad, was leading the capital police’s investigations into the Jan 2021 murder of 22-year-old Osama Satti, who was shot in his car by police officials, as well as the rape and murder of 10-year-old Farishta, whose family were allegedly subjected to humiliating treatment by the officials tasked with probing her initial disappearance.
The inquiry conducted to probe these killings blamed the SSP and DIG Operations for failing to “observe their legal responsibility”. 
An inquiry into the 2019 murder of Farishta held the SSP Operations and DIG Operations — both posts were held by the same person at the time — responsible, along with the capital police chief, since they “failed to meticulously observe their legal responsibility”.
Since the official in question held both positions concurrently, the inquiry report said, it was his responsibility to ensure the timely registration of the case and to post efficient SHOs. 
As per the record, the report notes, neither the inspector general or the DIG (Operations) conducted even a single inspection of the police station where the maltreatment took place. It further said the spirit of Chapter 22 of Police Rules 1934 “requires the supervisory officers to personally inspect the police station and note down their remakes in register No 13”.
A judicial inquiry into the murder of Osama Satti also blamed top Islamabad police officials for deploying the “Anti-Terrorism Squad/Crises Response Team, [a] highly skilled force that was not trained to restrain itself” in areas like Srinagar Highway.
It also revealed the Rescue 1122 team was given a “wrong address” and subsequently told to go back through wireless control as if “nothing had happened”.
**Dawn* reached out to the officer in question several times for comment, but he chose not to respond.*

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Flood-hit areas exposed to harsh winter: UN,ISLAMABAD: The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in an interim report on flood damage severity...,"ISLAMABAD: The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in an interim report on flood damage severity and propensity for severe weather says 14 districts of Sindh, 10 districts of Balochistan, nine districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and two of Punjab have been identified as the most exposed to difficult winter conditions.
The UNOCHA report, made available on Wed­nes­day, says that with the onset of winter season, stagnant receding water, displacements at inadequate and makeshift sites, damaged shelters and the lack of appropriate winter clothing, basic household items and safe heating supplies, are contributing to placing millions of people at risk of illness, disease and protection concerns, especially gender-based violence.
Currently, an estimated 14.6 million people need food assistance, while over seven million children and women need immediate access to nutrition services. This includes over 520,000 children facing severe acute malnutrition (SAM) requiring immediate treatment, and close to 80,000 children needing urgent medical interventions due to SAM-related medical complications, the report says.
Preliminary estimates indicate an increase in the national poverty rate of 3.7 per cent to 4pc as a direct result of the floods, placing between 8.4m and 9.1m people into abject poverty.
The report says the losses in food production are compounded by disruption of income and livelihood and the rising prices amid national and global inflation.
An estimated 4.4m acres of crop area, enough to cultivate crop for 14.6m people remain damaged, and more than 800,000 livestock lost.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Nawaz becomes latest beneficiary of amended NAB law,"Case against PML-N supremo, Zardari, Gilani about Toshakhana vehicles returned; court also lacks jurisdiction to try ex-president.","ISLAMABAD: PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif got the first benefit from the recent amendment in the accountability law when a court on Wednesday returned a Toshakhana reference to the anti-graft watchdog that had implicated him as well as PPP leader Asif Zardari and former premier Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani as accused.
The reference, relating to vehicles obtained by the two leaders from the state treasury with the help of Mr Gilani by paying small sums of money as is required by law, was returned by the accountability court to the NAB chairman citing lack of jurisdiction because of the National Accountability (2nd amendment) Act, 2022, that set Rs500 million threshold to make it triable as a NAB case.
Judge Mohammad Bashir returned another reference against Mr Zardari involving a Rs8.3 billion suspicious transaction between the account of Bahria Town and the account of an aide to the ex-president.
In the Toshakhana reference, the court had declared former prime minister Nawaz Sharif a proclaimed offender in September 2020.

Case against PML-N supremo, Zardari, Gilani about Toshakhana vehicles returned; court also lacks jurisdiction to try ex-president in reference involving Rs8.3bn

According to the reference, Mr Sharif and Mr Zardari obtained vehicles from Toshakhana by paying only 15 per cent of the price of the luxury vehicles.
NAB alleged that ex-PM Gilani had facilitated the allotment of vehicles to Mr Zardari and Mr Sharif by “dishonestly and illegally” relaxing the procedure for acceptance and disposal of state gifts vide a Cabinet Division memorandum issued in 2007.
Farooq H. Naek, counsel for Mr Zardari and Mr Gilani, argued before the court that the investigation report worked out that the national exchequer had suffered a loss of Rs118.52m whereas amendments to Section 9 and Section 10 of the National Accountability Ordinance (NAO), 1999, made earlier this year, had set Rs500m minimum value for a case to be investigated by NAB.
Moreover, he said, Sections 3-4 of the Anti-Money Laundering Act (AMLA), 2010, are not applicable to the case against Mr Zardari and Mr Gilani as there is no predicate offence that has been alleged against them, he said.
Mr Naek argued that since NAB lacks jurisdiction in the matter, the court has no jurisdiction in respect of the predicate offence under the NAO.
NAB prosecutor Sohail Arif, on the other hand, argued that the value of predicate offence as per the charge framed by the court is Rs118.52m, which is less than Rs500m as required under Section 5(o) of the NAO for having jurisdiction in the matter.
The court ruled: “In view of Section 5(o) of the NAO, 1999, when the value of the alleged offence under NAO is less than Rs500 million, the case is beyond the domain of NAB and trial under section 3-4 of AMLA, 2010 cannot be continued.”
It declared: “The jurisdiction of this court is as such ousted”.
The judge then returned the reference to the NAB chairman with the directive to the court staff to “return the reference books to the chairman through the investigation officer of the case”.
Suspicious transaction
The reference book pertaining to the Rs8.3bn suspicious transaction was also returned to the NAB chairman by the court.
The NAB had accused Mr Zardari of constructing his house in Clifton, Karachi, with the ill-gotten money. According to details mentioned in the reference, Mushtaq Ahmed, another accused, had provided Rs150m for the construction of the house.
The reference said that Mr Zardari could not provide proof of his claim that he had built the house through legal means.
According to the reference, an illegal transaction of Rs8.3bn was made via Mushtaq Ahmed’s bank account with the money being paid to M/s Bahria Town (Pvt) Limited.
Mushtaq Ahmed worked as a government employee in the President House from 2009 to 2013. He was recruited as a stenographer on the recommendation of Senator Rukhsana Bangash.
Another accused is Zain Malik, son-in-law of Bahria Town’s owner Malik Riaz.
Mr Naek argued that NAB had no jurisdiction to investigate this case since the “value of the offence is Rs150 million which is less than Rs500 million as required under Section 5(o) of NAO added through the NAO 2nd amendment Act 2022 and is given retrospective effect”.
The court noted that it lacks jurisdiction in this matter as well and directed the court staff to return the case file to the NAB chairman.

2022-12-22,2022-12-22,Federal govt consulting provinces on plan to save energy: Asif,QUETTA: The federal government has thrashed out a strategy for energy conservation and started consultations with...,"QUETTA: The federal government has thrashed out a strategy for energy conservation and started consultations with provincial governments in order to remove its flaws before implementation, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said during a meeting at the Quetta Airport on Wednesday.
Petroleum Minister Musadik Malik, Prime Minister’s Adviser Qamar Zaman Kaira, Maulana Abdul Wasey of the JUI-F and Energy Secretary Rashid Mahmood Langaryal accompanied Khawaja Asif.
The defence minister said the government was determined to save energy consumption by adopting drastic measures that would require the nation to make “radical changes in lifestyle”. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had directed the cabinet to share recommendations of a special committee for energy conservation with the provincial governments, the minister said.
The present government inherited a host of problems after taking over in April, a lack of money among them. “But the floods made matters worse by rendering millions of people homeless and financially vulnerable,” the defence minister observed.
Khawaja Asif said the entire world, except Pakistan, opens for business in the morning and downs shutters by sunset. “But the situation is starkly different in our country as markets remain open till late in the night, causing a colossal waste of energy.”
The minister said the special committee had suggested closure of markets and business establishments by 8pm and restaurants by 10pm. “The panel has also suggested changing the working hours of government offices.”
He expressed confidence that the nation would cooperate with the government in implementing the energy conservation strategy.
Khawaja Asif and other members of his delegation stayed at Quetta airport for several hours before returning to Islamabad. Senator Manzoor Kakar, Balochistan’s Finance Minister Zamarak Khan Achakzai and representatives of the Traders and Farmers Action Committee had a meeting with Khawaja Asif at the airport and offered suggestions for resolving the energy crisis.

• Party also elects central and provincial office-bearers
QUETTA: The seventh National Con­gress of the Pashtoonkhwah Milli Aw­a­mi Party (PkMAP) on Wednesday re-elected Mahmood Khan Achakzai as the party’s chairman, Arshad Khan Sw­­abi as senior deputy chairman and Abdul Rahim Ziaratwal as general secretary.
The three-day congress, which concluded on Wednesday night, also elected central and provincial office-bearers, including Abdur Rauf Lala as deputy chairman, and Attal Khan Achakzai as senior deputy secretary.
Among the central secretaries elected were Nawab Ayaz Khan Jogezai, Jumma Gul, Rasan Safi, Nazir Jan Lala, Malik Shaukat, Talimand Khan, Dr Kaleemullah, Fazal Qadir Sherani, Dr Hamid Khan Achakzai, Musa Bacha, Jabbar Khan and Dr Jamil Khan Panizai.
The provincial presidents elected by the party congress included Abdul Qahar Wadan for Balochistan, Dr Mohammad Ali for Khyber Pakhtu­nkhwa, Janan Afghan for Punjab, and Saleem Tareen for Sindh.
The congress also elected national and four provincial Qaumi Jirgas as an electoral college to elect central, provincial executives or cabinets and working committees, respectively.
The congress, attended by delegates from all provinces, discussed organisational affairs, structure and constitution, and endorsed decisions taken by the party chairman in the interim period between the sixth and seventh congresses.
Speaking on the occasion, Mr Achakzai highlighted the egalitarianism of the Pakhtun society in which the noble and a commoner could eat at the same table without any discrimination.
He said Pakhtuns had contributed to human civilisation and politics by constituting states, kingdoms and governance systems on Pakhtun-Afghan land as well as in the subcontinent in various periods of history. For instance, he said, the Sher Shah Suri model of governance and administration was still a point of reference for a welfare system.
“Foreigners’ travelogues have recorded that in Pakhtuns’ land, food and boarding are free for travellers and strangers, as hospitality is enshrined in the codes of ‘Pashtoonwali’,” Mr Achakzai said and wondered how such a society could breed terrorists and terrorism.
The PkMAP chairman said that terrorism and ensuing physical, political and economic sufferings inflicted on Pakhtuns and Afghans living on both sides of the Durand Line were the direct outcome of the international and regional powers’ policies and they pursued their nefarious strategic and economic interests.
He said if the prevailing situation in Afghanistan was not handled humanely and according to principles of international justice and peaceful co-existence, its seismic effects could be felt across the region and beyond.
He said that several superpowers entered as aggressors to conquer Afghanistan, but they never succeeded in their designs.
He urged Pakhtuns to forge unity in their ranks to counter the existential threats that they currently face.

2022-12-22,2022-12-22,"Plan afoot to merge units for health sector reforms, monitoring in KP",Concept paper to be put up to minister next week for consent.,"PESHAWAR: The health department has planned to merge the Health Sector Reforms Unit and Independent Monitoring Unit to “ensure evidence-based approach for policy-making and make recommendations for its implementation on health-related issues”in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, say officials.
They told Dawn that a concept paper for the initiative was being developed for approval by the health minister that was likely to come next week.
Officials said that the HSRU was established in 2003 to carry out research on the province’s health matters backed by statistics and formulate policies to improve patient care, while the IMU was set up in 2016 to monitor health facilities and point out missing facilities, including manpower, medical supplies, equipment and toilets.
They said that the health secretariat had recommended a combined structure for both units provided with data and insights to devise policies and implement them for improving patient care in the province.

Concept paper to be put up to minister next week for consent

The officials said that it had been realised making these units into one was needed because it would strengthen policy-making, implementation, health economics, human resources and other aspects of the department.
They said the IMU had all data of health facilities and the HSRU that of the policy-making and coordination with the centre and donor agencies about healthcare in the province.
The officials said that the proposed Health Sector Reform and Monitoring Unit (HSRMU) would suggest broad-based policies to the government and recommend implementation.
They said that a BPS-20 doctor from the administrative cadre would head the unit, which was to operate as an advisory body driven by scientific researches to develop policies for the provision of better care to patients in line with the deficiencies to be recorded by current IMU staff members, who were set to become part of the proposed entity.
The officials said that the IMU inspected public sector health facilities and prepared monthly and quarterly reports about missing facilities.
They said that the proposed HSRMU would be responsible for the overall leadership, supervision, management, and monitoring affairs to achieve the objectives.
According to officials, the health department wants to come up with innovative healthcare measures as suggested by the proposed body.
They said that the HSRMU would lead, supervise and contribute in all technical areas ranging from identification of policy issues to guiding towards drafting of policy documents in the areas identified in project documents and would convene and direct technical meetings as required.
The officials also said that the unit would play the overall leadership and supervisory roles besides performing communication functions in addition to scrutinising the quality of reports for accuracy and present the monthly and quarterly progress reports to the health secretary and minister as well as the chief minister.
They said that the HSRMU would examine matters relating to policy and strategic planning and advice on policy, strategy frameworks and health systems at provincial and district levels, and would plan, manage and implement the overall procurement strategy for the health department.
The officials said that the proposed body would prepare a policy implementation roadmap and monitor progress of all policy changes and human resource strategy for the department, including standardisation of recruitment process and term of reference of all personnel.
They also said that the HSRMU would have the services of primary and secondary healthcare specialists to give technical support on designing and implementation of primary and secondary healthcare reforms, and get the services of infrastructure specialists for infrastructure revamp strategy, oversee implementation and budget utilisation.
The officials said that the proposed unit would have broader responsibilities which included legal drafting for reviewing contracts besides carrying out economic evaluation of health interventions, formulating recommendations, and liaising with partner organisations for implementation.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,KP ministers blame ‘regime change’ for security issue,Taimur Saleem Jhagra says security challenges surfaced in KP after the removal of Imran Khan from office.,"PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government on Wednesday blamed the security issue in the province on the ouster of Prime Minister Imran Khan’s government in April this year.
It also flayed Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s administration on the criticism of the province’s police and counter-terrorism department over the seizure of the CTD centre in Bannu.
Accompanied by adviser to the chief minister on home Babar Salim Swati and higher education minister Kamran Bangash, finance minister Taimur Saleem Jhagra told reporters here that security challenges surfaced in the province after the removal of Prime Minister Imran Khan from power and that the “regime change” was responsible for the current law and order situation in the province.
He said a comparison of the security situation before and after the Shehbaz-government in the centre was enough to confirm his assertion.
The minister said terrorist activities on the country’s western borders began in 2001.
He said the post-2001 deaths in the province’s tribal districts (erstwhile Fata) outnumbered those reported nationwide during the period showing how ‘ignorant’ interior minister Rana Sanaullah and defence minister Khwaja Asif were about such casualties.
“It’s very sad to hear [remarks of members of the federal cabinet],” he said.
Mr Jhagra said the security situation had improved after the fencing of western borders and that was maintained by the centre and not KP.
He blamed Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s administration for the province’s financial challenges.
The minister said in the third letter to former adviser to PM Shehbaz Sharif on finance Miftah Ismail, he had warned that the continued denial of funds by the centre to the province could lead to security challenges in the province.
He said his government had to make “compromises on different things” due to those funding denial.
Aide to the chief minister Babar Saleem Swati said the “regime change” had led to “security pressure”, so he wondered why the state institutions continued to support Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s administration.
“What is happening right now [in the province] is just because of the regime change in the country,” he insisted.
He said KP acted as a buffer zone on the Western border.
Mr Swati said the sacrifices rendered by the province showed that its forces and residents continued to stand firm against militancy.
He said the provincial government had established CTD regional offices and would set up a few more soon.
Minister Kamran Bangash said there was a huge difference between the law and order situation in the province before and after 2013.
He said the federation should behave like a federation.
Mr Bangash said the provincial government, police and CTD were vigilant and were taking all necessary steps to maintain the law and order situation in the province.
‘We will fight militancy together,” he said.

“The man stated to be the owner of the house was burnt to death in his room. We have retrieved his charred body from the rubble and shifted it to hospital for autopsy,” Amir Khadam, a Rescue 1122 official, told reporters. 
The fire, which according to conflicting reports broke out either due to electricity short-circuiting or gas heater leakage, engulfed the double-storey house within no time, reducing household goods, including cash, gold ornaments and other valuables, to ashes. 
Fire tenders and ambulances of Rescue 1122 and tehsil municipal administration, Baffa-Pakhal, immediately responded to calls made by a women living in the adjacent house, and put out the flames after hectic efforts of many hours.  
The family of house owner, Mohammad Ijaz, had gone to his in-laws’ house, and he was alone there, sleeping in a room, Mr Khadam said, adding the charred body was shifted to the King Abdullah Teaching Hospital. 
The police, after registering an FIR, started investigation to ascertain the exact cause of the fire.  
Meanwhile, unknown assailants killed a young boy, namely Mohammad Rizwan, in Kirpai area of Oghi. 
The police said the boy was standing outside his cattle pen when assailants showed up there and opened indiscriminate fire on him, leaving him seriously injured. He was rushed to a nearby hospital, where doctors pronounced him dead. 
The police, after lodging FIR, started making efforts to arrest the culprits. 
Separately, the people on Wednesday complained millers were selling low quality wheat flour to them under the government’s subsidised flour scheme. 
“The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government is providing subsidy to millers to supply wheat flour at subsidised rate, but the latter are selling inferior quality commodity to consumers,” Mohammad Ajmal, a local, told reporters. 
He said the food department should check the quality of wheat flour being sold in Mansehra under the government’s relief package. 
“The subsidy being provided by the government on wheat to millers is only meant to provide relief to people, but millers are fleecing consumers,” he said.

When contacted, Mr Rashid Advocate confirmed to Dawn the receipt of such a letter, saying he had informed the district police about it.
However, an advisory note issued to him by DSP Swabi tehsil says he should take precautionary measures for his security. He has been told to avoid unnecessary movement; keep a licensed weapon, if any, for his defense/protection and maintain security on his part. The note, however, said policemen in plainclothes ‘will frequently be active in the surroundings of his house’.
He has been asked to contact immediately the Swabi district police officer, DSP headquarters, SHO Swabi city police station and the police control room in case he spots any suspect around.

Talking to mediapersons, he said the former PTI government in the centre had pushed the country’s economy into deep crisis.
Mr Younus insisted Imran Khan did not have sustainability in his policies and changed his positions repeatedly, harming the nation and future of younger generation.
He claimed the nation was no longer interested in following the former prime minister. He said Pakistan needed ‘serious’ leaders to tackle the issues in a prudent manner.

Responding to a question regarding the possible dissolution of the provincial assembly, he made it clear that Imran Khan was the chairman of the party. “Whatever decision he takes; we will ensure its implementation,” he said. 

CM threatens sit-in outside NA over ‘denial’ of dues by centre

He issued the directives during a meeting with principals of private schools. Though schools’ heads claimed canteens in their respective institutions were selling quality products, the assistant commissioner said he had received reports that such places were selling substandard food items to students, thus compromising their health.
He said health issues were rising among the school going children due to use of substandard edible items, particularly snacks, chips and biscuits.
Mr Asif told Dawn that he had given two days to the private schools management to improve quality of foods being sold at their canteens. 
Afterwards, he added he would visit each school to check the quality of food items. He said if any school canteen or tuck shop was found selling unhealthy items to children, the respective school would be imposed heavy fines as children’s health was important.
He said he also planned to crackdown on shops selling low quality food items in Bisham tehsil.

The persons with disabilities (PWDs) from different areas of Swat district received artificial limbs along with financial assistance in ceremonies in Mingora and Peshawar. 
The activity was carried out under the social protection programme of Qatar Charity in collaboration with Pakistan Institute of Prosthetic and Orthotics (PIPOS) and Pakistan Baitul Mal (PBM). 
The project was carried out in Swat and Khyber districts to provide artificial limbs to people with disabilities who had lost their body parts in accidents, IED blasts and other terrorist activities. The speakers said on the occasion that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was severely affected by terrorism where bomb blasts and other terrorist activities caused heavy loss to the residents as a big number of people lost their body parts. 
Qatar Charity’s field coordinator Sajjad Khan said that PWDs could now walk like normal persons after providing them with the artificial limbs. 
“Those people who were earlier dependent on other people for walking and carrying out their activities can now walk like normal people. We are happy to see the change in their lives,” he said. 
PIPOS head Dr Javed Ghani praised the Qatar Charity and PBM for their generous support. 
“We manufacture artificial limbs according to the size and need of PWDs. We are happy that we served them under the project and we expect that the donor agency would continue its support in KP because the number of PWDs was higher than our expectations,” Dr Ghani said. 
PBM provincial director Lal Badshah assured full support to the Qatar Charity and thanked it for considering interventions for the most vulnerable segments of society.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,"Hasan returns to Pakistan squad for NZ Tests, uncapped Kamran replaces Azhar","KARACHI: Pakistan pacer Hasan Ali returned to the national squad on Wednesday, for the upcoming two-match home Test...","KARACHI: Pakistan pacer Hasan Ali returned to the national squad on Wednesday, for the upcoming two-match home Test series against New Zealand. The Pakistan Cricket Board also named Khyber Pakhtunkhwa batter Kamran Ghulam as the replacement of veteran Azhar Ali, who retired from international cricket following the recently concluded series against England.
Hasan is touted to play the first Test in Karachi — which starts on Monday — after last playing a red-ball match for Pakistan against Sri Lanka in July. Following the away series against the Sri Lankans, the right-armer had lost his place due to injuries and lack of form.
Despite having taken 14 wickets in six Quaid-i-Azam Trophy matches this season, Hasan wasn’t picked for the Test series against England, which Pakistan lost 3-0 — their first-ever Test whitewash at home.
The national selectors, instead, preferred uncapped pacer Mohammad Ali over Hasan, despite their fast bowling resources already depleted due to the absence of spearhead Shaheen Shah Afridi, who is nursing a knee injury.
Ali was picked on the basis of a decent show in the Quaid Trophy — 24 wickets in as many outings as Hasan — but the right-armer struggled to cause trouble against the England batters on placid tracks.
Pakistan also gave Test caps to T20 mainstays Haris Rauf and Mohammad Wasim with Naseem Shah as the leader of the national side’s pace attack. Naseem and Haris picked up injuries following the first Test in Rawalpindi while Wasim took one wicket in his only Test in Karachi.
While Naseem returns for the New Zealand games after recovering from a shoulder niggle, Haris stays on the sidelines. Pace all-rounder Faheem Ashraf, who had forgettable outings against England has been “advised to participate in the ongoing Pakistan Cup” along with Ali according to the PCB.
For middle-order batter Kamran, this is the second time to be called up in a Pakistan Test squad. The right-hander’s maiden call-up was when he was picked for the home series against South Africa in 2021. He, however, did not play in any of the three matches.
Kamran accumulated an impressive 597 runs in eight Quaid Trophy matches this season and boasts a brilliant average of 47.36 in first-class cricket. The 27-year-old brings the experience of 44 first-class games into the Pakistan Test squad.
After the first Test, Pakistan and New Zealand will take on each other in the second and final game in Multan from Jan 3-7. The Tests will be followed by a three One-day Internationals — to be played in Karachi on Jan 10, 12 and 14.
Squad: Babar Azam (captain), Abdullah Shafique, Abrar Ahmed, Hasan Ali, Imam-ul-Haq, Kamran Ghulam, Mohammad Nawaz, Mohammad Rizwan, Mohammad Wasim Jnr, Naseem Shah, Noman Ali, Sarfaraz Ahmed, Salman Ali Agha, Saud Shakeel, Shan Masood, Zahid Mehmood.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,PM forms Sethi-led interim body to run PCB affairs; elections within four months,"The new committee will manage PCB affairs with full executive powers, says one of the board members.","ISLAMABAD: In a major top-level change in Pakistan cricket administration, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday nominated a 14-member management committee headed by Najam Sethi to run the affairs of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) till the elections to be held within the next four months.
“The Prime Minister has seen and is pleased to approve the proposal at  para 7, of the summary with the stipulation that names of the Management  Committee, to be placed before the Federal Cabinet,” said the notification issued by the Prime Minister’s Office on Wednesday. 

 





 
The Sethi-headed committee includes Shakil Sheikh (ex-PCB  BoG), Gul Zada (ex-PCB BoG) Nauman Butt (ex-PCB BoG), ex-Test  cricketers  Haroon Rashid, Shahid Khan Afridi and  Shafqat Rana, Sana Mir (ex-Pakistan women team’s captain), Aized Syed  (ex-PCB director NHPC), Tanvir Ahmed (ex-president Larkana Region),  Advocate Supreme Court Mustafa Ramday and Chaudhry Arif Saeed (CEO  Service Industries).

 





 
One of the members of the new management committee, requesting anonymity, said this committee had been formed in the light of PCB’s Constitution of 2014.
“This [management] committee will work till the elections of PCB Board of Governors and Chairman which will be held within 120 days,” the said member said.
“Now, after a formal approval from the Federal Cabinet anytime soon as a summary has been moved for getting [this] approval through circulation, the PCB Constitution of 2019 will be formally repealed and the Constitution of 2014 will be formally revived.”
The 2019 Constitution was approved by former prime minister Imran Khan.
This committee will manage PCB affairs with full executive powers with the aim of effecting the restoration of departmental cricket structure and allied matters, including the nomination of Board of Governors and the election of chairman, as stipulated in the 2014 Constitution, within 120 days.
According to sources, there were strong chances that after repealing the Constitution of 2019, Sethi would formally take charge as PCB  chairman after the completion of relevant legal formalities. 
The Ministry of Inter-provincial Coordination (IPC) the other day had moved a summary to include two new PCB BoG members — Sethi and Shakil — in place of incumbent PCB chairman Ramiz Raja and another member Asad Ali Khan. 
Ramiz was elected as PCB chief in September last year.
Late on Wednesday, sources added, the IPC Ministry moved a summary to Cabinet Division for its approval through circulation. 
It is relevant to note here that Ehsan Mani replaced Sethi as PCB chief following the latter’s resignation in 2018 after the formation of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government which was replaced in April this year following Imran’s removal as PM through a no-confidence motion in the Parliament.

2022-01-18,2022-12-22,Babar Azam rises to career-high Test batter ranking,"Babar, who is ranked first in ODIs and fourth in T20Is, trails Australia’s Marnus Labuschagne by 61 points in the Test rankings.","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan captain Babar Azam has attained a career-best second position in the latest International Cricket Council (ICC) men’s Test player rankings after notching two half-centuries in the final Test of the ICC World Test Championship (WTC) series against England in Karachi.
Babar’s knocks of 78 and 54 have helped him overtake Steve Smith, who managed 36 and six in a low-scoring game between Australia and South Africa in Brisbane. Babar, who is ranked first in ODIs and fourth in T20Is, trails Australia’s Marnus Labuschagne by 61 points in the Test rankings.
Australian batter Travis Head, whose first innings score of 92 was the highest in the Brisbane Test, has gained three slots to reach a career-best fourth position as he crosses the 800-rating point mark for the first time in his career. His previous best was fifth position in January this year.
In the latest weekly update that also takes into account performances in the first Test of the WTC series between Bangladesh and India in Chittagong, Cheteshwar Pujara’s knocks of 90 and 102 not out have lifted him 10 positions to 16th while Shreyas Iyer (up 11 places to 26th) and Shubman Gill (up 10 places to 54th) have also gained after some fine performances in the match.
England captain Ben Stokes (up places to 23rd), South Africa’s Temba Bavuma (up eight places to 24th) and Bangladesh’s Shakib Al Hasan (up four places to 37th) are some others to move up the batters list. England’s Harry Brook is in the top 50 for the first time after scoring centuries in all three Tests in Pakistan.
In the bowlers rankings, South African quick Kagiso Rabada has gained four spots to reach third position after grabbing four wickets in each innings at the Gabba. Rabada, a formerly top-ranked bowler, was third in August this year before slipping down the table.
India spinners Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel have made rapid progress after helping win the Chittagong Test. Yadav’s man-of-the-match effort of 8-113 has lifted him 19 places to 49th while Patel’s five scalps in the match see him jump 10 places to a career-best 18th position.
Other bowlers to move up the list include Marcon Jansen, Jack Leach, Mark Wood, Mehidy Hasan Miraz, Scott Boland and Mohammad Siraj.

2022-12-20,2022-12-22,England cap revival year with Pakistan whitewash,LONDON: The completion of England’s 3-0 series success over Pakistan on Tuesday was the latest chapter in a...,"LONDON: The completion of England’s 3-0 series success over Pakistan on Tuesday was the latest chapter in a remarkable revival, all the more extraordinary for the woeful run of red-ball results that preceded the ‘Bazball’ era.
Inflicting the first home whitewash suffered by Pakistan in Test history, courtesy of an eight-wicket win in Karachi on Tuesday, was striking enough in itself.
It also gave England their ninth win in 10 matches at this level, with Test world champions New Zealand, India and South Africa also among the vanquished, since captain Ben Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum took charge in May.
When they joined forces, however, England had won just one of their 17 previous Tests.
So how to explain the stunning turnaround? The answer begins in April, when the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) appointed Rob Key, a former England batsman with a modest Test record, as their new director of cricket.
The 43-year-old, previously a television pundit, has since seen his judgement vindicated repeatedly.
As New Zealand captain, McCullum provided the template for England’s resurgence in 50-over cricket that culminated in their 2019 World Cup final win.
Key backed him to have a similar impact on the Test side when he named him as a permanent replacement as coach for Chris Silverwood was sacked after England’s 4-0 thrashing in Australia.
Star all-rounder Stokes, 31, not long back from a mental health break, replaced close friend Joe Root as England captain, with the outstanding batsman drained by leading a losing side playing under severe Covid restrictions.
Numerous observers noted how the form of England all-rounders Ian Botham and Andrew Flintoff had slumped during their unsuccessful spells as Test captain.
Nevertheless Key, preferring his opinion to the weight of history, said:  “I believe in Brendon and Ben Stokes... Time for us all to buckle up and get ready for the ride.” And what a ride to date, with Stokes and McCullum capitalising on the feel-good mood created by the end of ‘bubble’ life.
In the new environment players are encouraged to enjoy cricket and not fear failure.
England’s attacking approach, dubbed ‘Bazball’ in honour of McCullum’s nickname, although he dislikes the term, has been based on aggressive run-scoring that allows bowlers the time to take the 20 wickets needed to win a Test.
McCullum has realised advances in limited overs run-scoring — on show in England’s recent T20 World Cup win under white-ball coach Matthew Mott — can be applied to Test cricket.
That expanded range of strokeplay, allied to classical shot-making, saw England become the first team to score 500 runs on the first day of a Test when Zak Crawley, rising stars Harry Brook and Ollie Pope, as well as Ben Duckett, all made hundreds in the Pakistan series opener in Rawalpindi.
England’s new attitude is also evident in Stokes’ willingness to risk losing a match in pursuit of a win.
In Rawalpindi, Stokes’ bold declaration, that left Pakistan needing 343 to win in four sessions, was rewarded with victory shortly before bad light threatened to end the match.
England’s willingness to defy their traditional conservatism was equally visible when 18-year-old leg-spinner Rehan Ahmed became the youngest Test debutant from any country to take five wickets in an innings during the Karachi finale.
Stokes has also proved himself an astute man-manager, reinvigorating veteran quicks James Anderson and Stuart Broad, while giving a much-needed confidence boost to left-arm spinner Jack Leach.
Have England changed Test cricket? Perhaps not but former captain Michael Atherton, noting how the current England team’s approach had faced scepticism at every turn, wrote in The Times on Tuesday that Stokes’ men had won in Pakistan by  “playing with more verve and attacking intent than any England team, surely, has ever done”.
For some the acid test remains next year’s Ashes series at home to arch-rivals Australia.
Stokes acknowledges that winning makes it easier for England to  “enjoy” themselves and is doing his best to head off the doubters.
“The real test will be when things don’t go so well,” he said.  “And that will be the time to make that [enjoyment] even more of a thing for us to take out there. But I hope we don’t come to that.”

Kamran, who was named in the Pakistan Test squad for the upcoming two-match series against New Zealand earlier, helped Khyber Pakhtunkhwa post 351-4 against Northern, a target they fell short of by 83 runs at the State Bank Stadium. 
The right-hander smashed 118 off 92 balls — an innings studded with four fours and eight sixes. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were further boosted by half-centuries from Mohammad Haris (61 off 25), Sahibzada Farhan (58 off 59), Khushdil Shah (52 off 49) and Waqar Ahmed (50 off 75).
In response to the mammoth total, Northern were dismissed for 268 runs with three overs to spare as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Ihsanullah took five wickets. 
The pick of the batters for Northern was Pakistan discard Umar Akmal, who added 76 off 71 balls with the help of five fours and three sixes. All-rounder Mubasir Khan’s 49-ball 63 also went in vain for the side.
At the NBP Sports Complex, Saim’s ton saw Sindh chase down a 254-run target by Balochistan in just 42 overs and with the loss of six wickets.
The left-handed opener took just 99 balls to plunder the Balochistan bowlers for 102 runs, striking nine fours and a six during the knock. Following the end of a 54-run opening partnership with Sharjeel Khan — who hit 36 runs of 16 balls — Saim saw two off his partners depart on the other end, leaving Sindh at 111-3.
The stylish batter then combined with Mohammad Suleman for 105 runs for the fourth wicket. After Saim lost his wicket as the scorecard read 216-4, Suleman went on to chase down the remaining target with Danish Aziz and returned undefeated at 66 off 75 balls. 
Earlier, Balochistan opener Haseebullah’s scored 107 off 110 balls before Balochistan were bowled out for 253 in 48 overs. Danish bagged three wickets with his left-arm spin and pacer Shahnawaz Dahani claimed two victims.
At the UBL Sports Complex, Southern Punjab defeated Central Punjab by 97 runs, thanks to an all-round performance from Hassan Khan.
Hassan first helped Southern Punjab post 274-8 with a quickfire 48 off 22 balls before taking two wickets to help his side bundle out Central Punjab for 177.
Zain Abbas was the top-scorer for Southern Punjab with 69 off 80. Sharoon Siraj, meanwhile, added 45 off 67. Later, Arafat Minhas took four wickets to wrap it up for the side.
Summarised scores: 
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa beat Northern by 83 runs.
