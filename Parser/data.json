            "Text": "Several legal issues were raised by the sitting judges during hearing of a case on Monday, pertaining to the Supreme Judicial Council's (SJC) authority to pursue complaints against retired or resigned Supreme Court judges.\n\nJustice Jamal Mandokhel voiced concern that proceedings against judges could hinder justice delivery, as judges might fear repercussions. He emphasised that judicial immunity existed not for personal benefit, but to safeguard the public's right to justice.\n\nA five-member larger bench, led by Justice Aminuddin Khan heard the appeal of the federal government regarding the SJC proceedings against the retired or resigned judges of the Supreme Court.\n\nAmicus curie Faisal Siddiqui argued that if the Supreme Court Practice and Procedure Act were implemented from October 11, instead of April 21, this appeal could not be heard. However, Justice Khan told the lawyer that he should argue on the main case, rather than on appeal\u2019s admissibility.\n\nSiddiqui replied that he only wanted to draw the court\u2019s attention that the provision of the Supreme Court Practice and Procedure Act about retrospective application had been declared null and void.\nHe said that ordinary laws did not apply to judges. He argued that action could be taken if there were allegations of corruption against a judge. However, he added that SJC jurisdiction ceased with the retirement of the judge.\n\nJustice Khan asked the question whether that SJC process ended with the judge's retirement. Justice Mandokhel said if he committed a crime as a judge, would his resignation clear him of all the crimes.\nSitting on the bench, Justice Irfan Saadat said that the SJC had disposed of the proceedings against a former chief justice. He then asked the question whether the proceedings could be reopened if the SJC had already given its opinion once.\n\nJustice Mandokhel asked whether chief justice could hold the SJC hostage or could he hear a complaint against himself in the SJC? Siddiqui replied that as per rules, the judge who faced complaint should recuse himself from the SJC proceedings.\n\nSiddiqui further told the bench that inquiry rules were for the sitting judges only. Also sitting on the bench, Justice Mussarat Hilali remarked that the inquiry rules were silent regarding a judge against whom the proceedings were pending.\n\nSiddiqui further said that no one stopped institutions like the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) or other anti-corruption institutions from corruption investigations against the judges.\n\nJustice Mandokhel remarked that if any institution started proceedings against the judges, would it not put the judges in fear. Siddiqui said that the government could amend the Presidential Order, 1987, for withdrawing the pension and benefits for the judge.\n\nLater, another amicus curie Moiz Jafari started his arguments, saying that if the ordinary laws were applied to judges, the independence of the judiciary would be affected. He added that judges would be under constant fear that the FIA or the NAB might take action against them.\n\nHe stressed that any action against judges could be recommended by the SJC otherwise, if the general rules were applied to the judges, every one of them would be sitting before a police inspector on the next day of his retirement.\n\nJafari made a point that after the resignation or retirement of a judge, the SJC\u2019s recommendation for the removal of the judge became ineffective.\n\nHowever, another amicus curie Akram Shaikh argued that once the SJC started its proceedings against a judge, it could not end.\n\nMisconduct of a judge and his ability not to be a judge were two different things, Shaikh said, adding that the termination of the proceedings upon the resignation of judge would give the impression that the SJC was dependent on the will of the judge.\n\n"

        },
        "Details": {
            "Text": "The upper house of parliament has rejected a bill seeking public execution of sex offenders and rapists as a deterrent against such heinous crimes.\n\nSenator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan of the JI introduced the bill during the Senate's farewell session, chaired by Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani on Monday.\n\nDefending the bill, Senator Khan referred to a report stating that 1,122 cases of rape were reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) province alone in the last five years.\n\nHe stated that following these incidents, the police arrested 581 individuals, of whom 494 were acquitted and only 87 were convicted. He added that 341 of the suspects were booked for raping women, but only 23 were sentenced.\n\nSenator Mushtaq mentioned that 152 people accused of raping children were acquitted, while courts sentenced only 64 of them. \u201cAccording to one report, in the first six months of 2023, 12 children were targeted for sexual assault every month,\u201d he said.\n\nHe proposed, \"Let just four such public executions be held, and this crime will end. Don't be afraid of America and Europe; strict punishments are necessary to control crime.\"\n\nSenator Kamil Ali Agha of the PML-Q supported the bill, citing the practice in America where authorities release videos of lethal injections being administered to convicts.\n\n\u201cIn Saudi Arabia, public executions are carried out. If we are Muslims, our stance should be correct. What is happening in the world is not important; what Islam says is important.\"\n\nSenator Humayun Mohmand of the PTI also voiced support for public hanging of rape convicts. \"In countries where public executions are carried out, crime rates are low. Where hands are cut off, theft is also minimal,\" he said.\n\nPPP\u2019s Senator Sherry Rehman opposed the bill, stating that public hanging spreads barbarism.\nShe mentioned that the PPP had opposed the death penalty for rape and emphasized the need for improving policing rather than focusing solely on death penalty laws.\n\n\u201cPakistan ranks fifth in the world in terms of the death penalty. Public hanging does not suit a society of the 21st century. Public hanging will not stop crime,\u201d she said.\n\nSenator Irfan Siddiqui of the PML-N also opposed the bill regarding public hanging, saying that hanging should be confined to the gallows. PML-N\u2019s Senator Ishaq Dar said since the death penalty is already part of the law, they are against public hanging.\n\nInterestingly, Barrister Ali Zafar, who also belongs to the PTI, opposed the bill.\n\n\u201cWe support the current law which includes the death penalty. However, we oppose public hanging. Instead of public executions and hangings on the streets, efforts should be made to improve the justice system,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani conducted a vote on the bill, 14 members voted in favor, while 24 members voted against it. Consequently, the chairman rejected the motion to present the bill for approval.\n\n"

        },
        "Details": {
            "Text": "Despite the suspension of notification regarding the victory of three MNAs by the Islamabad High Court, the final fate of the alleged election-rigging disputes are likely to be decided by the election tribunals, which is a time-consuming process.\n\nHowever, the current week is very significant as either the superior judiciary or the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) will look into the matter or the matter will be referred to the election tribunals for trial.\nThe PTI candidates are trying to obtain relief either from the ECP through summary proceedings or the superior courts.\n\nThe ECP will take up the PTI candidates\u2019 complaints today (Tuesday) against the issuance of final results without considering the Form-45 results given by the presiding officers.\n\nThe IHC division bench led by Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb will resume the hearing on election matters on Wednesday.\n\nThe PTI lawyers are hoping for some relief from this bench. However, PTI founder Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, mistrust IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq.\n\nThe PTI has an advantage that some lawyers who contested the elections are aggrieved by the final results. Now, they are approaching every legal forum for relief though they have no support from both the superior bars \u2013 Pakistan Bar Council and Supreme Court Bar Association. However, it is being witnessed that the PTI has no one policy to challenge the election results.\n\nA PTI lawyer agreed that the aggrieved candidates should have approached the Supreme Court on this controversy. However, a senior lawyer believes that final adjudication of election disputes by the superior courts will change the settled law and also create grave complications.\n\nHe believes that the apex court should give a strict timeline to the election tribunals for final decisions of election petitions. He expressed apprehension that if the superior courts intervene, then every losing candidate will want the same treatment.\n\nThe sanctity of ballot is likely to be undermined, he added. However, the PTI lawyer disagreed with the contention, saying that if the SC allows this election fraud, then there will be serious implications on democracy.\n\nThis bad precedent of election rigging through issuance of Form-47 will be remembered for decades and it will be misused in the election process every time, he added.\n\nThe PTI lawyer also states that adjudication of election tribunal is a time-consuming process.\n\nEven if the tribunal de-seats any candidate, then he may get a stay order from the apex court.\nThere is a need that the SC should form an inquiry commission to probe the allegations of alleged systematic rigging in the elections, he added.\n\nHafiz Hussain Khokhar advocate has said that the ECP does have jurisdiction under Section 9 read with other provisions relating to all corrupt practices regarding the election matters and can pass any order. However, when the election tribunals have been notified under Section 140 of the Elections Act 2017 for the entertainment and adjudication of election petitions, then no court, including the high courts, can exercise their jurisdiction relating to the election matter of a particular constituency or many constituencies in view of bar contained in Article 225 of the Constitution where it has been described that all election disputes will be decided by tribunals and this legal proposition in such a way has been many times decided by the SC and different high courts through their various judgments.\n\nHe also said that generally, the high court declines from interfering in constitutional jurisdiction relating to post-election matters or corrupt election practices, and this has been evident from the recent orders of the high court where all these types of applications filed in writ jurisdiction after this general election were forwarded to the ECP to be decided in accordance with law.\n\nA three-judge bench of the apex court led by Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa will take up ex-military officer Ali Khan's petition on Wednesday, which seeks a declaration that the February 8 elections were rigged, urging for a fresh round.\n\nThe PTI has disadvantage that all state institutions are on the same page regarding major issues.\nAlthough the petitioner has requested for withdrawal of the petition, the bench is determined to decide it on merit.\n\nThe SC has ordered to serve notice on the petitioner through the defence ministry or the SHO concerned.\n\nJustice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah in ex-army chief Gen (retd) Qamar Javed Bajwa job extension case had noted that a public interest litigation (PIL) can only be withdrawn with the permission of the court.\n\nThis is because it does not raise a personal issue limited to the petitioner; it is not a dominis litis (the person to whom a suit belongs) that would give a right to the petitioner to withdraw it as a matter of choice. \u201cIn granting the permission (to withdraw) the Court would be guided by considerations of public interest and would also ensure that it does not result in the abuse of the process of law.\n\n\u201cCourts must guard against possibilities of such litigants settling the matters out of Court to their advantage and then seeking withdrawal of the case.\n\n\u201cSometimes withdrawal of a public interest litigation, for oblique ends, can be used to the detriment of the public interest agitated therein. The Court has to be cautious not to fall prey to such oblique motives. The proceedings in public interest litigation are inquisitorial in nature and, therefore, the request for withdrawal of such litigation must always be weighed in the light of the question of public importance raised in it.\n\n\u201cA petitioner initiating public interest litigation is, therefore, not entitled to withdraw the petition at his sweet will. The Court, however, may permit withdrawal of such litigation on considering the nature of the matter agitated therein and ensuring that it does not involve abuse of the process of law,\", the detailed judgement authored by Justice Shah said.\n\n"

Such attacks are designed to collect online banking credentials and other sensitive information from infected machines.\nResearchers also reported an increase of 35% in trojan attacks that disguise themselves as legitimate computer programmes but are used to run malicious code by cyber criminals.\nIn addition, ransomware attacks designed to encrypt a victim\u2019s data, files, or system, making them accessible in exchange for a payment, increased by 24%.\nAlso, the researchers reported attacks using spyware rose by 36%, such attacks are malicious software that enters a user\u2019s computer, gathers data from the device and user, and sends it to third parties without their consent.\n\u201cBeing an emerging country and accepting digital transformation at a good pace, Pakistan has a very important role to play in Asia\u201d, the statement added.\nAs the cybersecurity landscape evolves, cyber threats continue to become diverse and sophisticated.\nThis trend is particularly evident due to the emergence of advanced technologies like AI and the escalating geopolitical and economic turbulence within the META region.\nMETA Research Center Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT) Director Amin Hasbini stated that these factors collectively contribute to the surge in cybercrime and the heightened complexity of cyberattacks.\nAccording to Kaspersky\u2019s analysis, the cybersecurity threat landscape in the META region has fluctuated significantly.\nIn the region, Turkey saw the highest number of users affected by online threats \u2013 41.8%, followed by Kenya 39.2%, Qatar 38.8% and South Africa 35%.\n"

            "Text": "The inclement weather in the northern regions of the country wreaked havoc for the second consecutive day on Monday, claiming the lives of over four people and leaving nine others injured.\n\nThe severe weather conditions led to the suspension of electricity supply in numerous areas of the province, with casualties occurring due to roof collapses in Swat, Lower Dir, Upper Dir, Lower Kurram, and Mardan.\n\nThe second day of relentless rain and snowfall on Monday left a trail of disruptions, power outages, and tragic incidents across Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan, and upper areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\nTourists found themselves stranded as their vehicles got stuck in the aftermath of heavy snowfall in popular destinations such as Galyat, Nathia Gali, Dunga Gali, Thandiani, and Ayubiya.\n\nElectricity supply was abruptly halted, while the Meteorological Department warned of more snowfall in the next 24 hours.\n\nIn Abbottabad and surrounding areas, three consecutive days of non-stop rain have been recorded, leading to a suspension of business activities. Meanwhile, the upper regions, including Galyat and Thandiani, witnessed over two feet of snowfall, causing the closure of the main Murree Road for all vehicular traffic due to heavy snow and landslides.\n\nDirector-General of Galiyat Development Authority (GDA), Shah Rukh Ali Khan, has instructed the deployment of staff with heavy machinery to clear the snow and ensure the safety of the roads.\nEfforts are underway to clear the roads leading to Nathiagali and Murree, with the combined resources of GDA and C&W.\n\nWidespread damage was caused by the storm, with trees, billboards, signboards, and electric wires and poles collapsing in various locations.\n\nIn Murree, powerful winds resulted in the roofs of numerous houses being blown off.\nThe disruption extended to the electrical infrastructure, as several feeders tripped, leading to the suspension of electricity supply in most areas. The continuous rain has heightened the risk of landslides in affected regions.\n\nAuthorities in Murree district, along with relevant institutions, have been put on high alert in response to the unfolding situation.\n\nSimilarly, the plains and upper regions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa grappled with the aftermath of continuous snowfall and rains for the second consecutive day, causing widespread disruptions and tragic incidents.\n\nAs rain and snowfall persisted, a total of three hundred and six feeders tripped in different areas, leaving most regions without electricity for over fourteen hours.\n\nCompounding the crisis on Monday, 306 feeders tripped across different areas of the province due to the rain, leading to electricity outages lasting more than fourteen hours in many regions.\n\nThe accumulation of water on major highways in Peshawar caused severe problems for commuters, with Peshawar's key commercial area, University Road, resembling a flood scene. Despite the cessation of rains, traffic remained gridlocked for hours.\n\nIn the low-lying areas of Peshawar, residences near rivers and canals faced water ingress. Local residents rallied to assist in pumping water out of affected houses, demonstrating a community response to the crisis.\n\n"

            "Text": "The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has once again summoned the heads of the Intelligence Bureau (IB), the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), and the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) in a case related to the illegal recording of private telephonic conversations.\nAn IHC bench comprising Justice Babar Sattar issued this order on Monday as it resumed hearing the petitions filed by Najam-us-Saqib, son of former Chief Justice of Pakistan Saqib Nisar, and Bushra Bibi, the wife of former prime minister Imran Khan in the wake of the leaking of their alleged telephone calls.\nThe FIA director-general, Waqar Uddin Syed, appeared in court along with a representative of the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ), Asif Bashir Chaudhry.\nAt the last hearing of the case, the court had also summoned the director-general of the IB and the chairmen of the PTA and the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA). However, the officials did not appear in court.\nAngered by their absence, Justice Sattar asked the state law officer why the court should not issue their arrest warrants. \u201cHow did they decide themselves that they couldn't appear in court?\u201d he asked.\nThe government lawyer informed the bench that the IB director-general was unwell, but the IB\u2019s deputy dg was present in court. The IHC noted that the officers who are unwell should present their medical reports at the next hearing.\nLater, the judge asked the FIA director-general to appear in court at the next hearing and explain how surveillance and recording of phone calls take place.\n\u201cThe director-general of the IB must inform us who can conduct surveillance on the citizens of Pakistan and whether the state of Pakistan has the capability to remain secure from illegal surveillance.\n\u201cThe PTA chairman should also brief us on the steps that can be taken to secure the calls and data of mobile phone users,\u201d Justice Sattar added. The court later adjourned till the first week of March.\nIn a reply submitted on Dec 19, 2023, the Federal Ministry of Defence had told the IHC that only a social media platform can tell which user has uploaded a particular content\u2014audio, video, or picture\u2014on it.\nThe ministry had highlighted that only the FIA has access and power to request such information from these platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, and X.\n\u201cUnder [Pakistan Electronic Crime Act] PECA, 2016, FIA Cyber Crime Wing is [the] designated agency for [curbing] cybercrimes.\n\u201cUnder Section 35 of PECA, the FIA has power to access or demand any information in readable and comprehensive format or plain version from service providers [social media platforms]. [The] court may direct [the] FIA cybercrime wing to further investigate the matter and get the details,\u201d it said.\nThe report stated that various tools are available on smartphones to record phone conversations.\n\u201cThese tools are cheap and easily available to everyone. Moreover, various groups provide paid services under which they claim to steal data from devices through various means,\u201d it added.\nThe report noted that a caller can also record his or her phone conversation with someone, and that recorded call can get leaked or hacked.\nIt said with the advancement in artificial intelligence, it is now possible through various available tools to alter one\u2019s voice or change the content of any conversation. \u201cThese tools can be used to mimic someone,\u201d it added.\n"

        },
        "Details": {
            "Text": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday delved into intricacies of the presidential reference about the death penalty awarded to former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto more than four decades ago, asking questions about the historical and contemporary legal frameworks.\nDuring a hearing of the reference, Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa, Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, and Justice Jamal Mandokhel raised several law points, concerning institutional action and individual initiative in enforcing martial law, importance of assessing cases on a contextual basis and the procedural matters.\nHeading a nine-member bench, Chief Justice Isa questioned whether the commencement of legal proceedings against Bhutto during the martial law period could be disregarded.\nHe observed that a martial law was not declared by the military as an institution rather it was an individual\u2019s initiative.\nPrompting a broader contemplation of the role of institutions in drawing boundaries within the legal landscape, he said: \u201cWe are looking at the past but not considering the future. Shouldn\u2019t institutions also draw the line?\u201d\nJustice Mansoor remarked that such cases might come up in the future, therefore, instead of an opinion on the reference, the bench should look at the cases when they arose.\nThe chief justice remarked that the court\u2019s focus was on the constitutional aspect, adding that a case could not be revised twice.\nJustice Mansoor remarked that the real question in this case was whether or not the proper process was followed in the court proceedings.\nHowever, Justice Mandokhel said that the case had attained finality, therefore, the question in the reference could be decided in an appeal.\nThe chief justice asked amicus curie Makhdoom Ali Khan, was there a question of bias or an admission of wrongdoing in this case. Makhdoom replied that a judge, who sat on the apex court bench on Bhutto\u2019s appeal, had said in an interview that there was pressure on them.\nRead more: PPP submits written reply in Bhutto case to SC\nHowever, the chief justice pointed out that the judge did not say that he was biased.\nHe added that if a judge could not withstand pressure, he should leave the bench.\nFurther, he continued, a person might raise the issue of prejudice, but others might not have the same opinion.\nThe chief justice also enquired about a judge\u2019s remarks about a cat in the Bhutto case.\nMakhdoom said that Justice Qaiser Khan had once said that \u201ceven a cat cannot be hanged\u201d, on the basis of the evidence in the Bhutto case and that the manner in which Bhutto\u2019s case was decided had never happened before.\nMakhdoom said that Bhutto\u2019s case bench member Naseem Hasan Shah had dilated on the differences between Bhutto and Justice Molvi Mushtaq.\nNaseem had said that Mushtaq was unhappy with Bhutto for ignoring eight senior judges and appointing Justice Aslam Riaz as the chief justice.\nThe chief justice said that Naseem was talking about other judges. He then asked where it was stated that he was under pressure to take a decision.\nMakhdoom replied that it was not specific to this case but in the overall context.\nNaseem \u2013 who retired as the chief justice of Pakistan \u2013 had also said that the court could have given the benefit of the doubt, but it did not because of its weakness and that the then defence counsel Yahya Bakhtiar had angered the judges, Makhdoom said.\nHe added that Naseem had said in an interview that Bhutto\u2019s lawyer did not argue for reducing the sentence and had angered the judges.\nThe chief justice remarked that if one got angry, then he could have stopped hearing the case, adding that the client should not be punished for the lawyer\u2019s conduct.\nThe chief justice said Bhutto\u2019s case was the first in the history of Pakistan where the trial took place at a high court, which consequently, took away the right to appeal.\nHe also referred to the Supreme Court\u2019s 4-3 ruling that upheld Bhutto\u2019s hanging. \u201cCan death penalty be given with a ratio of 4-3.\u201d\nJustice Mansoor said that there was only one interview related to pressure on the judges.\nHe asked whether those, who were accused of partiality, should also be heard.\nHe pointed out that those who disagreed with the decision had to leave the country.\nLater, the court ordered that as Makhdoom had given gave his arguments, his written statement be submitted. It added that another amicus curie Khalid Javed Khan had made his written submission and he could give his oral arguments at the next hearing.\nThe court said that heirs of the late Bhutto would also be heard, including Bilawal Bhutto Zardari\u2019s lawyers Farooq Naek, Raza Rabbani, and Zahid Ibrahim.\nThe court said that Ahmad Raza Kasuri, would also be heard.\n"

After his request was denied, the judge withdrew his application on January 27, stating that he was now well and able to perform his duties.\n\nOn January 28, Judge Bashir sentenced former prime minister Imran Khan and his spouse, Bushra Bibi, to 14 years in prison for misusing the state\u2019s gift repository during the former\u2019s term as PM. On February 3, the judge once again applied for leave until his retirement on medical grounds.\n\nJudge Bashir was adjudicating a number of high-profile cases, including the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) references filed against former Imran Khan and his wife for their alleged involvement in a \u00a3190m scandal.\n\nThe judge was also hearing another Toshakhana reference involving former prime ministers Nawaz Sharif and Yousuf Raza Gillani, as well as former president Asif Ali Zardari as accused.\n\nHe was also presiding over the hearing of a fake account case registered against Zardari and a NAB reference against former PM Shahid Khaqan Abbasi.\n\nAppointed in 2012 during the tenure of then-PM Gilani, the judge served an unusually long term. Although accountability court judges are typically appointed for three years, Judge Bashir served in the NAB court for eleven years.\n\n"

            "Text": "Foreign agricultural scientists have stressed the need for collaboration to enhance work on climate resilient, high yielding and fortified varieties of crops to ensure food and nutrition security amid the challenges of increasing population and inadequate productivity. \nAddressing the inaugural session of a two-day international conference hosted by the University of Agriculture Faisalabad (UAF), Vice Chancellor Dr Iqrar Ahmad Khan said there was a huge gap between the productivity of progressive and traditional farmers. \n\u201cWe have to promote modern trends in order to raise the per acre productivity,\u201c he added.\nHe said the country imported wheat, whereas 10 per cent in the average productivity could make it self-sufficient. \nHe said the UAF was developing climate-resilient wheat varieties in collaboration with the Washington State University.\nThe US Kansas State University Wheat Genetics Resources Centre\u2019s Founding Director Dr Bikram Singh Gill called for utilising plant breeding to cope with climate changes. \nHe said that centre's gene bank, which maintains more than 5,000 wheat genetics stocks, offers opportunities for researchers to quickly improve crop yield, quality and food security.\nScientist Dr Kulvinder Singh Gill from the Washington State University said the world's record of maximum wheat production is 17 tonnes per hectare, while the average production is limited to three tonnes. The maximum yield of rice is 22 tonnes and the average only four tonnes.\n\nRead\u00a0Climate change puts food security at risk\nHe said that in his project, high yielding varieties of heat tolerant germplasm from the heat stressed areas were collected and their field trials had been conducted in Pakistan, India, Nepal and Egypt. \nHe said field trials of new varieties were also being carried out at the UAF, which were expected to yield positive results.\nDr Richard Trerthowan from Sydney University briefed the participants about achieving higher yields of wheat. \nHe said a hybrid variety with enhanced yield requires fewer inputs\nand produces more nutritious grain.\nDr Alex Johnson from\nthe University of Melbourne said two billion people in the world are suffering from iron deficiency, whereas deficiency of zinc and other essential nutrients is also widespread. \nHe said he was collaborating with UAF researchers to explore the potential of genetically modified wheat. \nIslamic Organisation for Food Security\u2019s Programme and Projects Director Dr Zulfiqar Ali said only seven of the 57 OIC countries are meeting the food security goals. \nIn 2019, the OIC\ncountries were facing a food deficit worth $65 billion, while low hanging food worth $300 billion went waste due to lack of processing and other factors. \nAn expert from Tajikistan also attended the conference.\n"

Khaskheli, who hails from Thatta, accompanied his brother to the public hospital for treatment along with two women of the family. \u201cWe do not have enough money to rent a hotel.

The same directive extends to IOs of the Sindh police. The SHC's registrar has been tasked with circulating the order to all district and session judges for compliance by magistrates, with a copy sent to the IGP Sindh.\n"

            "Text": "Islamabad has engaged Tehran by committing to complete the first phase of the 80-kilometer Iran-Pakistan (IP) gas pipeline project within Pakistan\u2019s territory to avoid a looming $18 billion penalty. According to reports, Iran has granted an extension in the deadline of the IP gas pipeline project by 180 days until September 2024.\nTehran has granted this extension in a bid to avoid litigation in international court. Experts suggest that Pakistan and Iran could face strained diplomatic relations if Iran files a case against Pakistan in an international court. Iran could pursue legal action to safeguard its rights concerning the pipeline project.\nNow, Pakistan has decided to proceed with the construction of the IP gas pipeline within its borders to satisfy Tehran, despite the sanctions imposed by the United States.\nSources indicate that the Petroleum division is seeking approval from the cabinet to commence work on the IP gas pipeline project in Pakistan. Additionally, the Board of Gas Infrastructure Development Cess (GIDC) has been directed to expedite the financing process for the project.\nRecently, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) referred a case of fertiliser manufacturers to the Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) to investigate the unjustified increase in urea prices. The caretaker government also withdrew the subsidy on feedstock provided to fertiliser manufacturers.\nSources reveal that the government is displeased with these manufacturers who have accumulated billions of rupees from farmers under the guise of GIDC, which was intended for mega pipeline projects like IP, Turkmenistan\u2013Afghanistan\u2013Pakistan\u2013India (TAPI), and Liquefied natural gas (LNG) pipelines. However, they failed to deposit the money into the national exchequer and obtained stay orders from various courts, refusing to pay despite the Supreme Court\u2019s decision.\nCurrently, the government requires funds from the GIDC collection, which has amounted to over Rs350 billion. However, this money has been allocated to projects like the orange train and has not been utilised for pipeline projects.\nIndustrialists such as fertiliser manufacturers have refused to pay over Rs450 billion. During the tenure of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaaf (PTI) government, a 50% amount was waived off, but the Supreme Court directed payments in instalments. Nevertheless, the fertiliser manufacturers did not comply and obtained stay orders from lower courts.\n\nRead Iran's main gas pipeline hit by sabotage, oil minister says\nIran claims to have already spent $2 billion to complete its part of the pipeline within its territory. In contrast, Pakistan has not even commenced construction.\nPreviously, constructing the 80km portion of the IP pipeline project was part of the LNG Gwadar Pipeline project, intended to connect Gwadar with other parts of the country. It was agreed that Pakistan could construct this portion if relations between Tehran and Washington normalised and Pakistan was granted a waiver.\nHowever, due to mounting pressure from Iran, Pakistan has now opted to build a portion of the IP gas pipeline project within its territory.\nEarlier, under pressure from Saudi Arabia, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) government decided to shelve the LNG Gwadar Pipeline. At that time, Pakistan considered constructing the 80-kilometer pipeline if the situation between the US and Iran stabilised.\nIn 2017, Saudi Arabia engaged in a diplomatic dispute with Qatar, pressuring Sharif\u2019s government to abandon both the Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline and the LNG contract with Qatar. Pakistan, however, only shelved the LNG Gwadar deal, which was deemed part of the IP gas pipeline project, and continued the LNG deal with Qatar.\nThe petroleum secretary previously informed the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) that Pakistan faced the threat of $18 billion in claims due to the failure to commence construction on the IP project.\nHistorically, Pakistan and Iran have enjoyed good relations, particularly during the reign of the Pakistan People\u2019s Party (PPP). During Asif Ali Zardari\u2019s presidency, both countries signed a Gas Sales Purchase Agreement (GSPA), binding Pakistan to commence construction on the IP project. In the past, Pakistan imported Iranian oil \u2013 the supply, however, ceased in 2010 when Pakistani refineries failed to make payments. Although payment was never a significant issue between the two nations \u2013 both had worked out currency swaps and barter trade arrangements \u2013 experts believe the primary reason for the fallout was the US\u2019s reluctance to show flexibility regarding oil and gas trade between Pakistan and Iran.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 20th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

        "Details": {
            "Text": "The Pakistan Muslim League-N has not yet finalised its choice for a new finance minister, as it faces a hard decision between appointing the highly experienced Ishaq Dar as the finance minister and bringing in a new face at one of the most critical economic junctures.\nThe party\u2019s dilemma is that if it decides to replace Dar, it may end up selecting a technocrat, which would deprive it of the claim of having an experienced economic team. The PML-N has not groomed second-tier economic leadership, and without Dar, it might end up relying on technocrats like the Pakistan People\u2019s Party (PPP) and the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).\nSources in the PML-N told The Express Tribune that the party is also exploring other options, including considering the names of two bankers. They said that neither Dar nor anyone else has yet been finalised. However, a strong camp in the PML-N is not in favour of appointing Dar to the post for the fifth time, they added. However, the final decision would be made by former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who has not yet to share his thoughts about his choice for the position. Dar\u2019s name cannot be ruled out until Sharif shares his thoughts, they added.\nDar has served as finance minister four times and earned the reputation of a \u2018tough negotiator\u2019 with the International Monetary Fund. His relations with the IMF are now one of the reasons for the reconsideration of his appointment. However, Pakistan could not successfully complete the last $6.5 billion bailout package, and the blame has been placed squarely on Dar for his handling of the programme. In his speech at the Senate Standing Committee on Finance on June 16th, 2023, the former finance minister said that geopolitics was behind the stalled loan programme, as global institutions wanted Pakistan to default like Sri Lanka and enter negotiations.\nThe IMF has publicly denied this, while behind closed doors, the US had also complained about Dar\u2019s statement. Sources said that in one of the meetings after Dar\u2019s statement, US Ambassador Donald Blome had explained to Dar that his country did not have any influence on the IMF \u2013 a stance that the then finance minister did not agree with. The current IMF deal was finalised after the intervention of the then-PM Shehbaz Sharif.\nWhere Dar is blamed for the failure of the last programme, he has also been credited with completing the 2013-16 IMF programme.\nThe sources said that relations with the International Financial Institutions (IFIs) and foreign powers, and the future role of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), are the key considerations for selecting the nominee for the slot of finance minister.\n\nRead Deadlock persists as fifth PML-N, PPP meeting ends inconclusively\nHowever, criteria like clarity on strategic relations, political weight, and experience in managing the economy have not been given due weight at this time, according to party insiders.\nIn case Dar\u2019s name is not chosen and the party decides to appoint a politician, former Minister for Economic Affairs Sardar Ayaz Sadiq and former Power Minister Khawaja Mohammad Asif could be possible replacements. Former Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal might not be keen on taking the responsibility. The PML-N\u2019s choices for appointing a politician as finance minister are limited after the exit of Miftah Ismail and Shahid Khaqan Abbasi.\nNewly elected Member of the National Assembly Bilal Kyani could either be appointed as the Minister of State for Finance in the centre, or he might be the next finance advisor to the chief minister of Punjab. The PPP has publicly opposed Dar\u2019s candidacy, but its opposition does not carry weight until the party formally joins the next cabinet. The names of Muhammad Aurangzeb, the incumbent President of the Habib Bank Limited (HBL), and Sultan Ali Alana, the chairman of the HBL board, are also being considered for the position, according to some party insiders.\nAurangzeb is considered close to Shehbaz Sharif. Sultan Alana\u2019s name had also been considered for the position of the caretaker finance minister, but then Dr Shamshad Akhtar\u2019s name was finalised. The next finance minister\u2019s first task will be to sit with the IMF, get the last loan tranche of $1.2 billion, and at the same time kick-start negotiations for a new long-term deal. Any inexperienced appointee might find it difficult to sit across the table and negotiate a deal that strikes a balance between economic stabilisation and people\u2019s growing miseries.\nOne of the considerations for the next IMF programme might be the restructuring of unsustainable public debt. Bringing in a banker as finance minister might raise questions about conflicts of interest. The sources said that the establishment didn\u2019t seem keen on importing a finance Minister this time, particularly after the experience of appointing a central banker from abroad.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 20th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

He highlighted that this negligence led to a recent Rs4.567 per unit cost hike in fuel prices, approved by NEPRA for December 2023 bills.\n\nIn a statement issued on Monday evening, Siddiqui lamented the decrease in renewable energy production in 2023 compared to 2022 figures. He condemned the current caretaker administration\u2019s incompetence, noting that consumers would bear the brunt of this increase in fuel prices, reflected in their February bills following NEPRA's approval.\n\nSiddiqui urged for the rehabilitation of closed powerhouses and underscored the importance of investing in research and advanced technology to meet energy production needs. Specifically, he proposed utilising locally produced coal to operate the 1,300MW Jamshoro coal powerhouse. Additionally, Siddiqui underscored the necessity of enhancing the efficiency of power distribution companies.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 20th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

The court said that regardless of political government, the committee would provide answers regarding the missing persons.\nIHC Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani took up the matter for hearing.\nExpressing concern over the non-recovery of the missing Baloch students and the absence of the prime minister, the court once again summoned the caretaker premier for February 28.\nAttorney General Mansoor Usman Awan cited the caretaker prime minister's unavailability due to engagements in Karachi. Justice Kayani emphasised the importance of accountability, stating that appearing in court was not a matter of insult for the prime minister; rather, he was answerable.\nThe court said that a committee was being formed of the same agencies, which had been facing allegations relating to the missing persons issue. It added that regardless of the government, or the new government, this committee would provide the answers.\nAdditionally, the court announced stringent measures, stating that in any future cases of disappearance from within Islamabad's jurisdiction, a case would be filed against the Inspector General (IG) of police, interior secretary, and the in-charge of the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD).\nAttorney General Awan informed the court that eight students were still missing. The judge said that the prime minister was called because he was answerable to the court. He added that here nobody was above the law.\nThe court expressed dismay over the failure in the recovery of all missing individuals even after the lapse of two years. Whether institutions were responsible for their disappearance; or they ran away on their own, or they were kidnapped, in either case it was the failure of the state institutions, he added.\nThe attorney general requested the court for some time so that the new government could make a policy. The court said that three governments in the past had not been able to do anything to recover the missing Baloch students.\nIman Mazari Advocate said that during the last few months more students were forcibly disappeared, stressing that the change of government would not help. Justice Kayani said that the committee had been formed which would give answers, regardless of which government was in office.\nThe judge said that some institutions had been granted exemptions, which should not be given to them. He warned that the deputy commissioner of Islamabad misused Maintenance of Public Order (MPO)and now, after the court decision, he was facing the contempt case.\nLawyer Sher Afzal Marwat told the court that his house was raided at 2am by those who were wearing police uniforms and masks.\nJustice Kayani said that Marwat was a member of the National Assembly (MNA) as well as a lawyer. If this could happen to an assembly member here in Islamabad, imagine, what could be happening to the common people in Balochistan. If the state institutions did this, who would protect the citizens from thieves and robbers, he asked.\nIn a stark warning to the official, the judge said that they should be afraid of the time when someone stood up against the law enforcement personnel and shoot them in resistance.\n"

Whether acknowledged or not, this choice stands in favour of hope and democracy, supporting the PTI and Imran Khan.\"\nHe recounted the challenges faced by the PTI, including harassment with the anticipation that the supporters wouldn't turn out to vote.\nZafar highlighted raids on the homes of the PTI candidates, obstructions in filing nomination papers, and the prevention of party gatherings leading up to the polls.\nHe lamented the last-minute snatching of the party's symbol to create confusion among voters, labelling these events as \"pre-poll rigging\".\nBarrister Zafar criticised the timing of Imran's convictions in various cases just days before the polls, referring to it as a \"witch hunt\", and warned of the adverse effects on the country's politics.\n\u201cDespite all this, the nation came out and voted for the PTI on Feb 8.

Our mandate has been stolen and if it is not returned, then it will not stay in anyone\u2019s hands.\n\u201cA government without legitimacy and mandate will only fail,\u201d he added.\nMeanwhile, PTI Senator Walid Iqbal noted that the word \u201celection\u201d in Pakistan\u2019s Constitution meant that it was not the mere casting or counting of votes but was rather \u201can entire process\u201d.\n\u201cBut whatever happened throughout this process \u2014 which includes snatching of nomination papers, depriving a party of its electoral symbol, and raids \u2014 proves that the electoral process was tainted,\u201d he claimed.\nHe lamented the suspension of mobile and internet services, saying that the outage was condemned across the world.\n\u201cThe caretakers and the ECP will have to prove that there was no malice in this suspension,\u201d the senator demanded.\nIqbal highlighted that the CEC had assured the nation that provisional results, on the basis of Form-45, would be announced by midnight.\n\u201cBut this did not happen, everything is in front of us,\u201d he pointed out.\nMeanwhile, PML-N Senator Irfan Siddiqui acknowledged the imperfections in Pakistan's electoral history, noting that this issue had persisted for several decades.\nHe pointed out that none of the democratically elected governments had been allowed to complete their tenure.\n\"I agree with my colleagues that the history of our elections is far from perfect. However, why are we not discussing the 2018 polls?\" the senator questioned. \"The events in the 2018 general elections constitute a dark chapter in our country's history. Much transpired back then, and perhaps similar events occurred this year as well. If so, it wasn't limited to Punjab or Balochistan; it occurred in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa too.\"\nSenator Siddiqui emphasised that the irregularities were widespread.\n\"If you experienced it, so did we,\" Siddiqui underscored.\nIn the meeting, Barrister Zafar introduced a resolution in the Senate calling for the issuance of a production order for PTI Senator Ijaz Chaudhry.\nThe resolution received signatures from 24 members representing various political parties.\nSubsequently, as the caretaker minister for human rights prepared to conclude the ongoing debate regarding alleged election rigging, PML-N\u2019s Senator Sadia Abbasi objected and pointed out the quorum.\n"

            "Text": "The dust of controversy-marred elections on Feb 8 finally seemed to settle to some extent as the PTI, in its efforts to form a government, announced on Monday that its independent candidates, who emerged victorious in the Centre, Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa would join the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC).\n\u201cOur candidates have submitted their affidavits with us and with their consent, today we are announcing that PTI-backed independents are joining the Sunni Ittehad Council,\u201d PTI leader Barrister Gohar said while addressing a news conference in the federal capital.\nHe was flanked by the party\u2019s chief organiser and nominee for premiership Omar Ayub Khan, Central Information Secretary Raoof Hasan, SIC Chairman Sahibzada Hamid Raza and Majlis Wahadat-e-Muslimeen (MWM) Chairman Allama Raja Nasir Abbas.\nGohar observed that the PTI-backed independent candidates had emerged victorious in all the provinces, with more than 30 million ballots cast in the party\u2019s favour. \u201cWe claim that the PTI has won 180 National Assembly seats. Our candidates will join Sunni Ittehad Council in national, Punjab and Khyber-Pakhunkhwa assemblies,\u201d he said.\nGohar elaborated that the PTI had reached a \"formal agreement\" with SIC, noting that the step had been taken to protect the reserved seats. \"There are 70 reserved seats in the National Assembly and 227 reserved seats in the country, and these seats are only provided to political parties,\" he said.\n\u201cHence, to protect our reserved seats and provide cover to our members, we have reached a formal agreement under which all our candidates have joined the SIC and we will present this documentation before the ECP.\u201d\nParties are allocated 70 reserved seats - 60 for women, 10 for non-Muslims - in proportion to the number of seats won. This completes the National Assembly's total 336 seats. Independents are not eligible for reserved seats.\nHe added that a request would be submitted to the ECP to allocate the reserved seats according to the party's strength.\nGohar stressed that Form 47 should have been made in accordance with Form 45. Forms 45 and 47 are the official documentation of the election results.\nAfter voting is completed and ballots are counted at a polling station, the presiding officer fills out Form 45 and submits it to the returning officer of the constituency. The returning officer then gathers and tallies results from Form 45 from every polling station in the constituency to determine the final results.\nMeanwhile, prior to official confirmation of final results, Form 47 documents the unconfirmed results in a constituency. This includes the number of votes polled in the constituency, a candidate-wise breakdown of votes, and the number of votes cancelled or rejected. Form 47 is prepared by tallying results obtained from Form 45s.\nOn election night, reports surfaced that candidates and their representatives were being denied Form 45 by the presiding officers with the PTI expressing concerns over the \u201cnon-provision of Form 45\u201d to its polling agents.\nGohar said PTI\u2019s seven to eight seats from Peshawar were rigged by the deputy commissioner and others, demanding that the \u201cengineering in polls\u201d be investigated as it was a matter of public mandate.\nHe said JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman was with the PTI in their struggle against rigging in polls.\nReferring to PTI founder Imran Khan, Gohar stated that the decision about the return of turncoats to the party could only be taken by prisoner number 804.\nIndependents join SIC\nAs the development unfolded, 50 of the 93 successful PTI-backed independent candidates who won the National Assembly seats in the general elections officially joined the SIC and submitted the party certificate along with affidavits to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).\nThe SIC chairman sent a letter to the polls supervisory body, urging it to issue a notification in this regard.\nMeanwhile, over 60 triumphant independent candidates from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have officially become members of the SIC. The recently elected assembly members have submitted their affidavits to the designated chief minister.\n"

However, it wants the PPPP to join the federal cabinet and take ownership of the decisions instead of just simply sitting on the treasury benches as silent spectators.\nOn Monday, both sides met behind closed doors and continued deliberating on pending issues for over three hours.\nBoth the sides are expected to meet again on Tuesday. The meeting, held at the residence of senior PML-N leader Senator Ishaq Dar at the Parliament Lodges in Islamabad, saw the participation of prominent figures from both the parties.\nThe PPP delegation comprised Murad Ali Shah, Qamar Zaman Kaira, Nadeem Afzal Chan and others.\nMeanwhile, the PML-N leadership met with the leaders of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) to seek their support for the formation of the federal government.\nIn a statement, the MQM-P spokesperson said that the party has sought a pledge from the PML-N on its three-point constitutional amendments to join the government.\nThe MQM-P\u2019s three constitutional amendments deal with local government autonomy.\nIn its manifesto, the party has shared the draft of the bill as well. It stated that it is imperative that in order to instill a truly representative and participatory democracy quintessentially, the local governments at grass root levels, throughout the country, are to be empowered politically, financially, and administratively, so that the fruits of democracy are extended for the benefit of the populace.\nIn the meeting on Monday, discussions on other issues, including creating a common strategy to deal with the challenges being faced, were discussed. Various other issues focusing on how to get the people of Pakistan, especially Sindh, out of the mire of problems were deliberated upon.\nRead more: PML-N, PPP fail to reach consensus on govt formation\nThe party statement said that it is the responsibility of all the parties to solve the problems faced by the country and to get out of the crises.\n\u201cGiving constitutional protection to the devolution of powers and resources at the grassroots level is the top priority of MQM Pakistan,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nHe said that the leaders of both the parties agreed to continue talks and meetings regarding the government formation.\nFollowing the PML-N and the MQM-P meeting, Sindh governor and MQM-P leader Kamran Tessori engaged in an informal dialogue with journalists, reiterating the parties\u2019 unified stance in navigating the complexities of government formation.\nReportedly, Tessori affirmed, \u201cWe stand united in the challenging task of government formation. The MQM-P has assured full support, and we anticipate the issuance of an official declaration later today.\u201d\nDespite multiple rounds of talks, a decision regarding the PPP\u2019s inclusion in the cabinet remained elusive. Optimism, however, persists within the PML-N circles, with sources expressing confidence that an agreement with the PPP will be reached soon.\nSpeaking informally to reporters after the meeting, PML-N leader Azam Nazir Tarar conveyed a positive trajectory in the ongoing discussions, asserting that talks with the PPP committee would resume the next morning.\n"

Then ministers should pass on the vision and mandate to the teams of the technocrats as they know their job well. The performance of the governments world over depends on the technocrats based on \u2018right person for the right job\u2019.\nSome expressed the notion that the IMF is not a villain, but a fiscal regulator.

The other issue is the politics of agitation that should come to an end.\nThey also talked of the public\u2019s role in discouraging any protest legislations that would serve vested interests of politicians.\nSpeaking at the webinar, political activist Dr Nasir Khilji said that all the stakeholders of the country have to take the responsibility of inclusive economic reforms and their true implementation.\nHe said that the reforms should include a comprehensive strategy to handle the budget deficit and reduce the nonproductive and operational costs. He added that Pakistan has to broaden its tax, wipe off subsidies and reduce the financial burden of bureaucracy that produces hurdles only.\nDr Khilji emphasised that major surgery is required for Pakistan\u2019s entire financial management and governance system. \u201cIt is not possible without having all the stakeholders on the same page. They have to come on the same page if they care about 250 million people,\u201d he said.\n\u201cPakistan is a library of recommendations but no implementation of any proposed frameworks,\u201d he further added.\n"

            "Text": "The Environment Protection Department (EPD) Punjab has found water waste in around 90% of industries substandard and 300 flour mills and the majority of pharmaceutical units without wastewater treatment plants in Rawalpindi district.\nIn the first phase, the EPD concluded the sampling and laboratory tests of wastewater from 67 major industries in the district.\nField officials are now starting to collect sewage samples from all industries, flour mills, and pharmaceutical companies in all six districts of Rawalpindi division after the presence of toxic chemicals in underground water and Soan River was confirmed in laboratory tests.\nThe department has decided to enforce the installation of wastewater treatment plants in all industries of the division.\nThis toxic water is not only harming the healthy soil, but it\u2019s also causing harm to the aquatic animals. The use of chemical-contaminated sewage water is further poisoning vegetables, fruits and crops.\nThe department has established that the flour mills in Rawalpindi district have been contaminating water for the last 20 to 40 years and causing illnesses.\nBeginning on March 1, the EPD has also approved the sampling of wastewater being released by pharmaceutical companies in the Rawalpindi district. It is revealed that wastewater treatment plants were not installed in the majority of pharmaceutical units, while those factories having these plants use them for demonstration purposes only.\nThe wastewater sampling of industries in the Attock district will be completed by Feb 29, while sampling of multiple industries in the districts of Chakwal, Talagang and Jhelum, which begins in the first week of March, will be completed by March 31.\n\nRead\u00a0KW&SB submits report on sewage treatment plants\nThe EPD will initiate legal action against the industries whose samples are found substandard and they fail to install sewage treatment plants. In the first phase, notices will be served to all factories and responses will be sought. Subsequently, if their answers are unsatisfactory, they [industrial units] will be served with final show-cause notices.\nCases will be further sent to the Punjab Environmental Tribunal. After hearing cases, the tribunal can impose a fine ranging from Rs100,000 to Rs1 million sealing the units or can impose both penalties.\nWhen contacted, senior research officer laboratory at the EPD, Amin Baig told The Express Tribune that the wastewater sampling of industries is in progress in Rawalpindi division. He said that the companies release substandard and hazardous chemical-mixed water into the Saon River, which then flows into other rivers.\nDue to the constant release of toxic chemicals into the water, it is becoming a threat to the aquatic life in the rivers, Amin, said, adding the same water is also used for irrigation purposes.\nHe said that the department would complete division-wide sampling by March 31 before pursuing stern legal action against the violators. The field staff of Rawalpindi district has been provided final reports for pursuing legal procedures, the official added.\nAmin said that this year the department would fully focus on the installation of wastewater treatment plants by the industries, and ensure that the discharge of water from factories is per environmental standards.\n"

            "Text": "Adding to the string of festivals that took place in the federal capital, the Mashion Bazaar came to a close on Feb 19, Sunday after hosting two days of vibrant activities for Islamabad\u2019s residents.\nThe Mashion Bazaar is a shopping festival featuring women-owned, home-based ventures or brands targeting women. This was the first time that the festival came to Islamabad as it was previously only held in Karachi and Lahore.\nThe line-up of stalls at the event included niche brands which mainly operate through social media engagement and sales. The items showcased at the event ranged from home decor and fashion accessories to skin care products. The event also had a dedicated food area with a variety of food vendors offering festival snacks.\nThe festival also included other activities such as fun photo op installations and a punching bag site that allowed visitors a go at releasing their stress.\nEach evening closed with musical performances by celebrated artists such as the musical band AUR, Taha G and Izzchughtai. The festival was a star-studded event as aside from the performing artists, many celebrities including Uzair Jaswal and Merub Ali were also spotted at the shopping fair.\n\nRead\u00a0Traders make windfall profits with new year shopping bonanza\nThe festival ran for two days with visitors flocking to the event even on the second day despite the persistent overcast and rainy weather. However, most festivalgoers seemed to gravitate towards the food section as the selection of items for sale at the bazaar was on the pricier side.\nTalking to The Express Tribune, a visitor, who identified herself as Sana, said: \u201cIt seems like an event for the elite since on top of the pricey entry tickets, the products are just too expensive and do not cater to the general public.\u201d\nAnother visitor, Yahya, on the other hand, found the festival to be \u201cthe best out of all food festivals until now since the atmosphere was very pleasant and the environment that they had set up was quite well-arranged.\u201d\nThe festival seemed to have more success with younger visitors who were attending just to enjoy the festival, eating snacks and vibing to the music.\nThe event was held in The Rock Musicarium grounds situated within the Naval Sailing Club, making it a rather exclusive event set at some distance from the main city.\nMashion Bazaar is organised by the culture and lifestyle digital platform, Mashion which is run by renowned actor Mahira Khan.\n"

Ahmed was correct as Lt Gen (retd) Faiz had been appointed the Peshawar corps commander at that time.\nThe PML-N leader said all PDM parties worked hard to make the vote of no-trust motion successful -- a feat that nobody else had pulled off in the country\u2019s history before.\nHe continued that the PDM was of the view that the country would default if the economic situation and inflation continued as they were.\nPPP\u2019s Faisal Kareem Kundi, while addressing a news conference in Islamabad, claimed that the JUI-F chief was the biggest beneficiary of the no-trust motion himself, adding that he could have opted to stay out of the move being the head of the PDM.\nHe pointed out that now when the government formation was under way after the end of the polls, a major twist was seen on Thursday when a the JUI-F chief met with a PTI delegation despite a history of bad blood between them.\nKundi inquired that as the president of the PDM, on whose instructions had Fazl staged a sit-in in Islamabad and then why did suddenly call if off.\nHe maintained that after enjoying the perks of ministries during the coalition government\u2019s 16 months in power, the JUI-F was protesting in Sindh and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa after tasting defeat in the polls.\nThe MQM-P also dismissed the JUI-F chief\u2019s claim about the no-trust motion being initiated at the behest of Gen (retd) Bajwa as \u201cbaseless\u201d.\nAddressing a news conference at the MQM-P\u2019s temporary headquarters in Karachi, the party\u2019s convener and former federal minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui questioned the motive behind such statements after the elections and expressed concern about their potential impact on democracy.\nHe clarified that the meeting in question took place on March 26 2022, where MQM was also invited and he represented the party.\nSiddiqui continued that the JUI-F chief\u2019s claims were completely different from the actual case and situation discussed during the huddle.\n"

            "Text": "Liaquat Bagh \u2013 Rawalpindi\u2019s 500-year-old historic landmark \u2013 which has been under strict lockdown since February 7, ahead of the general elections over security concerns, remains sealed even after passing 10 days.\nAccording to sources, access to the historic site has been entirely restricted, with no entry permitted for citizens. The premises, housing the offices of Returning Officers for two constituencies within the office of the Parks and Horticulture Authority (PHA) and adjacent Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) office, prompted the district administration to seal off Liaquat Bagh and RDA Road due to security risks.\nThe park\u2019s closure has disrupted the usual flow of visitors, turning the area into a restricted zone, including for those seeking services from law enforcement and emergency responders at Rescue 15.\nThe stringent police presence at the Liaquat Bagh entrance towards Rescue 15 has made it challenging for hundreds of citizens to access necessary documents. Additionally, the closure extends to a local wrestling arena, denying access even to young wrestlers.\nNumerous government offices along the same route, such as the Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA), PHA, Wasa, Rawalpindi Press Club, and Rawalpindi Waste Management Company (RWMC), have also been affected by the road closures, inconveniencing hundreds of daily visitors.\nRead:\u00a0PTI\u2019s request to hold rally at Liaquat Bagh rejected\nThe closure has left approximately 4,000 daily visitors, including families and students from Gordon College, unable to engage in recreational activities like jogging and sightseeing. Even citizens from colder regions like Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, who frequented Liaquat Bagh for sunbathing and historical exploration, find themselves barred from entry.\nDespite the inconvenience faced by citizens, the offices of the Returning Officers remain operational round the clock, attracting unidentified individuals and vehicles, raising concerns among the populace.\nThere is a growing demand for the immediate reopening of Liaquat Bagh, which has lost its charm due to the extended closure, impacting essential services like plant watering by PHA staff and creating difficulties for worshippers at the Liaquat Bagh Park mosque. In response, official sources cite the park\u2019s closure as necessary until election objections are resolved. As the impasse persists, citizens hope for a swift resolution to restore access to this cherished historical site.\nHistorical background\nThe expansive Liaquat Bagh at the centre of the garrison city has a long and majestic history that dates back to settlements long before Rawalpindi was established around 500 years ago.\nOnce upon a time, it was part of a dense forest where the Indo-Aryans, pastoralists who migrated from Central Asia, were among the earliest settlers. They chose the area adjacent to Liaquat Bagh due to a clear stream of flowing water, which we know today as Nullah Leh. It exists to this date and is known as the \u2018Arya Mohalla\u2019.\nFrom 1880 to 1947, Hindu families cremated their dead here with the ashes scattered in the stream and also performed purification rituals in it. Hindu and Sikh women would also wash household utensils and clothes in the water channel which was also used by locals to take baths.\nThe dense forest of Liaquat Bagh also served as an ingress point for Afghan invaders whenever they attacked the subcontinent. Their troop would be stationed in the forest with soldiers also making use of the stream.\nIt also served as a location for political rallies and public meetings in the wake of the failed attempt to expel the British from India in 1857.\n"

            "Text": "Responding to Goldman Sachs\u2019 forecast of a rebound in Pakistan\u2019s US dollar-denominated Eurobond, the leading foreign bond maturing in April 2024, and others maintained an uptrend for the second consecutive working day on Friday. This marks a partial recovery from the approximately 5% decline following the post-election upset.\nIn a story titled \u2018Goldman Sachs sees end to Pakistan bond selloff on IMF prospects\u2019, Bloomberg reported on Thursday that \u201cGoldman Sachs Group Inc says Pakistan\u2019s dollar bonds will rebound, overcoming a fractured election mandate, as the leaders of the emerging coalition understand the gravity of the economic crisis and will work together to secure International Monetary Fund aid.\u201d\nAccording to a local research house, Pakistan\u2019s 10-year Eurobond worth $1 billion, maturing in two months on April 15, 2024, ticked up 0.1% to 97.91 cents on Friday. Pakistan has eight foreign bonds listed globally, totalling $7.8 billion, maturing between April 2024 to April 2051. Three of them, including the leading one, maintained an uptrend, while the remaining five bonds ticked down on Friday.\nBloomberg further stated that the South Asian nation\u2019s bonds rallied Thursday, led by notes maturing in April 2024, after the third-biggest group in the new parliament pledged support for former Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to take office again. Sharif, who already has a track record with the IMF, obtained a nine-month, $3 billion programme from the multilateral lender last June. These gains helped offset post-election losses that had reached 5%.\nThe nation is facing a looming deadline to find the money to meet $25 billion of external debt payments starting July, three times its foreign-exchange reserves. Its inflation rate is the highest in Asia, while the economy contracted last fiscal year. Investors demand an additional 11.5 percentage points of yield over Treasuries to buy the country\u2019s bonds, much above the 10 percentage points seen as the threshold of distress.\n\nRead\u00a0Hubco in talks to buy stake in Thar coalmine\nThe IMF has announced its team will visit Pakistan after the new government forms to discuss a medium-term package. \u201cWe do not see any of these stakeholders to be a holdout in the upcoming IMF negotiations,\u201d said Dhiraj Bajaj, lead portfolio manager for Asia and Emerging Markets debt at Lombard Odier, referring to the major political parties tipped to form a new government. \u201cThe only way forward to their success to stay in power is an IMF programme, and to then regain bilateral funding and meet their external liabilities. We believe this outcome is good for shorter and mid-dated US dollar bonds for now.\u201d\nPakistan\u2019s dollar bonds delivered some of the best returns in emerging markets last year, gaining over 90%. Goldman analysts cautioned that the outlook for Pakistan\u2019s bonds beyond a short-term rebound will depend on global financial conditions. Investors will weigh the risk of sticky US inflation and a longer wait for Federal Reserve rate cuts, which will act as a drag on all distressed debt, including Pakistan\u2019s, the analysts wrote.\nHubco buys stakes in Thar coal\nIn a notification to PSX on Friday, the Hub Power Company said it has entered into a \u201cdefinitive agreement\u201d for the acquisition of shares of Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company (SECMC), equivalent to approximately 9.5% of the issued and paid-up ordinary share capital of SECMC, held by Habib Bank Limited. To recall, the power company had entered into talks of the acquisition in mid-January 2024 to take stake in the country\u2019s top coal-rich mine that is supplying the black gold to run power plants.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 17th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

            "Text": "The State Bank of Pakistan has bought over $2 billion from the interbank market in the past seven months aimed at retaining official foreign exchange reserves at their current levels and also offsetting the impact of low disbursements of foreign loans.\nThe purchases from the market have also helped achieve the targets set by the International Monetary Fund regarding the net international reserves (NIR) requirements and the forward swaps, according to the sources in the central bank.\nDespite major buying from the market, the rupee-dollar parity largely remained stable with the local currency strengthening to around Rs279 to a dollar.\nThe central bank avoids responding to questions about the sale and purchase of foreign currency.\nThe sources said that the major purchases were made during the past few months, which have offset the impact of the shrinking window of external borrowings. Had these purchases not been made, the foreign currency reserves would have slipped to below $6 billion, and the rupee started depreciating, said the central bank sources.\nThe sources said that the SBP has met the IMF target of lowering the forward swap position to $3.45 billion by the end of December. These short-term borrowings by the central bank remained at $3.42 billion, slightly better than the IMF\u2019s maximum ceiling for the first half, the sources added.\nThey said that the central bank was also comfortable against another IMF target of NIR. The global lender has set the condition that the government\u2019s net reserves should not be negative by more than $13.4 billion in the first half of the fiscal year.\nThe IMF\u2019s projection of keeping the gross official foreign exchange reserves to $8.2 billion by the end of December has also been met. The reserves remained at $8.3 billion by end-December.\nAll this was possible mainly because of buying the dollars from the market, as the federal government struggled to materialise the planned foreign loans inflows.\nDuring the first half of Pakistan, the federal government repaid $3.2 billion foreign debt and also secured the rollovers of another $4 billion from Saudi Arabia and China. Despite these payments, Pakistan\u2019s external debt and liabilities again increased to $131.2 billion by end-December, according to the central bank data.\nPakistan is now trying to secure a rollover of $2 billion Chinese debt maturing on March 23rd. The country\u2019s current reserves position does not support making these payments, and there is no option but to get the loans rolled over again.\nThree weeks ago, Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar wrote a letter to Li Qiang, the Chinese premier, requesting him to rollover the debt, according to the finance ministry officials. Pakistan is paying a 7.1% interest rate on this $2 billion Chinese loan.\n\nRead\u00a0IMF loan uncertainty very high\nAnother loan payment of $1 billion on account of Eurobond is maturing in mid-April that cannot be rolled over.\nThe IMF has assumed the average exchange rate at Rs300 to a dollar by June \u2013 an assumption that is unlikely to be true if the central bank keeps buying the dollars from the market to cushion the reserves.\nThe IMF said earlier that the wedge between the interbank and open market exchange rates has narrowed, and the money markets have adequate liquidity. Reforms of exchange companies introduced in early September, coupled with measures against illegal foreign exchange activities, also helped improve market sentiments and liquidity, according to the IMF report.\nThe last IMF report had also stated that on the back of disbursements by the international financial institutions and continued SBP purchases, gross reserves further increased. However, despite the relative increase in the level of the foreign exchange reserves, the cushion was hardly sufficient to back 1.4 months of imports.\nDuring the first seven months of the fiscal year, the country had booked a trade deficit of $19.6 billion on the back of a 14% reduction in imports. The imports during this period remained at $36 billion as against $16.5 billion of exports.\nSince June 2019, Pakistan has adopted a market-based flexible exchange rate system, where the exchange rate is determined by market demand and supply conditions. But there have been incidents since June 2019 when the central bank also pumped dollars to stabilise the exchange rate during the period of uncertainty.\nThe higher purchases and meeting the external sector-related targets may help completion of the next programme review that carries the bonanza of the $1.2 billion loan tranche. However, the IMF is keen to negotiate the last tranche with an elected government.\nAn early formation of the government and timely announcement of the new finance minister would help secure the date for the next review talks from the IMF.\nThe finance ministry has not been able to ensure inflows of $6 billion on account of Eurobonds and foreign commercial loans. The data reported by the Economic Affairs Division and the central bank showed that Pakistan secured $8.1 billion in foreign loans during the first six months of the fiscal year, which was equal to one-third of the downward revised annual requirements.\nPakistan has also secured $5 billion rollovers from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, taking total external sector inflows to $13.1 billion or 52% of its needs.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 17th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

            "Text": "The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) plummeted nearly 2% to above 59,000 points on Friday amid intense political turmoil following the emergence of a new version of the story about former Premier Imran Khan\u2019s ouster by a no-confidence motion in April 2022. The index traded predominantly in the red as mainstream political players failed to reach a coalition arrangement necessary to form a new government, discouraging investors.\nIn the morning, the trading session began sluggishly as persistent political uncertainty weighed heavily on investor sentiment, pushing the index down by over 1,000 points by mid-day. Weak export data reported by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics further dampened market spirits, leading to an intra-day low at 59,739.47 points. The market continued its sharp decline, closing with a loss of more than 1,100 points.\n\u201cStocks sharply declined amidst dismal data showing negative LSM growth at -0.39% for July-Dec \u201823 and reports of Pakistan being downgraded to an authoritarian regime by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU),\u201d said Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti. \u201cUncertainty over the power-sharing formula by major political parties, IMF\u2019s new conditions over the next $1.2 billion tranche under SBA to liberalise imports, and the cabinet\u2019s approvals for an increase in gas prices acted as catalysts for the bearish market close.\u201d\nAt the close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded a loss of 1,147.10 points, or 1.88%, settling at 59,872.96. Topline Securities noted in its report that Pakistan equities began the day negatively, continuing the momentum from the previous day. The bourse remained negative for most of the business hours, with the KSE-100 index hitting an intraday low at 59,740 level (down 1,281 points) and ultimately closing at the 59,873 level (losing 1,147 points; down 1.88%).\n\u201cToday\u2019s pessimism stems from continuous uncertainty over the political front regarding the formation of the upcoming coalition setup, as political parties have yet to reach a conclusion in this regard,\u201d Topline added. The Exploration & Production, Power, Tech, and Cement sectors contributed negatively to the index, with Oil and Gas Development Company, Hub Power, Pakistan Petroleum, Systems Limited, Mari Petroleum, and Lucky Cement collectively losing 465 points, according to the report.\n\nRead\u00a0PSX rebounds on MSCI index review\nArif Habib Limited (AHL) observed in its report that stocks witnessed a close below 60k with a -5.14% week-on-week (WoW) decline, nearing the 59k February target set at the end of January, as the market entered a seasonally weak period. Only 13 stocks rose on Friday while 74 fell, with Oil and Gas Development Company (-5.47%), Hub Power (-2.65%), and Pakistan Petroleum (-4.12%) being the biggest drags on the index. Conversely, Engro Fertiliser (+2.12%) and Fatima Fertiliser (+7.36%) were the biggest index gainers, AHL wrote.\nIn significant developments, the federal cabinet approved a +12.3% increase in the weighted average gas price to Rs1,533/mmbtu. The gas tariff revision aligns with the IMF\u2019s conditions for the upcoming second review of the Standby Arrangement, the report added. JS Global analyst Mohammed Waqar Iqbal noted that the market remained negative, with the KSE100 index losing 1,147 points to close at 59,873. \u201cWe recommend investors take advantage of any downside as an opportunity to buy in the Banking and Exploration & Production sectors,\u201d the analyst added.\nOverall trading volumes increased to 314.2 million shares against Thursday\u2019s tally of 345.1 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs12.3 billion. Shares of 331 companies were traded, with 77 stocks closing higher, 238 dropping, and 16 remaining unchanged.\nK-Electric led in volume with trading in 41.8 million shares, losing Rs0.23 to close at Rs4.10. It was followed by WorldCall Telecom Limited with 25.7 million shares, losing Rs0.04 to close at Rs1.21, and Oil & Gas Development Company with 20.6 million shares, losing Rs6.18 to close at Rs107.93.\nForeign investors were net buyers of shares worth Rs636.14 million, according to NCPL.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 17th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

            "Text": "A week after the electoral showdown, the political battleground on Friday seemed anything but settled with major political players caught in second-guessing, leaving the formation of a central government hanging in the balance.\nPML-N, initially eying a coalition federal government alongside the PPP and the MQM-P, appeared to be indecisive while the PTI, lacking the numerical muscle for a government takeover, hinted at finding comfort on the opposition benches.\nMeanwhile, the PML-N reconsidered its plans on Friday, mulled over the consequences of making a coalition federal government and limited itself to Punjab.\nIn a meeting at Jati Umra, which was chaired by PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif, the party leadership advised that the PML-N shouldn\u2019t take the federal government and focus only on Punjab where it can easily form the government. They also said that the party shouldn\u2019t accept unreasonable demands of any political party for the sake of forming government in the Centre.\nThe party leaders also said that the only purpose of forming a federal government was to save the country and the state from sliding further into political and economic crises.\nNevertheless, certain members raised concerns about the feasibility of the country's governance in the absence of any party taking the initiative to lead at the national level. They argued that the PML-N should not withdraw from consideration if no other party is capable of forming a federal government.\nA tweet stating that Nawaz chaired the meeting called to contemplate if the PML-N should form government in the Center and Punjab has already taken some crucial decisions. The tweet, which was retweeted by PML-N-nominated chief minister in Punjab, Maryam Nawaz, added that the committee earlier formed to reach out to the PPP and other parties gave a briefing to Nawaz and some more important decisions were expected soon.\nThe decisions can be expected after a scheduled meeting between the PML-N and the PPP\u2019s committees on Saturday evening. The committees, earlier constituted to finalise conditions on which both the parties would move ahead, had to meet on Friday but due to the PML-N meeting, it was postponed till Saturday.\nThe committees were formed after PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari had announced that his party would vote for the PML-N\u2019s candidate for the Prime Minister\u2019s slot but wouldn\u2019t become a part of the federal government.\nBilawal, however, had unequivocally conveyed that the officer of Presidency should be given to his father and PPP president, Asif Ali Zardari.\nIn the two rounds that have already been held between the two sides, the PPPP has stuck to the party line so far as it hasn\u2019t asked for any portfolios but demanded key constitutional offices like the presidency, chairman senate and speaker of National Assembly\u2019s positions. The PPP committee has already briefed Bilawal about the multilateral contact among political parties.\nSome other factors contributing to political uncertainty include JUI-F\u2019s Maulana Fazlur Rehman decision not to support the PML-N and even asking it to sit on the opposition benches. The thaw in the JUI-F and the PTI relations after a PTI delegation approached Maulana to seek support for the protest against the alleged rigging has also forced parties to reconsider their strategies.\nIn November 2019, PML-Q\u2019s President Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain warned that no one would want to become the prime minister of the country after three months due to rampant inflation and unemployment. Given the current situation, it seems his prophecy has come true.\nBefore polls, it was envisaged that elections would lead to political stability but the split mandate has created a situation where political parties are still navigating the unchartered waters and busy in wheeling & dealing. Political observers believe that uncertainty seems to be the only certainty at the moment.\nNevertheless, the PTI, while dialling up its allegations of rigging and deciding to hit the streets, made it clear that it won\u2019t be pulling a disappearing act from parliament.\nIt asserted that it would not abandon the parliament by replicating its en masse resignations after the ex-premier Imran Khan was ousted through a vote of no-confidence in April 2022.\nPTI officials told The Express Tribune that even if their candidate, Omar Ayub, fails to clinch the parliamentary vote for the premier's slot, the party is here to stay in the parliamentary arena.\nMeanwhile, PTI leader Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif announced that following the instructions of PTI founder Imran Khan the party has decided to sit in opposition both at the Centre and in the province of Punjab.\n"

We reject all allegations and call for a thorough investigation into the matter.\"\nSimilarly, DRO Attock Rao Atif Raza insisted that the elections in Attock were conducted transparently without any external pressure. He rejected the allegations put forth by the former commissioner.\nDRO Jhelum Captain (retd) Sami denied the accusations, stating that he conducted the elections in accordance with his predecessor, maintaining cleanliness and transparency throughout the process.\nMeanwhile, DRO Chakwal emphasised adherence to the Election Act during the elections in Chakwal and urged the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to conduct an impartial investigation into the allegations.\nKhawar Bashir, DRO of the fifth district of Talagang in Rawalpindi Division, asserted the transparency of the elections in Talagang and called for an independent investigation into the allegations made by the former commissioner.\nIt is pertinent to note that as the controversy unfolds, the Election Commission of Pakistan has been urged by political parties and others to take swift action to address the concerns raised and ensure the credibility of the electoral process.\nHowever, the election commission has rejected Chattha's allegations, but said in a statement that it would \"hold an enquiry\".\nLeading advocacy group the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said after Chattha's announcement that the \"involvement of the state bureaucracy in rigging in Pakistan is beginning to be exposed.\nCandidates from the PML-N and PPP claimed most of the seats in Rawalpindi, sweeping aside candidates loyal to jailed former prime minister Imran Khan -- the target of a sweeping crackdown.\nImran Khan\u2019s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party called nationwide protests against the alleged rigging on Saturday.\nA small number of supporters took to the streets in major urban centres, with the largest gathering of around 4,000 people in its stronghold northern city of Peshawar.\nIn the central city of Lahore, police detained senior party member Salman Akram Raja and around a dozen supporters -- surrounding the party headquarters -- but said they had all been released by late afternoon.\nSenior PTI official Ali Muhammad Khan said after the protests that Chattha's statement proved his party was cheated.\n\"We must be returned our mandate,\" he told reporters in Islamabad.\nPTI defied a months-long crackdown that shattered its campaigning and forced candidates to run as independents, gaining more votes than any other party.\n"

If hurling allegations is your right, give me evidence along with it too.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the Supreme Court opted to keep its hands off the allegations of election rigging hurled by the Rawalpindi commissioner at CJP Isa, deciding against taking suo motu notice.\nReliable sources told Express News on Saturday that this decision was reached after a consultation among the judges, including CJP Isa, himself.\nThe allegations, which involve CJP Isa\u2019s purported involvement in poll rigging, were expected to be deliberated upon during a scheduled hearing in an election-related case on February 19.\nSources suggested that there is a possibility of the Rawalpindi Commissioner's case being considered within the framework of this pre-arranged case.\nA consultation meeting chaired by CJP Isa was reportedly convened to address the accusations made by the Rawalpindi Commissioner.\nJustices Muneeb Akhtar, Yahya Afridi, Ayesha Malik, and Athar Minallah were also present during the deliberations. Following a careful examination of the allegations, the participants decided against taking suo motu notice on the matter.\nAlso read: Rawalpindi commissioner resigns from post after confessing to 'poll rigging'\nECP forms probing committee\nThe ECP decided to establish a high-level committee to investigate the rigging allegations.\nChief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikander Sultan Raja called for an emergency meeting of the ECP following the serious allegations made by Chattha.\nIn a press release following the meeting, the ECP disclosed that the allegations were thoroughly discussed, leading to the decision to form a committee headed by a senior member of the commission to scrutinise the claims.\nThe committee will also include the secretary, special secretary, and additional director general of the law department, as outlined in the statement.\n\u201cThe committee will take statements from Rawalpindi\u2019s District Returning Officers (DROs) and Returning Officers (ROs) and is expected to submit a report to the commission within three days of being notified,\u201d the statement detailed.\nThe ECP further specified that based on the committee\u2019s findings, legal action and contempt of ECP proceedings might be initiated against the former commissioner.\nEarlier in the day, the electoral watchdog commission refuted the allegations made by Rawalpindi Commissioner Liaquat Ali Chattha against the chief election commissioner and the ECP.\n\u201cNo official from the ECP issued any instructions to Commissioner Rawalpindi to manipulate election results,\u201d stated the release issued soon after the commissioner\u2019s press conference.\n\u201cIt is important to note that the commissioner of any division is not the DRO, RO, or presiding officer and does not have a direct role in conducting the elections,\u201d it emphasised.\nNevertheless, the electoral watchdog will promptly initiate an inquiry into the matter.\n\u0627\u0644\u0632\u0627\u0645\u0627\u062a \u0644\u06af\u0627\u0646\u0627 \u062d\u0642 \u06c1\u06d2 \u0645\u06af\u0631 \u0627\u0633 \u06a9\u06d2 \u0633\u0627\u062a\u06be \u062b\u0628\u0648\u062a \u0628\u06be\u06cc \u067e\u06cc\u0634 \u06a9\u0631\u0646\u0627 \u06c1\u0648\u062a\u0627 \u06c1\u06d2\u060c \u0686\u06cc\u0641 \u062c\u0633\u0679\u0633#ExpressNews #BreakingNews #QaziFaezIsa pic.twitter.com/REeqO5WBpT\nSCBA deeply concerned\nMeanwhile, the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) has demanded the election commission conduct a transparent investigation into the allegations.\nA statement issued by the SCBA stated that Commissioner Liaquat Ali Chattha has tried to make the office of chief justice controversial, adding that the CJP has no role in the conduct of the elections.\n\u201cExecutive Committee of the Supreme Court Bar Association of Pakistan have expressed deep concern and anguish over the statement issued to the media by the Commissioner Rawalpindi division whereby he tried to involve the Chief Justice of Pakistan in the allegations of rigging in the general elections,\u201d the statement, available with The Express Tribune, read.\nIt stated that the SCBAP considers the statement of the Commissioner to be a \u201cmalicious attempt to raise a controversy qua the esteemed office of the Chief Justice of Pakistan\u201d which is regrettable and intolerable\u201d.\nThe SCBA noted that it is a matter of common knowledge that neither the SC net the Chief Justice of Pakistan has any concern with the entire electoral process which is within the exclusive domain of the ECP.\n\u201cThe SCBAP however considers that in the wake of allegations of serious rigging, the matters need to be taken up by the ECP and the same should be fairly inquired into and remedial steps must be taken to address the grievances of the contesting candidates.\u201d\nIt further pointed out that large-scale allegations qua the integrity and transparency of the election results certainly call for an urgent and thorough investigation which is the constitutional duty of the ECP in terms of Article 218(3) of the Constitution.\nThe SCBAP urged the ECP to perform its constitutional obligations to take all possible steps to ensure the integrity of the electoral process. In light of these developments, it urged all political parties and stakeholders who feel aggrieved by the election results or alleged rigging to exercise restraint.\n\u201cIt is essential to prioritise the preservation of democracy and to avoid any actions that could potentially derail the democratic process in the country. Furthermore, the SCBAP is of the view that the importance of adhering to the provisions outlined in the Elections Act of 2017 is essential at this point of time,\u201d the statement said.\n"

These poll- ing stations will now have the presence of not only local police but also special personnel from the Pakistan Army and Rangers. The district police have finalised a foolproof security plan for the upcoming general elections.\nA total of 883 polling stations have been designated for three National Assembly and six Sindh Assembly seats within Hyderabad district. Out of these, 34 are allocated for men, 327 for women, and 214 are joint polling stations. Moreover, seven temporary polling stations will be set up in open spaces. The total count of poll- ing booths will reach 3,218, including 1,700 for male and 1,518 for female voters.\nInitially, the ECP had identified 168 polling stations as \u201chighly sensitive\u201d out of the 883, but due to the evolving situation, this number has been increased to 181. Moreover, 365 polling stations are now classified as \u201csensitive\u201d, while 337 are considered normal. Security personnel from the Pakistan Army and Rangers will be deployed at the \u201chighly sensitive\u201d polling stations.

This was then followed by observing a minute\u2019s silence to honour the oppressed Kashmiris living in occupied territory. \nThe exhibition also featured performances such as tableaus, speeches and Kashmiri song competitions which were organised with the support of the All Pakistan Private Schools Management Association.\nThe General Secretary of All Party Hurriyat Conference Azad Kashmir Pakistan Chapter, Sheikh Abdul Mateen, was present at the event alongside the chapter\u2019s Information Secretary, Imtiaz Wani. Sheikh Abdul Mateen said on the occasion \u201cThe worst kind of atrocities in Occupied Kashmir have exposed the real face of India in front of the whole world. Such atrocities are rarely found in human history. The anti-Kashmir cruel policies of the Hindutva government of India, however, have not changed the reality of Kashmir.\u201d\nHe further said that the dream of world peace can never be fulfilled without the freedom of Occupied Kashmir. \u201cTill today millions of Kashmiris have sacrificed their lives for freedom and the only demand of Kashmiris is that they should be given the right of self-determination.\u201d\nRead:\u00a0Joint sitting expresses solidarity with Kashmiris\nImtiaz Wani reinforced his companion\u2019s points by adding that \u201cThe entire humanity is ashamed of Indian atrocities against the Kashmiri people, and it is a disgraceful stain on human history and conscience, so every Pakistani and every peaceful person in the world should raise their voice for the Kashmiri people\u2019s right of self-determination. The Muslim Ummah and the United Nations should play their role in resolving the Kashmir issue.\u201d \nDirector of Arts Council Waqar Ahmed, who was also present at the exhibition, said that Pakistan has always strongly supported the right of self-determination of Kashmiris at the political, moral and diplomatic level. \n\u201cIt is Pakistan's principled position that the Kashmir issue should be resolved according to the wishes of the Kashmiri people under the UN resolutions,\u201d he said.\nThe exhibition displayed photos related to Kashmiri history and culture and the performances celebrated the people of Kashmir. The song competition allowed young students a chance to learn about Kashmir and express their solidarity with its people.\nAmong the winners of the competitions, Eagle Public School won first position in the tableau performances, Ames School System got second position, Alfarooq Public School got third position and Green Valley School came fourth place.

She alleged that the accused had forced her to go with his friend and after she was transferred to another branch, when she went to collect her card from the Hassanabdal branch, she was verbally abused by him, and he refused to hand over her ATM card.\nRead:\u00a0SECP proposes anti-harassment steps\nFollowing her complaints, the departmental harassment committee probed into her allegations and, after inquiry, concluded that the accused was indeed harassing the female employee and he was accordingly dismissed from service. \nThe accused then filed an appeal with FOSPAH, which was dismissed, after which, he filed a representation with the President.\nThe president in his decision observed that the accused had duly admitted the allegations about calls, text messages, and denial to hand over her ATM card to the complainant deliberately. \u201cFacts admitted need not be proved,\u201d he added.\nThe president further made it clear that workplace harassment could have very serious consequences for working women as they can risk losing their jobs or the chance of promotions if they refuse to give in to the unethical demands of someone in authority. \n\u201cThe unwelcome conduct of co-workers makes the working conditions hostile and unpleasant, putting indirect pressure on women to leave their jobs\u201d, he added. He remarked that sometimes a woman employee can be so traumatised by the harassment that she may suffer serious emotional and physical consequences and become unable to perform her job properly.\n"

        },
        "Details": {
            "Text": "The Ministerial Group has cautioned against the privatisation of two LNG power plants, citing concerns about the current investment climate. The government\u2019s intention to privatise these plants, established during the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz\u2019s tenure with an LNG contract signed with the government of Qatar, is under scrutiny.\nSources reveal that the apex committee of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) directed the consideration of privatising two RLNG (Re-Gasified Liquefied Natural Gas) Power Plants. The committee constituted a Ministerial Group following the apex committee\u2019s directions to evaluate the possibility of privatising Haveli Bahadur Shah and Balloki RLNG Power Plants.\nAfter thorough deliberation, the Ministerial Group asserted that the privatisation of these two LNG power plants is not advisable at the present time, considering the overall investment climate. The group highlighted potential gains from future tariffs, estimated at Rs130.8 billion, and pointed out a payout to clean books amounting to Rs264 billion. It also noted that RLNG power plants had already generated a profit of Rs153 billion.\nQatar has expressed interest in acquiring these LNG-based power plants. In 2021, the cabinet committee on energy exempted LNG-based power plants from a 66% guaranteed off-take of LNG, despite the potential financial strain on gas utility Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) and the power plants. The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf government also contemplated exempting the LNG power plants from the merit order.\nImpact on the Power Sector and RLNG Supply Chain\nThe power sector plays a pivotal role in the re-gasified LNG supply chain, and any disruptions in RLNG supply/demand impact the economic dispatch of power, leading to high line pack issues in the gas transmission system.\nWhen RLNG supply falls below the firm order, the basket price of electricity rises compared to situations when supply follows demand. Lower RLNG supply causes operational constraints and system stability issues for the system operator. Conversely, the basket price is affected when the plants are compelled to accommodate RLNG oversupply by gas companies. The take-or-pay contractual arrangements for the three RLNG-based power plants specify a minimum fuel offtake requirement of 66% annually, as established under the Annual Production Plan. The decision to exempt RLNG power plants from guaranteed offtake was made by the Cabinet Committee on Energy following the demand of the then privatisation minister during the PTI government.\nRead\u00a0Privatisation of LNG plants, DISCOs put on fast track\nPrivate parties advocating for the exemption, particularly those interested in acquiring these LNG power plants, pressed for the move. Sources reported that Qatar\u2019s interest in acquiring these LNG power plants prompted the exemption of guaranteed offtake to enable control of LNG supply.\nCurrently, Pakistan State Oil (PSO) supplies LNG to SNGPL, which distributes it to the LNG power plants. Guaranteed offtake also involves damages if LNG power plants do not take at least 66% of supplies. Thus, the decision to exempt these power plants from 66% guaranteed offtake aimed to safeguard private investors from potential damages.\nChallenges and Recommendations\nExperts caution that the privatisation of these LNG power plants is not a straightforward process, as the power sector is grappling with circular debt that continues to rise. Payment issues for electricity supplies remain a major concern, with circular debt in the LNG sector emerging as a key factor in the overall circular debt in the power sector.\nSeveral challenges lie ahead, even if the government decides to proceed with the privatisation plan. Experts further recommend that the government address the issues of power distribution companies (Discos), which are significant contributors to the circular debt.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 4th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

            "Text": "Coordinator Pak-Afghan Joint Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PAJCCI), Ziaul Haq Sarhadi, has suggested issuing special passes to truck drivers transporting cargo goods between Pakistan and Afghanistan.\nIn a press statement released on Friday, Sarhadi said the suggestion is based on streamlining and smoothing of Pak-Afghan trade which recently halted for ten days over conditions of visas by truck drivers. Around 1000 truck drivers will be issued special passes instead of visas for carrying their goods with ease between Pakistan and Afghanistan, he added. He stressed that these trucks should be registered with Customs and Transport Departments in Pakistan and Transport and Gumrak in Afghanistan. The owners of heavy vehicles should also be charged a nominal fee for issuance of special pass, he added.\nRead\u00a0Pak-Afghan border at Torkham set to reopen\nSarhadi noted that hundreds of trucks got stuck on both sides of the border and businessmen faced hefty losses due to rotting of perishable items. The importers and exporters of both countries also have to pay enormous amounts as detention charges at a rate of US dollars 120 to 180 per day. He highlighted that the issuance of special passes to trucks, allowing them to ply between Karachi to Mazhar Sharif, will help in easing the transportation of cargo goods and promotion of trade between the two neighbouring countries.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 4th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

            "Text": "With less than a week before the general elections, the interim government has notified an implementation committee to execute the restructuring of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and has set a tight deadline of 72 hours to finalise a legal package.\nChairperson of the Pakistan Stock Exchange and Sui Southern Gas Company Limited, Dr Shamshad Akhtar will head the implementation committee in her capacity as the finance minister. The first meeting of the committee was held on Saturday, immediately after the notification, during which the chairperson of the committee presented her plan for overhauling the tax machinery.\nThe Revenue Division has notified the eight-member Implementation and Asset Distribution Committee to give effect to the FBR\u2019s restructuring. Two sub-committees have also been notified to prepare a slew of legal amendments in laws, finalise new statutes, and distribute the assets between the two new organisations. The sub-committee on the distribution of assets also met on Saturday.\nOther members of the implementation committee include the Secretary of Law, private consulate Dr Musharraf Rasool Cyan, Dr Manzoor Ahmad, Member Administration FBR Nadeem Rizvi, Member Legal Customs Mukarram Jah Ansari, and Member Inland Revenue Policy Afaq Qureshi. Additional Secretary Revenue Division, Sajid Qazi, will act as the secretary to the implementation committee.\nThree days ago, the federal cabinet approved the FBR\u2019s restructuring. After the cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar told The Express Tribune that the restructuring of FBR would be implemented by the next elected government, and the next Parliament would make requisite changes. However, immediately after approval, the Election Commission of Pakistan barred the prime minister from taking any action, terming it beyond his constitutional and legal mandate. According to the ECP, the caretaker Prime Minister should avoid major reforms in the FBR and keep it pending for consideration by the new government after the General Elections-2024. The committee notification indicates that the interim government will prepare plans within four to seven days, but no timeframe for submitting this plan to the federal cabinet has been given.\nThe approved restructuring involves the cessation of the FBR, leading to the creation of two new organisations and three new boards. Legislative changes, including enactments for Customs and Inland Revenue establishments, and alterations in respective rules and Rules of Business 1973, will be required for the restructuring\u2019s implementation.\nRead\u00a0FBR misses monthly target by 1.3%\nOn the administration side, changes will be necessary regarding budget and expenditure allocations, establishment of new administrations, and division of existing assets between the two administrations. In place of the FBR, the Federal Custom Board and Federal Inland Revenue Board will be created and placed under the Revenue Division.\nA government official stated that the Special Investment Facilitation Council supports the cabinet\u2019s decision, but said legislative changes should be left to the new government. The implementation committee will only prepare drafts of amendments, shared with the next elected government.\nThe notification mentions that the finance minister will engage with the economic teams of all major political parties to create understanding and buy-in for the approved restructuring. According to the notification, the legal sub-committee will prepare a legal package for the restructuring\u2019s implementation within four days. The package will include a statutory draft of new legislation, amendments in respective statutes, changes in rules of business of 1973, and other related rules and regulations.\nThe legal committee will also finalise the revised mandate of the Revenue Division, including the creation of a tax policy unit and the constitution of the tax policy board. The legal committee will conclude the establishment of the Federal Board of Customs and Federal Board of Inland Revenue within four days. Its mandate also includes proposals for the operationalisation of Customs Administration and Inland Revenue Administration within four days.\nOnce the legal plan is ready, it will be placed before the main implementation committee, which will have two days to give its approval. After approval, a one-day deadline is set for the Law Division to approve the legal package and prepare it for submission before the federal cabinet.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 4th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

            "Text": "The result management system in Pakistan \u2013 which remains a festering source of most electoral controversies \u2013 seems to have a mind of its own, leaving most voters scratching their heads at the end of the polling day and election outcomes shrouded in mystery.\nThe \u201cking\u2019s party\u201d ends up playing a winning hand, snagging more seats than its fair slice of the voting pie.\nRegardless of candidates' meticulous calculations and prevailing conditions, the outcome of elections seems to defy both logic and proportional representation.\nThe number of votes for mainstream parties frequently fails to align harmoniously with the seats they secure.\nIn this political chessboard where the establishment pulls out all the stops, a comprehensive analysis of the last four elections reveals a pattern where the \u201cking\u2019s party\u201d bags more seats than its proportionate vote share on the polling day.\nThe establishment's playbook includes deft pre-poll and post-poll strategies, including seat adjustments, vote division using \"manufactured\" smaller parties, and the creation of splinter groups, to influence results in favour of particular parties.\nNotably, none of the major political parties forming the government after the last four elections managed to secure more than 33 per cent of the total cast votes, allowing ample room for establishment manoeuvres.\nWhen traditional methods prove insufficient, rejected votes become a strategic tool, especially in closely contested races.\nRejected votes in many cases surpass the margin between the winner and the runner-up, and this trend is on the rise with each election.\n2002 general elections\nExamining the 2002 elections under then-military ruler General Pervez Musharraf, the Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid (PML-Q) emerged as the largest party with 78 seats.\nThis happened despite the fact that they secured fewer votes than the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), which participated in the elections under the banner of Pakistan Peoples Party Parliamentarians (PPP-P).\nThe opposition vote was further neutralised through alliances, with smaller pro-establishment groups securing seats beyond their vote share.\nThe PPP had bagged more votes compared to the PML-Q.\nThe king\u2019s party, the PML-Q, had received 7.5 million votes compared to PPP\u2019s 7.6 million.\nThe PPP could get 63 general seats.\nNawaz Sharif\u2019s broken PML-N secured 3.4 million votes, which by percentage of votes was 12 per cent of the total polled votes, and bagged only 15 seats.\nThis opposition vote was neutralised through a new alliance of some smaller pro-establishment groups contested on the platform of National Alliance, which got 1.3 million votes (five per cent), but it bagged 13 seats.\nMost of the 28 independents joined the PML-Q, strengthening the party's tally to increase its number for reserved seats for women and non-Muslims.\nWhen the PML-Q and the National Alliance still could not make the required numbers, a new splinter group from PPP-P comprising many of the party's stalwarts from Punjab was created with the name Pakistan Peoples Party-Patriots to join the coalition government.\nIn the 2002 elections, Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA) had bagged only 3.3 million votes (11 per cent) but secured 45 general seats.\nThe MMA served as friendly opposition and helped pass a constitutional amendment package Legal Framework Order (LFO) that validated all the actions of the military ruler.\n\u00a0\n2008 general elections\nIn the 2008 elections, held amid the tragic assassination of Benazir Bhutto and the declining rule of General Musharraf, of the 80.7 million voters in the electoral rolls, 35.6 million polled their votes with 44 per cent turnout.\nThe PML-Q was not the first choice of the powerful quarters this time. Led by Asif Zardari, the PPP secured 10.6 million votes which was 30.7 per cent of the total votes polled across the country on the election day. With 89 general seats, it emerged as the single largest party in the National Assembly.\nOn the other hand, the PML-Q this time bagged 7.9 million votes (23 per cent) but it could muster only 42 general seats while the PML-N though secured 6.9 million votes (20 per cent), however its tally of seats was 68- showcasing a discrepancy in proportionate votes versus seats.\nLater on, the PML-Q had to join the PPP-led coalition government which was initially formed with the help of independents and smaller groups.\n2013 general elections\nThe trend continued in the 2013 elections, which saw 55 per cent turnout.\nImran Khan-led PTI for the first time emerged as a serious contender.\nOn the polling day, the PML-N bagged 14.7 million votes with the highest percentage of the last four elections - 32.7 per cent of the total votes and secured 124 seats in the lower house of parliament.\nRead:\u00a0Elections 2024: Parties race to woo key youth voters\nThe PTI secured second highest 7.7 million votes (17 per cent) and bagged 26 general seats while the PPP though had 6.9 million votes (15 per cent), it bagged 31 general seats \u2013 again a discrepancy in proportionate votes versus seats.\nSimilarly, the combined tally of votes of the PPP and the PTI was almost the same as the PML-N, but if one combines their number of seats, they were much less, emphasising the disparities.\n2018 general election\nThe 2018 elections witnessed a shift in establishment preferences, favouring Imran Khan's PTI.\nOf 106 million registered voters across the country, 51.7 percent polled their votes.\nImran\u2019s PTI emerged as the largest party bagging 16.9 million (32 per cent) votes, securing 116 general seats. The PML-N which had falling out with the powerful quarters secured 12.9 million votes (24 per cent), however its number of general seats was only 64, while the PPP with 6.9 million votes (13 per cent) secured 43 general seats in the lower house.\n\u00a0\nRole of 'manufactured parties' and independents\nIn every election, novel strategies are employed to influence outcomes.\nIndependents consistently play a pivotal role, securing the fourth or fifth-largest votes and seats in the last four general elections.\nIn 2002, independents secured nine per cent of the total votes with 29 seats, supporting the king's party (PML-Q).\nReligious party alliances, like the MMA, served as friendly opposition to facilitate smooth governance for the ruling party.\nIn 2008, besides other factors, including inside tussle with powerful quarters, sudden power and gas outrages affected the PML-Q vote while Benazir\u2019s assignation had mustard sympathy for the PPP.\nIn 2013, the PPP had to suffer due to poor performance and was limited to Sindh.\nThe media campaign against the party, corruption charges, and general law and order in the country did not allow the PPP to campaign freely tilting the edge for the PML-N.\nIn the 2018 elections, the PTI was facilitated in every manner to ensure its victory.\nMany electable from South Punjab were conjured in a \"manufactured alliance\" tagged as \u201cJanoobi Punjab Mahaz\u201d to later join hands with Imran\u2019s party to form the government.\nKhadim Rizvi\u2019s Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) was there to dent the PML-N which had lost the blessings of the establishment.\nCampaigning on the blasphemy card played against the PML-N, as it is estimated that the TLP cost the PML-N at least 15 seats in the National Assembly.\nStill short of numbers, the PTI had to rely on smaller pro-establishment groups like MQM, PML-Q, BAP, GDA and independents to form a fragile government which crumbled when these groups withdrew their support.\nOf 13 independents who secured 11 per cent of the votes, the majority joined the PTI.\nIn 2008, around 30 MNAs were elected as independents securing nine per cent of the votes while in 2013, 29 independents got elected securing 14 per cent votes.\nThese independents had a crucial role to play in the formation of the PPP and the PML-N\u2019s respective governments at the Centre.\nRejected votes\nDespite perceived increasing awareness about the election process, the percentage of rejected votes has steadily risen.\nIn 2002, approximately 2.5 per cent of the votes were rejected; in 2008, 2.7 per cent; in 2013, it was 3.11 per cent, reaching 3.13 per cent in the 2018 elections.\nThough seemingly a small percentage, rejected votes have had a significant impact on results, changing outcomes in many constituencies.\nIn the 2018 elections, 1.6 million votes were rejected, influencing results in at least 30 National Assembly constituencies.\nIn many constituencies, the number of rejected ballots was greater than the margin of victory during the last four elections.\nECP\u2019s election management system\nWhile technology was expected to enhance the integrity of elections, this has not been the case in our situation.\nIn the 2013 elections, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) implemented a system that captured the thumb impressions of each voter to prevent fraudulent voting.\nHowever, when the results faced scrutiny, the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) system struggled to trace a significant number of contested thumb impressions, citing various technical reasons.\nIn 2018, the ECP introduced what it called an integrated \u2018Result Transmission System\u2019 (RTS) which crumbled within a few hours after the vote count started.\nFor the 2024 elections, the ECP is introducing a new system tagged \u2018Election Management System\u2019 (EMS), developed by a private company, to compile results electronically along with manual count.\nThe ECP had its first large-scale mock test of the new system only a week ago \u2013 around two weeks before the polling day.\nIt is to be seen how successful the new system would prove in bringing transparency in vote count.\nAs Pakistan braces for the upcoming elections, understanding these intricacies becomes crucial in deciphering the political chessboard where manoeuvring and strategy shape electoral outcomes.\n"

        "Details": {
            "Text": "PTI founding chairman Imran Khan has so far been convicted four times, but questions have been raised about the fairness of the trials, due process and timing of the judicial orders.\nImran has been convicted in three cases within five days -- namely cipher, Toshakhana (gift repository) and Iddat (a mandatory waiting period that a Muslim woman must observe on account of the death of her husband or dissolution of the marriage). His trials were conducted in jail expeditiously.\nThe purpose of speedy trials was to convict him before the next general elections scheduled for the 8th of the ongoing month. The timing of his convictions is interesting. Even PML-N supremo and former premier Nawaz Sharif was convicted in the Avenfield case just before the 2018 general elections.\nImran was earlier convicted in the Toshakhana case by an additional district and sessions judge on August 5 last year. After former chief justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial\u2019s retirement, it seems that all constitutional institutions, including the security establishment, are on the same page against the PTI, especially when it comes to Imran.\nLawyer Abdul Moiz Jaferii said anyone who had thought that what was happening with the PTI and Imran was about the law could now clearly admit their mistake.\n\"These have been three days of ridiculous atrocities committed in the name of law and justice. Each decision is more ridiculous than the last. To try and explain them in terms of law or within the frame of legality is to insult the intelligence of both the lawyer being asked and the public being answered to,\" he added.\nJaferii regretted that the most unfortunate aspect of the current situation was that it was the judicial system, which stood completely exposed as a weak and complicit tool in the greater design. \u201cIf the courts are going to be a circus, then all lawyers must realise they are playing the role of clowns.\u201d\nSenior lawyers believe that such convictions against political leaders cannot sustain in the long term. They say that these convictions can only gain a short-term objective. Now the next general elections were the main reason behind these expeditious trials.\nIt is also being witnessed that Nawaz\u2019s convictions have been set aside after a few years. Earlier, judicial proceedings were manipulated against him before the 2018 general polls.\nRead: Imran, Qureshi sentenced to 10-year imprisonment in cypher case\nWith his relationship with the 'powerful circles' restored, he has been successful in acquiring relief in those cases, which were initiated against him on the instructions of the apex court.\nCurrently, Imran\u2019s relationship with 'powerful circles' is very tense. The PTI founding chairman is himself mainly responsible for narrowing his party's political space.\nInstead of adopting new political options, Imran continued to offend the \u2018powerful circles\u2019 since his removal as the prime minister through a no-confidence motion under Article 95 of the Constitution.\nMatters grew worse after last year\u2019s May 9 mayhem. Instead of disassociating himself from the riots, Imran did not publicly condemn them. In all those events, once again the judiciary is the main loser as it was before the 2018 elections when Nawaz was the main target and he was convicted.\nDuring the tenure of ex-CJP Bandial, it was being alleged that superior courts were facilitating the PTI and Imran. After his retirement, everything has completely changed.\nSince the Jan 13 order that declared the PTI's internal elections as illegal, the party lost confidence in the judiciary to come to its rescue in the prevailing political situation. The PTI could not even retain its popular electoral symbol of the \u2018cricket bat\u2019 for the next polls.\nThe party leadership became further frustrated after the resignation of two pro-PTI judges in the Supreme Court -- Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi and Ijazul Ahsan.\nThe PTI withdrew its contempt petition against the caretaker Punjab government and Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) over the violation of SC order to ensure a level playing field for its candidates in the next general polls.\nAfter the SC's January 13 order, it has become difficult for the PTI to acquire relief from lower courts. The credibility of the general elections is at stake. The whole responsibility of the credibility of the elections has been shifted from the ECP to the top court after its January 13 order.\nThe dreams of many could not be fulfilled that the manipulation of judicial proceedings would come to an end during CJP Qazi Faez Isa's tenure.\nRights activists are criticising the Iddat case judgment wherein both Imran and his wife are convicted for seven years in jail. They believe that the verdict will have profound implications on women\u2019s rights. It has been learnt that Imran\u2019s legal team is going to challenge the three convictions in the Islamabad High Court.\n"

While presiding over a meeting to review the progress in the ongoing rehabilitation of flood-hit regions of Sindh, he directed his team to pursue funding from donors where it is still pending.\n\nThe meeting, held at the CM House, was attended by Chief Secretary Dr Fakhre Alam, Chairman P&D Sahkil Mangejo, PSCM Agha Wasif, Secretary School Education Dr Shireen Narejo, Secretary Health Dr Mansoor, Secretary Irrigation Niaz Abbasi, Secretary Works Nawaz Sohoo, CEO Peoples Housing Khalid Shaikh, and other concerned officers.\n\nWhile briefing the CM, Dr Narejo stated that 19,808 schools were damaged by the 2022 floods, with 7,503 requiring full reconstruction. Funding commitments of Rs60.972 billion from friendly countries like the European Union, China, and donor agencies ADB, Federal PSDP, and Provincial ADP were made for the construction of 2,020 school buildings.\n\nThe provincial government has initiated the construction of 431 schools for Rs4.428 billion, but funds committed by friendly countries and donor agencies are still in the pipeline. The CM instructed P&D chairman to secure project approvals from CDWP and other agencies, followed by the release of funds. The CM also directed the P&D Department to outline a plan for the reconstruction of the remaining 5,483 fully damaged schools.\n\nSecretary Health Dr Rizvi informed the meeting about the commencement of the Rs61,600 million 1,000 Days - Integrated Health and Population Program, supported by the World Bank and IsDB, with a Sindh government share of $30 million. The project is expected to conclude in 2026-27.\n\nThe project encompasses the refurbishment of 392 dispensaries, including equipment provision. Reconstruction efforts involve 121 Basic Health Units (BHUs), 97 Rural Healthcare Centres (RHCs), and 39 Taluka Headquarters (THQ) Hospitals that have been completely damaged.\n\nMoreover, the project will establish hospital-based blood banks at four DHQ hospitals: Kashmore-Kandhkot, Sujawal, Tando-Allahyar, and Tando Mohammad Khan. These blood banks will be linked with regional blood centres. The project will also establish diagnostic laboratories at 39 THQ hospitals, 10-bed nurseries at 39 THQ hospitals, and strengthen operation theatres at 39 THQ hospitals.\n\nAs part of the project, four Regional Training Institutes (RTIs), six Public Health Schools, and schools damaged during floods will be repaired and rehabilitated. The project aims to provide micro-financing and skill development opportunities to 6,000 women and deploy 1,176 community medical workers, 1,960 community health workers, and 392 family welfare workers to strengthen the local healthcare system.\n\nThe CM was informed about the signing of a MoU between PPHI and the Program for the operationalisation of 50 Dispensaries under PPHI Management. Initially, 50 dispensaries have been handed over to PPHI. Contracts for the procurement of 60 ambulances, 30 mobile medical vans, and five mobile laboratories, along with fabrication, have been awarded. The draft Terms of Reference (TORs) for a third-party consultancy firm for skill development through vocational training of 6,000 eligible women have been submitted to the Islamic Development Bank for approval.\n\nW&S Secretary Sohoo updated the CM on the progress on the Sindh Flood Emergency Rehabilitation Project (SERP), stating that work on 131 roads spanning 19 districts with a length of 680km has commenced, with physical progress ranging from 35 to 54 per cent. The CM directed the works department to expedite the work for timely completion.\n"

Pakistan is an independent and sovereign country. We believe in our own sovereign right to make decisions about Pakistan's internal affairs,\u201d she added.\n\nBesides the US government\u2019s reaction, a number of US congressmen wrote a letter to the Biden administration urging the White House not to recognise the new government in Pakistan till election fraud allegations were probed.\n\n\u201cYes, we understand that such a letter has been sent by some Congressmen to the US Secretary of State. This is a communication between public officials in the United States and is not addressed to the Government of Pakistan. We therefore have no comments to offer on such letters,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nMumtaz also declined to comment on the letter written by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), requesting the Washington-based lender to negotiate only with a legitimate government.\n\nOn the arrest of four individuals believed to be Pakistanis for allegedly transporting weapons to Yemen from Iran, the spokesperson said Pakistan was in contact with the US authorities.\n\n\u201cWe have seen the press release issued by the US Department of Justice indicating the said charges. We are in touch with the US Embassy in Islamabad and our Mission in Washington to ascertain more facts regarding the incident and to provide consular access to the individuals following confirmation of their nationality,\u201d she added.\n\nThe suspects were detained on Jan 11 in an operation conducted by the US Navy Seals off the coast of Somalia in the Arabian Sea.\n\nThe main suspect identified as Muhammad Pehlwan was charged with transporting weapons to the Houthis in Yemen.\nThe other three were accused of giving false information.\n\nThe spokesperson said there were no basis for speculative reports that certain countries had already conveyed their concerns to Pakistan over its move to start work on the long delayed multibillion-dollar Iran gas pipeline project.\n\nShe confirmed that the Cabinet Committee on Energy had already made a decision regarding the Iran-Pakistan pipeline.\n\u201cPakistan considers the Iran-Pakistan pipeline project as an important project that symbolises friendship between the two countries. Ensuring energy security remains a top priority for the Government of Pakistan and the Iran-Pakistan pipeline, among other projects, forms an important component of Pakistan's future energy mix,\u201d she explained.\n\nShe said the Cabinet Committee on Energy had approved the recommendations to resume work on the 80-kilometre section of the pipeline, which was inside the Pakistani territory.\n\n"

According to the party officials, the final results would be announced on Sunday after the election in Balochistan.\n\nThe PTI would election its chairman, secretary general and four provincial chiefs through the intra-party elections on March 3. As per the election schedule, Thursday was the last day of withdrawal of candidates and panels for provinces.\n\nAt the end of that phase, PTI Federal Election Commissioner Raoof Hassan issued the final list of candidates for the posts of party chairman, central secretary-general, Punjab president panel, K-P president panel, Sindh president panel and Balochistan president panel.\n\n\u201cWith Reference to the schedule of Intra-Party-Election issued on February 23, 2024, following is the revised final list of Panels/Candidates: 1. Chairman\u2019s Election, Barrister Gohar Ali Khan; 2. Central Secretary General\u2019s Panel, Omar Ayub Khan Panel; 3. Punjab President Panel, Dr Yasmin Rashid Panel; Khyber Pakhtunkhwa President Panel, Ali Amin Khan Gandapur Panel; 5. Sindh President Panel, Haleem Adil Sheikh Panel,\u201d said a press release.\n\n\u201cWith only one Candidate/Panel remaining as above, they have been declared elected unopposed by the respective Returning Officers,\u201d said a press release. \u201cThere shall, therefore, be no polling at the above stated 5 places,\u201d it added.\n\n\u201cPolling shall take place only at Quetta for the election of President Balochistan Panel,\u201d the press release said, adding that in Baluchistan, the president panels in contest were: a) Amin Khan Jogazai Panel b) Dawood Shah Panel and c) Munir Ahmad Baloch Panel.\n\nThe press release announced that the final result of the election would be declared by the Federal Election Commissioner on March 3, 2024, at the conclusion of the election process.\n\nThe PTI is holding the intra-party elections after a long battle in the run-up to the February 8 general elections, when it was stripped of its electoral symbol of \u2018bat\u2019 by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), a decision endorsed by the Supreme Court.\n\nIntra-party election is a required under the Election Act. The last elections were held in the PTI during June 2016 with the next elections due in June 2021. However, in response to ECP\u2019s notice, the party stated that it had failed to hold the elections due to the COVID pandemic and asked for a year\u2019s time.\n\nThe party conducted its elections on 8 June 2022, but the ECP refused to accept the elections. After long proceedings in the ECP, the PTI conducted the intra-party election again on December 2 2023. However, these elections were also challenged in the ECP.\n\nThe ECP again ruled that the elections were not held according to the party\u2019s constitution and decided to strip the party PTI of its electoral symbol. PTI termed the order of ECP as \u201cdeeply flawed\u201d and challenged it in both the Lahore High Court (LHC) and the Peshawar High Court (PHC).\n\nOn January 13, 2024, less than a month before the 2024 elections, a three-member Supreme Court bench affirmed the ECP\u2019s decision, overturning a previous PHC reversal. Following the apex court decision, PTI candidates contested the elections as independent candidates.\n\n"

            "Text": "After expressing total mistrust in Islamabad High Court Chief Justice Aamir Farooq, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan is contemplating to seek recusal of Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa from any bench hearing matters related to him or his party.\n\nImran Khan\u2019s spokesperson Shoaib Shaheen told The Express Tribune that he held a meeting with Imran at the Adiala Jail wherein it was discussed that CJP Isa should not hear cases related to Imran and his party in view of the larger bench order wherein it was held that Justice Isa should not hear cases involving Imran.\n\nHe stated that the PTI would move an application for his recusal in case any matter related to the party or its founder would be fixed before any bench led by CJP Isa.\n\nShaheen informed that they were preparing a petition against alleged rigging in the recent elections and the same would be filed in the apex court soon.\n\nImran and his wife, Bushra Bibi, already expressed mistrust in the IHC CJ. The IHC has issued notices to superior bars on their objections. The matter is still pending in the apex court. It is also witnessed that the previous PDM government had also expressed mistrust of the bench led by former CJP Umar Ata Bandial and comprising Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice\nMunib Akhtar hearing the matter regarding the holding of general elections of Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) assemblies. Then the PDM government was requesting the constitution of a full court but that plea was rejected.\n\nPreviously, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) had raised objections of biasness against then chief justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry. Likewise, allegations of bias was levelled by the Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) against then chief justice Mian Saqib Nisar. However, both parties could not succeed in recusing them from hearing cases related to them.\n\nHowever, there was no judicial order restraining them from hearing cases related to a particular party.\nIn CJP Isa\u2019s case, a larger bench led by CJP Gulzar Ahmed on Feb 11, 2021 held that Justice Isa should not hear cases involving the then PM Imran.\n\n\u201cThe Hon Chief Justice of Pakistan, therefore, observed that in these circumstances it would not be proper for the Hon Judge (Justice Isa) to hear the matter considering that he had already filed a petition against the Prime Minister of Pakistan, in his personal capacity. Therefore, to uphold the principle of un-biasness and impartiality, it would be in the interest of justice that the Hon Judge should not hear matters involving the Prime Minister of Pakistan,\u201d says a five-page written order in a case related to a news story citing him as announcing allocation of Rs500 million to all lawmakers ahead of the Senate polls.\n\nThe lawyers, however, are wondering as to why the PTI is agitating this issue as Justice Isa is hearing the party cases after taking charge as the CJP.\n\nThe PTI lawyers showed that they completely trusted him. Secondly, the apex court already ruled that only the judge himself could decide about allegations of biasness against him.\n\nEven the Balochsitan Bar Council through Hamid Khan advocate had filed a review petition against the court\u2019s Feb 11, 2011 order barring Justice Isa from hearing cases concerning Imran. The review petition is still pending.\n\nThe situation changed after the Jan 13 order wherein the bench led by CJP Isa held that PTI\u2019s intra-party elections were held as illegal.\n\nSubsequently, the PTI was deprived of its election symbol. Later, the PTI legal team was disappointed with the SC\u2019s decision and withdrew the contempt petition against the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and the executive authorities for not implementing the court\u2019s order to provide a level-playing field to the party during the elections.\n\nIt is being witnessed that the parties could not succeed to get relief through filing of objections on the judges. Likewise, when the PDM-led government was showing mistrust of former CJP Bandial, the superior bars led by the Independent Group was backing it.\n\nHowever, now the bar led by the same group was fully supporting CJP Isa.\n\nEven they will never endorse Imran\u2019s objections on IHC CJ Farooq.\n\nIt is noted that several lawyers are not satisfied about the judiciary\u2019s role in recent elections wherein there are serious allegations of rigging, implications of Jan 13 order wherein the PTI is facing difficulty to get reserved seats, allowing the trial of civilians in military courts by suspending the SC judgment, arrest of the PTI female activists etc.\n\nSomehow, the PTI needs to understand that the judiciary is the only institution which redresses its grievances. When the PTI's relationship was cordial with the security establishment, the superior courts were giving it relief.\n\n"

They also filed petitions seeking suspension of their conviction and sentences.\n\nA division bench comprising IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb resumed hearing these petitions on Thursday.\n\nDuring the proceedings, Justice Aurangzeb noted that the IHC has already issued an order highlighting the reasons as to why the suspension of conviction is so rarely allowed in criminal cases.\n\n\u201cWe are bound to abide by that order. As the order has already been challenged in the Supreme Court, we will wait for the apex court to decide that matter. We will, therefore, defer your request [for suspension of Imran Khan\u2019s conviction and sentence] for an indefinite period,\u201d he said.\n\nThe prosecutor for the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), the respondent in the gifts case, told the court that NAB special prosecutor Amjad Pervaiz could not attend the hearing due to the death of a relative. He requested the court to defer the hearing until the second week of March.\n\nThe assistant attorney general also told the bench that two special prosecutors were supposed to be appointed to represent the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), the respondent in the cipher case.\n\nHe also requested the court to adjourn the matter, noting that the FIA has written to the Ministry of Law for hiring the special prosecutors.\n\nImran\u2019s lawyer, Salman Safdar, told the bench that the trial court concluded the proceedings in a hurry and did not allow the accused to present his case.\n\n"

            "Text": "\u00a0The Peshawar High Court (PHC) has sought a reply from the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) within seven days while hearing a petition filed by the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) for the allocation of reserved seats to the party in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), Punjab, and national legislatures.\n\nA division bench comprising Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim and Justice Waqar Ahmad on Thursday took up a writ petition filed by the SIC, a little-known political party which is now in a position to form a government in the K-P thanks to the inclusion of PTI-backed candidates after the Feb 8 vote.\n\nThe PTI faced a setback when an ECP decision stripped it of its iconic election symbol just weeks before the polls, rendering the party unable to contest elections as a political entity.\n\nPTI candidates had to contest the general elections as independents. However, these independents managed to outstrip all other parties in the National Assembly, Punjab Assembly, and the K-P Assembly.\n\nAs per the Constitution, independent candidates have to join a political party within three days of the general elections, and the PTI-backed candidates joined the SIC after an agreement.\n\nThe SIC later approached the ECP for the allocation of reserved seats to its members in various legislatures. The ECP, however, reserved its order on the SIC petition on Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile, the party moved a writ petition in the PHC through advocate Shah Faisal Utmankhel, nominating both the ECP and the Provincial Election Commissioner as respondents.\n\nIt contended that the non-allocation of reserved seats for female and minority lawmakers was illegal and in violation of fundamental rights.\n\nIt noted that if the party, which has a majority in the K-P province, is not allocated the reserved seats, such an omission would amount to a violation of the Constitution.\n\n\"[This] would amount to extreme injustice to the mandate given by the general public and would violate the fundamental rights of women and minorities.\n\nThe SIC requested the PHC to direct the ECP to allocate SIC its reserved seats in proportion to its general seats in the K-P Assembly, the Punjab Assembly, and the National Assembly.\n\nDuring the hearing of the petition, the petitioner stated that according to Articles 51 and 106 of the Constitution, parliament will only be complete when seats for women and minorities are also filled, as without them, neither the Assembly nor the Senate sessions can be convened.\n\n\"This is a matter of public interest because if women are not given their reserved seats in the K-P Assembly, it will be tantamount to the absence of women's representation in the assembly, even though they have been successful in the election with a significant majority.\n\n\"Therefore, it is essential that the party is allocated the reserved seats so that their representation can be accompanied by addressing their issues on an urgent constitutional and legal basis.\"\n\nAfter the initial hearing of the petition, the court asked the ECP to submit a response within 7 days.\n\n"

            "Text": "The caretaker Balochistan government on Thursday imposed an emergency in Gwadar and declared it a disaster zone after heavy rains triggered devastating flash floods in the coastal city.\n\nIn a statement, Balochistan caretaker Information Jan Achakzai said the provincial government had decided to declare Gwadar calamity-hit and impose an emergency, acknowledging the severity of the situation.\nAccording to Achakzai, caretaker Balochistan Chief Minister Ali Mardan Khan Domki has already signed a summary for this purpose and a notification will be issued soon.\n\nHe added that the interim CM would personally monitor relief activities in all the rain-hit areas of the province.\n\nFollowing the devastating flash floods in Gwadar, triggered by heavy rainfall that lashed the area for several hours and left thousands of residents homeless as well as in dire need of assistance as the downpour caused widespread destruction, Haq Do Tehreek Balochistan (HDTB) chief Maulana Hidayatur Rehman, who won the election for PB-24, on Thursday reached the coastal city -- where his constituency was located -- to coordinate rescue operations.\n\nThe torrential downpours not only inundated residential areas but also disrupted essential services including the power supply and already strained sewerage system, adding to the miseries of the locals.\n\nWith the situation growing increasingly dire, urgent measures are being taken to provide shelter, food, and medical aid to those affected by the calamity.\n\nThe rainwater inundated the streets of Gwadar with an alarming depth of six to seven feet.\n\nAccording to officials, Gwadar district received over 180 millimetres of rainfall over the past two days.\nThe coastal highway connecting Karachi with Gwadar was damaged because of the heavy rainfall, disrupting vehicular traffic.\n\nThe impact of the flash floods has reverberated beyond Gwadar, with heavy rainfall also battering Quetta and other parts of Balochistan\n\nIn the statement, the interim provincial information minister said relief and rescue operations were under way in coastal areas hit by heavy rains.\n\n\u201cTeams of the district administration, army, navy, Provincial Disaster Management Authority, Levies and National Disaster Management Authority are working day and night in Gwadar, Ormara, Pasni and other areas,\u201d he added.\n\nHe continued that all available resources were being used to drain the accumulated rainwater and for the well-being of the affected population.\n\nAchakzai expressed concerns about the major damage to Gwadar\u2019s fundamental infrastructure because of the continuous rains.\n\n\u201cAccording to the latest information, two out of six disconnected roads from Gwadar city have been restored, and around 300 individuals have been safely relocated,\u201d he maintained.\n\nHe added that around 80 boats had been dispatched to the area for evacuation.\n\n\u201cAssessments are being conducted in the area to determine the extent of damage,\u201d the statement read.\n\nSeparately, caretaker CM Domki said that rescue operations were under way in the rain-hit areas with the help of the army.\n\nIn a statement, he observed that an \u201cunusual and disastrous situation\u201d had emerged because of the heavy downpours.\n\nIn light of the adverse weather conditions, the Balochistan education department has taken the proactive step of ordering the closure of all private and government-run schools across the province, prioritising the safety of students and staff.\n\nRelentless rainfall and hail continued to lash Gwadar and its surrounding areas, compounding the challenges faced by rescue teams and exacerbating the plight of the affected population.\n\nFurthermore, the rains in Nagor have led to the breach of protective dams, exacerbating the already precarious situation.\nAmid the devastation, efforts are under way to provide relief and assistance to those grappling with the aftermath of the flash floods.\n\n"

        },
        "Details": {
            "Text": "The interim government has failed to broaden the tax base, with the number of income tax return filers shrinking 35% to just under 3.9 million compared to last year, amid challenges to achieve monthly tax collection targets.\n\nThe caretaker government, whose rule has now effectively ended with the oath of the new National Assembly, also remained unable to tax retailers, neither was it able to suspend the mobile phone connections of non-filers of income tax returns. There was hope that, unlike politicians, technocrats would move against powerful retailers.\n\nSources told The Express Tribune that, contrary to the hype created around bringing reforms in the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), the figures of income tax return filers have significantly dropped.\n\nThis is the second consecutive month in which the government has missed the monthly tax collection target. However, due to better collection in the previous months, the FBR has somehow managed to achieve the eight-month tax target of Rs5.83 trillion.\n\nThe FBR, whose performance remained exceptionally good during the first half of the fiscal year, started facing problems from January this year. This coincided with the interim finance minister\u2019s attempts to restructure the tax machinery despite opposition from some cabinet members and questions over the mandate of the caretakers. The Election Commission of Pakistan also advised the interim government against restructuring the tax machinery.\n\nShrinking Tax Base\n\nIn November last year, Pakistan had shared a plan with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to increase the number of income tax return filers to 6.5 million by June 2024. The interim government decided to set up district tax offices to expand the base by shifting half of the tax force in the regional tax offices to these new offices.\n\nThe Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) had also given the interim government the target to increase the tax base by at least one million during the current fiscal year over last year\u2019s figure. When these targets were set, about 5 million people had filed tax returns for the last year.\n\nAs of the end of February, sources said, the total income tax returns received by the FBR stood at just 3.88 million \u2013 a number that was 2.1 million or 35% short compared to tax year 2022. The government faced a reduction in the number of filers across all four categories: companies, associations of persons, business individuals, and the salaried class.\n\nHowever, senior FBR officials hope that the figure will see a sharp jump in March after the publication of the Active Taxpayers List on Monday. All non-filers\u2019 names will be omitted from the new list, which will double the rate of withholding taxes on their transactions.\n\nDetails showed that compared to 92,704 associations that filed returns in the previous year, this year the figure has so far remained at 91,135. Similarly, in the last tax year, about 77,600 firms had filed their returns, which have now dropped to less than 72,000, showing a decline of about 8%.\n\nRead\u00a0Income taxation of SMEs\nThe major reduction in the number of filers was in the case of business individuals, as about 1.6 million or 43% fewer persons filed their income tax returns this year, said the sources. In the last tax year, about 3.8 million business individuals filed returns, which have now shrunk to 2.2 million.\n\nSimilarly, about 22% or 435,000 fewer salaried persons filed their returns this year. As against nearly 2 million salaried persons who filed returns last year, only 1.55 submitted their annual statements of wealth and income this year.\n\nThe FBR had sent a proposal to the finance minister to impose tax on retailers, but she left the matter for the next government, according to the sources. Similarly, a committee was also constituted to suspend the mobile phone connections of non-filers, but no order was issued in this regard.\n\nA senior FBR official said that despite the low number of filers, there were about 840,000 new filers this year, which showed the efforts of the tax machinery. Out of this, the big number was business individuals, as 510,000 business persons became return filers for the first time.\n\nNearly 11 million individuals and companies are registered with the FBR, but less than 7 million did not file their annual returns.\n\nTax Collection\n\nThe FBR has managed to achieve its eight-month tax collection target of Rs5.829 trillion, thanks to better performance in the first six months of the fiscal year. A timely decision by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the super tax case also helped the FBR get Rs6 billion on the last day, which in return became the reason to achieve the eight-month target.\n\nThe FBR, for the second time in this fiscal year, missed the monthly target by a margin of Rs33 billion or 4.6%. Under an arrangement with the IMF, Pakistan may have to kick in a mini-budget if the monthly collection falls short of the target by more than 1%.\n\nThe tax authorities attribute the shortfall in the monthly collections to the interim finance minister\u2019s drive to restructure the FBR and the increased number of holidays in February.\n\nThe provisional collection figures showed that the FBR has so far collected Rs5.83 trillion, showing an increase of Rs1.34 trillion or 30% over the collection made during the same period of the previous fiscal year.\n\nTill December, the FBR\u2019s management was confident of achieving the Rs9.415 trillion annual target despite a slump in imports. Income tax collection amounted to Rs2.76 trillion, up over Rs800 billion, or 41%, during the first eight months of this fiscal year.\n\nSales tax and customs duties remained the weakest areas. Sales tax collection reached over Rs2 trillion, which was Rs316 billion, or 19%, more than the last fiscal year. The FBR collected Rs352 billion in FED, and the collection of customs duty stood at Rs710 billion.\n\n"

However, The Express Tribune has obtained a copy of the letter. Addressed to IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, in the letter, PTI claimed that it did not want to stand in the way of any global lender\u2019s facility for Pakistan.\n\nHowever, the party stressed the need for the necessary reforms along with the facility to facilitate the repayment of the loans.\n\n\u201cThe IMF can negotiate only with an elected government that has the confidence of the people,\u201d it stated. The party urged the Washington-based lender to take into account its policy guidance note prepared in 1997.\n\n\u201cIt is a well-established reality that a government without legitimate representation, when imposed upon a country, carries no moral authority to govern, and, in particular, carry out taxation measures.\u201d\n\nAPP WITH ADDITIONAL input FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT\nPublished in The Express Tribune, March 1st, 2024\n"

The provincial government is already acquiring a significant amount of energy from such renewable projects.\n\nHe also mentioned that the Sindh government and K-Electric are collaborating on several alternative energy projects. KE set up two projects of 25MW each in the Hub area three years ago. The Karachi-based private energy firm is harnessing wind energy from the wind corridor located in Gharo in the province.\n\nSharing findings of a study titled \u2018Examining KE\u2019s Cost of Inaction in Deploying Renewables\u2019, Hammad Ali, an analyst at Renewables First specialising in the power market, said, \u201cKE\u2019s generation fleet is heavily dependent on thermal power generation. Timely decisions (on renewable energy projects) by KE can still save up to $4.51 billion in the next seven years.\u201d\n\nRead\u00a0\u2018Three waste-to-energy projects to be launched\u2019\nHe mentioned that previous decisions by the Karachi-based power utility company to procure thermal generation sources instead of cheaper renewable alternatives had resulted in losses of over $250 million in terms of the cost of missed opportunities.\n\nFormer NEPRA chairman, Tauseef Farooqi said that the latest license given to KE is non-exclusive, and any private entity can now enter the market in Karachi as a competitor.\n\nHe emphasised that KE should have been unbundled from the very first day because generation, transmission, and distribution are three very different departments that require separate attention.\n\nHe regretted that there was absolutely zero planning in Pakistan\u2019s power sector before the introduction of Indicative Generation Capacity Expansion Plan a few years ago.\n\nSpeaking of the potential of renewables in lowering costs for ordinary consumers and industrial users alike, he stressed that the country and utilities must now move towards a competitive, transparent, and open market mechanism as proposed under the Competitive Trading Bilateral Contracts Market\n\nProgramme Director of Net Zero Pakistan, Somanul Haq, said his organisation is a coalition of industries committed to net zero emissions by the end of 2050.\n\nHe further highlighted that the export industry in Pakistan is increasingly coming under pressure from global supply chains, and there is growing demand for Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) in the country, with 300GWh to be sold this year alone.\n\nHe said companies in Pakistan are shutting down every day due to more and more expensive fuels and unfavourable conditions.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, March 1st, 2024\n"

            "Text": "In what appeared to be a dress rehearsal of the election of the prime minister, the newly-stitched ruling alliance passed the first test of showing its numerical strength on Friday when their nominees for the speaker and deputy speaker slots sailed through without any hiccup.\nThe Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and Pakistan Peoples Party Parliamentarian (PPPP) clinched the two top positions in the National Assembly as PML-N\u2019s Ayaz Sadiq and PPPP\u2019s Ghulam Mustafa Shah were elected speaker and deputy speaker, respectively, on NA\u2019s second day of the inaugural session.\nThe result of the election of the speaker and deputy speaker was a forgone conclusion as both Sadiq and Shah were the joint candidates of the PML-N, PPPP, and MQM-P, among others, who have clear numerical superiority over the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI)-backed candidates sitting in assembly under the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) banner.\nSadiq and Shah defeated the SIC\u2019s Amir Dogar and Junaid Akbar with a comfortable margin as Sadiq bagged 199 votes while Shah secured 197 votes during speaker and deputy speaker\u2019s elections.\nDogar got 91 while Akbar secured 92 votes during the polls. Apparently, the day witnessed elections on key posts but the actual task was to check if the numbers were complete before the March 3 elections when the lawmakers would elect a new leader of the house \u2013 the new prime minister.\nA notable positive highlight of the day occurred when Sadiq embraced Dogar upon winning the speaker election. The moment stood out in contrast to the remainder of the day's proceedings, which were tainted by the customary exchange of slogans against each other's leaders and resorting to personal attacks.\nHowever, in a matter of seconds, PTI-SIC member Sher Afzal Marwat began vociferously chanting the slogan \"mandate chor (thief)\" as Sadiq engaged with PTI-SIC members seated in the front row.\nSimilar to the opening day of the inaugural session a day ago, the echoes of slogans such as \"chor\" (thief) and \"ghari chor\" (watch thief) persisted in the assembly hall all day. The chants were among other slogans voiced in support of two major political players: PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif and PTI's founding chairman Imran Khan.\nSIC members kept resorting to calling opponents \"chor\" (thief) \u2014 a reference to corruption allegations that have been chasing Sharifs and others over the years \u2014 while the PMLN-led alliance kept responding with Ghari Chor \u2014 watch thief \u2014 a reference to the Toshakhana case where Imran has been accused to selling a watch gifted by Saudi royals.\nFollowing the election of the speaker, outgoing Speaker NA Raja Pervez Ashraf administered the oath to Sadiq. Subsequently, Sadiq presided over the deputy speaker's elections and administered the oath to Shah after he secured an easy victory.\nThroughout the day, Ashraf delivered his farewell speech, Sadiq assumed charge from him, Dogar delivered a scathing speech, and Mahmood Khan Achakzai's address was characterised as belligerent.\nAchakzai not only called for an end to powerful stakeholders' roles in politics but also demanded the release of the PTI founding chairman.\nAshraf has served from April 2022 till March 1, 2024. He had replaced PTI\u2019s then-speaker Asad Qaiser after then-PTI\u2019s PM Imran Khan was ousted through a vote of no-confidence. His 23-month-long tenure has ended. In his farewell speech, he thanked the party heads for expressing trust in him.\nIn his first address to the 16th National Assembly after assuming the role of speaker, Sadiq emphasised the importance of collective efforts for the betterment of Pakistan. Speaker Sadiq underlined the significance of unity among members of the House, regardless of political affiliations.\n\u201cBoth the government and opposition play vital roles in the parliament. All members must set aside their differences and work together constructively to propel Pakistan forward,\u201d he stated.\nRead Nawaz chooses Ayaz for NA speaker\nReaffirming his commitment to constitutional principles and the rule of law, Speaker Sadiq pledged to fulfil his duties with integrity, ensuring the impartial functioning of the National Assembly.\nOpenly inviting all members to engage in constructive dialogue, Speaker Sadiq urged the members of the House to refrain from personal criticism, promoting a spirit of unity and cooperation. \"This House thrives on the contributions of every member, and I urge all to participate in constructive debate for the greater good,\" he stated.\nAfter the oath, Sadiq took charge and assumed the office of the speaker NA, amid desk thumping. \u201cSay thank you to boots as well,\u201d PTI-SIC leader Marwat quipped as the newly-elected NA speaker thanked different party leaders as well as all those whom he finds close to his heart.\nSadiq, in a polite tone, urged the newly-elected lawmakers to criticise the decisions but should refrain from resorting to personal attacks. Offering that his office was open for all, he urged them to work together for the betterment of the country.\nThroughout the day, PMLN supremo Nawaz Sharif entered the assembly hall only to cast a vote for the speaker and deputy speaker amid loud slogans of \u201csher, sher\u201d \u2013 lion, lion. On both occasions, Sharif was surrounded by a group of party leaders.\nMeanwhile, Asif Ali Zardari, the PPPP President and would-be President of the country, also cast his vote. His son Bilawal Bhutto accompanied him.\nNot a single slogan was raised either in favour or against Zardari even when he walked past the benches where SIC members were seated.\nShahbaz Sharif, the would-be candidate for the PM\u2019s slot, also cast a vote amid sloganeering from both sides. Shehbaz was surrounded by his party members while PTI-SIC while holding Imran Khan\u2019s posters started shouting slogans standing near the speaker\u2019s desk.\nPTI-backed candidates, including Sher Afzal Marwat, also held shoes in their hands while shouting \"chor chor\".\nPML-N and PTI-backed candidates were standing against each other when Shehbaz decided to leave the assembly hall after he cast his vote. Subsequently, the sloganeering suddenly ended and legislators went back to their seats.\nMeanwhile, Dogar while congratulating Sadiq said that PTI-SIC participated despite being deprived of seats, including reserve seats. Had the results come as per FORM 45, Dogar said, his votes would have been 225.\nTill this morning, Dogar revealed, 91 members who voted for him were under severe pressure but still decided to stand by him till the end.\n\u201cThis wasn\u2019t election but selection,\u201d Dogar said while referring to general elections and questioned what was the need to spend Rs50 billion on elections if the decision was to be made by those tasked to count votes rather than those who cast them.\nHe demanded to give back PTI-SIC won seats, saying the party was ready to cooperate.\nReferring to the speaker\u2019s offer of reconciliation, Dogar while paying tribute to Imran Khan\u2019s struggle said that Imran has given the go-ahead for reconciliation but has linked it with the demand that PTI\u2019s mandate should first be handed back.\nMeanwhile, a group of PTI-SIC members initiated chants of \"Lota, Lota\" when Aleem Khan, their former party colleague who currently leads IPP, approached to cast his vote.\n"

            "Text": "Ali Amin Gandapur, a diehard loyalist of jailed PTI founder Imran Khan, was elected the 20th chief minister of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa with a two-thirds majority on Friday in a provincial assembly session which witnessed vociferous sloganeering in favour of \u201cQaidee No 804\u201d, a reference to the former prime minister who has been serving an extended jail term at Adiala Jail on several charges that his beleaguered party claims are all trumped up.\nThe election for the provincial chief executive was a face-off between Ali Amin Gandapur and the opposition\u2019s Dr Abidullah, but ended up being a one-sided affair as Gandapur bagged 90 votes, while his challenger could grab only 16 votes. Lawmakers from Maulana Fazlur Rehman\u2019s eponymous faction of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam stayed away from the process.\nThe assembly session, which started with one-and-a-half-hour delay, was officiated by Speaker Babar Salim Swati. He restricted the entry of unauthorised people into the house before the commencement of the session, while media persons were guided to the press gallery.\nThe speaker allowed absenting MPAs five minutes to ensure attendance. Soon after this hiatus, bells were rung in the assembly for five minutes and the main hall doors were closed soon after. Initially, four MPAs: Ali Amin Gandapur, Hisham Inamullah, Zark Khan, and Abidullah, had submitted their nominations for the chief minister's election. However, Khan and Inamullah later withdrew their papers, leaving Gandapur and Inamullah in the race.\nSpeaker Swati explained the election process whereby those voting for Dr Abidullah would go to Lobby No 1, while those voting for Gandapur would go to Lobby No 2. The speaker then summoned the MPAs back into the house to announce the results, whereby Gandapur was declared the winner with an overwhelming majority. Gandapur was formally sworn in soon after his election as the chief minister.\nWhile speaking on the floor of the house after securing the office, Gandapur spelled out the priorities of his administration. He announced the revival of the Sehat Card, something that has politically benefited the PTI immensely in the impoverished province. He also announced the reopening of Panahgahs and Langarkhanas that Imran Khan had opened throughout the country for the shelter-less and the destitute as part of his vision for an Islamic welfare state.\nThe new chief minister called for immediate resignation of the chief election commissioner for his failure to hold transparent and credible elections. \u201cI would offer myself first if any electoral fraud is established against me. Then I shall offer my province,\u201d he added. Gandapur called for an audit of the vote, saying that stealing a mandate is not only a violation of the Constitution but also a betrayal to the public.\nRead Gandapur, leaders strategise for govt formation\nGandapur said that he was cognizant of the myriad challenges faced by K-P, a province wrecked by a deadly reign of the Taliban terrorism. He stressed the establishment of peace and security as the foremost task, asserting that without peace, a good roads infrastructure becomes irrelevant. He promised to reform those who resort to terrorism.\nGandapur singled out corruption as the most serious challenge that gnaws at the roots of good governance. He called on all elected representatives of his party to pledge under an oath that they would carry forward a crusade of their party chief against corruption in the province.\nHe said that nations could not stand on their feet by borrowing money from lenders. \u201cWe will increase our revenues by taxing the rich to provide relief to the poor,\u201d he added.\u00a0 The new CM pledged to stand up for the rights of the province. \u201cIf we (K-P) are denied our due share, then nobody will be allowed to exploit our mineral resources,\u201d he said amid thunderous applause from party supporters in the visitors\u2019 gallery.\n\u201cIf we are not given what belongs to us, then this august house should be ready to wrest its rights,\u201d Gandapur said in a veiled reference to the federal government led by PTI\u2019s arch nemesis whom it accuses of stealing its mandate in connivance with the powers that be.\nGandapur also expressed his gratitude to Imran Khan for reposing trust in him and assured that he would utilise all his energies to live up to Khan\u2019s expectations. He lamented that Khan, who is a proponent of freedom, justice, and welfare of the common man, has been \u201cunjustly imprisoned\u201d. Gandapur demanded an open and fair trial for Khan. The PTI claims that its founder has been denied his constitutional right to fair trial and was jailed on trumped-up charges through unprecedented marathon trials in a haste.\nThe new chief minister, who himself is facing several court cases, slammed the system for not changing despite the efforts from the PTI. In the same breath, he warned: \u201cIf we fail to change the system, then the people will hold us accountable.\u201d\nGandapur called on everyone to focus on the mandate given by the people and urged the opposition to raise their voices for the rights of the province inside and outside the assembly. However, he warned that if the opposition tried to create unnecessary roadblocks on the province\u2019s march to progress, then his administration would deal with them accordingly.\n"

            "Text": "\u00a0\nOn Wednesday, President Dr Arif Alvi, while signing a summary sent by Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar for summoning the inaugural session of the 16th National Assembly, expressed dissatisfaction with the \"tone and tenor\" of the interim PM. Dr Alvi noted that Kakar had resorted to \"unacceptable language\" and baseless allegations.\n\nA press release issued by the President\u2019s Secretariat on Wednesday night stated that the president summoned the NA session with some reservations. \"The president accorded his approval while keeping in view the mandate and implications of the timeline given in Article 91(2) and subject to some reservations and expecting the resolution of the issue of the reserved seats before the 21st day.\"\n\nDr Alvi had earlier returned a summary moved by the caretaker government due to the non-allocation of reserved seats to the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), a party comprising PTI-backed independent lawmakers. However, the president signed the second such summary in a change of heart.\n\nThe statement said, \"While responding to the summary\u2026, the president said that the tone and tenor of the honorable caretaker prime minister of Pakistan was unfortunate.\"\n\nHe took exception to the contents of the summary, stating, \"Summaries are not usually addressed in this way. It is sad that the chief executive of the country addresses the head of the state in the first form and resorts to unacceptable language and allegations without any substance.\"\n\nThe statement said the president believed and always maintained the principle of objectivity and neutrality in accordance with his oath and responsibilities under the Constitution and could not be oblivious of some incongruities in the electoral and government formation processes.\n\nIt noted that the president has to keep national interest in his view, for cohesiveness and betterment of the nation, adding that the return of the first summary was very much in accordance with the provisions of Article 48(1) of the Constitution.\n\"It is not understood on what grounds it [the decision to return the first summary] has been taken as a partisan act, though it was also aimed at the completion of the National Assembly in accordance with Article 51 of the Constitution, so that people of Pakistan are not deprived of taking part in the executive decisions of the country through their representatives as enshrined in the Objectives Resolution.\"\n\nThe president stated that he did not wish to indulge himself or delve into the baseless accusations of constitutional violation attributed in the summary.\n\n\u00a0\u201cIt was needless to remind that a caretaker prime minister/set-up is merely responsible to ensure conducive conditions for the peaceful, fair and transparent holding of general elections, within the framework of the Constitution and the timeline on which many quarters had expressed reservations.\n\nThe president stated that he fully realized that the Constitution of Pakistan must be implemented in letter and spirit, though it was not being done so in case of the existing electoral process.\n\nHe reiterated his stance about the provisions of the Constitution such as Article 51 and clause 2 of Article 91 to be followed by all and given effect in letter and spirit.\n\n"

After swinging back and forth, the KSE-100 index closed with gains of nearly 140 points.\nInvestor sentiment revived initially but soon volatility gripped the market. However, it picked up momentum with a midday rally owing to substantial stock buying in auto and banking sectors.\nResultantly, the KSE-100 index touched its intra-day high at 62,600.12. But the market\u2019s strength proved short-lived as investors grabbed the opportunity to book profit, pushing the KSE-100 to the intra-day low at 61,896.01.

            "Text": "The Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) has ruled that militancy in Pakistan is against the Paigham-i-Pakistan communique, a fatwa jointly issued by 1,800 religious scholars of all the various schools of thought in 2018. The CII has also reiterated that suicide attacks are un-Islamic.\nIn a statement issued on Wednesday after its 235th meeting, the council stated that armed actions by some elements are contrary to the unanimous fatwas/declarations issued by all madrasa boards and the Paigham-i-Pakistan. \u201cArmed actions are only the prerogative of the state,\u201d it said.\nThe CII expressed hope that parliament elected after the upcoming elections will endorse the declarations of the Paigham-i-Pakistan and make efforts for effective legislation in this regard.\nIn the meeting, the council \u2013 in response to a reference sent by the president \u2013 approved a detailed code of ethics regarding the religiously permissible methods of protest.\nThe CII noted that every method of protest that is free from religiously prohibited actions and evils and does not inherently involve any other unlawful or forbidden activities, is permissible.\n\u201cIt is not permissible to endanger lives, cause harm or distress to people, or cause damage to private or public property during protests.\n\u201cForcing people to participate in protests against their will, using abusive language, indiscriminate mixing of genders, making false accusations, spreading lies, false news, and rumors, etc, are all impermissible actions,\u201d it noted.\nAccording to the CII, destroying or causing harm to public or private property for the sake of protest is also not permitted. The council emphasized that government properties are not owned by individuals but collectively by the entire nation\n\u00a0\u201cIf during a protest, someone's property is damaged, the ruling is that if the person or group causing the damage is identified, they are obligated to compensate for the loss.\n\u201cIf the perpetrators cannot be identified, then it is the responsibility of the current government to compensate for the loss from the public treasury to the best of its ability,\u201d the statement said.\nIt said it is never permissible or lawful to harm or cause damage to any person during a protest, regardless of whether they are a government employee or anyone else.\n\u201cThe life, property, and honor of a Muslim are sacred and are even more esteemed than the sacred Kaaba. It is the responsibility of the organizers of the protest to ensure this and to impress upon the participants to completely refrain from any form of violence and terrorism.\n\u201cProtest organizers must ensure that no harm comes to any individual. If protesters go beyond the organizers' control and it becomes impossible to maintain peace during the protest, such protests should never be allowed to happen,\u201d it added.\nIn response to some questions raised by the Faizabad sit-in commission, the council noted that declaring someone a non-believer (kafir) is an extremely sensitive matter with severe consequences. Therefore, rushing to make such a declaration is never appropriate.\nSimilarly, it is incumbent upon individuals to exercise extreme caution before labeling someone as a non-believer based on their statements or actions.\n\u201cGranting such authority to anyone and everyone goes against the principles of religious teachings and the principles of wisdom and public interest,\u201d it added.\n"

            "Text": "With the intensification of the election campaign, a surge in violent clashes has marred the political landscape in Lahore.\nOver the past 10 days, at least four incidents of violence involving firearms have been reported.\nThe most recent incident occurred in Batapur on Tuesday night when an election campaign rally led by Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) candidate Malik Habib Awan was ambushed by opponents in Niror Village. Five people were injured in the incident.\nMalik Boda, the candidate\u2019s younger brother, along with his driver and gunman, were among the injured.\nOn Saturday night, a youth threw a shoe at former chief minister Hamza Shahbaz during an election campaign gathering in Badami Bagh.\nThe situation escalated as PML-N supporters captured the suspect, reportedly torturing him before handing him over to the police.\nSubsequently, they allegedly engaged in aerial firing and attacked a TLP office. The youth reportedly belonged to TLP.\nIn an FIR registered at Badami Bagh police station, TLP leader Akram Rizvi accused suspects Riaz Khan and Atif alias Toka of issuing threats before attacking their office in PP-147 Madni Chowk. They shot and injured Akram Rizvi and his supporters, identified as Usama, Mushtaq, Afzal Tahir, Tabib Akhtar Butt, and Afaq Butt.\nAlthough PML-N leaders withdrew charges against the youth, and he was reportedly released after a written assurance, a video circulated on social media falsely claiming the youth was tortured to death by PML-N supporters and police in custody.\nIn another incident, PML-N workers allegedly fired at a PPP office in NA-126 Rasoolpur village.\nAkhtar alias Akhtari, Faizan, and 12 other unidentified persons were nominated in a case over charges of resorting to firing at the office.\nOn January 26, unidentified suspects set fire to a Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) office on Jail Road, recovering a man with burn injuries from the premises.\nInitial police investigations suggest that suspected burglars entered the office to steal valuables while smoking, leading to the accidental fire.\nTwo weeks prior, Pakistan People Party (PPP) claimed that their office in Green Town was attacked with petrol bombs by unidentified suspects.\nLahore DIG Operations Ali Nasir Rizvi assured that Lahore police are taking swift and consistent actions to ensure peaceful elections.\nWith Section 144 imposed, strict measures are in place against the display and carrying of arms, as well as aerial firing.\nOver 26,000 policemen will be deployed according to a comprehensive security plan.\nEarlier on Tuesday, Punjab Election Commissioner Ijaz Anwar Chauhan paid a visit to the DC office to evaluate preparations for the upcoming general election.\nHe specifically reviewed the election monitoring cell, ballot collection, and the record rooms.\n"

Based on newly-obtained information, terrorists fired rockets at the Levies police station jail and train station in Mach on the last day of operations. They also targeted three individuals in a truck, martyring Levies official Lance Naik Rahmatullah, a resident of Sakna Taunsa Sharif.\nSimilarly, sources state that three young men who hailed from the Gadai neighbourhood of the city, including Kamil Haider, Ali Raza and Muhammad Ahmad, were also martyred in these attacks.\nThe bodies of the martyrs will reach Dera Ghazi Khan today, while funeral prayers for the three youths will be offered in their native Gadai. The funeral prayers of Lance Naik Rehmatullah were performed in Taunsa. Flowers were showered and the martyr was laid to rest with full military honours.\nHis heirs expressed how proud they were of their son who sacrificed his life for the sake of the country.

The swift pace of the selection process, with decisions already made but names kept under wraps, has sparked widespread suspicion regarding the transparency and integrity of the entire selection process.\nAgainst this backdrop, it is imperative to reflect on the broader context of reforms within the higher education sector in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. Last November, the Caretaker Chief Minister, Justice (retd) Syed Arshad Hussain Shah, convened a meeting at the Chief Minister House, signaling intent to addressing the myriad challenges plaguing universities across the province. \nRead:\u00a0K-P universities tackle financial woes\nKey officials, including Caretaker Provincial Minister for Higher Education Dr. Qasim Jan and Caretaker Minister for ST&IT Dr. Najeebullah, deliberated on a range of issues, from financial sustainability to the quality of education and research initiatives.\nCentral to these discussions was the recognition of the financial crisis afflicting universities, attributed in part to superfluous appointments and excessive staffing. The urgent need to halt this trend was emphasized, reflecting a broader imperative to ensure the fiscal viability and long-term sustainability of higher educational institutions. To this end, a committee, led by the minister for higher education, was proposed to oversee the formulation and implementation of key decisions and proposals arising from the meeting, in collaboration with relevant stakeholders.\nMoreover, the meeting underscored the critical importance of appointing vice chancellors with not only impeccable credentials and legal compliance but also demonstrable administrative acumen. The activation of a search committee on an emergency basis was ordered by the caretaker chief minister, highlighting the urgency of filling these leadership vacancies with individuals capable of steering universities through these tumultuous times.\nBeyond administrative reforms, there was a strong emphasis on fostering a culture of research excellence aligned with international standards and market demands. \n"

            "Text": "The outlawed Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) established a new base in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (KP) in mid-2023, revealed a new UN report, which sheds light on close ties between not only the TTP and the Afghan Taliban but also the anti-Pakistani groups and al Qaeda.\nThe 33rd report compiled by the UN Monitoring Team was submitted to the UN Security Council last week providing details about the presence of terrorist organisations in Afghanistan and their linkage with the Kabul regime.\n\u201cA new TTP base was established in mid-2023 in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, where 66 TTP individuals trained as suicide bombers,\u201d the 23-page report read.\nIt was important to highlight that the new base was established merely months after Pakistan allowed hundreds of TTP terrorists to return as part of the confidence-building measure.\nIt was evident that the returning TTP terrorists instead of laying down arms regrouped and posed a greater threat to Pakistan\u2019s security.\nThe increased TTP attacks prompted authorities to withdraw from the peace efforts brokered by the Afghan Taliban.\n\u201c[The] TTP was further strengthened and emboldened, increasing attacks with a broader degree of autonomy to manoeuvre,\u201d the UN report said.\n\u201cThe Taliban are generally sympathetic to TTP aims,\u201d it further said, corroborating evidence on the ground that the TTP and the Afghan Taliban are two sides of the same coin.\nAnother revelation made in the report is the close nexus between the TTP and al Qaeda.\n\u201cBesides supplying weapons and equipment, Taliban rank and file, al Qaeda core and AQIS fighters assisted the TTP forces in cross-border attacks,\u201d the report noted.\nDespite Taliban instructing the TTP fighters not to participate in operations outside Afghanistan, many had done so with no apparent consequence, according to the report.\nThe report further revealed that some Taliban members also joined the TTP, perceiving a religious obligation to provide support.\nInterlocutors reported that the TTP members and their families receive regular aid packages from the Taliban.\nAlso importantly, the UN report said a notable development was the increase of Afghan nationals in the TTP ranks. This endorsed Pakistan\u2019s stance that an increasing number of Afghan nationals were involved in suicide attacks in the country.\nThe report also noted that the relationship between the Taliban and al Qaeda remained close, and the latter maintained a holding pattern in Afghanistan under the Taliban patronage.\n\u201cRegional states assess that the presence of al Qaeda\u2019s senior figures in the country has not changed and that the group continues to pose a threat in the region, and potentially beyond.\u201d\nThe al Qaeda was reported to have established up to eight new training camps in Afghanistan, including four in Ghazni, Laghman, Parwan and Uruzgan provinces, with a new base to stockpile weaponry in the Panjshir Valley. Some camps might be temporary.\nHakim al-Masri (not listed), based in Kunar province, is responsible for the training camps and conducting suicide bomber training for the TTP.\nThe UN report further said al Qaeda core and AQIS continue to provide training, ideological guidance, and support to the TTP.\nIn July 2023, al Qaeda reportedly issued orders for all vehicles used by the group to be gifted to the TTP owing to fear of being targeted by the United States of America. With the consent of senior al Qaeda leaders, AQIS selected approximately 15 commanders to assist the TTP with attacks in Pakistan.\nIn September, AQIS reportedly supplied armed fighters during the TTP attack in Chitral, Pakistan. The TTP morale increased following international attention on the September attack. Aside from anti-Pakistan operations, the TTP reportedly conducts assassinations of Taliban defecting to ISIL-K.\nIt also said the short-term detention of 70 to 200 TTP members and the relocation of personnel northward away from the border areas by the Taliban were assessed as deflecting pressure from Pakistan to contain the TTP.\nSimilarly, the report revealed that a newly formed Tehreek-e-Jihad Pakistan (TJP) is a front, providing the TTP with plausible deniability, to alleviate the pressure from Pakistan on the Taliban.\nThe TJP conducted several attacks in 2023, including one against Pakistani security forces in K-P on Dec 12, 2023.\nThe report said regional states expressed continuing concern for its collaboration with other terrorist groups, especially the TTP, in recruitment, training, planning attacks and posing a regional threat.\nOne member state reported al Qaeda core providing training and ideological guidance to ETIM/TIP.\nAnother member state, according to the report, assessed the strength of Majeed Brigade (MB) at 60 to 80 fighters, with recruitment focusing on female suicide bombers.\nA couple of member states reported MB cooperation with the TTP and the ISIL-K in training, weapons acquisition, intelligence-sharing and joint operations, although several other member states sought additional information in this regard.\nThe MB claimed several attacks targeting Pakistan\u2019s law enforcement agencies and Chinese personnel in Pakistan during the reported period.Pakistan reacts to UN report\nAt a weekly news briefing, Foreign Office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said Pakistan had been raising concerns that the terrorist groups and entities threatening the country had found refuge in Afghanistan.\n\u201cWe are concerned that these groups and entities have a free hand to attack Pakistan, and to sponsor terrorist activities inside Pakistan,\u201d she said.\n\u201cAnd we urge Afghanistan to take immediate and effective action against these terrorist entities, hand over their leadership to Pakistan, and those individuals who have been involved in terrorist activities inside Pakistan.\n"

            "Text": "\u00a0\nThe Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet will hold a meeting on Thursday (today) to review the revision of the rates of subsidised wheat to Gilgit-Baltistan among other matters.\nThe participants of the ECC meeting, chaired by interim Finance Minister Dr Shamshad Akhtar, will discuss a 13-point agenda.\nThe G-B government recently withdrew its decision to increase the price of subsidised wheat in the region after its residents staged protests and rallies for over a month. However, the Awami Action Committee (AAC) of the region rejected the G-B government\u2019s decision and announced continuing the protest campaign until all its 15 demands were met.\nIts other demands include the withdrawal of various taxes, suspension of the Finance Act 2022, ensuring G-B\u2019s share in the National Finance Commission (NFC) award, provision of land ownership rights to the locals, and cancellation of all leases granted to outsiders for exploration of minerals in the region.\nThe AAC has also demanded 80% royalty of Diamer-Bhasha Dam under net hydel profit should be given to the people of G-B, ensuring electricity supply to its residents as well as an end to the 22-hour power outage in the region.\nAccording to the agenda, the ECC will also review the demand and supply situation of wheat in the country in detail.\nThe meeting is also expected to approve the technical supplementary grant of Rs500 million for the Civil Aviation Authority. The grant will be spent on the modernisation of Pakistan Meteorological Department\u2019s (PMD) hydro-met services.\nRead:\u00a0G-B gov dashes to Islamabad on wheat subsidy\nThe summary of the technical supplementary grant of around Rs38.8 million for the International Reforms Cell of the Cabinet Division will be considered as well.\nThe ECC will further consider the summary of the permission to import the cattle of Sahiwal breed for the National Immunisation Programme.\nThe meeting is likely to approve the summary of a technical supplementary grant from a Japanese endowment for the construction of the flood-affected roads in the rural areas of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and the project of providing clean drinking water to the three union councils of Lahore.\nThe ECC will also consider the summary of providing additional funds of more than Rs1.59 billion to the finance ministry for consultancy services and recruitment of consultants for the current financial year.\nThe summary of the technical supplementary grant of Rs7.5 billion for federal education and professional training will also be discussed.\nThe participants of the meeting will further consider two summaries of technical supplementary grants of more than Rs560 million for the housing and works ministry.\nA technical supplementary grant of Rs4 billion will also be approved for the 7th Population and Housing Census.\nThe ECC will consider the summary in connection with giving cover to the local currency related to the difference in the value of the dollar and rupee for the use of budgetary foreign aid during the current financial year.\n"

            "Text": "\u00a0\nThe Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed an appeal challenging the rejection of nomination papers for a candidate from PP-244 Bahawalnagar constituency in the Punjab Assembly, citing the publication of the ballot papers.\nA three-member bench, led by Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, heard the appeal filed by Malik Muzaffar Khan. The petitioner's counsel argued that the rejection of the nomination papers was illegal.\nThe court, however, declared that the petitioner had delayed approaching the Supreme Court for review. It noted that if the decision of the election tribunal had been challenged promptly, relief could have been granted.\nSpecial Secretary of the Election Commission Zafar Iqbal informed the court that over 260 million ballot papers were printed for national and provincial constituencies. The large number of candidates necessitated the use of 2400 tons of paper for the ballot papers, with the printing process now concluded.\nInterestingly, a day earlier, another three-member bench headed by Justice Muneeb Akhtar ordered the approval of nomination papers for Sardar Shehbaz Siyal from NA-144 Khanewal, directing the allocation of an election symbol. This decision contradicted the dismissal of the appeal regarding PP-244, citing the publication of ballot papers.\nRead:\u00a0Supreme Court clears path for election\nIn its order, the court rejected the Election Commission of Pakistan's (ECP) excuse regarding the publication of nomination papers, stating it was unacceptable.\nJustice Muneeb Akhtar acknowledged the challenges faced by the ECP, but said that the court had to balance the difficulties of the electoral body with fundamental rights.\nIn a separate development, PTI leader and former minister Hammad Azhar withdrew his appeal against the rejection of nomination papers from NA-129 before the same bench.\nAzhar's counsel informed the court that he did not wish to pursue the case. Justice Shah questioned the reference to Article 62 (i)-F in the high court's decision, stating that the verdict had clarified its applicability.\nHammad Azhar's counsel withdrew the appeal, and the former minister announced his decision to abstain from the upcoming general elections.\n"

representatives of other agencies, ECP secretary and other senior officers attended the meeting hurriedly called to assess the security situation.\nRaja pointed out that ECP offices as well as election rallies were being attacked in the two provinces just a week before the general polls.\nHowever, he clarified that the polls would take place despite terrorism, security challenges, and the events affecting them.\nThe statement quoted the CEC as saying that foolproof security arrangements were being made for the polls and describing \u201cterrorism as the biggest enemy of the electoral process\u201d.\nRaja reiterated that the ECP was fully prepared to hold peaceful polls on their scheduled date, expressing the hope that the law enforcement agencies and Pakistan Army troops would manage the situation.\nHe expressed full confidence in the law enforcement agencies, saying that they would make all necessary administrative and security arrangements for the peaceful conduct of the general elections.\nThe CEC continued that elements interfering in the elections and disrupting the security situation would be dealt with strictly, adding that no leniency would be shown to anyone in this connection.\nHe advised the law enforcement agencies to be wary of attempts by various elements to take the law into their hands, especially during the counting process and announcement of the results.\nDuring the meeting, the interior secretary, chief secretaries and police chiefs of K-P and Balochistan; and representatives of intelligence agencies informed the CEC about all the security as well as administrative measures that had been taken to control the security situation across the country, especially in the two provinces, for peacefully conducting the general elections.\nThe Balochistan chief secretary and the police chief told the meeting that the provincial administration and security agencies were prepared to combat terrorism.\nThey briefed the commission about the ongoing operation against the terrorists.\nThe two officials assured the ECP that no political or non-political force would be allowed to obstruct the electoral process and those who did so would be \u201cdealt with iron hands\u201d.\nSimilarly, the K-P chief secretary and the police chief highlighted the security measures taken in the province in connection with the elections, while highlighting the threats it faced.\nThey said that preparations were complete at the administrative level and all resources had already been provided to the law enforcement agencies.\nCaretaker Interior Minister Gohar Ejaz said he had returned from a visit to Balochistan where he reviewed the security situation.\nHe added that the federal and provincial governments would extend their full support and resources to the ECP for conducting the general elections.\n\u201cThe elections will be held on February 8 come what may.\u201d\nThe meeting was called just a day after the assassination of a National Assembly independent candidate in Bajaur district of K-P and the killing of an ANP activist in Balochistan\u2019s Qilla Abdullah.\nA sudden spurt in violence also saw a grenade attack on the election campaign office of PPP candidate, Ali Madad Jatak, on Quetta\u2019s Sariab Road.\nA similar grenade attack was carried out at the residence of another PPP candidate, Mir Zahoor Buledi, in Kech district of Balochistan.\nOn Tuesday, a bomb blast on a main road in Balochistan\u2019s Sibi area during an election rally led by Saddam Tareen, a PTI-affiliated independent candidate for NA-253 (Ziarat) constituency, left at least four people dead and five others injured.\nEjaz said the attacks taking place in Balochistan were not related to the elections, but were acts of terrorism. He continued that there was no political polarisation in Balochistan.\n\u201cOur major challenge in Balochistan is terrorism, and the security agencies are commendably protecting the country.\u201d\nCaretaker Information Minister Murtaza Solangi said some elements had been spreading rumours about delaying the elections on the pretext of security and weather issues but the caretaker government was fully committed to conducting the general elections on Feb 8.\nSolangi recalled that there were security issues in 2008 and 2013 but the general elections were still held.\nSeparately, the ECP decided to dispatch the ballot papers for the general elections in some areas of Balochistan and K-P by air to ensure prompt delivery.\n\u201cThe ballot papers will be airlifted to Gwadar, Panjgur, Kach, Kharan, Bajaur and Kurram Agency,\u201d the ECP spokesperson told APP.\n"

Prominent political figures have also been issued threats. The law enforcement agencies are grappling with the formidable challenge of upholding peace and stability in the region.\nOn Thursday, one person was killed and five others injured in three separate attacks in Balochistan.\nIn the first incident of violence, an individual lost his life and another sustained injuries as a blast occurred on Sabzal Road in Quetta.\nAccording to police, unidentified miscreants had planted an improvised explosive device on the roadside, resulting in a powerful explosion that claimed the life of a person on the spot.\nEmergency services reached the site of the incident and initiated a rescue operation. The law enforcement agencies cordoned off the area and opened an investigation into the cause of the blast.\nMeanwhile, in two separate incidents of violence in the province, four people sustained injuries in two separate hand-grenade attacks in Jaffarabad and Turbat cities.\nThe first grenade attack occurred in the Ghulam Nabi Chowk area of Turbat, leaving a person injured whereas the other took place on national highway in Dera Allah Yar, Jaffarabad district, leaving three people injured.\nThe injured were immediately rushed to the hospital for medical assistance.\nFollowing the attack, the security forces swiftly cordoned off the affected sites.\nThe Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) while expressing deep concern over the terror attacks sought an immediate report from the Balochistan chief secretary and inspector general.\nIn another episode of violence, unidentified assailants hurled a hand grenade at the office of Mir Nooruddin Nowsherwani, the PPP candidate in Kharan. However, no loss of life was reported.\nSimilarly, miscreants threw a hand grenade at the office of PML-N on Qambrani Road, Quetta. No casualty was reported.\nAccording to the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD), 15 political figures in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa received threats from extremists in connection with the upcoming general elections.\nReleasing a list of such individuals, the CTD maintained that threats had been issued to former National Assembly member Mohsin Dawar, ex-provincial minister Imtiaz Qureshi, Senator Hidayatullah, PML-N\u2019s former MNA Amir Muqam, PTI leaders Pir Musawir Shah and Shah Muhammad, JUI-F\u2019s Malik Adnan Wazir and Ehsanullah.\nSenators Bakhti Afsar and Maulana Abdur Rasheed are also threatened by the extremists.\nThe CTD stated that the police officials of concerned districts have been informed about the threats, and directed for additional security of the listed politicians.\nMeanwhile, sit-in and protest against the killing of National Assembly candidate Rehan Zeb continued in Khar Bazaar, Bajaur.\nZeb was shot dead on Wednesday by unidentified assailants while campaigning in Bajaur district\u2019s Sadiqabad Phattak Bazar.\nA day earlier, unknown miscreants lobbed a hand grenade at the election office of the PPP on Sariab Road in Quetta, injuring five people. According to police, Ali Madad Jatak, the PPP candidate for the provincial assembly seat in Quetta, was not present at the office at the time of the attack.\nMiscreants also threw a hand grenade at the residence of Mir Zahoor Buledi, the PPP\u2019s candidate for a provincial assembly seat in district Kech.\nOn Tuesday, a bomb blast on a main road in Balochistan\u2019s Sibi during an election rally led by Saddam Tareen \u2013 a PTI-affiliated independent candidate for the NA-253 (Ziarat) constituency \u2013 left at least four people dead and five others injured.\nAn ANP activist, identified as Zahoor Ahmed, was killed and another injured when armed men opened fire in the Maizai Addah in Qilla Abdullah district.\nANP Balochistan condemned the incident and demanded that the government should arrest the culprits.\nWith input from News Desk\n\u00a0\n"

            "Text": "As Pakistan gears up for its 12th general elections, the dream of a \"level playing field\" remains an elusive mirage. The historical pendulum of victimisation and strategic manoeuvring continues to shape electoral outcomes, leaving voters to grapple with the complexities of a political landscape where fairness is often sacrificed at the altar of power dynamics.\nIn the intricate dance of power dynamics, the hurdles faced by PTI shed light on a historical pattern of political victimisation and strategic manoeuvring.\nIn the wake of the events on May 9, where PTI supporters face allegations of breaching military installations, the party is confronted with unparalleled difficulties.\nProminent figures such as Imran Khan, Shah Mehmood Qureshi, and Pervaiz Ellahi now reside behind bars. Several influential members are either in hiding or are barred from participating in elections.\nThe PTI, having been stripped of its electoral symbol \u2018Bat,\u2019 now sees its candidates running independently. More than 50 per cent of these candidates are newcomers, a result of widespread defections from the party.\nIn the absence of the freedom to campaign publicly or on mainstream media, PTI candidates have turned to social media, attempting to navigate an increasingly challenging political landscape. Imran Khan and Shah Mehmood Qureshi were served 10 years in imprisonment on Tuesday under the Official Secrets Act in the cypher case, just days before the polls.\nAs if this were not sufficient, an accountability court on Wednesday delivered another blow by sentencing Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi to 14 years in a state gift case, dealing a final blow to the hopes of voters and supporters.\nThis situation raises questions about the concept of a \"level playing field\" in Pakistan's political history. PTI's predominantly young, middle-class supporters argue that their party is undergoing the worst victimisation in the nation's history, claiming that no other party has faced such adversity. The claims are partially true.\nA closer examination of Pakistan's political past reveals a recurrent theme of victimisation, with one party's misfortune often becoming another's patronage. The ebb and flow of power dynamics have seen roles reversed within a short span, with political parties, instead of learning lessons, aligning with powerful establishment to push their opponents into electoral oblivion.\nLet's delve into a brief history of instances where the elusive \"level playing field\" was conspicuously absent in every election the country had:\nPTI's Rise to Power (2018)\nPTI emerged as the choice of powerful quarters, displacing PML-N from favour. Nawaz Sharif faced disqualification and conviction on corruption charges after the Panamagate scandal, paving the way for PTI's ascendancy.\nSoon after he came to power in 2013, Nawaz Sharif lost the support of the establishment and was disqualified from office by the Supreme Court and was convicted on corruption charges as a result of Panamagate leaks that highlighted that hundreds of Pakistanis including the Sharif family had parked their money in offshore accounts.\nBoth the disqualification and conviction have now been overturned by the Supreme Court making elder Sharif a frontrunner for the covet office for the historic fourth time.\nThe PML-N government was paralysed by Imran Khan and Tahirul Qadri\u2019s protests in 2014 and by TLP in 2017. The most lethal was TLP\u2019s month-long sit-in at Faizabad, one of the main junctions that links the capital Islamabad with other cities.\nThe sit-in was organised to protest against purported changes in the oath of the members of parliament regarding the finality of the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) which TLP claimed was an act tantamount to blasphemy.\nMeanwhile, the TLP entered the electoral arena brandishing a hardline religious stance, clinching the fourth-largest vote share in Punjab, the province which decides the fate of elections due to its population size and corresponding number of seats in the National Assembly.\nMany electables either switched to other parties, mainly to PTI, or they returned the party ticket and contested as independents and later joined Imran\u2019s party.\nLeading up to the 2018 elections, PML-N experienced setbacks in votes, and reputation, and even witnessed attempts on the lives of key leaders. Its law minister Zahid Hamid resigned from the federal cabinet due to pressure from TLP, while Ahsan Iqbal faced an assassination attempt. Nawaz Sharif encountered a shoe being thrown at him during a public function.\nReligious decrees against the party were issued, discouraging voters from supporting PML-N. Evidently, this created an uneven playing field for PML-N, leaving the path open for PTI.\nPPP's challenges (2013)\nIn 2013, PML-N assumed power following general elections in which PPP and smaller parties like ANP confronted serious threats from terrorists, hampering their ability to conduct election campaigns freely.\nDuring its 2008-13 term in government, Salman Taseer, PPP\u2019s governor in Punjab, was assassinated by his own official bodyguard in 2011. The assassin claimed the governor was trying to secure the release of a Christian woman who was in jail on blasphemy charges. This action according to the assassin was an act of blasphemy.\nUnknown assailants took the life of Shahbaz Bhatti, a Christian member of the PPP cabinet, seemingly in response to his firm stance on blasphemy-related issues. Meanwhile, Hamid Saeed Kazmi, another cabinet member, narrowly escaped an assassination attempt.\nTo avoid potential backlash from extremist elements, several sitting PPP ministers, including Sherry Rehman, had to go underground. Their efforts aimed at amending legislation to discourage the misuse of blasphemy laws had drawn ire from those opposing the changes.\nElection rallies of PPP and ANP were attacked by the terrorists lost a key leader and many workers in one such attack on an election corner meeting in Peshawar.\nSuch circumstances tilted the playing field in favour of PML-N and PTI, pushing PPP out from Punjab and KPK.\n\u00a0\nPPP at the cost of PML-Q 2008\nPPP won the 2008 elections amid the tragic assassination of Benazir Bhutto which engendered a sympathy vote for the party and the declining rule of General Pervez Musharraf as PML-Q was not the first choice of powerful quarters this time.\nBesides other factors including inside tussle with powerful quarters, sudden power and gas outrages started in the country just before the election and PML-Q claimed that this was done to curtail the party's vote bank.\nPML-Q leadership claimed their party was made to lose the election despite its good performance during the 2002-07 term.\nPML-Q's Ascendency (2002)\nIn 2002, PML-Q assumed power with the support of the establishment, having been established by General Pervez Musharraf through the fragmentation of PML-N. The top leadership of both PML-N and PPP resided in exile, and numerous prominent figures faced corruption charges, which could be absolved if they pledged allegiance to the military ruler.\nDespite unfair tactics, PPP and PML-N, though receiving a good number of votes, faced a significant discrepancy in the number of seats secured.\nRead: Political parties urged to show economic manifestos\nWhile both PML-Q and PPP secured 26 per cent of the votes, PML-Q emerged as the leader with 78 seats compared to PPP's 63. In contrast, PML-N, despite having 12 per cent of the votes, only managed to secure 15 seats. Additionally, other pro-establishment groups like the National Alliance, with five per cent of the votes, garnered 13 NA seats, and Muttahidda Majlis e Amal (MMA), with 11 per cent of the votes, secured 45 general seats.\nClearly, the electoral field was not favouring both PPP and PML-N at that time.\nEmbarking on a journey through Pakistan's electoral history's early years, one encounters twists, turns, and recurring themes of political manoeuvring throughout its chequered history.\n\u00a0\n1956: The Inception of Constitutional Experimentation\nNine years post-independence, Pakistan witnessed the adoption of its first constitution, establishing a parliamentary form of government with executive powers vested in the prime minister. The president, the head of the state, was to be elected by members of the National and provincial assemblies.\nDespite East Pakistan's demographic majority, the National Assembly's representation allocated half the seats to the province, sparking claims of underrepresentation.\nHowever, the constitutional journey faced a detour as the first general elections slated for February 1959 were pre-empted by a coup d'\u00e9tat in October 1958. General Ayub Khan seized power, ushering in his own constitution and a shift to a presidential form of government. The subsequent elections in 1964 bore witness to rampant rigging, securing Ayub's continued rule.\n1970-1977: Electoral Turmoil and Manipulations\nThe year 1970 marked the first general elections under martial law, introducing universal adult franchise. Awami League, the popular party of East Pakistan, faced adversity from powerful quarters from West Pakistan. The elections of December 1970, held under the second martial law, were marred by allegations of suppression. Awami League Chief Sheikh Mujeebur Rahman was behind bars on sedition charges.\nIn 1977, the founder of the PPP, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, advanced the elections almost a year ahead of schedule. The opposition parties claimed delimitations favoured PPP, and state resources were exploited for electoral gains. The elections, characterised by large-scale manipulations, left even Bhutto astonished at the results.\nChief Election Commissioner Justice Sajjad Ahmed acknowledged widespread manipulations, denying a level playing field to opposition parties.\n1985: Non-Party Based Elections Under Military Rule\nDuring General Zia-ul-Haq's military rule, the 1985 elections took a different course, being non-party-based. The PPP boycotted the polls, citing mistrust in the process, and the political landscape grappled with unique dynamics under military oversight.\n1988: The Demise of Zia and the Birth of IJI\nThe 1988 elections, following the death of General Zia-ul-Haq, witnessed the formation of the nine-party alliance named IJI to counter Benazir Bhutto's PPP. Propaganda campaigns and last-minute changes, such as the mandatory national identity card for voting, were aimed to favour IJI. PPP secured 93 seats against IJI's 54, highlighting a shift in political dynamics.\n1990s: A Decade of Shifting Alliances and Power Dynamics\nAfter then President Ghulam Ishaq Khan dismissed Benazir Bhutto\u2019s nascent government in August 1990, he appointed Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi who was head of IJI in 1988 elections as caretaker prime minister.\nIn Sindh, the stronghold of PPP, Jam Saddiq, another known anti-PPP politician was appointed as caretaker chief minister.\nMeanwhile, millions of rupees were doled out from the national exchequer to favour component parties of former IJI. This was proven in the Supreme Court in the Asghar Khan case. The decision came in 2012 decades after what was done back in 1990 to deny the PPP a level playing field. The PML-N-led alliance secured 105 seats against Benazir Bhutto-led Pakistan Democratic Alliance\u2019s 45.\nWithin three years the roles were changed again. Nawaz and Ishaq Khan who was a representative of the establishment fell out on the issue of the appointment of a new army chief after the sudden demise of General Asif Nawaz due to heart attack.\nBenazir Bhutto joined hands with the establishment and sent Nawaz packing in 1993. Her husband who was in jail on corruption charges, became part of the interim cabinet. PML-N which was contesting previous elections on the symbol \u201cBicycle\u201d was denied its election symbol and was allotted a tiger as the new symbol.\nThen popular PML-N lost the election bagging 56 general seats against PPP\u2019s 65.\nThe Benazir Bhutto-led PPP government did not last long either. Bhutto\u2019s confidant President Farooq Leghari dismissed her government in November 1996.\nBenazir Bhutto, along with her husband Asif Ali Zardari and numerous other prominent members of their party, confronted corruption charges.\nRather than concentrating on election matters, they found themselves entangled in legal battles, striving to evade potential convictions under recently introduced accountability laws, which appeared to be selectively wielded against those out of favour with powerful entities at that time.\nThe establishment\u2019s favourite PML-N returned successfully in the February 1997 elections bagging a \u201cheavy mandate\u201d of 137 general seats against PPP\u2019s 18, out of 203 directly elected seats for the National Assembly.\nPPP alleged PML-N of worst victimization. Benazir went on self-exile while Zardair was incarcerated on corruption charges.\n1999: The Fateful Military Coup and PML-Q's Emergence\nNot a year had passed when PML-N developed differences with powerful quarters. On November 28, 1997 PML-N supporters stormed the Supreme Court building to avoid possible contempt of court. This heavy-mandate government of Nawaz Sharif was sacked in October 1999 in a military coup when Sharif attempted to replace army chief General Perez Musharraf and appointed General Zia Uddin Butt as the new army chief.\nNawaz Sharif and many others faced imprisonment, only to be released when they signed a covenant with the establishment not to return to Pakistan for the next ten years. A new party PML-Q was created breaking PML-N into pieces which contested the 2002 polls as the king's party.\n"

            "Text": "The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Wednesday summoned an urgent meeting of security officials following the assassination of a National Assembly independent candidate in Bajaur district of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and the killing of an ANP activist in Balochistan\u2019s Qilla Abdullah.\nA sudden spurt in violence -- just eight days before the general elections -- also saw a grenade attack on the election campaign office of PPP candidate, Ali Madad Jatak, on Quetta\u2019s Sariab Road. A similar grenade attack was carried out at the residence of another PPP candidate, Mir Zahoor Buledi, in Kech district of Balochistan.\nA day earlier, a bomb blast on a main road in Balochistan\u2019s Sibi during an election rally led by Saddam Tareen, a PTI-affiliated independent candidate for NA-253 (Ziarat) constituency, leaving at least four people dead and five others injured.\nThe ECP told the media in Islamabad that it would meet with government and intelligence officials on Thursday (today) to discuss the worsening law and order situation in the two provinces.\nIn K-P, Rehan Zeb, an independent for NA-8 constituency, was shot dead by unknown assailants, while campaigning in Bajaur district\u2019s Siddiqabad Phattak Bazar at around noon time, according to the local po- lice. Zeb was among four people injured in the shooting. He suffered bullet wounds to his head and neck. He was rushed to the District Headquarters (DHQ) Hospital in Khar in a serious condition, where he succumbed to his injuries.\nRead:\u00a0ECP designates 50% of polling stations as sensitive\nZeb sought to contest the election with the PTI\u2019s support, but the party decided to support an- other candidate.\nHowever, Zeb decided to contest the elections as an independent candidate. After the incident, elections for NA-8 and the provincial assembly constituency of PK-22 have been postponed.\nIn Balochistan, violent attacks continued to mar the elections campaigns in various parts of the province. One person was killed and five others sustained injuries in three firing and grenade attacks, the police and party officials said.\nAn ANP activist, identified as Zahoor Ahmed, was killed and another injured when armed men opened fire in the Maizai Addah in Qilla Abdullah district. The injured were rushed to a hospital, where the ANP activist breathed his last.\nThe ANP Balochistan condemned the incident and demanded that the government should arrest the culprits.\nIn another incident, unknown miscreants lobbed a hand grenade at the election office of the PPP on Sariab Road in Quetta, injuring five people. According to police, Ali Madad Jatak, the PPP candidate for the provincial assembly seat in Quetta, was not present at the office at the time of the attack. In a third untoward incident, miscreants lobbed a hand grenade at the residence of Mir Zahoor Buledi, the PPP\u2019s candidate for a provincial assembly seat in district Kech.\nHowever, there was no report of any loss of lives. The attackers escaped from the spot.\n\u00a0\n"

        "Details": {
            "Text": "Fierce electoral contests are underway in multiple constituencies spanning the four districts of Hyderabad and Mirpurkhas divisions, encompassing the \"Laar\" region of the province, featuring a total of 18 National Assembly and 39 Sindh Assembly seats.\nWhile the number of closely contested seats remains relatively low in this region, key contenders include the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA), and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P).\nAdditionally, candidates from the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan (JI), Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F), Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) are actively campaigning in these divisions.\nThe battleground, though varying in intensity across constituencies, is particularly fierce in Hyderabad,\nBadin, Mirpurkhas, and Tharparkar districts. These areas collectively hold 9 National Assembly and 19 provincial assembly seats, with a total of 3,756,314 registered voters.\nIn the absence of reliable electoral surveys, the attendance at public rallies and meetings serves as a key indicator of a party's popularity.\nHyderabadThe electorate of the second largest city of Sindh has always appeared divided along ethnic lines since the 1988 general elections. The Urdu-speaking population, which inhabits in City and Latifabad Talukas, used to elect the representatives from the MQM-P. The inhabitants of Qasimabad and Hyderabad Talukas, meanwhile, always went with the PPP\u2019s candidates.\nHowever, the 2018 elections witnessed a maiden blow to that three-decade long divide, when a PPP candidate, Abdul Jabbar Khan, defeated MQM-P\u2019s candidate in Latifabad on a Sindh Assembly seat. Observers credited an split in the MQM-P\u2019s voters, and the emergence of a new vote bank for the PTI, as the reasons behind the PPP\u2019s inroad into MQM-P\u2019s erstwhile stronghold.\nCurrently, an electoral combat is unfolding on three National Assembly and six Sindh Assembly seats in the district that boasts of 1,225,147 votes \u2013 662,713 male and 562,434 female.\nIn view of the 2018 election results, the rejuvenated MQM-P will be defending its victory on two seats of the National Assembly and three of the Sindh Assembly and the PPP on one National Assembly and three Sindh Assembly.\nWith the PTI facing obstacles in its path to election campaigning, a three-way contest which played out in 2018, is likely to turn into a direct electoral battle between two major parties.\nNevertheless, six of the constituencies like NA-218, NA-219, PS-60, PS-61, PS-63 and PS-65 will arguably remain immune to the prevailing political tension. On the City taluka-based NA-220, MQM-P\u2019s former MNA Syed Waseem Hussain will be defending his party\u2019s stronghold against PPP\u2019s Waseem Rajput.\nThe PS-64, which falls under NA-220, is also set to see a contest between MQM-P\u2019s Rashid Khan and PPP\u2019s Mukhtiar Ahmed alias Aajiz Dhamra. On PS-62 in Latifabad, PPP\u2019s former MPA from the constituency Abdul Jabbar Khan is pitted against MQM-P\u2019s Sabir Hussain Qaimkhani, a strong candidate who was elected MNA from Latifabad in 2018.\nBadinIn the agriculture and oil rich coastal district of Badin which is home to five sugar industries albeit with rampant poverty, the PPP is confronted with the party\u2019s dissidents former Sindh home minister Dr Zulfiqar Mirza, his wife former National Assembly Speaker Dr Fehmida Mirza and their sons.\nRead: PPP-GDA electoral showdown expected in Sanghar\nFrom the platform of the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA), the Mirza family caused upsets for the PPP in 2018 when Dr Fehmida Mirza and her son Hasnain Ali Mirza were elected as MNA from NA-230 Badin and MPA from PS-72, respectively.\nThe Mirzas began to wage an electoral war against their party since 2015 local government elections when they bagged close to half seats of the local bodies.\nHowever, according to the local observes, the spirit of the past two elections seems missing in the ongoing campaign of Mirzas with both Dr Zulfiqar and Dr Fehmida out of the electoral combat.\nThe nomination forms of the couple were rejected on the basis of their alleged bank default. When the Sindh High Court restored their forms, the process of allocating election symbols was already completed with the GDA\u2019s symbol \u2018star\u2019 given to their sons.\nThe couple, mainly Dr Zulfiqar, is now campaigning for their sons Hasnain, a former MPA, and Hassam Mirza. The former is running from PS-70 Badin-III and the latter from NA-223 and PS-71 Badin-IV. The district, with 942,176 voters has two constituencies of the NA and five of the PS.\nMirpurkhasIn Mirpurkhas district the PPP is facing a two-fold electoral attack\u2014from MQM-P and an independent candidate Syed Ali Nawaz Shah, a former PPP stalwart and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto\u2019s associate elected to the Senate, National and Sindh assemblies multiple times since 1977.\nThe district has two seats of the National Assembly and four of the provincial assembly with 865,400 voters. In 2018, Shah as an independent candidate defeated the PPP\u2019s opponent on NA-218 Mirpurkhas-I with the support of MQM-P, GDA and other parties. He is again standing for the same seat, renamed as NA-211 Mirpurkhas-I, against PPP\u2019s Pir Aftab Hussain Shah Jilani.\nThe PPP will also have to deal with Shah and his son, Syed Shuja Muhammad Shah, on PS-47 and PS-46, respectively, though the party had managed to win those two seats in 2018. Syed Zulfiqar Ali Shah and Noor Ahmed Bhurgari, both elected MPAs in 2018, will face off Shahs on PS-46 and PS-47.\nMirpurkhas city based constituency, PS-45 Mirpurkhas-I, has in the past elected MQM-P\u2019s candidates five times since 1993. But in 2018 the PPP\u2019s Hari Ram Kishori Lal grabbed that constituency for the first time in decades. In the upcoming polls, Zafar Ahmed Khan Kamali, who was elected MQM-P\u2019s MPA from that seat in 2013, will try to reclaim his lost constituency from PPP\u2019s Lal.\nSon of former Sindh chief minister Arbab Ghulam Rahim, Arbab Inayatullah, is standing for PS-48 against the PPP\u2019s Mir Tariq Ali Talpur, who was elected MPA in 2018 from the same area.\nTharparkar\nThe GDA, represented by former chief minister Arbab in Tharparkar, posed a tough challenge to the PPP in 2018. The party managed to secure only one provincial seat out of two seats of National Assembly and four of provincial assembly in that district. Arbab is again leading a strong campaign for his party, besides being himself a candidate for NA-215 Tharparkar-II.\nBut the GDA has changed its winning candidate for PS-52 Tharparkar-I Abdul Razzak Rahimo by giving the ticket to Sher Khan Samejo this time. Rahimo has been elevated to fight for NA-214 Tharparkar-I against Pir Ameer Ali Shah Jeelani, whose father late Pir Noor Muhammad Shah Jillani had won that seat in 2018. Ameer had succeeded his father after his death in a by-election.\n"

Water has also started to flow in the catchment areas of the dams, causing water levels to rise.\nWith forecasts of heavy rain throughout the next two to three days, air pollution in the cities is expected to considerably reduce and water levels are to increase further.\nFor the past six months, air pollution remained so high that its index had crossed 300 owing to continuous drought, dust and smoke in the region.\nHowever, last night's rain and snowfall has finally caused the air pollution index of Islamabad to decrease from 278 to 178 and the air pollution index of Rawalpindi has come down from 290 to 189. In other cities, such as Murree levels have decreased to 160 on the index, 157 in Attock, 160 in Jhelum and 160 in Chakwal.

There is no risk of a water crisis in the twin cities this summer as rainy season has started late this year, but rain is expected to be normal.\u201d\nDepartment of Agriculture spokesperson, Muhammad Haroon, said that the ongoing rains in Rawalpindi Division will improve the production of wheat, corn, vegetables and fruits in the Potohar region. \u201cThe current ongoing moderate rains are beneficial for the wheat crop,\u201d he exclaimed.\nOn the other hand, the heavy rain became a boon for traffic in the city as there was continuous disruption of traffic at different intersections and roads including, Murree Road, Liaquat Road, Rawal Road, Mall Road, Saidpur Road.\n"

However, he added that runner-up candidates used such tactics when they saw their defeat.\nThe ECP lawyer evaded the queries put forth by Justice Najafi that why only a single contestant was evicted in response to the law and\u00a0 order situation; why the process of consolidating the results was not stopped, and why it was not resumed in presence of the candidates after the problem was brought under control.\nJustice Najafi adjourned the proceedings for short time, ordering the RO to appear before the court.\nAfter proceedings resumed, the ECP lawyer told the court that the RO had not turned up and his mobile phone was switched off.\nHe added that after sending the results to the ECP, the RO went home.\nAlso read: \u2018Power-wielders\u2019 must learn to respect people\u2019s choice: PTI\nThe ECP lawyer argued that the petitioner could not check the Form-47 from the RO, requesting the court to dismiss the plea as not maintainable.\nHe argued that the petitioner should have contacted the ECP first against the process of counting.\nThe petitioner\u2019s lawyer argued that their matter was not related to the process of counting votes, but it was about how a candidate could be deprived of their right of observing the process of consolidation of results.\nPetitioner Raja was evicted from the premises of the RO\u2019s office by the Model Town SP. The RO\u2019s order alluded to an incident that lasted a few minutes wherein certain miscreants holding stick were allowed by the police to enter the lawn of the premises.\nThe lawyer contended that the commotion was caused overcome in a few minutes.\nThereafter, he added that the process of the receipt of results from the presiding officers continued unhindered.\nHe argued that there was no reason for the eviction of his client.\nThe RO had requested the Lahore police chief that no candidate, their agents, media teams and any other person should be allowed into his camp office for NA-128 at Govt Girls High School Shuhada-e-APS E-Block Model Town, Lahore as they caused a law and order situation.\nThe RO maintained that the working condition inside the premises had become impossible because of the aggressive behaviour of the candidates and their agents.\n"

            "Text": "Pakistan\u2019s Ambassador to the US Masood Khan has termed Kashmir a \u201cflashpoint\u201d amid tensions between nuclear-tipped India and Pakistan, saying that the two countries should not only discuss their decades-old dispute but also negotiate nuclear confidence-building measures.\n\nIn an interview with Newsweek \u2013 a weekly American weekly magazine \u2013 the ambassador emphasised that India might think that it had taken care of the Kashmir issue but the Kashmiris did not think in that way and nor did the Pakistani people.\n\n\u201cI think that, realistically speaking, we should have talks not only on the future of Jammu and Kashmir and the aspirations of the people of Jammu and Kashmir\u2026 but we should also have nuclear confidence-building talks, so that we establish reliable communication channels,\u201d he said.\n\nNewsweek correspondent Tom O\u2019Connor, who interviewed the ambassador amid Israeli war on Gaza, wrote that the presence of weapons of mass destruction on both sides of the Line of Control (LoC) in the region, added another dimension to the conflict.\n\nHe cited Ambassador Masood Khan as arguing that it needed to be addressed by Islamabad and New Delhi to avoid a major crisis, intended or otherwise. \u201cAs two responsible nuclear weapons states, we must resolve outstanding disputes in Kashmir,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIndia and Pakistan should have some sense of where we are, what our capabilities are, what our intentions are, as a matter of fact, and so that our entire approach to the region is not accident-prone,\u201d the ambassador added.\n\nThe Newsweek pointed out that the Pakistani officials had often lamented a lack of international attention to the Kashmir issue, where New Delhi carried out a mass crackdown since Prime Minister Narendra Modi revoked the region\u2019s semi-autonomous status in August 2019.\n\n\u201cWe would say that attention from Kashmir is moving away because of Ukraine or the preoccupation of the Western world with China as a competitor, as a challenger to the existing order, and so on,\u201d Masood said. \u201cNow, in addition to Ukraine and the Indo-Pacific politics, you have the Middle East,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201dSo, Kashmir is no more on the radar screen of the international community, and yet the oppression continues there,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis is very perilous for the international community because the Kashmiris\u2019 freedoms are as sacrosanct as the freedoms of any peoples in any part of the world.\u201d\n\nPakistani officials have often drawn connections between the Kashmir dispute and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, owing to some common historical roots. Newsweek report said that Ambassador Masood Khan also referenced these commonalities, but also the dissimilarity.\n\nFor the rest of the world, the ambassador noted, the war on terror had come to an end, but it was not for Pakistan. Now, he hoped to continue to build more substantive ties between the two nations, based not only on security but also in various other fields such as investment, education and climate change.\n\n"

It diverts the River Neelum through a system of tunnels out-falling into the River Jhelum.\n\nA technical fault in the design of the project has led to a serious water shortage in Muzaffarabad city, in addition to creating environmental issues.\n\nSources told The Express Tribune that the then AJK prime minister had addressed the matter with the then Pakistani prime minister in a letter written on September 07, 2018.\n\nThe two prime ministers had met on October 09, 2018, to discuss the issue.\n\nLater, the Pakistani PM had directed MoWR secretary to furnish a report in consultation with Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) chairman and the AJK government after jointly visiting the NIHPP along with relevant technical officials and verifying the actual discharge downstream.\n\nAfterwards, the MoWR furnished its report initially to the Prime Minister's Office and subsequently on the directions of the Prime Minister's Office to the Cabinet Committee on Energy.\n\nThe Cabinet Committee on Energy on August 28, 2019, approved recommendations made in the report.\n\nAmong other things, the report had recommended carrying out a comprehensive environmental study to determine the e-flow along the lines of the study conducted by the Government of Pakistan for contesting its case against India's Kishanganga Hydroelectric Plant.\n\nThe study was to be conducted by hiring international consultants of repute. The committee had noted that there would be no change in the scope or cost of the project.\n\nIt had also directed MoWR to submit its recommendations to the relevant forum\u2014Departmental Development Working Party (DDWP)\u2014for further implementation.\n\nThe sources said the MoWR presented this issue again in a recent meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Energy. The ministry briefed the committee that pursuant to the diversion of the River Neelum, the downstream river flows reduced drastically down to Muzaffarabad City.\n\nThis reduction in flows unleashed several adverse environmental impacts in terms of the deterioration of the river water quality and reduction in water supply for Muzaffarabad city.\n\nThe Cabinet Committee on Energy once again directed the ministry to carry out the study.\n\nThe NJHPP had experienced a fault in 2022 and remained shut for one year. In August 2023, it restarted generating electricity again following the completion of the restoration work in its tail race tunnel.\n\n"

They add that local bright youth could fully tap into AI to earn remotely with hands-on projects. They stress that it is high time to establish such rules as AI rapidly penetrates all fields and sectors.\nSharing their views with The Express Tribune, they state that preventing youths from misusing AI is crucial and should be approached through three facets. Firstly, comprehensive educational programmes should raise awareness about ethical implications and consequences, aiming to prevent youths from relying on AI technologies like ChatGPT for ready-made answers to assignment questions. Secondly, fostering an environment that values originality and critical thinking is essential, promoting honest academic practices. Lastly, it is advisable to implement advanced plagiarism detection and proctoring tools, leveraging technology to maintain authenticity.\n\u201cIt is vital to address concerns around AI-generated fake content. I advocate for a regulatory approach that fosters innovation while managing risks. We propose measures such as mandatory disclosure, ethical guidelines, and user awareness initiatives, along with collaboration with the tech industry. Striking a balance is crucial to prevent harm without hindering AI\u2019s positive impact in sectors like education and healthcare. It\u2019s imperative to involve diverse stakeholders in a consultative process to tailor regulations effectively for Pakistan\u2019s unique landscape, promoting responsible AI practices and transparency,\u201d said Entrepreneur and technology expert Salman Lakhani, who is also the founder and CEO of Cubix.\nRead\u00a0US begins study of possible rules to regulate AI like ChatGPT\nLakhani highlights that local bright youth can fully tap into AI to earn remotely with hands-on projects. In marketing, AI tools can be used to dig into data and craft personalised campaigns that truly hit the mark. When it comes to graphic design, one can experiment with AI-driven graphic design platforms. For tech enthusiasts, diving into the world of AI-based automation and data processing in software development can be highly rewarding. He highlighted the importance of young Pakistani talent enrolling in online courses, engaging actively in AI communities, and contributing to real-world projects. By developing a versatile skill set, staying updated on industry trends, and offering AI-based solutions on freelancing platforms, recent graduates can access numerous remote opportunities, allowing them to thrive in Pakistan\u2019s dynamic digital landscape.\n\u201cDiscouraging the misuse of AI among youths calls for a multifaceted approach, including stressing ethical education, promoting digital literacy, and implementing technological safeguards. By adopting these strategies, educators, policymakers, and communities can work together to ensure that AI technologies like ChatGPT are leveraged to enhance learning and creativity among youths, rather than diminish the value of authentic academic endeavour,\u201d said SI Global Solutions CEO Noman Said.\nSaid highlighted that fresh graduates can effectively learn and polish their AI skills from home by leveraging a wealth of online resources and self-directed learning strategies. These include online courses and tutorials, open-source projects, competitive programming, online forums and communities, research papers and blogs, personal projects, webinars and workshops, YouTube channels, podcasts, and audiobooks. By combining these resources with a disciplined, self-motivated learning approach, fresh graduates can significantly enhance their AI skills from home, he said, adding that it is important to set clear learning goals, maintain a regular study schedule, and actively seek feedback and collaboration opportunities to maximise the learning experience.\nMeanwhile, other IT and AI trainers underscore the need for stringent regulatory oversight to mitigate the proliferation of counterfeit multimedia content in Pakistan\u2019s burgeoning IT industry. As AI technologies evolve, they become increasingly adept at generating deceptive videos, audios, and texts, posing significant challenges to information integrity and national security. They stress that implementing such measures is imperative to ensuring the responsible utilisation of AI, protecting citizens from digital disinformation, and securing the integrity of the digital landscape in Pakistan.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 9th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

            "Text": "Balochistan Caretaker Chief Minister Mir Ali Mardan Khan Domki has inaugurated an extensive solarisation project to shift various public department buildings including educational institutions, healthcare facilities and civic departments onto renewable energy that will provide clean, affordable and uninterrupted power supply to public facilities in the province.\nThe Balochistan government, with the support of Chinese government, has completed the solarisation of 12 educational institutions, computer labs and hospitals that have been equipped with modern solar power facilities.\nChinese Ambassador to Pakistan Jiang Zaidong participated in the inaugural ceremony where he expressed his views through a video link at the Chief Minister\u2019s Secretariat.\nPakistan\u2019s total installed solar energy capacity was 1.24 gigawatts (GW) by 2022, representing a 17% increase over 2021. The government has proposed many initiatives to increase the share of solar energy.\nBy now, the country\u2019s solar energy market is estimated to rise at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 49.68% from 1.30 giga tonnes in 2023 to 9.77 giga tonnes in 2028.\nIn the specific case of Balochistan, according to the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation programme, Pakistan\u2019s total technical solar and wind potential stands at 2,900 GW and 340 GW, respectively.\nRead\u00a0Kakar advocates solar innovation\nAdditionally, Balochistan has the potential to implement greater than 14 GW of renewable energy projects within five to 10 years through least-cost pathways, including photovoltaic (PV) utility-scale plants of 9,500 to 11,500 megawatts.\nBalochistan\u2019s geography, irradiance and location make it one of Pakistan\u2019s most high-potential provinces, with respect to renewables. Decentralised micro-grids paired with solar generation could be used to increase reliable electricity access to rural residents.\nWhile micro-grids generally only provide basic electrification (high quality lighting and charging of mobile phones), it is able to do so for multiple households at a significantly lower cost in the long run. An estimated 36% of Balochistan is electrified, so this pairing has immense potential for the province. In the future, the province is poised to become the country\u2019s most booming solar power hub.\nThis article originally appeared on The China Economic Net\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 9th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

            "Text": "The Western capitals on Friday called into question the \"undue restrictions\" put in place during the February 8 elections in Pakistan and expressed concern over allegations of vote-rigging, but pledged to work with whoever formed the next government.\nThe United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union, in their separate statements, called upon the relevant Pakistani authorities to ensure a timely and full investigation of all the reported irregularities in Thursday\u2019s elections.\nThe statements by UK Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell and the US State Department Spokesperson Mathew Miller condemned all acts of violence in the lead-up to the elections as well as on the polling day.\n\u201cWe recognise, however, serious concerns raised about the fairness and lack of inclusivity of the elections,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cWe regret that not all parties were formally permitted to contest the elections and that legal processes were used to prevent some political leaders from participation, and to prevent the use of recognisable party symbols,\u201d he added.\n\u201cWe also note the restrictions imposed on internet access on polling day, significant delays to the reporting of results and claims of irregularities in the counting process,\u201d Cameron said in comments, which were echoed in the statements of both Borrell and Miller.\n\u201cWe regret the lack of a level-playing field due to the inability of some political actors to contest the elections, restrictions to freedom of assembly, freedom of expression both online and offline, restrictions of access to the internet, as well as allegations of severe interference in the electoral process, including arrests of political activists,\u201d Borrell said in his statement in Brussels.\n\u201cWe therefore call upon the relevant authorities to ensure a timely and full investigation of all reported election irregularities and to implement the recommendations of the upcoming EU Election Expert Mission report,\u201d Borrell added.\nSimilarly, Miller said in Washington: \u201cWe join credible international and local election observers in their assessment that these elections included undue restrictions on freedoms of expression, association, and peaceful assembly.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cWe condemn electoral violence, restrictions on the exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms, including attacks on media workers, and restrictions on access to the internet and telecommunication services, and are concerned about allegations of interference in the electoral process. Claims of interference or fraud should be fully investigated.\u201d\n\u201cThe UK urges authorities in Pakistan to uphold fundamental human rights including free access to information, and the rule of law. This includes the right to a fair trial, through adherence to due process and an independent and transparent judicial system, free from interference,\u201d added Cameron.\nThe EU, the UK and the US welcomed the increased number of women voters compared to the last elections. \u201cWe commend all those who voted,\u201d Cameron said. Miller also noted that millions of Pakistanis made their voices heard by voting on February 8, with record numbers of Pakistani women, members of religious and ethnic minority groups, and youth registered.\nAlso read: Govt says 56 incidents reported on election day despite suspension of cellular services\n\u201cThe participation by the Pakistani people to exercise their right to vote, despite systemic barriers still faced by women and persons belonging to minorities, demonstrates their commitment to democracy and the rule of law,\u201d said Borrell. \u201cWe commend Pakistani poll workers, civil society, journalists and election observers for their work to uphold Pakistan\u2019s democratic and electoral institutions,\u201d said Miller.\nBorrell said that the Pakistani authorities were faced with the challenging task of countering serious terrorist threats and attacks. He called on all parties and actors to use peaceful and democratic mechanisms to settle differences, refraining from further violence.\nHe underscored the importance to political pluralism, democratic values, independent media, vibrant civil society, judicial independence and international human rights standards, which, he described as the key for democratic elections.\n\u201cWe call on all political actors in Pakistan to engage in a peaceful and inclusive dialogue aiming at the formation of a stable government and to respect human rights in line with the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, as well as with international treaties to which Pakistan is party,\u201d he added.\nThe EU foreign and security policy chief emphasised that Pakistan was an important partner, and that the EU looked forward to continuing to work with Islamabad on the priorities agreed in the EU-Pakistan Strategic Engagement Plan.\n\u201cWe encourage Pakistan to continue reforms in the areas of human rights, good governance, as well as labour rights and environmental standards, to address the shortcomings outlined in the GSP-Plus report of November 2023, and to continue the necessary economic reforms,\u201d he added.\nMiller said that the US awaited complete results, adding that Washington was prepared to work with the coming Pakistani government, regardless of political party, to \u201cadvance our shared interests\u201d and to bolster \u201cour partnership by supporting Pakistan\u2019s economy\u201d through trade and investment.\n\u201cWe will continue to support Pakistan strengthening its democratic institutions, engage through the US-Pakistan Green Alliance Framework, broaden people-to-people ties, and promote human rights including freedom of expression,\u201d he continued.\n\u201cWe are also committed to strengthening our security cooperation and creating an environment of safety and security that affords the Pakistani people the peace, democracy, and progress they deserve,\u201d the State Department spokesperson added.\n"

            "Text": "Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Quaid Nawaz Sharif announced on Friday his intentions to form government at the Centre and tasked party president Shehbaz Sharif to open talks with Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) and Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) in this regard.\nShortly after Nawaz made the announcement, Shehbaz reportedly held talks with PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and Co-Chairman Asif Zardari during a meeting held at the Chief Minister House in Lahore. The meeting was also attended by PPP leader Faryal Talpur.\nShahbaz also spoke with MQM Rabita Committee Convenor Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui by telephone and expressed his desire for talks on government formation. Dr Siddiqui assured him that he would consult the party\u2019s Rabita Committee on the matter after the complete election results.\nSome PPP leaders have indicated that the party will convene its Central Executive Committee (CEC) meeting to discuss the possibility of forming a coalition government. Throughout the election campaign, the PPP had bitterly criticized the PML-N for its poor performance during the previous coalition government.\nNawaz delivered his \"victory speech\" at the PML-N Secretariat in Lahore, despite his party being relegated to the second position, as independent candidates supported by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) emerged as the largest group in the incoming National Assembly after Thursday's vote.\nInsiders have revealed that the PPP leadership is pursuing a two-pronged strategy. Firstly, they are bargaining for a better share in the government. Secondly, they are working to rope in the maximum number of independent candidates in Punjab to further consolidate their position.\nPreviously, senior PPP leader Khursheed Shah reportedly stated that the party would not engage in discussions with PML-N if Nawaz Sharif asserted himself as the prime minister. This implies that the PPP was open to considering a coalition but without Nawaz assuming the role of prime minister.\nThe PPP, however, has not taken this position officially.\n\u0644\u0627\u06c1\u0648\u0631: \u0642\u0627\u0626\u062f \u067e\u0627\u06a9\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0633\u0644\u0645 \u0644\u06cc\u06af (\u0646) \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0646\u0648\u0627\u0632\u0634\u0631\u06cc\u0641 \u0639\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0646\u062a\u062e\u0627\u0628\u0627\u062a \u0645\u06cc\u06ba \u06a9\u0627\u0645\u06cc\u0627\u0628\u06cc \u067e\u0631 \u062e\u0637\u0627\u0628 \u06a9\u0631\u0631\u06c1\u06d2 \u06c1\u06cc\u06ba\u06d4 https://t.co/OCgWT7ltO5\nThe MQM too has expressed its willingness to the proposition of a coalition government. Dr Siddiqui had said that the MQM would work unconditionally with parties for the sake of the betterment of the people. He added that they had a three-point demand, which they would take to parliament.\nGiven that PML-N enjoys very good relationship with the JUI-F, an engagement with Maulana Fazlur Rehman would be more of a formality.\nGiven the PTI's current strained relationship with the establishment, its prospects for returning to government, despite securing an impressive victory in Thursday\u2019s elections, appear very slim.\nThe government that PML-N is likely to form is anticipated to resemble a rerun of the Pakistan Democratic Movement\u2019s (PDM) coalition government, which assumed power after the removal of the PTI government through a no-confidence vote in April 2022 and remained in office until August 2023.\nPML-N tactfully acknowledged its polling position and utilized technicalities to claim victory, as on paper, the party emerged as the single largest political party. This occurred after PTI fielded its candidates as independents following the denial of its electoral symbol.\nNawaz claimed that not only at the Centre, but the PML-N had also emerged as the single largest party in Punjab. He stated that he would have been happier if the party had got a simple majority to form a government at the Centre on its own.\nAlso read: EU urges Pakistan to ensure full investigation of reported election irregularities\nIf they had obtained simple majority, Nawaz continued, they would have invited other parties to join them, to form a coalition government. \u201cWe will invite PPP, MQM and JUI to join us in forming a government to take Pakistan out of the quagmire it is currently in,\u201d he said.\nEmphasising that a collective effort was the need of the hour, Nawaz said he had instructed Shehbaz Sharif to meet Asif Zardari, Maulana Fazl and Dr Siddiqui, adding that he had given the mandate to Shehbaz Sharif and senior party leader Ishaq Dar, who would hold the first meeting on Friday.\nTalking about Punjab, Nawaz also dropped a hint that Shehbaz might again become the provincial chief minister, as he said that his role had been commendable. In a lighter vein, he also said that Shehbaz had already started buying laptops for the youngsters.\nResponding to a question, he said he wanted to give his speech on Thursday but then the results were still awaited. On Thursday with only 10 to 12% results announced, people formed an opinion which was beyond comprehension, Nawaz added.\nNawaz stressed the need for all parties to sit together and form a government, because the country \u201ccannot afford another round of elections\u201d. He said that all institutions, parliament, judiciary, armed forces and media should play a positive role to take the country out of this quagmire.\nThe three times former prime minister said that he respected the mandate given to all the parties, even the independent candidates. He added that he invited them also to join the PML-N in taking country out of the crisis.\nHe said that they should come up to the expectation of the masses. He suggested that a 10-year period of stability was required to put the country on the right track. He added that they had to take the country in the 21 century.\n"

            "Text": "\u00a0\nIn a near-repeat of the 2018 elections, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), which has ruled Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa twice, appeared headed for a clean-sweep, convincingly trouncing all rivals in both National Assembly and Provincial Assembly constituencies in the general elections held on Thursday, according to unofficial, unverified preliminary results.\nThe results compiled by contestants based on Form-45, political heavyweights of all rival parties of the PTI, including JUI-F, ANP, PML-N, and PPP, appeared to be losing in both the National Assembly and K-P Assembly constituencies.\nBesides, those who parted ways with PTI founder Imran Khan, including the former chief ministers Pervaiz Khattak and Mehmood Khan, who formed a separate political party \u2013 the PTI-Parliamentarians \u2013 are on course to lose the contest, while those who stood with the PTI are emerging victorious.\nIn the 2018 general elections, PTI founder Imran Khan had won a National Assembly constituency from Bannu. While all other party heads \u2013 Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, Shehbaz Sharif, Asfandyar Wali Khan, Aftab Sherpao, Sirajul Haq and Maulana Fazlur Rehman \u2013 had lost in the province.\nAlthough the final results are pending compilation, unofficial reports indicate a familiar trend unfolding. Barrister Gauhar Khan, Chairman of PTI, contesting as an independent candidate, appears to be on the path to victory.\nWhile the heads of the PTI\u2019s rival political parties, PML-N Quaid Nawaz Sharif, ANP provincial president Aimal Wali Khan, JUI-F chief Fazl, and his two sons, QWP chief Sherpao and his son Sikandar, and JI Amir Sirajul Haq were facing defeat.\nIn initial results, PTI sweeps aside political heavyweights. Among those succumbing to PTI\u2019s electoral dominance is veteran politician Ghulam Ahmed Bilour. While former federal minister Saleem Saifullah emerged victorious, his brother Anwar Saifullah of PPP faced defeat.\nPPP K-P President Syed Muhammad Ali Shah Bacha, General Secretary Shuja Khan, Information Secretary Amjad Afridi, ANP Information Secretary Samar Haroon Bilor, JUI General Secretary Maulana Ataul Haq, JI K-P Amir Prof Ibrahim and General Secretary Abdul Wasi and Bakht Jahan are also facing defeat.\nRead:\u00a0Hours after polling, nation awaits final results of elections\nMeanwhile, the PTI-backed candidates, who contested as independents because the party had lost the election symbol of \u2018bat\u2019 due to intra-party elections controversy \u2013 are poised to clinch victory for the second, and even third time.\nThe expected victorious PTI-backed candidates included former National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaisar, K-P Speaker Mushtaq Ghani, former federal ministers Shaheryar Afridi, Ali Muhammad Khan, Ali Amin Gandapur and others.\nSimilarly, this list is expected to include three grandsons for former president Gen Ayub Khan\u2014Omar Ayub Khan, Akbar Ayub Khan and Arshad Ayub. On the other hand, former president Ghulam Ishaq Khan's one son-in-law Hisham Inamullah and grandson Taimur Saleem Jhagra are on course to victory.\nHowever, Ghulam Ishaq Khan's other son-in-law Anwar Saifullah and granddaughter Samar Haroon Bilour appeared to be losing. But in an interesting bout, Anwar Saifullah\u2019s borther, Salim is expected to avenge his 2013 defeat to Fazl Saleem as he is on way to defeat Fazl\u2019s son Maulana Asjad Mahmood.\nThe PTI backed, Shandana Gulzar and Mian Umar Jamshed Kakakhel are on course to retain or take back the seats their parents had one held. Shandana\u2019s father Gulzar Khan had won the 2013 general elections from Peshawar on a PTI ticket. Now, Shandana Gulzar is expected to re-take this seat.\n"

            "Text": "Amidst the fervor of the highly contentious elections, the spotlight shifts from the political battleground to the technological arena.\nThe tale unfolds with a clash between the PTI's resilience and the Election Commission of Pakistan's (ECP) touted Election Management System (EMS) - a clash that will decide the fate of the nation.\nWith the promise of technological advancement, expectations were high for swift and accurate results. The ECP has heralded its EMS as the emblem of transparency and efficiency in result compilation.\nYet, as the clock struck 2am, the promised unveiling of unofficial results remained elusive, shrouding the election in controversy and reviving the memories of the 2018 election\u2019s Result Transmission System (RTS) debacle.\nDespite claims that the new system was capable of working even without the internet, most constituencies \u2013 more than 85 percent\u2014awaited their fate, casting doubt on the efficacy of the EMS and transparency of the elections itself.\nThis setback compounds the existing grievances over an uneven playing field in the pre-election phase, exacerbated by countrywide mobile and internet suspensions under the guise of security concerns throughout the election day.\nNevertheless, amidst the chaos and uncertainty, the PTI emerges as a force to reckon with. Weathering a storm of legal battles, symbol stripping, and communication blackouts, Imran Khan's party asserts its resilience.\nAcross Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the PTI-backed candidates hold sway, solidifying their stronghold in Northern Punjab and challenging the PML-N's dominance in urban centers like Lahore and Faisalabad.\nThe aftermath of the May 9 blunder saw prominent figures deserting the PTI, spawning splinter groups and leaving the party to rally behind fresh faces.\nRead:\u00a0Hours after polling, nation awaits final results of elections\nIn a bold move, the PTI allocated 55% of its tickets to newcomers, willingly or unwillingly defying conventional wisdom and paving the way for a new breed of leaders.\nIn the labyrinth of Punjab's political landscape, the PTI squares off against the PML-N that projected itself as a government in the making in the center and Punjab. In Sindh, the PPP continues winning streak, albeit facing resistance in Karachi, a testament to the city's unique political dynamics.\nAs expected, Balochistan continued to show mixed mandate.\nThroughout Pakistan's tumultuous electoral history, a recurring narrative of favoritism and manipulation has marred the democratic process. From the party-less elections of 1985 to the controversial polls of 2018, the cast of characters may change, but the underlying script remains consistent.\nWith each cycle, tweaked versions of the same manipulative tactics are deployed to engineer desired outcomes, perpetuating a cycle of distrust and disillusionment. In the latest chapter of this saga, the ECP finds itself under scrutiny as suspicions surrounding the EMS come to fruition.\nAs the nation eagerly awaited election results, screens outside the district returning officer offices, meant to display real-time updates, served as nothing more than a tantalizing tease for media representatives. Denied access to the inner workings of the electoral process, journalists found themselves relegated to a token \"media room,\" left to ponder the opacity shrouding the proceedings.\nDespite concerns raised by skeptics in the media, the EMS was thrust into action without a comprehensive test run, underscoring a disregard for due diligence in the pursuit of expediency.\nAs delays in result compilation mounted, doubts over the ECP's credibility intensified, casting a long shadow over its constitutional mandate to ensure free and fair elections.\n"

            "Text": "In an unexpected twist, independent candidates supported by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) seemed to be gaining the upper hand in the preliminary results late on Thursday, causing ripples across the political landscape. This surprising turn of events occurred even as the party's founder, Imran Khan, remained incarcerated, and despite the perceived absence of a fair playing field.\nHowever, uncertainty loomed large following the expression of the Pakistani people's will through their votes in the 2024 general elections, particularly amidst a temporary suspension of cellular services due to security concerns just prior to the commencement of voting.\nTo add insult to injury, despite assurances from the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) that the election results would be promptly disclosed, not a single constituency's outcome was announced even as the clock struck 2 o'clock. This delay added frustration and uncertainty to an already tense political atmosphere.\nHowever, in the wee hours of Friday, when very few results trickled in, all PTI-backed independents, supporters gathered at the party\u2019s central secretariat and started \u201cvictory\u201d celebrations. PTI Chairman Gauhar Khan claimed that its candidates were leading on 150 National Assembly seats.\nThe late-night results showed, PTI-backed Muhammad Nawaz Khan Allai won NA-13, Battagram, securing 24,657 votes against Rah-e-Haq Party\u2019s Atta Muhammad, who bagged 18,096 votes, while Ali Muhammad Khan got 42,041 votes to beat ANP\u2019s Ahmed Khan Bahadur, who got 13,845 votes in NA-23,Mardan.\nDespite the media's ongoing coverage of unofficial and unconfirmed results for both national and provincial assembly seats, the situation remained volatile as the ECP failed to announce a single official result by 2 a.m. on Friday.\nAdding to the frustration, Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja, who had previously declined to request the restoration of mobile phone services, insisting that the ECP system could operate without it, was reported by midnight to attribute the delay in results to the suspension of cellular services.\nAs the vote-counting process continued up to the filing of this report, media projections indicated that PTI-backed candidates were leading on a significant number of seats out of the total 266 general seats available in the National Assembly.\nThese projections were shocking, to say the least, for the party of three-time former prime minister Nawaz Sharif. However, just like the ECP, the PML-N also remained tight-lipped.\nMeanwhile, despite suspension of the mobile phone services, the military\u2019s media wing said that 12 people, including 10 personnel of security forces and law-enforcement agencies, were killed and 39 others injured in 51 attacks in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.\nApart from the security challenges, polling was held amid allegations of pre-poll manipulation, in the absence of level-playing field and suspension of cellular services across the country. The shutting down of the mobile internet, which depends on cellular services, was slammed by activists and political parties, excluding PML-N, but all their demands to restore signals were met with silence.\nAmid a deafening silence by ECP and the PML-N, the PTI leadership was found vocal, seeing the initial results. PTI Chief Organiser Omar Ayub Khan, PTI Parliamentary Leader in the Senate, Barrister Ali Zafar, and PTI Central Secretary Information, Raoof Hasan, thanked the people on behalf of the \u201cPTI chairman-for-life Imran Khan\u201d for speaking via massive turnout despite every possible method employed to undermine the will of the people.\nRead:\u00a0PTI endorses 44 candidates for NA, PA seats from Lahore\nRaoof Hasan, while speaking about the initial results, said that the PTI was leading on 125 National Assembly seats by significant margins, indicating a potential shot at the government formation at the Centre and in at least two provinces.\nHowever, Hasan expressed concern over the reported slowdown in result announcements, suggesting possible efforts to tamper with the outcome, a practice seen in the past. Hasan warned of serious consequences for those allegedly attempting to manipulate election results, emphasising that the PTI and the people of Pakistan would not tolerate such interference.\nIn a video message shared on PTI\u2019s official Twitter handle, Hasan strongly advised the swift and transparent announcement of the results without any attempts to withhold or tamper with them.\nMeanwhile, in a joint statement, they stated that despite the use of the worst state interference in the electoral process and pre-poll rigging, Imran showed Pakistan a new path by expressing his unwavering faith in the Constitution, law and democracy.\nBoth the leaders expressed serious concerns as polling process in several constituencies across the country, especially in Karachi, were delayed due to constant obstructions.\nHowever, they lauded that the people had shown their full confidence in Imran Khan and his true agenda of \u201cHaqeeqi Azadi\u201d through their power of votes despite the worst pre-election rigging attempts and creating numerous other hurdles.\nOmar and Zafar stated that \u201cthe preliminary results were very encouraging, which clearly showed that the PTI was taking a convincing lead.\u201d\nHowever, they said that after clear and visible chances of victory of Imran Khan\u2019s candidates in the preliminary results, the process of results got slowdown alarmingly, besides surfacing of reports of closure of the screens in the offices of returning officers, which was very concerning.\nThey warned that \u201can attempt to steal people\u2019s mandate through a closed-room conspiracy would have very negative and fatal consequences.\u201d\nEven PMLN senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed posted on X that the poll results were probably \u201cthe biggest election upset in Pakistan\u2019s political history in the last 50 years,\u201d saying it was extremely important that the \u2018February 8 Surprise\u2019 be transformed into an opportunity for a much-needed \u201cHealing Touch\u201d reinforcing National Unity & Stability by respecting Popular Will & Mandate of People of Pakistan! \u201cRepeating mistake of 2018 polls, when Election Commission\u2019s RTS suddenly conked off before midnight, with results withheld,\u201d he said, \u201cwould be a recipe for disaster!\u201d\nThe results were so delayed that ECP appeared to be violating ECP act of 2017 as Section 13 (3) (Establishment of results management system) states that The Returning Officer shall compile the complete provisional results as early as possible and shall communicate these results electronically to the Commission. Provided that if, it adds, for any reason, the results are incomplete by 02:00 a.m. on the day immediately following the polling day, the Returning Officer shall communicate to the Commission provisional results as consolidated till that time along with reasons for the delay, in writing, while listing the polling stations from which results are awaited and thereafter shall send the complete provisional results as soon as compiled but not later than 10:00 a.m.]\n"

            "Text": "The election day in Sindh was marred by widespread disruptions in mobile phone communication, leading to a reportedly below-average turnout. Sporadic clashes, polling suspensions, and delayed starts were observed at various places. In Kotri, Jamshoro district, a political worker sustained a gunshot injury during a brawl, adding to the incidents of violence.\nSome 17,635,792 people were registered to vote in 39 constituencies of the National Assembly and 83 of the Sindh Assembly across Hyderabad, Mirpurkhas, Nawabshah, Sukkur, and Larkana divisions. Leaders of major political parties, along with independent observers, argued that the mobile network suspension adversely affected voters turnout. \nInstead of receiving information about their polling stations via SMS by texting their national identity card numbers to the Election Commission of Pakistan's number 8300, voters had to physically visit their polling stations.\nPPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, after casting his vote in Naudero, Larkana, urged the urgent restoration of mobile services. He emphasised the impact of the suspension on voters turnout and coordination among polling staff, particularly in relaying information about any violent incidents to law enforcement agencies and political parties.\nBilawal warned that delays in communicating such incidents could adversely affect the safety of the general public and stressed the need for an immediate restoration of mobile services for the sake of democracy.\nRead\u00a0Election concludes amid low turnout, security concerns in Balochistan\nResponding to a question about the ongoing elections, Bilawal expressed confidence in securing a favourable mandate. Meanwhile, his father and PPP's Co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari, who cast his vote in Nawabshah, claimed his communication with the people remained unaffected by the mobile network suspension. He expressed hope for a sweeping victory for the PPP in the polls.\nViolence\nA worker of independent candidate Malik Changez Khan in PS-79 Jamshoro-III was injured with a gunshot during a fight allegedly with PPP's workers in the Kotri area. In Hyderabad, an incident of aerial firing occurred at St Bona Venture High School's assembly ground, where a polling station was set up. The MQM-P attributed the firing to PPP's supporters, leading to clashes between the two groups.\nGunshots were also reported in Tando Wali Muhammad, where armed men allegedly broke down a ballot box, scattering ballot papers. These incidents occurred in the NA-220 constituency. Confrontations among workers of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, PPP, MQM-P, and Jamaat-e-Islami were observed in various areas.\nComplaints of a delayed start of voting emerged from several polling stations, including station number 95 in NA-220 and PS-64 Hyderabad, where the process started in the afternoon. Voting was suspended for around two hours at polling station number 80 in Badin city on PS-71 after a clash between PPP's Taj Muhammad Mallah and GDA's Hassam Mirza.\nIn Benazirabad district, people complained about changes to polling stations. Independent candidate Sardar Sher Muhammad Rind, contesting against Zardari on NA-207, alleged that polling staff were partisan in support of the PPP's contestant. Late starts were reported at several polling stations in Larkana, where GDA's Kazim Abbassi, contending on PS-11, complained about last-minute changes to polling stations.\n"

The polling stations across all districts witnessed enthusiastic participation from young people aged 18 and above. Some were accompanied by their parents.\nIntermediate student Samina Ahmed, who voted at the Siraj-ud-Daula College polling station, could not hide her excitement. \"Casting my vote was a lifelong dream come true,\" she said and prayed for the prosperity of the country, regardless of who comes to power.\nSisters Humera and Sumera, casting their votes at the Dukhtaran-e-Awam School in DHA, highlighted the importance of using their right to choose wise leadership for the nation. Salman Ahmed, another young voter, stated that voting is a national duty, emphasising the need for youth to prioritise education.\nSeveral young voters highlighted the need for electoral reforms, advocating for modernising the process to align with technological advancements.\nApart from the youth, elderly people and special needs voters also turned out in good numbers to cast their votes. Some expressed concerns about the lack of facilities for senior citizens and requested separate polling booths. Many special needs people faced challenges due to inaccessible voting places, urging the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to strategise for a hindrance-free voting experience.\nSecurity personnel were observed facilitating the elderly and special needs people, receiving prayers and gratitude in return.\nSimilarly, women took the lead at various polling stations in Karachi, outnumbering men during the general elections. In Central, Eastern, Korangi, and East districts, women were seen arriving early to cast their votes, with minimal male presence.\nRead\u00a0Young voters to play crucial role in Hyderabad polls\nRehana, a housewife at the APWA School Liaquatabad polling station, said that she decided to vote while others were still asleep, emphasising the significance of this national duty.\nHigher numbers of female voters were reported in the morning at the Rana Home Economics College polling station.\nWomen across different polling stations expressed optimism about elected representatives addressing women's issues, particularly inflation, a major concern regardless of the ruling administration.\nA significant number of men and youth were observed casting their votes in the afternoon, taking advantage of the public holiday. Despite the late start, they actively participated in the democratic process, expressing their commitment to national duty.\nSupporters of some candidates provided transportation facilities to ferry voters to and from polling stations. Women voters, in particular, utilised this service, often using six or nine-seater rickshaws adorned with party flags. Political parties clarified that this transportation initiative was voluntary and not an official party service.\nDuring the general elections, political parties and independent candidates set up polling camps to guide voters to polling stations, following the Election Commission's code of conduct. Volunteers, both male and female, were present at these camps to assist voters. However, these volunteers lacked sufficient training, resulting in ineffective guidance to polling stations and booths. In the past, parties would send polling cards to voters' homes, facilitating knowledge of voting locations. This time, parties didn't conduct this practice, leading to delays in checking votes and informing volunteers at the camps. Consequently, voters encountered difficulties, with many unable to cast their votes.\n"

However, there were some reports about chaos because of alleged rigging at some polling stations in Orangi. \nMeanwhile, polling was conducted peacefully at the polling stations located in three National Assembly seats: 229, 230, 231, and PS-84 to 89 seats of the Sindh Assembly constituencies in Malir district and its rural areas which saw a rush of voters from the early morning. \nPolling agents from PPP, PML-N, and Jamaat-e-Islami were present at most of the polling stations. However, the number of polling agents from PTI was less. The leaders of the political parties kept complaining about the rigging and slower process. Various political parties had set up their camps outside various polling stations in Malir but they complained that the staff was not properly trained. \nIn Korangi district, the polling process was completed peacefully at the polling stations comprising NA 232, 233, 234, and PS 90 to 96. \nVoters also pointed out errors in the voter lists and also expressed concerns over the shutdown of mobile services. Police and other security agencies kept patrolling to ensure peace. \nSimilarly, in district Kemari, the polling process was peacefully for its two National Assembly constituencies: NA-242 and 243, and PS-111 to 115. \nNA-242 includes Baldia Town and adjoining areas, known for its dense population and diversity, including a religious vote bank. NA-243 includes Keamari and other areas, including some islands. \nVoters in these constituencies also complained about late starts to the polling process and lack of properly trained staff at many polling stations, resulting in unusually long queues outside the polling stations. Women voters in the islands also exercised their right to vote on a large scale.\n"

            "Text": "The Supreme Court has held that the courts must exercise extreme caution when handling cases involving matters of faith.\nChief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa authored a five-page judgment while granting bail to an accused charged with distributing a proscribed book, Tafseer-e-Sagheer.\nThe judgment expressed concern that emotions often overshadow facts in cases related to offences against religion, where individual complainants take precedence over the state. The CJP highlighted the nature of such offences, emphasising that they are not against individuals or personal property.\n\"We regretfully note that in dealing with cases pertaining to offences against religion facts give way to emotions, as seems to have happened in this case too, and individual complainants supplant the State, even though the very nature of these offences is not against an individual or with regard to personal property,\u201d the order read.\nThe counsel for the petitioner stated that distributing/disseminating a proscribed book was made an offence by the Punjab Holy Quran (Printing and Recording) (Amendment) Act in the year 2021 whereas the FIR alleged that the petitioner had done this in 2019.\nThe accused had been charged with distributing a proscribed book in 2019, and the judgment noted that the Constitution prohibits charging someone for an act that was not an offence when committed.\nThe court ruled that since distributing the book was not an offence in 2019, the petitioner could not be charged for it.\nRead:\u00a0SC urges govt action on frivolous litigation\nThe judgement also noted that as regards the offences under sections 298-C and 295-B of the PPC for which the petitioner is also charged, his counsel submitted that neither the FIR nor the police report (challan), submitted after investigation by the police, allege that the petitioner had done any of the acts mentioned therein to constitute these offences.\n\"The instant case is also not one wherein the charge could be altered or where the petitioner could have been convicted of a lesser offence to those under sections 298-C and 295-B of the PPC.\nTherefore, the offences under sections 298-C and 295-B of the PPC are removed from the Charge framed against the petitioner.\"\nThe court also said that religious compulsion also violates the Divine scheme of accountability in the hereafter. \u201cEven Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Almighty Allah be upon him) was told by the Creator that he is required to only convey the message and should not compel people to believe, as stipulated in surah Ar-Ra\u2019d (chapter 13), verse 40 and in Surah Yunus (chapter 10), verse 99 of the Holy Qur\u2019an.\u201d\nThe judgement further held that freedom of faith is one of the fundamental tenets of Islam. \u201cBut sadly, in matters of religion tempers flare up and the Qur\u2019anic mandate is forsaken,\u201d it added\nThe court further said that if only the functionaries of the State had heeded the Holy Qur\u2019an, considered the constitution and examined the law then the FIR would not have been registered in respect of the offences.\nThe court also said that the petitioner was arrested on January 7, 2023, and has remained incarcerated for thirteen months, which is more than double the permissible punishment under section 5 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1932.\nTrials in respect of offences where the maximum sentence of imprisonment is relatively short must be conducted promptly or the accused should be granted bail. However, bail was declined to the petitioner by the additional sessions judge on 10 June 2023, without considering that the petitioner had already served out the maximum prescribed imprisonment for the said offence.\nThe learned judge of the high court also dismissed the petitioner\u2019s bail application, through the impugned order dated November 27, 2023, by overlooking this crucially important aspect of the case.\nTherefore, the court noted, that since the petitioner has already served out the maximum imprisonment of six months prescribed for the offence if he is found to be guilty of having committed it, keeping him incarcerated would violate a number of his fundamental rights.\nArticle 9 of the Constitution stipulates that a person shall not be deprived of his liberty save in accordance with the law; the law no longer permits his detention, it added.\n\"And, Article 10A of the Constitution guarantees the right to a fair trial and due process, which too the petitioner is now being denied. In addition to the violation of these two Fundamental Rights is the overarching right stipulated in Article 4 of the Constitution, \u2018To enjoy the protection of law, and, to be treated in accordance with law is the inalienable right of every citizen.\u2019\u201d\n"

Two sub-committees had also been notified to prepare a slew of legal amendments in laws, finalize new statutes, and distribute the assets between the two new organizations.\nOn February 1, the federal cabinet approved the FBR\u2019s restructuring. After the cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar told The Express Tribune that the restructuring of FBR would be implemented by the next elected government, and the next parliament would make requisite changes.\nHowever, immediately after the approval of this plan, the ECP barred the prime minister from taking any action, terming it beyond his constitutional and legal mandate.\nAccording to the ECP, the caretaker prime minister should avoid major reforms in the FBR and keep them pending for consideration by the new government after the General Elections 2024.\n"

He also recalled his challenge to the PML-N leaders for a debate.\n\u201cIt is truly unfortunate that PMLN did not agree to a debate for PM candidates. One myth I hoped to address is the fiction that due to PMLN, Punjab performs better than other provinces,\u201d the PPP chairman wrote in one of his posts.\n\u201cAs Hafiz Pasha\u2019s book; \u2018Human Security in Pakistan\u2019 demonstrates. Sindh now preforms better than Punjab in many areas. Such as governance, freedom from want, freedom from fear, gross regional income and human security over all,\u201d he continued.\n\u201cPMLN knows this and this is why they ran away from a debate. Unfortunately the media perpetuates the myth of PMLNs performance. The people know the truth. IA the people will vote for real performance over \u2018showbazi\u2019 tomorrow,\u201d he added.\nIn another post on X, Bilawal shared data about Pakistan\u2019s exports of goods and services, and said that everyone agreed that increasing exports was the only way out for country from the ongoing economic crisis.\nThe dats showed Pakistan\u2019s exports were worth $20.5 billion in 2008; $31.5 billion in 2013; [the period when the PPP was in power from 2008-13]; $30.5 billion in 2018; [the PML-N government from 2013-18] $39.5 billion in 2022 [the PTI government] and $36 billion in 2023 [the PDM coalition government].\n"

            "Text": "A quiet village in Mandi Bahauddin found itself ablaze with whispers of a police raid on PTI workers and supporters after sunset. Farooq*, arrested a few days ago after he fell down, has emerged covered in mud, after a chase through the narrow village streets.\u00a0\nFor giving a chase, he was beaten up before being bundled up in a police van. \u201cThe police beat me up with sticks,\u201d Farooq said.However, as the police van carrying two party workers sputtered towards the jail, the influential one was allowed to go home while the other one was thrown in the jail with several other PTI workers; all fearing what cases would they be fixed in by the morning.\nBack in the village, the family of the young PTI supporter was on their toes to, initially, locate his exact location and, then, see who could help them get him released before being booked in a case. They knew who could help them but were reluctant to directly ask him because of the bitter rivalry.\nA common relative was then approached to see if he could ask none other than an influential PML-N leader to help them out.Just minutes after the screen of the PML-N leader brightened up and he put the phone to his ear, he was calling his contacts to trace the young PTI worker\u2019s exact location.\nSoon, they found that and, without wasting a minute, they were on the way to get Farooq released. Using his contacts, they entered the prison and asked the officials concerned to locate the young man, which they did.\nRead:\u00a0PTI \u2018needs to follow conciliatory path\u2019\nBefore they could clear his name from files and head home, two other young men, who were arrested in a separate raid, recognized the PML-N leader and urged him to help them out as well as no one else was coming for them. After a few ifs and buts, all three were let go. Soon, they were reunited with their families.\nHowever, as soon as Farooq reached home, the PTI workers came up with a narrative that he was released after PTI\u2019s influential leader, who had alighted from the police van midway, approached a judge and sought his help to get him released from prison. The villagers then started choosing the story that suited them.\nThis could be one of the rarest occasions where PML-N came to PTI\u2019s rescue amid an ongoing crackdown against PTI workers and supporters in the run-up to the general elections as the crackdown is still going on in different areas.\nIn one of the raids, several PTI workers and supporters, including a student of 9th grade, were arrested from Islamabad\u2019s Ghauri Town area on February 6.The student whose father is a lawyer by profession and once served as a polling agent for a PML-N leader in Islamabad before deciding to stand with Imran Khan shared that he along with other lawyers and the PTI candidate in NA-48, Ali Bukhari, ran from pillar to post to get his son released, saying he finally succeeded at 2am on Tuesday night. \u201cMy son is so afraid that he isn\u2019t even going in the street after what happened with him,\u201d the lawyer Rana Abdul Qayyum said.\n\u201cHe is just a 15-year-old boy; he has a whole life ahead of him; I don\u2019t know how will he overcome the trauma.\u201d\u201cCan we still call these elections free, fair and transparent,\u201d Qayyum questioned, regretting that political rivalry shouldn\u2019t have reached this extent.\n"

Besides, both the parties also had their assessment about the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI)-backed Independent candidates.\nThese two parties have underscored the importance of the role of independent candidates in the formation of the next federal government, as their internal assessment suggest that based on the election campaign it would be difficult for a single party to win simple majority.\nHowever, any formula for the formation of a coalition government at the Centre will be worked out in the light of the election results. A PML-N source told The Express Tribune, that after the elections, the party will be is in a position to form the federal government they were not sure about simple majority.\nThe source added that the party thought that if there were lesser seats than expected, the government could be formed with the cooperation of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI), Istehkam-e-Pakistan Party (IPP), Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) and other like-minded parties and independents.\nIf necessary, the same formula, which was used to form a Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM)-led coalition government in 2022, could be used this time, the source said. In the light of the political situation, the PML-N can discuss the matter of government formation with the PPP.\nContinuing, the sources said, Nawaz Sharif was the PML-N\u2019s candidate for the post of prime minister. However, keeping in mind the emerging political situation or other issues, if arose, the name of Shahbaz Sharif could be considered for the premiership. However, the final decision will be taken by Nawaz.\nOn the other hand, PPP sources said that Bilawal Bhutto Zardari is the party\u2019s candidate for prime ministership. They added that after evaluating the election results, the strategy for the government formation would be worked out.\nAccording to these sources, PPP Co-Chairman Asif Ali Zardari will decide the matters related to the government formation, while the party chief Bilawal Bhutto Zardari will consult and take the like-minded parties. The PPP would also try to court successful independent candidates into its camp.\nPTI sources claim that they would be successful in the National Assembly contests. Senior political analyst Zia Abbas said that the PML-N was likely to get most of seats in the election and it might form the government with the cooperation of the like-minded parties and independents.\nBesides, Abbas continued, the PPP will succeed in forming the government in Sindh and the PML-N and the IPP and others would join ranks to form the government in Punjab. However, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) and Balochistan would see coalition governments.\nPTI sources claim that they would be more successful in the contests for the National Assembly but Abbas said he did not see any improvement in the political situation of the PTI, adding that the party would get less number of seats.\n"

Wapda was backed by ECNEC Chairperson Dr Shamshad Akhtar.\nAttendees of the meeting told The Express Tribune that the package included construction of more than half a dozen canals, some of which were highly controversial, such as the Greater Thal Canal.\nSindh has long opposed the construction of some of these canals due to their adverse impact on the province\u2019s water share. Some of these projects included in the package had separate approvals, but Wapda bundled them with those not yet approved by all competent forums.\nECNEC members were largely uninformed when Wapda introduced the proposal, backed by Finance Minister Dr Shamshad Akhtar, according to a cabinet member. In response, Sindh Revenue Minister Younus Dagha opposed the proposal, particularly objecting to the Greater Thal Canal project.\nDagha\u2019s main objection was to the Greater Thal Canal project, said sources.\nWapda\u2019s proposal also violated the commitment given to the International Monetary Fund and an Act of Parliament that requires thorough scrutiny of such proposals, said a senior planning ministry official.\nDuring the meeting, the planning minister and planning secretary did not object to violations committed by Wapda. Sources said that at one point, the finance minister stated that she would conditionally approve the master plan.\nThe reasons for expediting ECNEC proceedings were unclear, especially as the interim government planned another ECNEC meeting next week after the general elections.\nRead WAPDA inks contract for Kurram Tangi Dam Project Stage-II\nA late-night press release by the finance ministry stated that \u201cthe summary of Ministry of Planning Development and Special Initiatives regarding Development of National Irrigation Network for Green Pakistan Initiative was discussed in detail with the submission to Ministry of Water Resources and Provinces to allocate priority to strategic canals in accordance with National Water Policy\u201d.\nThe finance ministry further stated that \u201cGreater Thal Canal Project (Phase II) was also discussed, on which the government of Sindh showed its concerns\u201d.\nThe ECNEC directed the government of Sindh to present its views regarding techno-economic viability of the Greater Thal Canal (Phase II) project to the Council of Common Interest. \u201cThe forum gave approval of the Greater Thal Canal (Phase II) project, subject to approval of the CCI,\u201d the finance ministry added.\nThe ECNEC approved increasing the cost of ongoing projects funded through the Public Sector Development Programme by 6% to compensate contractors against inflation. The 6% increase will dent the budget by Rs168 billion, despite approved projects already having the option to make adjustments against inflationary pressures.\nThe ECNEC was told that after a series of meetings, it has been recommended that the price adjustment formula will be applied on a case-to-case basis, with a financial impact of at least Rs168 billion.\nThe Constructors Association of Pakistan (CAP) and Association of Consulting Engineers Pakistan (ACEP) complained about the unprecedented inflation and recession of the economy in the country, coupled with the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak since January 2020.\nThey claimed that this unprecedented situation has crippled construction activities in the country and cast negative effects on the Engineering Consultancy Sector. The Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC) notified its document on September 19, 2022, to address the price adjustment in ongoing contracts, August-2022 due to an unprecedented price hike.\n\u00a0\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 8th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

            "Text": "The Cabinet Committee on Privatisation (CCoP) on Wednesday approved handing over the management control of the two loss-making power distribution companies to the private sector aimed at stemming their losses and improving efficiency.\nHeaded by Privatisation Minister Fawad Hasan Fawad, the CCoP also approved revising the budget of the Privatisation Commission, jacking it up by 175% or Rs2.2 billion. The Commission\u2019s budget has increased phenomenally during the course of the fiscal year to make room for the majority of the $14.53 million or Rs4.3 billion payments to the financial advisors hired for the privatisation of Pakistan International Airlines and remodelling of the Roosevelt Hotel, New York.\nThe financial advisor of PIA will get a total of $6.9 million or Rs2 billion, and out of this, 95% or Rs1.9 billion will be paid during the current fiscal year, the CCOP was informed. Similarly, the financial advisor of the Roosevelt Hotel would get a record $7.65 million or Rs2.2 billion, and 60% of this payment will be made during the current fiscal year. These are probably the highest payments made to any financial advisor hired by the Privatisation Commission.\nFor the current fiscal year, the government had approved a Rs1.3 billion budget for the Privatisation Commission, which the CCoP has now revised to Rs3.4 billion \u2013 an increase of Rs2.2 billion or 175%. The additional room was created to make payments to PIA advisor Ernst & Young and Roosevelt Hotel Advisor is Jones Lang Lasalle (JLL) \u2013 a Chicago-based real estate management firm.\nThe privatisation ministry has used the Rs290 to a dollar exchange rate for the budget purposes for making the $14.53 million payments to these advisors. But the financial advisors will be paid in dollar terms.\nThe CCoP decided to give the Gujranwala Electric Power Company (GEPCO) and the Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (HESCO) on a 20 to 25 years lease contract, according to at least two cabinet ministers.\nThe decision was taken on a summary moved by the Ministry of Energy and it also has the backing of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC).\nHowever, it was also decided that both these power distribution companies along with eight others will remain on the active Privatisation Programme. The CCoP also approved to end the earlier process of handing over these entities to the provinces.\nThe privatisation minister has in the past stated that the transfer of ownership of the power sector to the provinces cannot be described as privatisation.\nThe Ministry of Privatisation has not issued a press statement after the CCoP meeting.\nBoth the power distribution companies are running in losses. The annual State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) report showed that the GEPCO caused a loss of Rs20.6 billion while the losses incurred by the HESCO amounted to Rs54.4 billion in the fiscal year 2022.\nThe CCoP did not pick the highest loss-making entity \u2013 Peshawar Electricity Supply Company \u2013 which caused Rs103 billion losses in 2022 \u2013 even more than the losses of PIA.\nThe CCoP did not accept the Ministry of Energy\u2019s proposal to give a lead role to the Power Division in handling the outsourcing process. The CCoP also did not agree to setting up an inter-ministerial committee to give the two entities on lease.\nThe Power Division\u2019s proposal to appoint the International Finance Corporation (IFC) \u2013 an arm of the World Bank \u2013 as the financial advisor was also not accepted by the CCoP at this stage.\nThe privatisation ministry had supported the proposal of selecting one better-performing and one worse-performing power distribution company. The privatisation ministry has not supported delisting the Discos from the privatisation programme; however, the proposal of withdrawing the summary for provincialisation of Discos has been supported.\nThere has been less focus on the privatisation of the power sector, which caused Rs376 billion losses out of the Rs730 billion combined losses by all the government-owned companies.\nThe CCoP did not approve another summary for the transfer of the 10% shares of Oil and Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL) back to the Petroleum Division. These shares currently rest with the Privatisation Commission.\nEarlier, the Privatisation Commission Board had referred the decision for the transfer of 10% shares of the OGDCL in the name of the Petroleum Division to the CCoP. The Privatisation Commission has been receiving dividends of the 10% shares, which it then remits to the finance division.\nThe CCoP decided that for the time being, these shares should stay with the Privatisation Commission. Eventually, these 10% shares along with the entire 85% government shareholding in the OGDCL would be transferred to the Sovereign Wealth Fund, according to the government officials.\nSeven profitable companies have been placed in the Sovereign Wealth Fund, and their earnings will be used to make future investments in various ventures, they added.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 8th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n\u00a0\n"

            "Text": "Pakistan on Thursday witnessed a countrywide shutdown of internet and cellular phone services during the polling process with the authorities attributing the move \"to maintain law and order\" in the wake of the violence that occurred a day earlier.\nHowever, the suspension was denounced by Amnesty International, which described it as a \u201creckless attack on people\u2019s rights\u201d, as well as experts and political stakeholders, particularly the PTI, a political party that relied heavily on social media platforms for its electoral campaign.\n\"It has been decided to temporarily suspend mobile services across the country,\" an interior ministry spokesman said in a statement.\nThe spokesman added that \u201cprecious lives have been lost\u201d in recent militant attacks in the country and \"security measures are essential to maintain law and order situation and to deal with potential threats\".\nChief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja said the decision on mobile networks was made by \"law and order agencies\" following Wednesday's violence and the commission would not interfere.\nIn a post shared by the state-run broadcaster PTV on social media platform X, Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) spokesman Haroon Shinwari said the internet suspension would not affect the results of the polls and they would be announced on time.\nHe added that the ECP\u2019s system was not linked to the internet.\nThe CEC also maintained that the ECP had its own exclusive independent networking system that did not require internet.\nHowever, the suspension of the cellular services created hassles for the voters.\nVoters in Pakistan were reliant on a text messaging service to confirm the polling station where they were registered.\nForty-year-old Abdul Jabbar said the internet disruption prevented him and his wife from finding their polling station.\nNetBlocks, a global internet watchdog, said data confirmed there was a disruption to mobile phone and internet services \"corroborating widespread user reports of outages\".\n\"The ongoing election day internet blackout in Pakistan is amongst the largest we've observed in any country in terms of severity and extent,\" NetBlocks director Alp Toker told AFP.\nRead more: Naya or Purana Pakistan\n\"The practice is inherently undemocratic and is known to limit the work of independent election observers and cause irregularities in the voting process.\"\nAmnesty International slammed the suspension of internet and cellular services, calling it \"a blunt attack on the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly\".\n\u201cIt is reckless to impede access to information as people head out to polling stations on the heels of devastating bomb blasts and what has been an intense crackdown on the opposition in the lead up to the elections in the country,\u201d Livia Saccardi, the interim deputy director for South Asia at Amnesty International, wrote in a post on X.\n\u201cUnwarranted restrictions on dissemination of information, despite reassurances to the contrary from the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority and Election Commission of Pakistan, are in breach of people\u2019s human rights at this critical time in Pakistan,\u201d Saccardi added.\nNighat Dad, a lawyer who runs the not-for-profit organisation Digital Rights Foundation, said the outage \"is an attack on the democratic rights of Pakistanis\".\n\"Shutting down mobile phone services is not a solution to national security concerns. If you shut down access to information you create more chaos. How do you call [anyone] if, God forbid, there is an attack?\"\nShe added that there was more room for disinformation to spread, including about reports of unconfirmed attacks.\n\"People will of course put their safety first if they are unable to verify rumours of an attack in their area,\" she said, noting such disinformation could cause voters to stay away from the polls.\nSenior PTI leader Senator Syed Ali Zafar has written a letter to the CEC, expressing concern over the suspension of internet and mobile phone services across the country on the day of the polls.\nAccording to a statement issued by PTI\u2019s Central Media Department, Zafar wrote in the letter that the nationwide suspension of mobile phone and internet services on the day of the elections had caused severe and significant damage to the country.\nBarrister Ali Tahir, the Election Correspondence Cell of the PTI in Sindh in-charge, wrote to the CEC as well, claiming that the internet shutdown raised serious doubts about the ECP\u2019s commitment to fulfilling its constitutional duties.\n\u201cThe suspension of internet services on polling day represents a clear and brazen assault on democracy and the rule of law.\u201d\nThe PTI in a post on X called on people to remove passwords from their personal Wifi accounts \"so anyone in the vicinity\" could have internet access.\nAlso read: Election day deals: Vote and avail discounts at all these eateries\nPPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari demanded that the caretaker government should restore the services.\nIn a letter to Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa, PPP Central Election Cell In-charge Senator Taj Haider urged the top judge to \u201cissue instructions\u201d on the matter of internet services being suspended across the country.\nHe added that the internet suspension had affected voter turnout.\nHaider informed the CJP that the interim government\u2019s step was in violation of the Islamabad High Court\u2019s 2018 order, which declared the suspension of cellular services on the pretext of \u201csecurity concerns\u201d as illegal.\n\u201cThe closure has also adversely affected reporting and responding to security incidents. One of our workers was shot dead in Mirpurkhas today and it was after an hour that we came to know about the murder,\u201d the letter read.\nHaider also maintained that that \u201call political parties except the PML-N\u201d have raised their reservations over the internet suspension\nJamaat-e-Islami Karachi chief and NA-250 candidate Hafiz Naeemur Rehman also expressed his concerns over the shutdown of cellular services.\nIn a video posted by the JI on X, the party\u2019s Karachi chief condemned the suspension of mobile services, describing the move as a \u2018shameful stunt\u201d. He accused the interim government of paralysing the communication system on the day of the elections.\nBy the time the polling was over by 5pm, both the internet and cellular services were resumed partially in Islamabad as well as Rawalpindi. Subsequently, they were completely restored across the country.\n"

            "Text": "The curtain finally rises on the general elections as the nation prepares to go to the polls today. Despite delays and political hiccups, Pakistanis will now cast their votes, electing new national and provincial legislatures and ushering in a fresh constitutional journey.\nThe road to these elections has been riddled with challenges with echoes of the past haunting the present. The 2018 polls had seen PML-N supreme leader Nawaz Sharif caught in the cross hairs. However, this time around, the PTI chief, Imran Khan, and his party are facing a crackdown.\nThe elections were earlier scheduled for November last year as the previous National Assembly was dissolved days before it could complete its term in August, 2023. However, unforeseen events threw out unexpected plot twists.\nSoon after a caretaker government was sworn in, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) announced that it could not hold general elections in the 90-day constitutional timeframe as it would have to conduct fresh delimitation of constituencies in view of a digital census that the outgoing political government notified in the last week of its term.\nThe ECP later announced holding polls in the last week of January without specifying its exact date. However, the polls oversight authority had to announce the date of election in consultation with the president on November 3, 2023 only after the intervention of the Supreme Court.\nThe Supreme Court later also removed some other legal hurdles to the general elections, which some forces including some political parties like JUI-wanted deferred to a later date for various reasons including inclement weather in the northern parts of the country and security issues.\nApparently, a restive political climate is the only thing that has remained unchanged between the two general elections.\nIn view of a highly polarized environment coupled with security challenges, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has deployed security forces to perform duties as defined in Article 245 (functions of Armed Forces) of the Constitution.\nThe police will be the first-tier responders, followed by the civil armed forces as the second tier, and the armed forces as the third tier. The armed forces are being deployed outside the most sensitive polling stations.\nThe role of the security forces has become all the more important after the recent surge in violent attacks targeting election candidates and political entities, especially in Balochistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa provinces.\nChief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja recently admitted in an official statement that there are security challenges; that the law and order situation is deteriorating in two provinces, and the poll body\u2019s offices as well as political meetings are being attacked just ahead of polls.\nThe CEC, having all the time to ensure free and fair elections and foolproof security arrangements, simply termed \u201cterrorism as the biggest enemy of the electoral process\u201d.\nParties and independents\nIn the political ring, heavyweight contenders like the PML-N, the PPP, the MQM-P, the JUI-F, the PML-Q, the TLP, the JI, the ANP as well as others regional and religious parties vie for victory.\nFor the general election 2024, the ECP has allocated election symbols to 150 political parties.\nRead:\u00a0How elections can shape the future\nThe PTI, though in the contest, faces unique challenges as the ECP deprived it of its iconic election symbol, the cricket bat, forcing its candidates to run as independents. This, the PTI leaders and experts say, can open the window for horse-trading post elections.\nThe Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen) states that as many as 111 political parties have nominated 275 women candidates to contest the upcoming elections on general seats, making up 4.6 percent of the total of 6,037 candidates.\nVoters and candidates\nNevertheless, over 128 million registered voters out of a total 241.4 million population would elect members for 266 National Assembly and 593 provincial assemblies\u2019 seats.\nOut of the total 128,585,760 voters, constituting over half of its total population, over 69 million (69,263,704) male and over 59 million (59,322,056) female voters of Islamabad, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh and Balochistan would put democracy to its latest test.\nAccording to Fafen, this indicates an increase in the proportion of voters within the population, rising from 49.6 percent in 2018 to 53.2 percent in 2024.\nBetween the last two general elections, Fafen said, the number of registered voters increased by 27.4 percent, from 86,189,828 in 2013 to 106,000,239 in 2018. Since then, the number of registered voters has increased by 22 million (21.7%), reaching 128,585,760. These include 12.5 million women.\nA staggering total of 5,121 candidates, including 4,807 males, 312 females, and two transgender individuals \u2013 representing a diverse spectrum of parties and ideologies \u2013 are vying for the 266 general seats in the National Assembly.\nSimultaneously, 12,695 candidates, comprising 12,123 males, 570 females, and two transgender persons, are contesting the 593 general seats across the four provincial assemblies. Voting for both the national and the provincial assemblies will be held on the same day.\nPolling stations and booths\nThe ECP has set up a total of 90,675 polling stations across the country including a total of 25,320 polling stations for men, 23,950 for women and 41,405 combined polling stations.\nThe ECP has established 50,944 polling stations in Punjab, out of which 14,556 will be for men, and 14,036 for women, while 22,352 polling stations will be for both men and women.\nThere will be 19,006 polling stations in Sindh, including 4,443 for men, 4,413 for women and 10,250 joint polling stations. Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa will have 15,697 polling stations, including 4,810 for male, and 4,286 for female voters. There will be 6,601 combined polling stations in K-P.\nBalochistan will have 5,028 polling stations, including 1,511 for men, and 1,317 for women. The number of joint polling stations in the province is 2,200.\nThe ECP data shows that there will be 276,398 polling booths across the country, including 147,552 polling booths for men and 127,846 polling booths for women.\nIn total, there will be 149,434 polling booths in Punjab, 65,005 in Sindh, 47,077 in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, and 14,882 in Balochistan.\nYoung voters\nFafen states that the distribution of voters across age groups demonstrates that voters under the age of 35 constitute 44 percent of the total electorate.\nWithin the age brackets, the largest proportion of voters falls within the 26-35 range. In the younger category of 18-25, the proportion of voters is notably lower at 18 percent.\nThese figures may indicate a combination of factors such as under-registration and a decline in population growth rates over time.\nSubsequently, the 36-45 age group comprises 22 percent of the registered voters. The 46-55 age category has 14 percent of voters, while a mere nine percent fall into the 56-65 age group. Lastly, individuals aged 65 and above account for 10 percent of voters.\nTurnout and expected outcome\nIn the 2018 general elections, the turnout was 51 percent, meaning only half of the country\u2019s voters came out to cast their votes. As admitted and explained by politicians and experts, no party is in a clear position to gain majority in the National Assembly, saying it can lead to a hung parliament, again.\n"

            "Text": "Pregnant women and children from low-income families facing heightened stress due to poverty and inflation are grappling with severe health issues, revealed a report from the Rawalpindi District Health Authority's Clinic-On-Wheels initiative.\nThe pressing challenges of poverty and inflation have rendered pregnant women and young children in these households more susceptible to anaemia due to limited access to clean water, nutritious food, and fruits.\nLaunched a month and a half ago, the \"clinic-on-wheel\" initiative operates with eight vehicles across 15 union councils in Rawalpindi. The programme aims to provide free medical facilities to young children and pregnant women, identifying health problems under the Prime Minister's Initiative Program for Mother and Child Health.\nThe initiative encompasses guidelines for healthy living, free medicines, and various tests, including Hepatitis A, B, C, ultrasound, anaemia, and sugar tests. The mobile clinics reach the doorsteps of residents in Dhok Rata, Rata Amaral, Dhoke Hassu, Cantt areas, Rahmatabad, Dhok Dalal, and other areas.\nThe current situation highlights the physical frailty and anaemia prevalent among women who lack access to sufficient food and fruits. Young children are also experiencing physical weakness due to anaemia.\nRead:\u00a0Punjab maternal deaths spike\nDistrict health authorities advise pregnant women with health issues to avoid further pregnancies and encourage family planning. The clinic-on-wheels not only provides necessary medications but also offers family planning counselling from experts available on-site.\nIntegrated Reproductive Maternal Newborn Child Health and Nutrition Programme (IRMNCH) Coordinator Dr Naveed Akhtar Malik said the clinic-on-wheels initiative is a premier programme delivering quality and free healthcare to pregnant women and children at their doorsteps.\nCurrently operating with eight vehicles in 15 union councils, the programme plans to expand to seven more union councils with additional vehicles.\nDr Malik emphasised the oversight of Dr Jamal Nasir, the Punjab Health Minister, and Dr Ijaz Ahmed, the Chief Executive of the District Health Authority, who actively monitor the programme, ensuring daily reports and guidance.\nThe clinic-on-wheels has already reached 50,000 women and children, providing free tests, screenings, and medications, aiming to bridge the gap in treatment facilities for those affected by poverty, he said.\nDr Malik anticipates the programme's continuation in 15 Rawalpindi union councils for an additional two to three months, offering comprehensive healthcare through mobile clinics staffed by experienced doctors and technical staff.\nBesides medical treatment, the clinic-on-wheels service undertakes awareness programmes for polio vaccination and prevention of dengue and epidemic diseases.\nUnder the pilot project, the initiative was first launched in the rural areas of Rawalpindi tehsil.\nAs part of the initiative, each vehicle has a male doctor and female doctor, a nutrition officer, family planning staff, and laboratory test staff and is equipped with essential medicines.\n"

            "Text": "Recent gas and oil price hikes set to fuel inflation, impacting consumers and industries alike"
        },
        "Details": {
            "Text": "The latest hike in gas and petroleum oil prices for households and industrial consumers in February is estimated to increase the inflation rate by almost half a percentage point to around 25% in the current fiscal year 2023-24, reducing the likelihood of a token cut in the benchmark interest rate in mid-March 2024.\n\nThe projection for the inflation rate does not account for the potential impact of political upheaval following the election upset. Prolonged political crisis over the establishment of a new government at the centre, and its ripple effects, particularly any delays in securing a new International Monetary Fund loan programme post-April, could further raise inflation.\n\nThe surge in gas prices is expected to curb the smuggling of fertiliser to neighbouring countries at the expense of farmers and consumers, increasing the supply of urea and DAP in the country and reducing the need for their import.\n\nIn a commentary on the impact of the gas price hike on inflation and commodity prices, Arif Habib Limited (AHL) stated that the increase in gas prices could lead to a 43 basis point rise in the inflation rate. \u201cWith the current inflation rate standing at 28.3% as of January 2024, we anticipate that, taking this effect into account, the CPI (consumer price index) for FY24 will likely reach 24.91% year-on-year.\u201d\n\nWhile speaking to The Express Tribune, AHL\u2019s Head of Research, Tahir Abbas, said that the inflation rate estimate for FY24 before the recent gas price hike was around 24.50%.\n\nThe latest inflation rate projection of 24.91% does not include the likely impact of the upward revision in petroleum oil product prices for the second half of February 2024, he added.\n\nOptimus Capital Management (OCM) foresees the impact of the new gas pricing on inflation to be relatively low at 35 basis points, increasing the full-year inflation rate for FY24 to 24%.\n\nTo recall, the federal cabinet approved the weighted average gas price increase by 12.3% to Rs1,533/mmbtu (million British thermal units) from the last price of Rs1,365/mmbtu in November 2023.\n\nAmong notable increases, the gas tariff for fertiliser manufacturers witnessed a significant jump of almost 700%, an increase of 67% for residential consumers, and a surge of 25% for captive power plants operating mostly in export industries.\n\n\u201cWe estimate a minimal 10% increase in gas prices across all income quintiles (other than the protected class),\u201d AHL said.\nThis is the second gas price hike in three months made to fulfil IMF conditions ahead of the second and last review of the domestic economy by the global lender under its current programme of $3 billion, ending in April 2024.\n\nThe government also revised up diesel prices by Rs8.27/litre, increasing to Rs287.33/litre for the period from February 16 to 29. It raised petrol prices by Rs2.73/litre to Rs275.62/litre.\n\nDays before the latest hikes in oil and gas prices, OMC, Research Analyst, Maaz Azam, had projected February\u2019s inflation rate to sharply reduce to 24-24.5% compared to 28.3% in January. Further declines to 20-21% are expected for March 2024.\n\nRead\u00a0Govt set to raise gas prices up to 41%\n\nIn its late January 2024 monetary policy statement, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) revised up its projection for the FY24 average inflation rate to 23-25% compared to July 2023\u2019s estimate at 20-22%.\n\nSBP Governor, Jameel Ahmad, linked the upward revision in the inflation rate to the hike in November 2023\u2019s gas prices by the government, stating that the impact of the price hike was significantly higher than the bank\u2019s projections.\nSectoral Impact:\n\nAHL stated that the urea price is estimated to climb up by Rs1,120/50kg bag after the feedstock gas prices are massively hiked up to Rs1,597/mmbtu from Rs580/mmbtu in November 2023 (up by 2.8 times). Whereas, the fuel stock price for fertiliser manufacturers has increased to Rs1,597/mmbtu (previously: Rs1,580), up by 1.1%.\n\nTo recall, the fertiliser manufacturers were provided subsidised gas to make urea available at Rs2,500/bag to farmers. However, the low pricing encouraged smuggling of the fertiliser to comparatively expensive markets, resulting in the price of the chemical to around Rs5,000/bag in local markets.\n\nThe research house further said that keeping in view the partial gas dependency of Engro Fertiliser on the Petroleum Policy 2012 policy, the impact on it will be lower compared to other urea manufacturers; albeit the company would need to augment prices by Rs846/bag to completely pass on the impact.\n\nMeanwhile, Fauji Fertiliser Bin Qasim Limited (FFBL) will have to revise urea and DAP prices by Rs1,367/bag and Rs530/bag, respectively, to pass on the impact completely.\n\nIt is pertinent to note that OGRA has not yet notified a revision in feed and fuel prices of consumers under the MARI network. However, once notified (assuming the same as SNGP and SSGC) for MARI network plants, the Fauji Fertiliser Company (FFC) will have to raise urea prices by Rs1,120/bag to pass on the impact fully.\n\nAHL also estimated, assuming an average Rs1,000/bag increase in urea prices by the industry (including FFC) and for every one-month lag in MARI gas notification, FFC would have a monthly positive after-tax earnings impact of Rs1.88/share.\nGas tariff for cement players using captive power plants has increased to 2,750/mmbtu, up 10%. \u201cOur workings suggest that Lucky Cement will have to raise prices by nearly Rs10/bag to completely pass on the impact of higher gas prices.\u201d\nUsage of gas by long steel players (manufacturers of rebars: ASTL and MUGHAL) during the reheating process is very low. The steel manufacturers are mostly relying on furnace oil for power generation, therefore, the impact would be muted.\n\nEPCL has to raise PVC prices by $15/tonne to fully offset the impact. Lotte Chemical will need to raise PTA prices by $13/tonne to fully pass on the impact.\n\nBesides, the gas price hike would make available the required financing to oil and gas exploration and oil marketing companies and help control circular debt. The beneficiaries may include OGDC, PPL, PSO, SNGPL, and SSGC.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 18th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

They expressed concerns over the federal cabinet\u2019s approval of a 67% increase in gas tariffs as it would increase production costs, reduce industrial activities, and badly hurt exports.\nDuring a meeting, they urged the government to take solid measures and ensure competitive energy tariffs for the industry to boost industrialisation and exports.\nPresident ICCI highlighted that Pakistan\u2019s economy is in deep trouble, citing the manufacturing sector still struggling to recover, textile sector exports declining by around 3% during July-January 2023-24, and foreign exchange reserves of $8 billion, which are insufficient to cover only 6 weeks of imports.\nHe said Pakistan needs $22 billion in external financing during 2024-25 to meet its financing needs.\nTo cope with these challenges, Pakistan urgently needs to boost industrialisation and exports. However, the repeated hikes in electricity and gas tariffs have made the cost of doing business very high which is hurting production activities and making exports uncompetitive in the international market.\n\nRead\u00a0SITE association president condemns gas tariff hike\nPresident KCCI emphasised that Karachi\u2019s industries were demanding a reduction in gas tariffs to improve industrial activities. He expressed concern that increased gas tariffs would create more problems for the industry that would slow down the economic growth of the country.\nHe urged that the new government in consultation with the private sector should fix the utility tariffs for the next 10 years to enable better growth of business activities and revive the economy.\nBakhtawari, former President ICCI and Secretary General UBG, stressed that the government should privatise all loss-making utility companies to reduce their burden on the national exchequer and improve their performance.\nBoth chambers called for political stability in the country, which is the key requirement to achieve economic stability. They urged that the new government should give top priority to promoting ease of doing business to make Pakistan a hub of business and investment activities and enable it to emerge as a strong economy.\nBoth chambers agreed to work in close cooperation to address the key issues of the business community and create a conducive business environment.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 18th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

            "Text": "Hyderabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (HCCI) President Adeel Siddiqui urged the government to focus on solar and wind energy with a consistent and sustainable policy, while also advocating for research on artificial gas through the Thar coal project.\nHe stressed the need to arrange gas through both conventional and unconventional methods to achieve self-sufficiency in the country\u2019s energy sector. Siddiqui suggested that instead of relying on expensive Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) imports, research on artificial gas through the Thar coal project should be prioritised.\nIn a statement on Saturday, Siddiqui highlighted how economic degradation and unemployment were leading to poverty and a subsequent increase in crime rates. He insisted that energy tariffs could be controlled by eliminating line losses through comprehensive policy measures. He urged the government to prioritise solar and wind energy investments over importing LNG, which annually burdens the national economy with $1.25 billion in additional costs.\n\nRead\u00a0HCCI gives protest call against power, fuel price hikes\nSiddiqui cautioned that the industrial sector would not grow without consistent economic policies, regardless of changes in government. He pointed out that the recent 250% increase in energy costs, including a Rs4.26 rise per unit of electricity under fuel adjustment, would adversely affect small traders and the cost of doing business, making lives miserable for many.\n\u201cWe are paying 16 cents per kWh, while neighbouring and regional countries, as well as the rest of the world, charge only 6 cents per kWh,\u201d he remarked. Siddiqui argued that exports could not increase with such a steep rise in energy costs, reiterating that the manifold increase in gas tariffs would escalate production costs and hinder export competitiveness, preventing Pakistan from competing effectively in the international market.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 18th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

Transportation charges for trucks have been hiked to an exorbitant level of Rs1.1 million because of prolonged travel duration which makes it almost impossible for businessmen to bear the expense, they said.\nSarhadi highlighted that a truck carrying goods to Afghanistan returns to Pakistan after around 45 days and the owners now prefer local transportation within the country, instead of sending their vehicles to Afghanistan, creating an acute shortage of vehicles.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 18th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

        "Summary": {
            "Text": "Issue of raising gas prices by 175% may go to ECC next week"
        },
        "Details": {
            "Text": "The government has initiated discussions to increase gas prices for the remaining six fertiliser plants aimed at preventing the possibility of windfall profits of around Rs100 billion due to its earlier decision to raise prices for only four plants.\nThe issue of gas prices in the range of 175%, or Rs1,017 per mmbtu, may go to the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet next week, along with another proposal to prioritise gas allocation to the industrial sector, according to government sources.\nEarlier this month, the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) approved giving priority gas supply to the industrial sector, alongside residential and commercial users. The SIFC has approved the new gas supply merit order, with the ECC\u2019s approval pending to finalise it. Under the revised order, fertiliser and power plants would receive second priority.\nSources said the deliberations about gas price increases are taking place separately in the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Energy after the fresh revision in gas prices for four fertiliser plants created a lacuna. Authorities have concerns that these six plants might exploit the gap to raise urea prices despite no increase in their input costs.\nThe federal cabinet increased gas prices on Wednesday in the range of 29% to 700% for four fertiliser plants receiving gas through the networks of Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) and Sui Southern Gas Company Limited (SSGCL). It did not adjust prices for six other plants receiving gas from the Mari gas network.\nGas prices for Fatima Fertiliser and Agritech increased by 29%, for the new Engro Fertiliser plant by 700%, and for Fauji Fertiliser Bin Qasim Limited plant by 175%. After the increase, gas prices for these plants are now equal to the prescribed price of Rs1597 per mmbtu. However, this move discriminates against these plants compared to six others getting gas from the Mari Petroleum Company Limited network.\nRead:\u00a0SITE association president condemns gas tariff hike\nMari Petroleum Company Limited (MPCL) is entitled to receive wellhead gas prices in accordance with relevant agreements with the government for gas produced from its various natural gas reservoirs. Mari Field wellhead gas prices are determined and notified by OGRA bi-annually under the Oil and Gas Regulatory Ordinance.\nThe six plants receive gas at the rate of Rs580 per mmbtu for feedstock, which is Rs1017 or 64% less than the prices for the other six plants. Three out of the six plants belong to Fauji Fertiliser Company (FFC), one old Engro fertiliser plant, one plant of Fatima Fertiliser, and the Pak-Arab Fertiliser Limited plant.\nAccording to some estimates, the increase in input costs for the four plants, which produce less than 40% of the total urea, may result in about a Rs750 per urea bag increase. The six plants produce about 63% of the total fertiliser and can get away with Rs100 billion in windfall profits even by keeping prices slightly lower than other manufacturers.\nHowever, if the government increases gas prices, these six plants may have to cover the difference above Rs580 per mmbtu and the new rate in the form of the Gas Development Surcharge (GDS). Additional GDS revenue would go to the provinces. Gas Supply Agreements for six Mari-based plants are valid until June 2024.\nDespite receiving billions of rupees in subsidies in the past, the four plants did not significantly benefit farmers.\nSources said that there is a possibility that a summary might be taken to the ECC next week to end the disparity in rates among all ten fertiliser plants. But along with the decision on gas prices, there must be a solution to use the GDS, as the additional funds given to the provinces can be used for other farming-related purposes, they added.\nUrea is available in the market in the range of Rs5,000 to Rs5,500 compared to notified prices of around Rs3,600 per bag.\nThe issue of urea price increases due to an increase in gas prices was discussed at the last ECC meeting.\nIndustry Minister Gohar Ejaz was of the view that manufacturers would not increase prices because they were already selling the product at higher rates in the black market. However, the energy minister believed that fertiliser companies would increase prices, and there was no effective mechanism to stop them. Some ECC members believed that fertiliser plants should not be charged uniform rates, which was not accepted.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 18th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

        },
        "Details": {
            "Text": "The Supreme Court is so far showing restraint and not taking suo motu notice of the Rawalpindi Commissioner Liaquat Ali Chatha\u2019s allegation that Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa was involved in rigging this year\u2019s general elections.\nIt has been learnt that no meeting of top court judges were held.\nHowever, senior SC judges informally consulted among themselves after the Rawalpindi commissioner\u2019s claim.\nSome of them suggested taking suo motu notice of his allegation and the matter should be scheduled before a larger bench for adjudication but this proposal was turned down.\nLater, CJP Isa talked to some media personnel at the SC premises, wherein he expressed his surprise over the \u201cbaseless\u201d allegation levelled by the Rawalpindi commissioner.\nFormer additional attorney general (AAG) Tariq Mahmood Khokhar believed that the commissioner\u2019s unsubstantiated assertions against the CJP were despicable and ludicrous.\nHe added that the CJP\u2019s extra-judicial public comments to the media were \u201cgratuitous\u201d and did not constitute an authoritative or judicial ruling.\n\u201cTherefore not much should be read into this,\" he continued.\nKhokhar said his personal view was that judges should remain insulated from the public controversies.\n\u201cJudicial silence would perhaps have been more appropriate.\u201d\nHe further explained that the causality of the Rawalpindi commissioner\u2019s rant against the CJP had its roots in the judicial decisions involving the PTI electoral symbol of the \u2018cricket bat\u2019 as well as its founding chairman Imran Khan\u2019s several successive criminal convictions and custodial sentences.\n\"There is a perception among a significant part of the nation that historically, the Supreme Court has been and remains a threat to democracy.\"\nAlthough the SC did not take a suo motu notice, a three-judge bench, led by CJP Isa, will take up a former military officer\u2019s petition seeking a declaration that February 8 general elections were rigged and urging for a fresh round of the polls.\nNow a debate is under way as to whether or not CJP Isa should be a part of the bench hearing the plea on polls rigging.\nLawyer Shoaib Shaheen, who contested the recent elections as a PTI-backed independent candidate, has also written a letter to CJP Isa about the alleged rigging in his constituency.\nSenior lawyers believed that the SC should order a probe into the allegations of rigging in the elections.\nSince the time of the British rule, districts including Attock, Chakwal, and Jhelum in Rawalpindi have been recognised as significant sources of military recruits, with soldiers hailing from these areas participating in both the world wars.\nMoreover, even after the Partition, a majority of young people from these regions have shown a preference for joining the armed forces of Pakistan.\nIn the 2018 general elections, the PTI celebrated victories in the majority of the National Assembly seats in the Rawalpindi division and Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), as the PML-N lost all of them in these areas.\nHowever, the February 8 general elections brought a surprising turn of events, with the PTI failing to retain any seats in this historically significant region.\nAllegations of massive rigging in the final results have already been raised by the PTI-backed independent candidates, particularly concerning the issuance of Form 47 by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).\nMany candidates have argued that the results indicating their victories had been collected through Form 45, distributed by presiding officers to their agents after the counting at polling stations.\nInterestingly, a majority of PTI candidates in these districts enthusiastically celebrated the unofficial results on the night of February 8.\nHowever, the scenario took a turn when the returning officers (ROs) issued Form 47, showing the defeat of PTI-backed independent candidates and declaring PML-N contestants as successful in these constituencies.\nThe PTI-backed candidates are alleging that they were denied entry into the ROs' offices during the counting process.\nLegal experts believed that the SC became controversial after its January 13 order wherein the PTI\u2019s internal polls were declared as illegal and the party was deprived of its popular electoral symbol.\nNow the PTI is struggling to secure its mandate and allocation of reserved seats on account of the SC\u2019s January 13 order.\nThe PTI candidates were consistently complaining about not being given a level playing field to them during the elections but their grievances were not addressed.\nEven after the January 13 order, the PTI was disappointed and withdrew its contempt petition over the violation of the court order for providing a level playing field to the party.\nPTI founding chairman Imran was awarded convictions in three cases within a week.\nThere are serious doubts on the fairness of Imran and his wife Bushra Bibi\u2019s trials in the Toshakhana reference and Iddat case. The former premier and PTI vice chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi\u2019s jail trial in the cipher case is also dubious.\nAccording to Article 225 of the Constitution, election disputes can exclusively be addressed by tribunals but this process is time-consuming.\nFurthermore, with the current accusation of widespread rigging, the tribunals will only address individual cases.\nThe crucial factor determining the legacy of CJP Isa lies in the conduct of free and fair elections.\nWhile he played a role in ensuring that the general elections were held, questions have arisen about the fairness of the process.\n"

            "Text": "The PML-N is apparently dragging its feet on forming a government in the center despite the alleged assurances by the PPP-P, the second largest party in the National Assembly, of unconditional support. However, the party has also not given any hint about a possible change of hearts with regard to leading the future coalition government at the federal level.\n\u201cWe have offered the PML-N time and again to form a government in the Center but they are deliberately delaying it. I don\u2019t understand why the PML-N is doing so,\u201d said a PPP-P leader after the third meeting between the two parties held to decide terms and conditions of a possible alliance on Saturday.\nResponding to speculations that the PPP-P was still demanding that PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto should be made the prime minister, he said \u201csuch a thing has not been discussed at all in the meetings\u201d. He said the PPP-P has even declined the PML-N\u2019s offer to lead the government after two and a half years.\n\u201cWe have been saying PML-N is the majority party in NA and it should form the government,\u201d he said, adding \u201cPPPP is still ready to give vote to the PML-N\u2019s candidate for the PM\u2019s slot.\u201d Additionally, he reiterated that PPPP is not yet interested in becoming a part of the upcoming federal government.\nHe said the PML-N has yet to respond to the PPP-P\u2019s other proposals, including its demand that the office of the president should be given to the PPP-P along with the office of Senate chairman and National Assembly speaker.\nAnother PPP-P leader confirmed that the PPP-P has not demanded a prime ministerial position for Bilawal, saying the party is sticking to its \u201cprinciple position\u201d and arguing on the points that Bilawal and PPP-P President Asif Ali Zardari have already shared in their recent press talks.\nHe, however, rejected the impression that the matter was being dragged on, stating that both the sides would consult with their leadership and meet on Monday again. \u201cThings are expected to reach a conclusion by Monday.\u201d\nBoth the PPP-P leaders refrained from sharing specifics, saying they were under oath. Several leaders of the PML-N were also approached for comments but no one was available.\nMeanwhile, a joint declaration issued after the coordination committees of both parties met in Islamabad stated that detailed discussions took place regarding government formation.\nIt added that significant progress was made on various issues; however, the two sides decided to sit again on Monday to finalize matters.\n\u201cThe proposals put forth by both parties were thoroughly discussed, and while substantial progress was achieved, further deliberations are required to finalize the matters at hand,\u201d the joint statement read.\nEmphasizing the importance of a robust democratic government for Pakistan\u2019s stability, the committee members concurred on the necessity of reaching a consensus.\nTwo other PPP-P leaders who are part of the coordination committee formed to work out power sharing modalities revealed the PML-N has made no mention of its concerns, if any, against formation of a coalition government.\nThe PML-N, whose senior leaders\u2019 recent statements suggest that the party was having second thoughts about forming a coalition government, was still working out modalities with the PPP-P on how to smoothly run the assembly business, and on how to reconcile differences over handling government affairs between the two parties, if and when they arise.\nThis blowing hot and cold by PML-N seems to be an attempt by its leadership to keep the option open to withdraw from this arrangement in a dignified manner if needed. However, thus far it seems that Shehbaz led PML-N is in no mood to give up on its aspirations of forming a federal government.\nAccording to a statement issued by the party, the committee has agreed that a strong democratic government guarantees a stable Pakistan. It said that both sides to give matters a final shape have sought more suggestions that will be deliberated upon on Monday.\nSome PML-N leaders said the party is not ready to get blackmailed on agreeing to any unconstitutional demand, which is why it is not interested in forming a government.\nA day back all media houses had reported that the party leaders in a meeting presided over by Nawaz Sharif loudly advocated against forming a coalition government in the center and laid emphasis on focusing solely on Punjab.\nTalking to The Express Tribune, Sardar Bahadur Khan, who is part of the PPP-P\u2019s talks committee, said his party has in principle agreed to support the PML-N, and the PML-N is very much interested in forming its government.\u00a0 Nothing has been said to indicate otherwise, he added.\nHe denied the impression that the PPP wants any ministries in Punjab. He said the PPP indeed wants its political interests in the province to be guarded but is not asking for any ministries.\nRegarding senate seats, he said given that they would expect the PML-N to support them to get some Senate seats, that as per numbers they are entitled to.\nWhen asked what positions the PPP-P was asking for, he said that the party wanted constitutional portfolios\u2014the positions of the president, the Senate chairman, the National Assembly speaker. Governorship would be decided with mutual consent, he added.\nHe said there was no disagreement between the two sides. \u201cThe PPP-P will support the PML-N on all important matters including budget, as has already been said by Chairman Bilawal.\u201d\nQamar Zaman Kaira, another member of the PPP delegation, said the media was being a bit over anxious regarding formation of a government, which, he said, will be formed on its own time.\nRegarding the PML-N having given any indication to suggest they were not interested in taking the government, he also said that PML-N has given no such hint.\nHe said the PML-N has the PPP-P\u2019s unconditional support so these meetings are not being held to determine any power sharing formula. \u201cThe PPP has already stated that it will not be part of the federal government. The PPP\u2019s support for PMLN is to ensure democratic process in Pakistan does not derail.\u201d\nA PPP leader said if the PML-N was not interested in forming a government, as some of its leaders have suggested then it should request the PPP-P to take the lead. He said the PPP-P has the potential and the capability to steer the country out of all the crises.\nHe said if it gets the chance, the PPP-P will seize this opportunity as it knows that it can reach out to independent candidates for smooth function of assembly business.\n\u201cThe PML-N only have us to bank on, whereas the PPP would have not only the PML-N but also the PTI backed candidates to reach out to. So we would be in a much more comfortable position. If this happens, the PPP will offer the presidency to the PML-N.\u201d\n"

Arif Lohar and Noori, accompanied by their respective musical groups, infused the stage with pulsating energy and enchanting melodies.\nAdding to the spectacle, Ali Zafar and Aima Baig, the voices behind the official anthem of HBL PSL 9, captivated the audience with their musical prowess and electrifying performance.\nZafar mesmerised the crowd with a dazzling medley featuring his past PSL anthems, adding an extra layer of excitement to the show.\nThe celebration also featured a captivating laser show, enriching the overall entertainment experience for the audience.\nPSL is a T20 league contested by six city-based franchise teams. It was founded by the Pakistan Cricket Board in 2015.\nThis year, the event is being held in four cities \u2013 Karachi, Lahore, Multan and Rawalpindi, with the final scheduled to be played at National Bank Stadium, Karachi on March 18.\nMeanwhile, Islamabad United won the opening game of the Pakistan Super League against defending champions the Lahore Qalandars by eight wickets on Saturday.\nPromoting himself to No.3, captain Shadab Khan led the way by blistering an unbeaten 74 runs off 41 balls after taking 1-24 with the ball. Two-time champion Islamabad cruised to 200-2 in 18.2 overs after Lahore made 195-5.\nRassie van der Dussen led Lahore with an unbeaten 71 off 41 balls and Sahibzada Farhan added a rapid 57 up front.\nFarhan dominated the power play against fast bowler Naseem Shah, who returned after five months out due to a shoulder injury. Naseem claimed the wicket of David Weise in the penultimate over. Naseem's younger brother, Ubaid, had a forgetful league debut, being smashed for 15 in his only over.\nVan der Dussen crashed four boundaries and three sixes in the death overs. Shadab and Salman Ali Agha plundered 138 off 67 balls in a third-wicket stand. Agha made 64 off 31.\nLahore badly missed leg-spinner Rashid Khan of Afghanistan, who was ruled out of the tournament because of back injury.\nAlso, Haris Rauf, whose Pakistan contract was terminated this week after he refused to play tests in Australia last year, conceded 38 in his three overs. Shaheen Shah Afridi, who dropped Shadab early on, ended up with 0-31.\n"

This move sparked rumors on social media speculating that he had fled following the \"disclosures.\"\nOn Saturday, the Punjab Information Department invited both the Rawalpindi commissioner and RPO for a news conference related to the Pakistan Super League (PSL) cricket tournament.\nHowever, the RPO's office clarified that the senior official had applied for leave before the elections, which was not approved at that time but was later granted after the polls. The RPO was present at his office on Friday before traveling to Lahore in the evening.\nThe additional responsibilities have been entrusted to Rawalpindi CPO Khalid Hamdani in the RPO's absence. Authorities stated that it was unclear whether Ali had indeed left for the UK or remained in Lahore. They confirmed that he had taken a 14-day leave and was expected to resume duty on March 2.\nThe Express Tribune attempted to contact the Rawalpindi RPO but there was no answer.\nA handout issued by the Punjab police spokesperson read that the Rawalpindi RPO had applied for a 14-day leave for his trip abroad on January 17 this year before the elections.\nIt added that a formal summary in this connection was sent to the Punjab CM\u2019s Office on January 30.\nThe handout continued that the interim Punjab government had approved the 14-day leave of the Rawalpindi RPO based on the recommendations of the summary.\nRead ECP refutes Rawalpindi commissioner's allegations, initiates inquiry\nIt issued a notification that allowed him to leave the country from February 18 to March 2.\nThe Rawalpindi RPO\u2019s spokesperson said the official was on a pre-approved leave for a trip abroad from February 18 to March 2.\nThe spokesperson added that the RPO had applied for a leave to go abroad to the UK a month before and it was approved two weeks ago.\n\nHe refuted the \u201cbaseless\u201d speculations on social media that the RPO\u2019s leave was linked to the allegations made by the Rawalpindi commissioner.\nTaking on social media platform X, interim Punjab CM Mohsin Naqvi also confirmed that the Rawalpindi RPO leave was approved on January 30 this year and notified on January 31.\n\u201cLet's foster positivity and refrain from unnecessary controversies. [The] RPO Rawalpindi is a dedicated career officer deserving our respect,\u201d he wrote.\nA day earlier, Rawalpindi Commissioner Chatha dropped a bombshell, confessing to his role in \u201crigging\u201d the recent elections, a week after polls marred by allegations of manipulation returned no clear winner.\nTaking responsibility for what he termed a \"heinous crime,\" Chatha implicated not only himself but also pointed fingers at the head of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and the country\u2019s top judge -- thrusting them into the spotlight.\nThe \u2018confessions\u2019 came as the ECP has already been in the crosshairs of several rigging allegations in the aftermath of a tumultuous week and thick clouds of manipulation continue to linger over results, throwing further questions over the legitimacy of the ballots.\nChatha, in a stunning admission, announced his intention to surrender to the authorities, acknowledging his role in \u201ctampering\u201d with the electoral outcome by turning the tables and \u201cflipping losers into winners\u201d.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n"

            "Text": "PPP chief Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has revealed that he was offered to lead the next possible coalition government as the prime minister for two years. However, he declined the offer as his party only wants to ensure democracy and the survival of the federation.\n\"If I have to become the prime minister, I will want the people of Pakistan to elect me to that position,\u201d Bilawal said on Sunday while addressing a public meeting in Thatta district of Sindh organized to celebrate the PPP\u2019s landslide election victory in the province.\nAfter the Feb 8 general elections, the PML-N and the PPP respectively emerged as the largest and the second-largest party in the National Assembly.\nThe parties, together with the MQM, the IPP, the PML-Q, and BAP, later agreed to form a coalition government with the two leading parties holding talks to decide a power-sharing formula.\nTalking with reference to these negotiations, Bilawal said the PPP does not want federal ministries in return for supporting the PML-N\u2019s candidate for the position of the prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif.\n\"We only want to ensure that democracy and the federation survive. We want to extinguish the fire [of division and hatred] which is spreading in Pakistan. This is why we have decided that [PPP Co-chairman] Asif Ali Zardari will be the party\u2019s candidate for president,\" he added.\nHe expressed hope that his father, after assuming the presidency, will not only be able to douse the raging flames of political differences but also save the federation. \"Once again, we have to raise the slogan of Pakistan Khappay [we want Pakistan].\"\nAfter the assassination of Bilawal\u2019s mother\u2014PPP former chairperson Benazir Bhutto\u2014in December 2007 in a bomb attack in Rawalpindi, Zardari had famously raised the Pakistan Khappay slogan to douse the flames of communal hatred in Sindh, to which Benazir belonged.\nReferring to the protests against rigging initiated by various parties in Sindh, Bilawal likened the post-Feb 8 elections situation with the events of 1977 when his grandfather and former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's victory was denied, and the circumstances paved the way for martial law.\nRead more: PPP urges SC to take notice of Pir Pagara\u2019s statement\n\"Bhutto had won the elections but when the Nine Stars alliance [Pakistan National Alliance, which comprised nine political parties] started a campaign, the democratic process was rolled back, and the country had to bear with the dictatorship of Ziaul Haq for over 10 years.\"\nBilawal contended that the politicians who look towards dictatorship to get power still exist.\n\"When they talk about rigging today, they are actually demanding that a dictatorship-like system should be established in the country.\"\nHe appealed to all political parties to try to find solutions to their issues in the democratic dispensation.\nIn the same breath, he warned the people that if the tendency for seeking undemocratic solutions continued, some elements would keep dividing them in the names of religion, sect, and ethnicity.\nHe later sought a promise from the Jiyalas\u2014PPP\u2019s loyalists\u2014that they will take to the streets on his call if democracy faces some serious threat.\nThe PPP's chairman said they tried a lot to help PTI founder Imran Khan understand the need to strengthen democracy and parliament, but to no avail.\nHe claimed that even till today Imran\u2019s party appeared non-serious as its leaders claim that they have won the elections and can singularly form the central government and that too without the PPP's votes.\n\"We have decided to support those who have come to us and asked for our votes. But we will take no ministries and will pursue no personal interests except the public interests and the basic issues.\"\nAlso read: PML-N, PPP fail to reach consensus on govt formation\nPolitics in Sindh\nTaking reference to Sindh, where the PPP swept the polls, he said he did not know about Pakistan, but the Sindh government was going to be formed on the basis of Form 45, tacitly conveying his distrust of election results in Punjab while simultaneously asserting the authenticity of the election results in Sindh.\nCommenting on the ongoing protests staged by the GDA, the JUI-F, and the JI against alleged rigging in Sindh, Bilawal asked leaders of these parties to substantiate their allegations with evidence. He expressed his readiness to go for by-polls at such constituencies.\nIn a rejoinder to the allegations of GDA's leader Pir Pagara Sibghatullah Shah Rashdi against the PPP\u2019s alleged role in rigging, Bilawal said Pagara and even his deceased father faced electoral defeats at the hands of his mother--Benazir Bhutto\u2014and grandfather Zulfiqar Bhutto.\nHe recalled the results of the 2002, 2008, 2013, and 2018 general elections and said despite rigging by the GDA and the PML-Functional, which is now a part of the GDA, they lost all those elections to the PPP.\n\"Mullah (JUI-F's Rashid Mehmood Soomro) was demanding one seat in each division [of the province], and Pir Sahab was demanding 10 seats,\" he claimed, referring to some back channel communications among these parties.\nThe PPP's chairman also revealed an episode of an interaction with Pir Pagara's brother Sadaruddin Shah Rashdi some years ago and quoted him as saying that \"at present we are against you but in the end we will be with you\".\nBilawal argued that both the JUI-F and the GDA are mistaken about their electoral support in the province because they only keep in sight their public meetings which are attended by the students enrolled in the seminaries and the spiritual followers of Pir Pagara.\nAccording to him, neither such students have the right to vote for the JUI-F nor the spiritual followers can be assumed with certainty to become voters.\nhttps://t.co/uUP3320DFz\nHe also responded to the JUI-F's claim that Bilawal was even defeated in his family's constituency in Larkana by Soomro. \"What type of joke is it? On the one hand you call yourself a maulana and on the other hand you tell a lie so firmly.\"\nHe pointed out that he has won NA-194 Larkana with a lead of around 100,000 votes against Soomro.\nHe invited both the GDA and the JUI-F for a contest in the by-elections on one of the two NA seats which he will vacate either from Larkana or from Qambar-Shahdadkot NA-196 where he defeated Rashid Mahmood Soomro's brother.\nBilawal said his party is being accused of perpetrating violence during the polling but these claims run contrary to fact. He said his workers Shiraz Awan, Abdul Malik Mari, Raza Khoso, and Bilawal Zardari were killed in Karachi, Khairpur, Sanghar, Mirpurkhas, and Naushehro Feroze districts.\n"

            "Text": "Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) has urged the judiciary to take notice of the remarks made by the Grand Democratic Alliance's (GDA) leader, accusing them of supporting a potential coup. \nSpeaking at the press conference in Hyderabad on Saturday, PPP Sindh President, Nisar Ahmed Khuhro, brought the Supreme Court's attention to the statement made by GDA chief Pir Pagara Sibghatullah Shah Rashdi.\nKhuhro quoted Pir Pagara as suggesting that the judiciary might endorse an emergency or martial law, which he deemed as a looming possibility. \nPir Pagara also predicted a short duration for any coalition government formed by PPP and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), estimating it to last no longer than eight to ten months.\nKhuhro condemned Pir Pagara's statement, alleging that it unjustly implicated the judiciary and constituted slander. \"By advocating for martial law, Pir Pagara is violating Article 6 of the constitution,\" Khuhro asserted. \nHe further criticised Pir Pagara for abstaining from the election campaign, accusing him of remaining inactive while GDA candidates canvassed without their leadership.\nAccusing GDA, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), and Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) of attempting to instigate chaos in the country, Khuhro referenced past remarks by PTI leader Imran Khan about using nuclear weapons.\n\nRead\u00a0GDA\u2019s sit-in protest against \u2018rigging\u2019 starts on Friday\nHe argued that GDA and JUI-F leadership similarly sought to pave the way for martial law due to their electoral losses.\nKhuhro emphasised that Pakistan cannot afford another undemocratic regime, citing PPP's decision to support a PML-N candidate for prime minister as a move towards restoring stability. \nHe clarified that PPP's support would not entail joining the federal government, but, would support democracy.\nSpeaking of the sit-in protests by GDA and JUI-F, Khuhro noted that these parties did not receive a mandate from the people of Sindh in previous elections. \nHe questioned the absence of protests in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), where JUI-F lost previously held constituencies, unlike in Sindh.\nKhuhro criticised the disruption caused by the parties' blockades of highways and motorways in Sindh, highlighting the adverse impact on ordinary citizens.\n"

            "Text": "During the winter season, people require a stable supply of gas not only for cooking purposes but also for heating their homes in a cost-effective manner however, for citizens in the coastal city of Karachi, plagued by incessant gas outages, even the routine task of preparing basic meals and hot beverages in the kitchen requires much patience and effort.\nNadia, a homemaker residing in a flat at the Rashid Minhas Road shared her struggle to prepare meals given the sporadic spells of gas loadshedding. \u201cSince the onset of the winter season gas is unavailable for almost 16 to 20 hours a day. Not only is the supply cut off through the night, it is also stopped throughout various times of the day,\u201d said Nadia.\nConcurring with Nadia, Farida, a resident of Surjani Town, and Sahar, a resident of Liaquatabad, both revealed that the unannounced closure of gas, had disrupted their cooking schedules and eating habits.\n\u201cMany a times our children have to go to school hungry since there is no gas before 8am in the morning,\u201d lamented Farida.\n\u201cWhen our LPG cylinders run out, we have no choice but to purchase bread, and tea from the hotel, which is very costly,\u201d added Sahar.\nSeconding Sahar, Ali Suhail, a finance officer at a firm, said, \u201cPeople are already suffering due to inflation and limited financial resources. When there is no gas at night, people have to line up at the hotel and buy bread.\u201d\nAsif Raza, a hotel owner, confirmed Suhail\u2019s observation, when he reported receiving a large influx of customers, who could not prepare bread at home due to the gas outage. \u201cWe are also using LPG stoves at our hotels, due to which the cost of bread has increased,\u201d revealed Raza, who further added that due to the increase in demand for LPG, commercial cylinders were booked by hotels a week in advance.\n\nRead\u00a0Gas shortage puts extra financial burden on consumers\n\u201cAt present, apart from domestic consumers, most of the food manufacturers are running their business on LPG. Since, natural gas reserves are depleting rapidly, in the next two to three years, it is estimated that 90 percent of Karachi\u2019s domestic consumers will shift to LPG,\u201d predicted Masood Khan, a local distributor of LPG.\n\u201cDue to the increasing demand, some profiteers are selling LPG from Rs270 to Rs300 per kg informed Irfan Khokhar, chairman of the LPG Distributors Association, who implored the government to formulate a strategy for making LPG more affordable in the coming years.\nAccording to Mohammad Owais Ashraf, an expert in the energy sector, a lot of investment is needed in the energy sector for discovering new gas reserves. \u201cAt present, natural gas reserves are decreasing rapidly therefore, circular debt in the gas sector has to be reduced,\u201d opined Ashraf, who stressed on the importance of resolving the country\u2019s energy crisis for future generations.\nHowever, Abdul Sami Khan, Chairman of the All-Pakistan Petroleum and CNG Dealers Association believed that energy projects initiated by the government usually failed to reach completion. \u201cIn 1990, an environment-friendly energy project was launched to reduce the consumption of petroleum, by switching a large number of vehicles to CNG. However, the Pak-Iran Gas Pipeline Project could not be completed due to various reasons, and we used up our natural gas reserves mercilessly. Now the situation has become such that gas is also disappearing for domestic consumers,\u201d highlighted Khan.\n\u201cSince the demand for gas during winters exceeds its supply, the gas load management plan has to be implemented,\u201d claimed an official from the Sui Southern Gas Company.\n"

Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJ) Qazi Faez Isa, who is also the JCP chairman, will chair the upcoming meeting of the commission.\nOn December 4, the CJ formed a committee to review the JCP Rules 2010 and define the protocols for appointing judges to the superior judiciary.\n\nThe Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) has persistently advocated for alterations in the JCP rules, proposing that the sole authority to select judges should not rest with the chief justice of Pakistan.\n\nHowever, at the December 4 meeting, two JCP members, Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Munib Akhtar, had expressed objections to the committee's formation at this juncture, especially in the absence of an elected government.\n\nPBC member Advocate Akhtar Hussain had highlighted that judge appointments, being a policy matter, have nevertheless been executed. Stressing the urgency of filling vacant positions in high courts, Hussain had urged the expeditious framing of judge nomination regulations.\n\nOn December 17, The Express Tribune had reported that the committee, formed by CJ Isa, is contemplating the establishment of a committee to nominate candidates for appointment as judges in the superior courts.\n\nSources had suggested that the committee aimed to regulate the discretionary powers of chief justices concerning the appointment of judges to the superior judiciary.\n\nA member of the rules committee informed The Express Tribune that there was also a proposal for a medical board to assess the health and mental condition of judge nominees.\n\nTo ensure timely appointments to vacant positions in high courts and the apex court, deadlines will be specified in the JCP rules.\n\n"

The last round of such polls faced rejection by the apex court.\n\nPreviously, on February 2, a day after PTI announced the schedule for fresh inter-party polls, the party opted to postpone them until after February 8.\n\nThe decision was attributed to the commitments of members in their respective constituencies and alleged \"unlawful blocking of PTI venues by the administration.\"\n\nAhead of the polls, the Supreme Court had stripped the party of its symbol, upholding the Election Commission of Pakistan's (ECP) decision to declare PTI's internal polls as \"unconstitutional.\"\n\nConsequently, the party lost its iconic 'bat' electoral symbol, compelling its members to contest elections as independent candidates under different symbols. Furthermore, PTI forfeited the right to reserved seats for women and minorities.\n\nIn the aftermath of the general elections on February 8, a significant number of PTI-backed independent candidates emerged victorious. However, due to the altered political landscape, the party had to forge an alliance with the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) to secure reserved seats.\n"

            "Text": "In an attempt to appease foreign and local human rights groups, the government has time and again announced special quotas for civil service positions for differently-abled persons however, poor implementation and a lack of dedication towards reserving the seats has meant that thousands of aspiring candidates for government jobs remain at fortunes mercy.\nZakia Parveen, a government job aspirant from Lahore, has suffered from polio since childhood due to which her physical mobility is constrained, and she has to use a wheelchair. Her husband too lives with hearing and speech impairment. \u201cI have passed the intermediate exam and have been trying for a government job since several years but have not been successful,\u201d lamented Zakia, who further claimed that thousands of differently-abled people like her had been unsuccessful in securing a government job despite having the necessary education, skills and ability.\n\u201cAs per data from the World Health Organization, 15 to 20 percent of Pakistan\u2019s total population comprises of people suffering from some kind of disability. But, unfortunately, the quota of jobs for special persons is only 3 per cent,\u201d revealed Wajid Hussain, President of the Rights of Special Persons Welfare Foundation (ROSP), who was of the opinion that a lack of awareness and facilities for the special needs of differently-abled persons had aggravated their isolation from paid employment.\n\u201cTransportation is a big problem for differently-abled persons and half their salary is spent on commute only,\u201d added Hussain.\nRead: Job cuts expected at banks in Asia\n\u201cDifferently-abled persons require a disability certificate to get a job, but it is very difficult to obtain this certificate since only one hospital, the Services Hospital, issues it in the city. It takes the whole day for many differently-abled persons to reach there and wait for their turn,\u201d explained Syeda Imtiaz Fatima, founder of the Independent Living Home.\nAccording to a report obtained by the Express Tribune from the Pakistan Public Administration Research Center, Establishment Division for the year 2021-22, the number of differently-abled persons recruited under the two percent quota in federal departments was only 1704 while the total number of federal employees was 575,354. Furthermore, despite the reservation of the 3 per cent quota, more than 150 reserved seats in Punjab were vacant, while no reserved seats quota existed for the transgender community.\nZanaya Chaudhry, a trans rights activist, working as a contractual Victim Support Officer for the Punjab Police confirmed that no quota was fixed for the transgender community in government jobs. \u201cA major reason behind this is that most educated transgender persons, including myself have had their gender written as male on their educational certificates. Even though, I was able to change my gender officially, most people are unable to do so since the process is long, complicated and costly,\u201d shared Zanaya.\nSpeaking to the Express Tribune on the matter, Punjab Social Protection Authority\u2019s (PSWA) Vice-Chairperson Jahan Ara Watto said, \u201cThe Labor Department is working to ensure that the 3 per cent quota allocated for special persons is respected in government employment, The biggest problem for people with disabilities is the lack of basic training, education, technical skills, access to infrastructure, transport and proper medical care facilities.\n"

Alarmingly, UNESCO reports that globally, 40 percent of the population lacks access to education in a language they speak or understand.\nRamzan Baloch, a writer, raises concerns about languages unsupported by the state, such as Balochi, lamenting its lack of encouragement in school curriculums. \nRead:\u00a0Embracing diversity\n\"If we aspire to cultivate a diverse society, we must actively promote all languages spoken within the country,\" Dr. Wassan urged, citing the threat of language imperialism that jeopardizes hundreds of languages. \"There is a complete dominancy of English language across the world. Everyone wants to learn it. It seems the only way of survival for many,\" he added.\nDr. Wassan, speaking from his anthropological perspective, advocates for the conservation of all languages, underscoring their role in facilitating understanding across different cultures and preserving heritage. \"We have to respect all languages. All languages,\" he urged.\n\"The essence of folk wisdom lies in language. The organic solution to any issue lies in the mother tongue, and we should respect each other's languages,\" asserted Amar Fayaz, the linguist. \nFayaz emphasises the pivotal role of language in transmitting knowledge from one individual to another, asserting that no single language can single-handedly preserve humanity, rather, it is the collective interconnectedness of languages that achieves this.\nHighlighting the politicization of languages in Pakistan, Fayaz urges for a shift towards fostering love and empathy through our languages, emphasizing their inherent interconnectedness.\nIn cities like Karachi, many parents express apprehension as their children do not learn their mother tongues in schools. \"The education system aims to teach children a particular language, primarily English, creating a significant detachment from our own culture,\" lamented Mustafa Aziz, a resident of Mehmoodabad. \nAziz's concerns echo those of Baloch, who criticizes the intellectual class for neglecting their own languages.\nReferring to the United Nations' endorsement of linguistic rights, Baloch advocates for primary education to be delivered in the mother tongue. \nDr Wassan said that the 'Mother Tongue Day' serves as a reminder of the imperative to preserve linguistic diversity, ensuring the safeguarding of our collective cultural heritage for generations to come.\n"

The teams, equipped with DGPS and other accessories, will send their findings to a designated lab for processing and preparation of land records.\nMinister of Revenue Younus Dhaga presented plans for the re-writing and special revision of old land records.

The SPSC on Tuesday evening suspended eights of its employees in connection with the incident while the Hyderabad police recorded statements of seven officers and officials but arrested none.\nLater in the evening the commission also announced postponement of the exam to the month of April. The cancellation of the paper, which started around 11am, spurred a furious reaction by the candidates who allegedly damaged furniture in the examination centers in addition to holding protests. \nMore than 306,000 candidates from across the province were enrolled for the test for recruitment on over 2,200 vacancies of BS-16 Secondary School Techer (SST).\nRead:\u00a0CM Sindh orders inquiry into BIEK first-year exam result\nThe SPSC had staggered the candidates on the basis of their districts. The one-paper exam for the candidates started from February 15 in five centers in Karachi, Hyderabad, Sukkur and Larkana. \nThe test was scheduled to last till February 26. The question paper contained 50 multiple choice questions which were divided in three categories of general knowledge, Urdu and Sindhi. On Tuesday, over 23,000 candidates reached to the five centers but they were told the paper has been cancelled.\n\"... the matter has been referred to the district police to conduct a thorough probe and initiate an FIR against the alleged involved officers or officials of SPSC or private persons under relevant law,\" reads a statement issued by SPSC's secretary. \"In order to uphold the commitment to transparency, meritocracy and accountability, the full commission of SPSC has unanimously decided to cancel all the papers of BS-16 SST General and Science categories whether conducted or yet to conducted with effect from February 15 to 25.\"\nThe statement conveyed that the commission of planning to re-conduct the test in the month of April, no definite schedule was provided. The Secretary told the media that they learned about the leaked paper through an online page operated by an individual, Naeemullah Mahar. He blamed Mahar for often defaming his institution and for misleading the youth against them. Nevertheless, he conceded that the information about the leaked paper on Mahar's portal was factual.\nProtest\nThe candidates appearing in the two test centers in Hyderabad and in one center each in Sukkur and Larkana resorted to protests. They staged a sit-in on the road outside Shaheed Umeed Ali Sports Complex near Niaz Cricket Stadium where 5,000 of them had to appear. Another 6,960 candidates were to take test at Public School Hyderabad. Many of them later held a demonstration outside the SPSC's head office on Thandi Sarak road. \nA sit-in protest was also staged outside Sir Shahnawaz Bhutto Memorial Library in Larkana and outside Public School on Airport road in Sukkur. The candidates blamed the SPSC for continuing to obstruct merit based recruitment. They urged the apex court to take notice as well as order punishment against the officers involved in selling off the government jobs. \nSuspension\nAccording to an office order issued in Hyderabad on Tuesday evening by the Secretary SPSC, Assistant Controller Exams-I Zainal Alam, Senior Computer Operators Sajjad Ahmed Chawli and Ahsan Zaheer Abro have been suspended. At least five Naib Qasids including Khan Muhammad Shah, Akbar Ali Dahiri, Syed Shahzed Jaffri, Shahzaib Abro and Aziz Ahmed are also facing suspension. It has been stated in the order that a separate charge sheet against these employees will also be issued.\nMeanwhile, SSP Hyderabad Amjad Ahmed Shaikh confirmed that the police have recorded statements of seven employees of the commission including its secretary and controller. He denied making any arrests.\nChaos at NED\nDuring the SPSC test at NED University ground, there was an uproar when the administrative staff started withdrawing the paper. The candidates got angry, tore the papers, threw chairs and staged a protest on University Road. Clashes also took place between the administration and the candidates while the SPSC staff also escaped. The invigilators said they took back papers as per instructions, the candidates assaulted them unjustly.\nThe Sindh Professors and Lecturers Association Central President Munawar Abbas while talking to The Express Tribune said that he was on duty and the mismanagement reached its peak after taking the papers. The women teachers of the college were mistreated, no security was provided for the teachers. If this kind of mismanagement continues, \"we will not conduct the upcoming exams of SPSC on February 28,\" he said, adding \"we will announce disaffiliation from the SPSC test.\"\n\u00a0\n"

            "Text": "The Senate of the Federal Urdu University (FUU) has short-listed three names for the slot of vice chancellor of the varsity through a voting mechanism.\nThe three names, forwarded to President Dr Arif Alvi, who is also the chancellor of the university, are: Dr Bakht Jahan, Dr Muhammad Ali Shah, and Dr Zaabta Khan Shinwari, respectively the first, second, and third choices. Sindh is left out of the race in short listing done through voting.\nThe names were short-listed during a meeting of university senate chaired by Chancellor Alvi at the Presidency in Islamabad. All members of the senate reached a consensus on the first two names, Dr Bakht Jahan and Dr Muhammad Ali Shah. \nHowever, opinions were divided on the third candidate. Some members proposed Dr Athar Mehboob, but after extensive discussion and a voting process, Dr Zaabta Khan's name was included as the third candidate. The president did not participate in the voting process.\nA senate member who attended the meeting informed The Express Tribune that during deliberations on the selection board for lecturers and assistant professors, some senators expressed concerns about the lack of sharing the inquiry report on which the board's formation was based. \nRead:\u00a0FUUAST entangled in financial quandary\nChancellor Alvi expressed his displeasure in response. Subsequently, a decision was made to maintain the current selection board. The new VC will have the authority to decide within six months of appointment whether to retain or dissolve the board and form a new one.\nThe Senate meeting did not address the university's financial crisis, leaving the resolution of this issue to the incoming VC. The Express Tribune reached out to VC candidate Dr Bakht Jahan for his plans to address the financial crisis. \nHe said that he intended to collaborate with stakeholders and make decisions in consultation with them. He emphasised the importance of stakeholders owning the rule of law and the university. When asked about his approach, he said, \"I will adhere to the law, and I need to familiarise myself with its contents.\"\nDr Muhammad Ali Shah, another candidate for the VC position, commented on strategies to resolve the financial crisis. He acknowledged that financial challenges are not unique and outlined a plan to increase resources, control expenses, and seek support from the public and private sectors. \nRegarding the transfer of the principal seat, he said that, if appointed, he would continue to travel between Karachi and Islamabad as the university has campuses in both cities, making it impractical to stay in one location.\n"

            "Text": "The Power Division, on Tuesday, claimed that it had met the target of freezing circular debt at Rs2.310 trillion as of December 21, 2023, in its efforts to manage the power sector and address technical and commercial losses.\nThe Power Division secretary informed a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Power, chaired by Senator Azam Nazeer Tarar, about this achievement.\n\nThe Secretary of the Power Division provided a detailed briefing on the status of circular debt, explaining that all circular debts had met their set target of Rs2.310 trillion as of December 21, 2023, including those successfully negotiated with the International Monetary Fund, ensuring consistency in 2024 as well.\n\nThe Power Division attributed the achievement of targets to efficiency in managing the power sector and addressing technical and commercial losses through tariff adjustments. Additionally, Rs85.7 billion has been recovered due to an anti-theft drive initiated in the second week of August 2023.\n\nThe ministry stated that addressing circular debt would lead to progress rather than regression. Despite objections from the Election Commission, the Secretary of the Power Division emphasised that restrictions on staff posting had been imposed to control electricity theft.\n\nThe session began with inquiries about the report regarding two matters: awarding of contracts to M/s Sinohydro Corporation for LoT-I, M/s Harbin Electric International for LoT-II, and consultant M/s GOPA Intec for the construction of a 765kV double circuit transmission line from Dasu Hydro Power Station to Islamabad I/C Grid Station and ADB project ACSR Bunting Conductor LoT-11 A, discussed and referred to the Power Division in the last meeting.\n\nThe managing director of NESPAK provided a detailed briefing on DTLP (Lot-I by M/s Sinohydro Corporation Limited), DTLP (Lot-II by M/s Harbin Electric International), DTLP (Consultant Hiring by M/s GOPA Intec), and ADB-4018-2022 (M/s Newage Cables Lahore). Additionally, he discussed the pre-qualification matter with Lot-I by M/s Sinohydro Corporation Limited. The minister for Energy (Power Division) added that the World Bank, being the donor agency, has the right to set the framework for changes, emphasising complete transparency and refuting malicious actions.\n\nRead\u00a0Power Division told to reshuffle DISCOs CEOs\n\nThe committee members also discussed Public Petition No PP-5485 regarding the restoration of electricity in Mirani Dam Feeder Dasht, District Kech. The Power Division explained that the system had deteriorated due to floods and stressed the necessity of local support, as 80% of the inefficiency is attributed to a lack of financial resources and law enforcement support. The chairman committee assured the ministry of his support and recommended writing a letter to the provincial government of Balochistan to facilitate the supply of electricity in the area.\n\nFurthermore, the committee members discussed the recommendations made by the Senate Standing Committee on Commerce in its meeting held on September 12th and 13th, 2023, in Karachi. The secretary of the Power Division expressed that the commerce, power, finance, and petroleum divisions are collectively working to resolve the matter, especially concerning the substantial tariff involved.\n\nThe committee members also considered Public Petition No PP-5652 & 5653 against the management of K-Electric (KE) IBC for the illegal disconnection of PMT in Jahanabad near Gulshan-e-Maymar, Karachi. The KE official explained that after analysis, it was discovered that the fault was at the PMT end, and the issue had already been resolved.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 21st, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

            "Text": "Pakistan\u2019s power generation dropped by 2.4% to 8,314 Gigawatt hours (GWh) in January 2024 due to low demand in the system during the winter month. However, the cost of the fuel component in the overall production surprisingly surged by 23% to Rs13.79 per unit due to increased reliance on expensive fuels like imported gas, furnace oil, and diesel.\nAccording to data compiled by Arif Habib Limited, electricity generation decreased by 2.4% in the month under review compared to 8,515 GWh in January 2023.\n\nDespite the low demand in the system, Pakistan increased generation from expensive fuel-run power plants after generation from comparatively low-cost powerhouses declined, including nuclear plants, local coal-fired plants, and local gas-run plants. Production from the cheapest hydropower plants increased on a year-on-year basis but remained relatively low in the month.\n\nWhile speaking to The Express Tribune, Pak-Kuwait Investment Company\u2019s Head of Research, Samiullah Tariq, stated that production from the cheapest hydropower plants increased by 15.5% to 924 GWh in January on a year-on-year basis.\nProduction from hydel plants, however, remains low usually in January when the flow of water decreases due to the maintenance of canals.\n\nProduction from the second-cheapest nuclear power plants reduced by around 8% to 1,728 GWh in January compared to the same month of the previous year, \u201capparently due to conjunction on transmission lines taking power from the south to the northern parts of the country,\u201d Tariq said.\n\nHe maintained that while nuclear power plants are installed in Karachi (south), production from the plants is utilised primarily in the high-demand areas located in the north of the country.\n\nBesides, production from other cheaper sources like solar and wind also remained low in January compared to the same month of the previous year due to seasonal constraints.\n\nIn this backdrop, and to keep the transmission lines working, the government had to increase production from expensive options like furnace oil and diesel.\n\nRead\u00a0Power generation hits 33-month low\nAdditionally, higher availability of imported (expensive) LNG in the month allowed the government to utilise the fuel for power generation, pushing the power tariff higher.\n\nAHL stated in a brief comment that during January 2024, actual power generation was 4.7% lower than the reference generation. \u201cThis decline in generation is expected to result in higher capacity charges for the third quarter (Jan-Mar) FY23 QTA (quarterly tariff adjustment).\u201d\n\nTariq explained that the lower production causes an increase in capacity payment, resulting in making power tariffs more expensive for end-consumers.\n\nThe research house\u2019s work shows generation on diesel cost (only fuel component) at Rs45.61 per unit in January, while there was no diesel-based production in January 2023.\nThe fuel cost of furnace oil surged by 22.33% to Rs35.44 per unit in the month compared to Rs28.97 per unit in the corresponding month of the previous year.\n\nThe price of imported power surged by almost 28% to Rs32.80 per unit. The cost of production (fuel cost only) through imported gas-fired power plants rose by 11% to Rs24.30 per unit.\n\nThe cost of production on local gas shot up by 43.3% to Rs13.75 per unit after the government increased the fuel price for the first time in November 2023. The local gas was made further expensive for different users the second time in February 2024.\n\nThe cost of generation through local coal-fired plants surprisingly spiked by 72.3% to Rs11.92 per unit in January compared to Rs6.92 per unit in January 2023.\n\nNuclear power became costlier by almost 24% to Rs1.33 per unit compared to Rs1.07 per unit this time last year.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 21st, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

They highlighted that Pakistan is facing numerous challenges regarding food insecurity and malnutrition, which stem from issues such as poverty, limited access to clean water, inadequate infrastructure, and climate change-induced disasters like floods, torrential rains, and droughts. The experts suggested that the government should make comprehensive efforts to address these challenges by improving agricultural practices, investing in infrastructure, enhancing social safety nets, and promoting sustainable development initiatives.\nThese discussions took place during a two-day Pakistan-Korea Nutrition Centre (PKNC) conference on food nutrition and public health held at the main auditorium hall of Sindh Agriculture University (SAU) on Tuesday. The event was organised by SAU\u2019s Institute of Food Sciences and Technology in collaboration with the Korea International Cooperation Agency Pakistan and the University of Agriculture Faisalabad.\nExperts underscored the need to control post-harvest losses by implementing various measures, including improving infrastructure for storage and transportation, promoting modern harvesting techniques, educating farmers on proper handling and storage practices, implementing effective pest control measures, encouraging the use of appropriate packaging materials, and investing in technology for monitoring and managing post-harvest processes. They also highlighted the importance of establishing cold chain facilities and promoting value addition through food processing to reduce losses and improve the efficiency of the agricultural supply chain.\nDr Kim Jae Han, Programme Manager of Pakistan-Korea Nutrition Centre, advocated for increased attention to agricultural production and rural health. He delivered a presentation on the significance of nutrition and health education programmes at universities.\n\nRead\u00a0Global collaboration for food security stressed\nSindh Agriculture Research Director General Noor Muhammad Baloch highlighted the need to reclaim 8 million hectares of uncultivated land for agriculture and to train rural women in kitchen gardening.\nSAU VC Professor Dr Fateh Marri highlighted that 45% of children under five years of age in Pakistan are affected by food shortages, with over 32% being underweight for their age and 15% suffering from severe malnutrition. He stressed the need for collaboration among scientific institutions, experts, and stakeholders to ensure food security.\n\u201cClimate change has had negative effects on agricultural production and its quality, which also pose major risks to food security,\u201d he added.\nSindh Food Authority Director General (DG) Agha Fakhar Hussain stressed the importance of addressing health hazards associated with harmful food and announced the expansion of the food business monitoring system. Moreover, initiatives such as chemical analysis and microbiology laboratories are in progress, along with training and internship programmes for university graduates to play a role in local communities.\nSAU Institute of Food Sciences and Technology Director Professor Dr Aijaz Hussain Soomro said factors of climate change, including more rains, sudden floods, and water shortages, have been taking a heavy toll on food security in the country.\nUniversity of Agriculture Faisalabad Dean Dr Masood Sadiq Butt highlighted the benefits of food processing, value addition, food composition, maternal and child health, and education.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 21st, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

The human resource, coupled with the mineral resource, will lead to a stable, prosperous, and rising Pakistan,\u201d the prime minister said, addressing the signing ceremony of a joint venture agreement between Pakistan Mineral Development Corporation (PMDC) and the US-based Miracle Saltworks Collective Incorporated for establishing a dedicated facility for crushing and packaging pink salt for export purposes.\nManaging Director of the PMDC, Asad Ahmed, and President of Miracle Saltworks Collective Incorporated, Ahmed Nadeem Khan, signed the agreement, witnessed by Prime Minister Kakar, Energy Minister Muhammad Ali, and relevant senior authorities.\nThe prime minister said the practice of exporting raw materials should come to an end as the export of products after value addition was direly needed.\n\u201cThis is the path for Pakistan. This is the right step. We will be exporting quality product in the coming days. Pakistan will get rightful branding for its product. This will pave the way for further opportunities,\u201d the prime minister remarked, who also distributed awards among individuals who played a key role in the joint venture agreement.\nCalling the US a \u201cmost valued\u201d trading partner of Pakistan, he said the agreement symbolised the investment climate in the country that would further strengthen the friendship between the two countries and their people.\nHe said the decision of the US-based firm to invest $200 million in Pakistan was a resounding vote of confidence in the government\u2019s economic policies. Prime Minister Kakar said the investment was not just about pink salt but about trust, partnership, and shared prosperity.\nHe told the gathering that the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) was playing an important role in creating an enabling environment for foreign direct investment. It serves as a one-window facility for investors besides streamlining processes and removing bureaucratic hurdles to attract investment in the fields of mining, energy, IT, agriculture, livestock, industry, and tourism, he added.\nThe prime minister lauded the friendship of the American people, calling them the \u201cmost warm and generous\u201d people on earth with openness and liberal values which was a role model for a thriving economy.\n\nRead\u00a0PM calls for utilisation of natural resources\nHe said Pakistan was not rich for its geostrategic location rather it was a geo-economic offer as the country sat on the Tethyan Belt of 2800sq km filled with immense mineral resources.\nEarlier, Energy Minister Muhammad Ali said the agreement was the beginning of a long journey that would boost investors\u2019 confidence. He said Pakistan had tremendous potential in the mineral sector, and the government was committed, focused, and has prioritised the sector to exploit the potential through more investment in the pink salt sector.\nPMDC Chairman Shamsuddin lauded the SIFC\u2019s role which led to a surge in PMDC\u2019s profit by three to four times compared to last year. He said the PMDC\u2019s geologists were actively moving around for exploration purposes and hoped that the number of mining leases would continue to grow.\nShamsuddin called for further empowerment of the SIFC, strengthening of the Geological Survey of Pakistan besides providing security to miners, and amending the rules to streamline processes.\nManaging Director of PMDC Engineer Asad Ahmed said the agreement represented the culmination of excessive collaboration between the partners and thanked the petroleum ministry and SIFC for effective coordination.\nChief Communications Officer of the Miracle Saltworks Collective Incorporated Mubarak Khan called the agreement the beginning of a great journey and a great opportunity for Pakistan as the pink salt would act as an ambassador in millions of homes internationally.\nExecutive VP and Chief Financial Officer Miracle Saltworks Collective Incorporated said the project would lead to the global monetisation of Pakistan\u2019s mineral resources, which was one of the richest countries with huge mineral resources.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 21st, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

            "Text": "The Pakistan Peoples Party and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz finally cooked up a deal on Tuesday night to once again sew together a coalition government in the Centre \u2013 ending ten days of intense negotiations after an inconclusive national election failed to crown a clear winner.\nThe parties reached a consensus on splitting up the power pie, deciding on crucial positions including prime minister, president, governorships, and chairman Senate.\nUnder the power-sharing recipe, Shehbaz Sharif is set to assume the role of prime minister once again, while Asif Ali Zardari will reoccupy the presidential chair.\nIn addition, a PML-N leader confirmed that the PPP is slated to assume the roles of Senate chairman and Punjab governor, while the governors in both Sindh and Balochistan will belong to PML-N.\nFollowing much uncertainty post-polls, top leaders from both major parties confirmed that they were once again joining forces to form the government \u201cin the nation\u2019s best interest\u201d in their seventh meeting.\nThe agreement put the brakes on the days of political limbo, potentially resolving the deadlock in the wake of the Feb 8 elections that left the national assembly hanging in the balance.\nThe development came as despite consecutive meetings, the situation appeared to be slipping out of control when Bilawal, in a press briefing earlier in the day, clearly stated that PPP would cast its vote for PML-N's prime ministerial candidate on its own conditions.\nHowever, by the end of the day, there was a surprising turn of events as Bilawal declared that the PPP would extend support to Shehbaz to become the premier before midnight.\nRead more: Bilawal stands firmly by PPP's stance on govt formation\nThe official declaration that the PPP would cast their votes in favour of Shehbaz for his prime ministerial election, reciprocated by PML-N's support for PPP to secure Zardari as the resident, was announced during a late-night press conference at Zardari House in Islamabad.\nBefore this public announcement, both sides initially fine-tuned the details of the upcoming coalition government through their respective committees. The finalisation of the modalities took place at the residence of PML-N leader Ishaq Dar on Tuesday, with the top leadership of both parties in attendance.\nBilawal Bhutto Zardari confirmed at the conference that former premier Shehbaz Sharif, who was seated beside him, would be the coalition's candidate for prime minister. He added that his father Asif Ali Zardari will be the alliance's candidate for the country's president.\n\u0644\u0627\u0626\u06cc\u0648: \u0686\u06cc\u0626\u0631\u0645\u06cc\u0646 \u067e\u0627\u06a9\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u067e\u06cc\u067e\u0644\u0632\u067e\u0627\u0631\u0679\u06cc \u0628\u0644\u0627\u0648\u0644 \u0628\u06be\u0679\u0648 \u0632\u0631\u062f\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u060c \u0632\u0631\u062f\u0627\u0631\u06cc \u06c1\u0627\u0648\u0633 \u0627\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0622\u0628\u0627\u062f \u0645\u06cc\u06ba \u067e\u0631\u06cc\u0633 \u06a9\u0627\u0646\u0641\u0631\u0646\u0633 \u06a9\u0631\u0631\u06c1\u06d2 \u06c1\u06cc\u06ba\u06d4 https://t.co/xAaBnKsUno\nShehbaz Sharif said the two parties had the numbers to form a government and also had the support of other smaller parties. PML-N is the largest party with 79 seats and PPP is second with 54. They, along with four other smaller parties, have a comfortable majority in the legislature of 264 seats.\nThe delay in forming a government has caused concern as Pakistan is grappling with an economic crisis amid slow growth and record inflation, rising militant violence, and needs a stable administration with the authority to make tough decisions.\nBhutto Zardari said the parties would push to form a government as soon as possible. According to the country's constitution, a session of parliament has to be called by Feb 29 after which a vote for a new prime minister will take place.\n\"Pakistan Peoples Party and Muslim League Nawaz now possess the requisite numbers, placing us in a position to establish the forthcoming government,\" stated PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari during a press conference in Islamabad, accompanied by senior leaders from both parties.\n\u067e\u0627\u06a9\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0633\u0644\u0645 \u0644\u06cc\u06af (\u0646) \u06a9\u06cc \u0633\u06cc\u06a9\u0631\u0679\u0631\u06cc \u0627\u0637\u0644\u0627\u0639\u0627\u062a \u0645\u0631\u06cc\u0645 \u0627\u0648\u0631\u0646\u06af\u0632\u06cc\u0628 \u06a9\u0627 \u0627\u06c1\u0645 \u0628\u06cc\u0627\u0646\n\n\u067e\u0627\u06a9\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0633\u0644\u0645 \u0644\u06cc\u06af (\u0646) \u06a9\u06d2 \u0635\u062f\u0631 \u0627\u0648\u0631 \u0646\u0627\u0645\u0632\u062f \u0648\u0632\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0639\u0638\u0645 \u0634\u06c1\u0628\u0627\u0632 \u0634\u0631\u06cc\u0641 \u0633\u06d2 \u067e\u0627\u06a9\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u067e\u06cc\u067e\u0644\u0632 \u067e\u0627\u0631\u0679\u06cc \u06a9\u06d2 \u0686\u06cc\u0626\u0631\u0645\u06cc\u0646 \u0628\u0644\u0627\u0648\u0644 \u0628\u06be\u0679\u0648 \u0632\u0631\u062f\u0627\u0631\u06cc \u06a9\u06cc \u0645\u0644\u0627\u0642\u0627\u062a\n\n\u0645\u0644\u0627\u0642\u0627\u062a \u0633\u06cc\u0646\u06cc\u0679\u0631 \u0627\u0633\u062d\u0627\u0642 \u0688\u0627\u0631 \u06a9\u06cc \u0631\u06c1\u0627\u0626\u0634 \u06af\u0627\u06c1 \u067e\u0631 \u06c1\u0648\u0626\u06cc pic.twitter.com/rv7e8V8GXB\nWith no single political party securing a simple majority in the February 8 elections, alliances became necessary for the pursuit of governmental power. The delay in reaching an agreement had raised concerns.\nWhile negotiations unfolded for government formation, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) had formed an alliance with the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) to secure the necessary numbers through reserved seats in the assemblies.\nHowever, Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari informed reporters that the SIC lacked sufficient numbers to lead the next central government. He revealed that Shehbaz would be the next prime minister, with Zardari as the joint presidential candidate for both parties.\nEmphasising their commitment to resolving the ongoing crises, Bilawal expressed optimism about the ability of both parties to deliver results once in power.\nAlso read: PML-N choices for finance minister limited\nAddressing a question about PML-N leader Ishaq Dar's nomination as Senate chairman, Bilawal explained that decisions were made during meetings and would be announced separately by each party. He highlighted the efficiency of past coalitions and decision-making processes compared to previous tenures.\n"

            "Text": "The Sindh High Court (SHC) ordered on Wednesday the restoration of all social media apps, including the micorblogging website \u2018X\u2019, and sought explanation from the relevant authorities regarding internet outage on the election day.\nA two-member bench, headed by Chief Justice Aqeel Ahmad Abbasi, heard the petitions against the shutdown of internet services on the election day. The court expressed concern over the widespread shutdown of internet services during the crucial election period.\nThe lawyer for the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) informed the court that instructions from the interior ministry had to be implemented, adding that they received the instructions and implemented them.\nThe government lawyer argued that there were certain legal issues because of which such action had to be taken. The chief justice told the government side to fix the issues before things go out of hands. \u201cYou do your job better and we will do our job,\u201d the chief justice remarked.\nAmid political, economic and security challenges coupled with rigging allegations arising out of February 8 elections, the government restricted access to \u2018X\u2019 \u2013 formerly known as Twitter \u2013 in the country without giving any reasons.\nMedia watchdog the Freedom Network termed the internet outage an \u201cundeclared censorship\u201d and held the caretaker government responsible for \u201cviolating fundamental rights of citizens\u201d. In a statement it demanded that the public access to the social networking platform must be restored immediately.\nDuring the SHC proceedings, the chief justice highlighted the criticism and allegations of irregularities raised by national and international observers and media outlets. In sarcastic remarks, he addressed the authorities, saying: \u201cYou people conducted a very good election. Everyone in the world is hailing it.\u201d\nThe chief justice further remarked, \u201cYou shut down the internet...you did not allow people to contest elections. You people did not allow anyone to run an election campaign,\u201d suggesting that the internet shutdown might have hindered the democratic process.\nThe court ordered the restoration of all social media apps, including X. It also sought an explanation from the authorities concerned regarding the suspension of internet services on the election day and adjourned the hearing until March 5.\nMeanwhile, services of social media platform X (formerly Twitter) have been disrupted for the fifth day today. The platform has been inaccessible since Saturday when former Rawalpindi commissioner Liaquat Chattha held a press conference and accused the chief election commissioner and chief justice of being involved in rigging the general elections.\nAs the proceedings commenced, Justice Abbasi quipped: \u201cThe way you held elections, everyone around the world witnessed it. Even the international media is telling the world how elections were held.\u201d\nAlso read: X becomes govt's first target\nHe noted that the internet was not working \u201chere, there or anywhere\u201d, adding that the services were disrupted everywhere.\n\u201cDon\u2019t do this, the public understands who is doing what,\u201d the judge remarked. \u201cLet the whistle of the pressure cooker blow lightly, the more you try to clamp it down the larger the explosion would be,\u201d he warned.\n\u201cWho\u2019s going to be president, who\u2019s going to be prime minister, who will get governorship; if this had to happen, why were elections held?\u201d Justice Abbasi asked.\nJustice Abbasi said: \u201cWhat was the need for the elections if positions were to be distributed sitting in a\ndrawing hall? You people are powerful and can do whatever you want to.\u201d\nHe further lamented that the courts and all other institutions had lost their respect. \u201cWho is running the country?\u201d the judge asked.\nFor his part, the PTA counsel said the government had decided to shut down internet and cellular services on Feb 8 over security reservations submitted by provinces.\n\u201cA law and order situation in the country was prevented because of this decision,\u201d he claimed, adding that the most important factor was national security.\n"

        },
        "Details": {
            "Text": "In a majority verdict that will have implications for former Supreme Court judge Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi, the apex court has ruled that if the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) has started misconduct proceedings against a judge, these proceedings will continue even if the judge retires or resigns.\n\"If proceedings have already been initiated by the SJC against a judge, the same shall not abate on his resignation or retirement, as the case may be, during such proceedings. It is the prerogative of the SJC to proceed with the matter accordingly,\" said a short order issued by a five-judge larger bench on Wednesday.\nThe bench led by Justice Aminuddin Khan was hearing an intra-court appeal filed by the government against a Supreme Court verdict that declared that judges who retire or resign do not fall within the ambit of Article 209, which deals with misconduct by superior court judges.\nA division bench of the Supreme Court, comprising Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Munib Akhtar, had passed this order last year\u2014on June 27, 2023.\nUnder the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023, an intra-court appeal can be filed against a Supreme Court order. Such appeals are supposed to be filed within 30 days after a verdict.\nHowever, the government filed the intra-court appeal against the Supreme Court ruling on January 23, 2024\u2014almost seven months later\u2014after Justice Naqvi submitted his resignation while the SJC was concluding misconduct proceedings against him on allegations of financial corruption and manipulation of benches.\nIn its short order, the Supreme Court condoned the delay by the government in filing the appeal while partially allowing it. The order noted that one member of the larger bench\u2014Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi\u2014disagreed with the majority's decision on the point of \"limitation as well as on merits.\"\nEarlier, during the proceeding of the case, Attorney-General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Awan argued that it is the prerogative of the SJC to take action on misconduct committed by a judge during his service. \"The judiciary guarantees fundamental rights; therefore, it should be independent,\" he said.\nAwan said independence of the judiciary will be affected if it avoids accountability of judges. He said under Article 209, only the SJC has the authority to inquire against superior court judges.\nAlso read: \u2018Tainted\u2019 SC judge doffs robe to \u2018save face\u2019\n\"It is not necessary to recommend their removal if judges violate the Code of Conduct. If a judge is suffering from a curable mental illness, the SJC can also grant leave to that judge for treatment. It can also admonish a judge who is not punctual,\" he said.\nHe said when a complaint is brought before the council, it is necessary to give some opinion on it. Awan said after the retirement of a judge, he may be appointed to constitutional positions such as Chief Election Commissioner, Shariah Court judges, or tribunals.\n\"It is essential for the council to give its opinion on the allegations against a judge so that appointments can be made on constitutional positions.\"\nThe AGP said judges should be held accountable, but this accountability should not diminish the dignity of the Supreme Court. \"No other institution can take action against judges. For public trust, the SJC should work transparently,\" he added.\nOne of the amici curiae, Khawaja Haris, said with the retirement or resignation of a judge, the SJC's proceedings become meaningless.\n\u201cIt is not necessary for a judge to resign only because the allegations against him are true; a judge can also resign if he cannot tolerate the ridicule,\u201d he said.\nWhen one of the judges, Jamal Khan Mandokhail, asked if a judge should not give reasons for his leaving the post in his resignation, Haris said such reason should definitely be cited if the law demands it.\n\u201cThe purpose of Article 209 is to remove a judge from office. If a judge is not in office, then how can the council proceed with the action? If a judge has retired or resigned, then what recommendation will the council make to the president?\u201d he asked.\nWhen Justice Mandokhail questioned whether the SJC should abruptly terminate its proceedings upon resignation of a judge, Haris replied in the affirmative. \"For example, if a judge resigns on the 11th and the council resumes proceedings on the 12th, then the judge is no longer present.\"\nJustice Mandokhail said Section 5 of Article 209 states that the SJC can continue proceedings even if a judge is not in office.\n\u201cIn the case of a judge's resignation or retirement, only the part related to recommending to the president will become irrelevant. Inquiry on a complaint against a judge is necessary. Wouldn't a judge prefer to go home acquitted of the allegations against him?\u201d he noted.\nHaris said under the laws of Pakistan, the sentence awarded to a convicted is terminated if he passes away.\nWhen the judge asked as to who can stop the SJC if it decides to take action against a judge, Khawaja Haris replied that the Supreme Court has that authority. He cited the example of Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry case in which the SC stopped the SJC from conducting proceedings.\nAnother amicus curiae, Akram Sheikh, however, opined that the SJC proceedings should not depend on a judge\u2019s resignation or retirement.\nEarlier, Justice Mussarat Hilali, a bench member, cited the example of a judge in Kolkata High Court, noting that misconduct proceedings against the judge did not stop upon her resignation.\n\n"

            "Text": "The process of allotment of reserved seats for women and minorities to the political parties in the National Assembly and the provincial legislatures has entered its final stage, following the compiling of the results of the recent general polls by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) but the situation has become intriguing after the PTI-backed independent lawmakers, who has just joined the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), has 93 members in the lower house of parliament as well 84 and 116 in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab assemblies, respectively.\nAs per the Constitution, the reserved seats are allocated to the political parties on the basis of the number of their lawmakers elected on the general seats. For their allocation, the ECP had already received the priority list of candidates from the parties before the February 8 general elections.\nThe situation this year is different from the previous elections as the largest group of lawmakers are independents, who cannot have the reserved seats.\nBarring a few, these independents are backed by the PTI, which was unable contest on its popular electoral symbol of the \u2018cricket bat\u2019.\nThere are a total of 346 reserved seats for women -- 60 in the NA and 66, 29, 26, and 11 in the provincial legislatures of Punjab, Sindh, K-P, and Balochistan.\nSimilarly, there are 10 reserved seats for minorities in the lower house. Besides, there are eight, nine and three reserved seats for minorities in the Punjab Sindh, and Balochistan assemblies.\nBased on the current election results, the PML-N is likely to bag 17 reserved seats for women in the NA, 33 in Punjab and one in Balochistan.\nBesides, it will also be allocated two reserved seats for minorities in the lower house and four in Punjab.\nThe PPP will fetch 10 reserved seats in the NA from Sindh as well as a reserved seat each for women and minorities from Punjab in the lower house.\nThe party will receive 19 reserved seats for women and six for minorities in the Sindh Assembly. In addition, it will bag two reserved seats for minorities in the Punjab Assembly as well.\nThe MQM-P will bag four women's seats in the NA. It will also fetch six seats for women and two for minorities in the Sindh Assembly.\nBased on these figures, if the PTI-backed members after their inclusion in the SIC, the party will be allocated 22 reserved seats for women in the NA, 20 in K-P, and 27 in Punjab, beside three seats for minorities.\nHowever, the SIC had neither applied for any reserved seat to the ECP -- a requirement under the law -- nor had it filed a priority list of candidates before the elections.\nAlso, the ECP has already rejected the Form 33 nominations filed by the PTI candidates for the reserved seats.\nSources said the SIC would apply for the allocation of the reserved seats to the ECP.\nIn case, the ECP decides against the SIC, those 22 NA and 20 provincial assembly seats might be allocated to the other parties.\nAccording to the lists submitted to the ECP, the PML-N women lawmakers who will take the NA seats include Tahira Aurangzeb, Shaista Pervaiz Malik, Marriyum Aurangzeb, Nuzhat Sadiq, Musarrat Asif, Seema Mohiuddin, Shaza Fatima, Romina Khurshid Alam, Wajiha Qamar, Zaib Jaffar, Kiran Imran, Anusha Rahman, Zahra Wadood Fatemi, Asyia Naz Tanoli, Saba Sadiq, and Farah Naz Akbar.\nThe party\u2019s nominees to take seats in the Punjab Assembly include Zakia Khan, Ishrat Ashraf, Azma Bokhari, Hina Pervaiz Butt, Salma Saadia, Rahila Naeem, Bushra Anjum, Sania Ashiq, Salma Butt, Kanwal Pervaiz Chaudhry, Mehwish Sultana, Nosheen Adnan, Asma Ehtishamul Haq, Kausar Javed, Uzma Jabeen, Ambreen Ismail, Mumtaz Begum, Sandal Malik Hussain, Rukhsana Kausar, Shazia Rizwan, Motiya Begum, Rabia Naseem Farooqui, Sonia Ashir and Uzma Kardar.\nFor the PPP, those taking the reserved seats in the NA include Hina Rabbani Khar, Shehla Raza, Shagufta Jumani, Mehreen Razak Bhutto, Naz Baloch, Sharmila Farooqi, Mehtab Akbar Rashdi, Shazia Sobia and Mudassar Sahar Kamran.\nThose to take seats in the Sindh Assembly include Seema Khurram, Tanzeela Umm Habiba, Rehana Leghari, Yasmin Shah, Nuzhat Pathan, Syeda Marvi Faseeh, Sadia Javed, Farzana Hanif, Sajila, Hina Dastgir, Rukhsana Parvez, Nida Khoro, Saima Agha, Ruma Sabat, Arooba Rabbani, Khairun Nisa and Maleeha Manzoor.\nThe MQM-P's top list for the NA includes Asia Ishaq Siddiqui, Nighat Shakeel Khan, and Sabeen Ghori.\nSofia Saeed Shah, Sikandar Khatoon, Kiran Masood, Farah Sohail, Bilqis Mukhtar, and Qaratul Ain are the MQM-P\u2019s picks for the seats in the Sindh Assembly.\nIn the current National Assembly at least 10 political parties are out of the race for receiving the reserved seats.\nThese parties include the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), Istehkam-e-Pakistan Party (IPP), Markazi Muslim League (MML), PML-Q, PML-Zia, BNP-M, BNP-Awami, BAP, PkMAP, ANP and Jamaat-e-Islami (JI).\nPreviously, the PTI started negotiations with the JI to use its platform for bagging the reserved seats. However the talks, according to sources, broke down because the JI had already submitted its list of candidates for the reserved seats that could not be altered.\nAccording to the sources, if the PTI used the JI platform, it would put 22 JI lawmakers in the NA, besides 30 in the Punjab Assembly and a large group in the K-P Assembly.\nThe PTI independent members were of the opinion that the move would directly benefit the JI.\u00a0 Therefore, they refrained from forming an alliance with the party.\nAn ECP spokesperson drew attention of the politicians for the reserved seats to file the returns of their election expenses (Form C) by Wednesday (today).\n"

            "Text": "Widespread protests persist against alleged poll rigging in Quetta and other regions of Balochistan, marking a significant escalation in unrest. The four-party alliance comprising Baloch, Pashtun, and Hazara nationalist parties has maintained a sit-in outside the deputy commissioner\u2019s office in Quetta, denouncing the purported election irregularities.\n\u201cWe refuse to relent until our demands are addressed,\u201d declared Haji Atta Muhammad Bangulzai, a prominent leader of the National Party (NP), who claims victory in a provincial assembly seat from the Sariab Road Quetta constituency. Notably, women are actively participating in the protest demonstration, underscoring the widespread discontent.\nThe alliance, consisting of Balochistan National Party (Mengal), Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), National Party (NP), and Hazara Democratic Party (HDP), has issued ultimatums to the Election Commission of Pakistan and returning officers across the province, warning of intensified protests if their demands are not met.\nIn a separate demonstration, supporters of the Pashtoonkhwa National Awami Party (PNAP) marched through Quetta\u2019s streets, decrying the alleged overturning of Khushal Khan Kakar\u2019s victory in NA 251 Zhob, Killa Saifullah, by the returning officer.\nRead:\u00a0PTI stage countrywide protests against poll \u2018rigging\u2019\n\u201cOur candidate\u2019s triumph in NA 251 was unjustly nullified,\u201d asserted Raza Muhammad Raza, a central leader of PNAP, amidst fervent flag-waving. The protest rally, originating from Jinnah Road, converged into a sizable demonstration at Bacha Khan Chowk, with attendees vociferously condemning the Election Commission of Pakistan and the returning officer.\nTheir primary demand is the immediate issuance of the victory notification for Khushal Khan Kakar in NA 251. Simultaneously, the Awami National Party (ANP) mobilized in protest against alleged election malpractices in Chaman, led by provincial president Asghar Khan Achakzai, who criticized the returning officer and ECP for purportedly overturning his electoral success.\nAdditionally, the Sibi Ittehad and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) organized protests in Sibi, Naseerabad, and Loralai, demanding the prompt issuance of victory notifications for their respective candidates.\nThese protests, ongoing since February 9, have brought Balochistan to a virtual standstill, as major highways remained blocked, underscoring the deep-seated frustration and discontent among the populace regarding the integrity of the electoral process.\nOn February 15, at least two people were killed and around a dozen injured during an exchange of fire between two rival political groups in the Hub city of Balochistan as police failed to bring the situation under control.\nA peaceful protest in PB-21 against alleged result changes in the general elections turned violent. Chaos erupted on the national highway near the Civic Center, resulting in the loss of two lives and injuries to around a dozen people in a gunfight between two groups.\n"

The objective is to resolve the long-standing problem of Nullah Leh in three phases.\nThe trunk sewerage system will be built on both sides of the Nullah Lei in the first phase, the canal will be paved from the middle to accommodate the rainwater in the second phase, while roads will be constructed on both sides of Nullah Leh in the third phase.\nThe Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA) has been appointed as the executing agency to hire the services of a consultant for a comprehensive feasibility study to construct a large sewage trunk on both sides of Nullah Leh. The cost of the project has been approved under Project Concept-2 (PC-2) and it will be included in the future annual development program (ADP).\nRead:\u00a02m face Glacial flooding in Pakistan\nThe consultant will be assigned to prepare Project Concept -1 (PC-1) so that under the second phase, the middle part of the drain can be paved and the clean rainwater be passed from there and thrown into Swan River.\nUnder the first phase, trunk sewerage will be constructed on both sides of Nullah Lei along the 16km long route from New Katarian Bridge to Swan River, for which funds will be released after the feasibility study is completed.\nAccording to the RDA sources, Nullah Lei will be covered with sewer trunks construction in the first phase, the middle part of Nullah Lei will be paved and rainwater will flow from there in the second phase and the third phase, roads will be constructed on both sides of Nullah Leh. The project will ease the woes of Rawalpindi city and Cantt motorists through an alternative route of traffic to Islamabad.\nThe Nullah Leh\u2019s open sewage has been the cause of heavy losses of life and property during floods in monsoon. The need to solve the long-standing problem was strongly felt in 2006-7 when 80 human lives were lost and financial losses of billions of rupees during a historic flood in 2001-2.\nThe project to construct the Expressway with a secure sewerage system began in 2006-7, however, the 2008 governments in the federal and Punjab terminated the project.\nDespite all efforts and announcements, the work on the Nullah Lei project could not be started due to its high cost, but now the caretaker Punjab government decided to start the Nullah Lei project in three phases.\n"

            "Text": "The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has taken serious notice of the persistent breach of its orders in the Pakistan LNG case, issuing notices to high-ranking officials, including the chairman of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), the member operations-IR, and tax employees of the Islamabad tax office.\nThe notices were served in response to the allegedly unauthorised recovery attempts through the attachment of bank accounts belonging to power distribution companies (DISCOS).\nThe court has mandated appearances for February 22 (Thursday).\nReliable sources reveal that the DISCO, after the prolonged silence from FBR/LTO Islamabad, took legal action through tax lawyer Waheed Shahzad Butt.\nThe petition raises concerns over the alleged tax robbery tactic, executed without proper legal procedure, and in direct violation of the IHC's binding order in the Pakistan LNG case. The petition contends that the matter had not been clarified despite previous instructions from FBR regarding the necessity of obtaining prior approval from the member operations.\nWaheed Butt asserts that certain tax employees at the Islamabad tax office are openly flouting FBR instructions regarding the attachment of bank accounts of DISCOS, National Transmission & Dispatch Company (NTDC), and Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA).The lawyer said that the instructions issued in C. No. 6 (21) S (IR-Operations)/ 2017/ 35481-R dated 20.03.2017 have been blatantly ignored and violated by LTOs without any apprehension of accountability, a claim reaffirmed by the parent agency (FBR) on November 27, 2023.\nIHC after hearing the DISCO argument issued notices to the Secretary Revenue Division, Member (Operations), Chief CIR, CIR and DCIR, Zone-II, LTO, Islamabad.\nIHC order states, \u201cThe petitioner is aggrieved by recovery notices dated 22.02.2023 pursuant to which coercive recovery has been affected from the accounts of the petitioner. The learned counsel for the petitioner states that the assessment order was pending adjudication before the commissioner (Appeals), who by order dated 21.02.2023 had dismissed the petitioner\u2019s appeal. Such order was communicated to the petitioner at 02:00 p.m. on 22.02.2023.\u201d\nHowever, without issuing any prior notice after the dismissal of the petitioner\u2019s appeal or even the communication of the appeal order to the petitioner, coercive recovery was affected at 09:00 a.m. on 22.02.2023 in breach of law.\n\u201cHe states that the coercive recovery is also in breach of the instructions issued by FBR to the Commissioner, by letter dated 20.03.2017 directing the Commissioners that coercive recoveries are not to be affected against discourse without the prior approval of FBR,\u201d it said.\n"

He pointed out that since the nationalist parties tasted drubbing and faced challenges, they were raising hue and cry.\nIn a pointed remark, Bugti further observed that nationalist parties tend to claim righteousness in areas of victory while resorting to criticism and accusations against institutions in regions where they face defeat.\n"

            "Text": "The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) issued the gazette notification late on Saturday, announcing the successful candidates for the national and provincial assembly constituencies of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. It encouraged the independent candidates to join any political party of their choice, should they wish to do so.\nElections in the province were held for 44 National Assembly seats and 113 constituencies of the provincial assembly on February 8. The ECP held back the announcement of the results of eight National Assembly and 23 K-P Assembly for various reasons.\nMost of the winners in the provinces are the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) backed candidates, who contested the elections as independents because the ECP had denied the party of its electoral symbol of \u2018bat\u2019 because of its controversial intra-party elections.\nAs per the law, the independent candidates could join any political party within three days of the issuance of the gazette notification; otherwise, they would remain independents till the tenure of the assembly.\nConsequently, the newly elected National Assembly members (MNAs) have until Monday (today) to join a political party, should they decide. Similarly, the newly-elected members of the provincial assembly (MPAs) have until Tuesday (tomorrow) to take the decision.\nThe newly-elected MNAs include Ali Amin Gandapur from NA 44; Sibghatullah, NA-4; Gohar Ali Khan, NA-10; Omar Ayub Khan, NA-18; Asad Qaiser, NA-19; Shandana Gulzar, NA-30; Shehryar Afridi, NA-35; Sher Afzal Marwat, NA-41; and others.\nGandapur, who has been nominated by the PTI as its candidate for the post of K-P chief minister, had also won a provincial assembly seat PK-113, Dera Ismail Khan. However, the notification issued on Saturday night did not include his name, which was notified on Sunday.\nThe gazette notification of eight National Assembly constituencies in K-P, which had not been issued so far, include Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Quaid Nawaz Sharif's constituency of NA-15 Mansehra, PML-N Provincial President Amir Muqam's constituency of NA-11 Shangla besides NA-27 Khyber, NA-28 Peshawar, NA-38 Karak, NA-40 North Waziristan and NA-43 Tank.\nThe 23 withheld results of the K-P Assembly constituencies include 8 constituencies of Peshawar \u2013 PK-72, PK-73, PK-74, PK-75, PK-78, PK-79, PK-80 and PK-82. The other constituencies include PK-20 and 21, Bajaur; PK 28, 29, and 30, Shangla; PK-40 Mansehra; PK-41 Torghar; PK-44 Abbottabad; PK-95 Kurram; PK-101 and 102, Bannu: and PK-103, North Waziristan\nBefore the elections, the ECP postponed the voting in Bajaur district\u2019s constituencies of NA-8, and PK-22 because of the assassination of a candidate Rehan Zeb. The voting for PK-91, Kohat was postponed after the death of candidate Ismatullah.\nSindh & Punjab\nThe ECP has been notifying the success of candidates in due course. On February 13, it announced the victory of Mian Azhar, a PTI-backed independent candidate for NA-129, Lahore, besides 54 newly-elected independent MNAs on February 16.\nNow, the ECP has also notified the success of seven independent Sindh MPAs. They are Ejaz Khan, PS-88; Wajid Khan, PS-92; Nazar Mehmood, PS-93; Mohammad Owais, PS-96; Bilal Hussain Jadoon, PS-109; Rehan, PS-110; Sarbuland Khan, PS-112; and Muhammad Shabbir, PS-114.\nHowever, apparently, a lack of decision-making by the PTI leadership, regarding joining a party, eliminated the chances of getting reserved seats for women and minorities under articles 51 and 106 of the Constitution.\nAccording to the Rule 92 (6) of Election Rules 2017, the winning independent candidates can formally inform the ECP regarding their decision of joining a political party within three days of the issuance of gazette notification of their victory. Otherwise, the candidate will remain as independent.\nThose notified on Friday could join a political party by Monday. However, Mian Azhar failed to produce any document related to his joining any party within the specified period. Therefore, he would remain as independent, according to sources.\n"

Was this petition filed for fame, the chief justice asked, adding that the court would hear the case.\n\nA court order later said that the petition was filed on Feb 12 and before filing the plea, publicity was made in electronic and print media.\n\nThe Registrar's Office raised objections to the petition, but considering the importance of the case, the petition was fixed for hearing with the registrar's objections.\n\nHowever, the order said, after filing the petition and gaining maximum publicity, the petitioner filed another plea for withdrawing the petition.\n\nNormally, the court said, an applicant was entitled to withdraw the plea but in this case, the petitioner exploited the situation and achieved his personal objective.\n\nThe court order said that the petitioner was being given another chance, therefore, apart from the usual practice, court notices should be complied with through the concerned police station house officer (SHO). As the petitioner was a retired brigadier, the notice should also be complied with through the defence ministry.\n\n"

On Monday, the six district returning officers (DROs) of Rawalpindi division submitted their written statements to the committee.\n\nAccording to sources, the committee will record testimonies of the returning officers (ROs) from the 13 NA constituencies.

He said that woodworking skills are fundamental in the furniture manufacturing process, from crafting intricate designs to ensuring the structural integrity of pieces. However, the demand for skilled woodworkers in Pakistan exceeds the available workforce. \nThis shortage was attributed to various factors including limited vocational training programmes, low wages and a lack of interest among the young generation to pursue careers in woodworking, he added. The PFC chief said that export-oriented furniture manufacturers heavily rely on timely deliveries to maintain customer satisfaction and uphold the global market.\nHowever, the scarcity of skilled woodworkers has led to production bottlenecks, prolonging lead times and jeopardizing shipment schedules, he mentioned.\n"

            "Text": "The Punjab Police top brass for the past over two decades has been struggling to build a positive, soft image of the department.\nOther than official pronouncements and meetings, \u201cChanging the thana (policing) culture\u201d has been a slogan of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) during all these years.\nPakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), even before forming its government in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), had been eagerly vowing \u201cde-politicisation of police stations and making them public-friendly\u201d.\nBillions of rupees have been pumped over the years into different projects -- the most recent one of turning over 700 police stations in Punjab into lucratively designed, well-furnished Special Initiative Police Stations (SIPS) with a motive described as promoting community policing.\nHowever, all the efforts seem to have been lost after involvement in a targeted crackdown against the workers of a political party since May last year. \nThe acts of blatant abuse of power, violating the sanctity of home and person, harassment of women, children and other family members, illegal detentions, even horrific allegations of sexual harassment, were initially justified as necessary to create deterrence for the protection of institutions and symbols of national integration. \nPost May 9, initially the law enforcement agencies enjoyed a moral high ground. \nAs Hegel\u2019s dialectics describes in \u201cunity of opposites\u201d, after a certain saturation point, a thing, idea or value loses its essence and transforms into its opposite.\nAs the details of gruesome acts of violence and inhumane treatment in the guise of manhunt for the perpetrators came into public eyes, thanks to a party\u2019s vibrant social media cell, the moral grounds were lost. \nAt a polling booth on February 8, a constable lamented that they too were fed up with the immoral acts deemed cultural taboo that they had been forced to do. \nAn SP said he had closely witnessed a transformation in police\u2019s behaviour after the raids on homes and feared that nothing in his house, from household items to family members, would remain safe.\nAfter the General Elections 2024 were announced, the same issue was used to block the PTI from launching a campaign, a fundamental, constitutional right, and the party\u2019s political gatherings were dispersed\nPeople were targeted even in remote villages. In an incident, an advocate of Lahore High Court, Khalid Khan Ranjha\u2019s house was raided by over three dozen unidentified officials and allegedly taken to an undisclosed location along with 70-year-old ailing father in Koray Koth, a small village of Sargodha district. \nTheir crime allegedly was of launching a door-to-door campaign for a PTI-supported candidate.\nThe home of another LHC advocate, Rai Faisal, was raided multiple times in Syed Wala, a village in Nankana Sahib. \nA large number of activists were allegedly abducted before the election day.\nThe election day has passed but the police\u2019s targeting political activists has not come to a halt. Two days back, a video went viral of a man being dragged out of his car at Liberty Roundabout in front of his children and wife for carrying a flag.\nA philosopher said that the people at large do not have opportunities of high formal learning but they learn from their experiences. \nDevelopment of public consciousness is a tedious process but hard to transform or dodge.\nThe Punjab Police cannot build a trustworthy, public-friendly image after acting as a tool of coercion to curb political dissent. \nEven if it starts once again the quest for changing its culture and continues for the next two decades, a few months of a role similar to that experienced during the past year will bring it back to the square one.\nThe departments, especially the police command, must sit together and decide at once never to trespass their role defined in the constitution and laws.\nIn the long run, this is the only way to win public goodwill.\n"

Bahawalnagar police spokesperson Zahid Rasool Khan told The Express Tribune that Talha Arshad, who had completed MPhil in food sciences and was PhD student, had been kidnapped and later shot dead in the head last month. His body was sealed in a box and dumped into an old well. \nThe kidnappers had taken the mobile phone of the victim to Sahiwal and demanded Rs10 million in ransom through a message to release him. After two days, the kidnappers had gone to Donga Bonga on the suburbs of the city and reduced their demand to Rs8 million, threatening to kill the youth if his family did not pay the ransom. \nA couple of days later, they went to Manchanabad and against demand the ransom. \nIn an apparent bid to mislead the police, the kidnapers accuse Talha of harassing women. They also sent a video clip to the family, showing Talha tied with ropes.\nAfter the repeated threats, the family of the victim paid a ransom of $4,000 and $500 more on January 29.\nThe following day, a call was received by of rescue hotline 15 that a box was floating in a well, upon which Sub-Inspector Wahab Aslam reached the spot and pulled out the box with the help of Rescue 1122 officials.\nThe decomposing body of Talha Arshad was found in the box.\nAfter the discovery of the body, the police had arrested two prime suspects in the case. The police were taking the suspect Hameed to help find Talha's motorcycle on Friday night when his accomplices allegedly opened fire on them.\nAccording to the police spokesman, Hameed was killed by the firing of his accomplices who managed to escape after the encounter.\nThe police shifted the body to a hospital for postmortem.\nThe city\u2019s traders had observed a strike and staged a protest sit-in against the police after the murder of the kidnapped youth, after which the DPO had promised steps to ensure justice in the case.\nA team had identified a house used by the suspects with the help of information technology and arrested the suspects after keeping it under surveillance.\n"

            "Text": "In the labyrinthine alleys of Ibrahim Hyderi, amidst the scent of saltwater and the hum of daily life, a centre radiates hope and transformation. Here, Kamran, affectionately known as Kami, and his friend, Ali, are rewriting the script for the transgender community in the country's male-dominated society.\nAt the tender age of 25, Kami stands as a pillar of inspiration at a local centre in Ibrahim Hyderi, a fishing community on the edge of the teeming metropolis of millions of people. Young girls from diverse backgrounds gather to learn the art of beautification, all under Kami's expert tutelage and free of cost.\nFor Saima, a 21-year-old student, Kami's presence not only brings comfort and security but also instills confidence. \"The way Kami teaches is amazing,\" she shares. \"It gives me the assurance that despite the odds, one can develop skills and succeed.\"\nBorn and raised in Ibrahim Hyderi, Kami's journey to earning respect and dignity has been marked by resilience and determination. In a society where acceptance for the transgender community is often a distant dream, Kami and his peers have defied convention and embraced a path less traveled.\n\"People love us. They respect us by heart,\" Kami affirms with a smile, his eyes glistening with pride. His belief in the power of hard work has propelled him forward, leading him to join the Pakistan Fisherfolk Forum (PFF) as an instructor and beautician.\nRead:\u00a0Music, transgender dance banned\nFor over 15 months, Kami has dedicated himself to empowering the young girls of Ibrahim Hyderi, Bangali Para, and neighbouring areas. Under his guidance, more than a thousand girls have embarked on three to six-month courses, gaining valuable skills that promise a brighter future.\nBut Kami is not alone in his mission. His friend Ali, aged 33, stands by his side as an instructor for stitching classes at the PFF. Like Kami, Ali exudes dedication and passion, earning the trust and respect of his community through his commitment to excellence.\n\"At home, I receive the same respect,\" Ali shares, his gaze shifting to the attentive students in his class.\nIn a family of 11, Ali plays a pivotal role in maintaining financial stability, working tirelessly to ensure a comfortable life for his loved ones. Despite the challenges they face, Kami and Ali refuse to succumb to despair. Instead, they embrace every opportunity to uplift themselves and those around them.\nTheir presence at the centre has not gone unnoticed by the community. Syed Qambar Shah, a resident of Ibrahim Hyderi, acknowledges the profound impact of their appointment. \"With the inclusion of transgender individuals at the centre, our community feels a sense of security,\" he reflects. For Ferzana, a student of Ali, the centre serves as a beacon of hope for girls from humble backgrounds.\nBoth Kami and Ali understand the importance of self-reliance and determination. They actively seek opportunities to inspire others, whether through their teaching or their culinary skills. For Kami, teaching at the PFF center is not just a job - it's an honor. It grants him a sense of identity and belonging, reaffirming his place in society.\nIn a world where prejudice and discrimination often reign supreme, Kami and Ali stand as symbols of resilience and hope. Through their unwavering commitment to education and empowerment, they are not only transforming lives but also reshaping societal norms. As they continue to pave the way for a more inclusive future, their journey serves as a testament to the power of courage, compassion, and community.\n"

Mallah, in a fervent plea to these officials, emphasized the transient nature of power dynamics, urging them to uphold principles of justice and fairness.\nMallah underscored the irony of Marri and Mahesh Malani's allegations, given PPP's historical entrenchment in power in Sindh. \nHe pointed out the glaring contradictions, highlighting the extensive control PPP wielded over electoral machinery and personnel, casting doubts on the legitimacy of their complaints.\nDrawing attention to reported instances of coercion and manipulation at polling stations, Mallah denounced the intimidation tactics allegedly employed by PPP-affiliated presiding officers, particularly targeting female voters.

He called for a thorough investigation into the alleged rigging and emphasized the need for re-elections to restore faith in Pakistan's democratic processes.\nIn a scathing indictment, Mallah accused Malani's associates of orchestrating electoral fraud in Mithi city and beyond, questioning the authorities' failure to address these grievances promptly.\nThe GDA's stance reflects a steadfast commitment to upholding the principles of democracy and transparency, as they rally against the encroachment of electoral integrity.\n"

The motive behind the fatal gun attack, whether related to robbery or another cause, remains unknown.\nPreliminary reports suggest that Rehan, a joint in-charge of UC-3 in MQM-P Surjani Town Sector, was outside his wife's aunt's house when two assailants on a motorcycle approached. \nReacting quickly, Rehan pushed his wife indoors, only to be met with gunfire moments later, leaving him critically wounded on the road.\nAs news of the incident broke, Sheikh Abdullah, a newly elected member of the Sindh Assembly from MQM, arrived at Jinnah Hospital. He described Rehan as a responsible worker of MQM-Pakistan. The grieving wife said that the attackers, without any apparent motive, opened fire on Rehan, leaving him critically injured.\nSheikh Abdullah added that another shooting incident had occurred in Surjani Town, targeting an estate agency. The injured in that incident happens to be the father of a prominent MQM-P member.\nPolice are investigating the incident, exploring all possible angles, including robbery resistance. \nSurveillance footage from CCTV cameras along the escape routes is currently being examined by investigators to identify the culprits.\n"

        },
        "Details": {
            "Text": "The caretaker setup assumed control of the federal government of Pakistan in mid-August 2023 under the leadership of caretaker Prime Minister Anwarul Haq Kakar. Since then, it has faced criticism for various measures, despite being a technocratic setup. Generally, this kind of setup is good for initiating necessary actions deemed vital by the state, but can also incite public displeasure. The interim government inherited political, economic, and law and order challenges from its predecessor, the Pakistan Democratic Government (PDM). To address economic challenges such as inflation hike, current account deficit, lack of investor interest due to prevailing uncertainty, and mounting debts, it has focused on bringing foreign exchange to Pakistan through promoting the Information Technology Sector and introducing measures for broadening the tax base through digitisation, among others. No doubt, the performance in the tech sector has remained commendable. Whereas taxation measures have been analysed in the upcoming part of this article.\nThe most important initiative that has remained the talk of the town pertains to the restructuring of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), which the caretaker setup thinks could significantly increase tax revenue and enhance the overall performance of the FBR machinery. The interim government faced backlash from FBR officers too; however, it remained determined and announced the FBR restructuring committee just a week before the general elections, raising questions about the timing of this measure. However, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) refrained from endorsing it, stating that such proposals should be considered by the elected government instead. Measures like these, which could have a significant impact on revenue collection, should never be taken in haste and without thorough consideration.\nIn this short span of approximately five months, the caretaker setup has also issued multiple Statutory Regulatory Orders [SROs] under the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 (the Ordinance) read with Income Tax Rules, 2002 (the Rules), and the Sales Tax Act, 1990 (the Act) read with Sales Tax Rules, 2006 (the Rules), to broaden the tax base through digitisation of processes and systems. Credit for this must also be given to the FBR leadership, which has remained very receptive in bringing about changes and ultimately implementing them. The SROs issued under the Ordinance include SRO 1171(I)/2023 dated August 28, 2023, SRO 1588(I)/2023 dated November 21, 2023, SRO 1771(I)/2023 dated December 05, 2023, SRO 1846(I)/2023 dated December 22, 2023, and SRO 1845(I)/2023 dated December 22, 2023, respectively. While the SROs issued under the Act include SRO 1189(I)/2023 dated September 05, 2023, SRO 1185(I)/2023 dated September 05, 2023, SRO 1525(I)/2023 dated November 10, 2023, SRO 1775(I)/2023 dated December 07, 2023, SRO 1788(I)/2023 dated December 11, 2023, SRO 1525-DI(I)/2023 dated December 12, 2023, SRO 1842(I)/2023 dated December 21, 2023, and SRO 28(I)/2024 dated January 10, 2024, respectively.\nRead:\u00a0Does Pakistan need corporate tax reforms?\nIf the performance of the interim setup is evaluated by focusing on the tax measures taken to promote tax objectives such as documenting the economy, broadening the tax base, and increasing tax revenue, then it can be safely said that it has at least tried to play its role. From bringing rules for record-keeping of beneficial owners to introducing draft SWAPS Rules, which is an initiative to revamp the withholding tax process and further digitise it, the interim setup has been proactive. It has also brought rules for the purpose of section 175A of the Ordinance to provide real-time access to information and databases to the FBR by various specified organisations, which will assist the FBR in multiple ways, including adding those into the tax net who have not yet obtained the registration number and ultimately forcing them to pay their due share of taxes.\nIf the SROs issued for sales tax are considered, we also find that objectives of taxation are being addressed. For instance, enhancing check posts for the purpose of examining goods and related documents in relation to the supplies of goods originating from tax-exempt areas. The broadening of the scope and applicability of the electronic invoicing system is another landmark achievement of the interim setup, by virtue of which the supply chain of fast-moving consumer goods has been targeted. Further, in another SRO, the scope of Tier-1 retailers has also been enhanced by specifying the threshold for the retailer whose withholding tax is deductible under section 236H of the Ordinance. The perspective also exists in Pakistan that it is not just about issuing SROs, but rather strict implementation should also be done. The upcoming elected government will have a strong responsibility on its shoulders to ensure not only the changes brought about during this period but rather that whatever law is in place is given and implemented in a true sense.\nIt should always be considered that measures for the improvement of state institutions should not be changed with the shift of power as this impairs their performance. When it comes to investment opportunities, investors are always looking for consistent policies for over a decade or so at least, so that they are comfortable making their decisions with ease, which unfortunately is always missing when we talk about our country Pakistan. Moreover, the interim setup should always consider the constitutional powers it is subject to so that no measures backfire or legal objections are later raised by the honourable courts having competent jurisdiction.\nThe author is a law graduate with aN ADVANCED DIPLOMA IN INTERNATIONAL TAXATION.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 19th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

        },
        "Details": {
            "Text": "The global textiles and apparel trade is undergoing a significant transformation, shifting emphatically towards man-made fibres (MMF), which constitute around 63% of global textiles and apparel trade, earning them the title of \u201cfibre of the future\u201d.\nHowever, Pakistan\u2019s textile sector stands at a crucial crossroads, predominantly tethered to cotton-based exports, which account for almost 67% of its total textile and apparel exports.\nMMF-based exports account for a mere 12%, thus sidelining itself from the burgeoning MMF market.\nThis reliance on cotton not only highlights a missed opportunity in an evolving industry but also underscores the necessity for Pakistan to diversify and enhance its textile exports towards MMF to overcome economic challenges and increase its competitiveness in the global textiles landscape.\nDespite being among the top 25 textile and apparel exporters, Pakistan has one of the least diversified export baskets.\nTo gauge the idea, around 1% of the product space accounts for around 65% of exports consisting of denim and non-denim fabrics and apparel, knitwear, socks, home textiles and towels.\nMoreover, Pakistan\u2019s textile and apparel exports are highly concentrated in cotton-based products whose share in global trade has shrunk from 40% to 33% between 2007 and 2021 while MMF-based textiles and apparel share has grown from 30% to 35% during the same period.\nSince 2007, Bangladesh, India, China and Vietnam have experienced an increase in the share of MMF-based exports, however, Pakistan has not seen an increase in its exports. Also, the share of cotton-based exports has declined for other countries.\nFor Pakistan, it effectively means that it is competing for a larger piece of a shrinking pie.\nThere are two main factors behind the lack of growth in MMF-based exports. First, the industry lacks the production capacity necessary to manufacture MMF-based products.\nSecond, and more importantly, investment in MMF-based manufacturing capacity has been disincentivised by economic distortions, especially in the realm of trade policy.\nPolyester staple fibre (PSF) is the basic raw material required for MMF production, and purified terephthalic acid (PTA) is the main input for the manufacturing of PSF.\nAs it stands, there is 5% import duty on PTA and resultantly a cascading import duty of 7% on PSF with an additional anti-dumping duty of 12% on PSF.\nRead:\u00a0Textile exports surge to $1.46b\nThe duties on imports were raised from 4% and 6% to 5% and 7% in June 2016. However, Pakistan\u2019s sole PTA manufacturing facility, using an outdated 30-year-old technology, is already outcompeted by newer, more efficient facilities in China and India.\nThe plant survived on cheap gas ($4/mmBtu) for conversion from paraxylene to PTA and subsidised by high duties on imported PTA/PSF at the expense of the export sector.\nFollowing recent gas pricing reforms, the plant\u2019s operational viability has vanished, leading to the argument that the 5% duty on PTA is unnecessary and should be eliminated along with a reduction in PSF import duty to 2%.\nMoreover, in the PSF domain, there are only three major manufacturers that enjoy a protected monopoly due to the imposition of 7% import duties and up to 12% anti-dumping duties on imports of cheaper and higher quality PSF.\nEffectively, this has created opportunities for rent-seeking in the PSF market that Pakistani PSF manufacturers have capitalised on by keeping domestic PSF prices significantly above international prices. Higher PSF prices are further enabled by curbs on import LCs faced by the spinning industry.\nThis rent-seeking behaviour is also triggered by the National Tariff Commission (NTC) of Pakistan.\nThis has been the case with anti-dumping and import duties on PSF. NTC actions, intended to protect the domestic market and support the broader public interest, have unintentionally favored a small group of domestic manufacturers.\nThis has come at the expense of a larger group of exporters, highlighting the unintended negative consequences of protectionist trade policies.\nTypically, in economics, a non-competitive private entity would be shut down. However, public enterprises are treated differently, often receiving support through expansion, or protectionist policies, thanks to their access to extensive financial and political resources, which clearly is not the case or domain for the PTA plant.\nThis situation exemplifies the issue of concentrated benefits and dispersed costs. By levying import and anti-dumping duties, a small group of manufacturers reap the benefits, while the burden of these costs is spread across a wide array of exporters.\nThe imposition of high duties on PSF significantly undermines Pakistan\u2019s textile exports by making the production of MMF economically unfeasible. This situation is discouraging for domestic textile and apparel firms considering investments in MMF production.\nThe disparity is in stark contrast with the cost of PSF in other countries. For instance, textile exporters in China can acquire PSF at 91 cents (Rs255) per kg, whereas in Pakistan, the price soars to around Rs362 per kg, marking a 40% increase.\nGiven the elevated costs of both PSF and PTA, manufacturing MMF is neither viable in the domestic market nor competitive internationally.\nThis leads to an understanding that the primary contributors to the unusually high PSF prices in Pakistan are the extensive import duties on PTA and PSF, coupled with additional anti-dumping duties on PSF.\nMoreover, the situation is exacerbated by the ability of local manufacturers to maintain inflated prices, a consequence of the import Letter of Credit (LC) restrictions confronting the spinning industry.\nThese factors collectively stifle the growth of the MMF sector, highlighting the urgent need for policy revision to alleviate the burden on the textile export market.\nThe need to re-evaluate import and anti-dumping duties becomes critical, especially now that nearly half of Pakistan\u2019s PSF-based spindles are shut down. As the industry aims for export resurgence amid rising demand in major western markets, the domestic supply of both cotton and PSF is insufficient to operate these machines.\nThis shortage is compounded by local PSF manufacturers operating at reduced capacities due to the diminished demand, a result of Pakistan\u2019s PSF prices being significantly higher than those of its regional rivals.\nLowering the import and anti-dumping duties on PSF would facilitate enhanced production levels across the supply chain, leading to increased exports and job creation.\nLastly, enhancing exports of MMF is pivotal for bolstering Pakistan\u2019s textile exports, a crucial step for the country to emerge from its ongoing economic difficulties.\nIncreasing MMF exports would diversify and strengthen the export portfolio, making it more competitive globally and instrumental in economic recovery.\nShahid Sattar has served as member energy of the Planning Commission and Muhammad Mubasal is an economic analyst with experience from his previous role at UNDP\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 19th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

They demanded a judicial probe into the allegations levelled by the Rawalpindi commissioner.\nAyub announced plans to establish PTI governments both at the federal and provincial levels. Omar reiterated the party's capability to assume governance at both tiers. He pledged to prioritize the dismissal of false cases against PTI\u2019s leaders and workers upon assuming office, including those against Imran Khan, Bushra Bibi, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, and Pervaiz Elahi. \u201cAs soon as Imran Khan is released, he will assume the position of prime minister. The premiership is an entrusted responsibility to Imran Khan.\u201d\nOmar hailed the PTI's triumph despite obstacles such as the loss of its signature \u2018bat\u2019 symbol and the incarceration of its top leaders and activists, and called for honouring people\u2019s voice and restoring the PTI's rightful mandate given to it on February 8.\n\u201cWe unequivocally denounce the extensive electoral tampering in the recent polls and term it as \u2018mother of all riggings\u2019,\u201d he said, highlighting a pervasive lack of trust even among beneficiaries of the rigged elections, including Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP).\nEchoing Omar's remarks, Barrister Gohar maintained that the PTI secured 180 seats in the National Assembly in the February 8 vote, only to face alleged rigging during the issuance of election results by the returning officers on Form 47. He demanded the announcement of results as per Form 45.\nAccusing the authorities of \u201cdeliberately delaying provincial election results\u201d to undermine the PTI majority, Gohar called for formation of a judicial commission to probe into election manipulation charges. He urged transparency in the investigation process and public disclosure of its findings.\nReferring to Rawalpindi Commissioner Liaquat Chattha\u2019s resignation after admitting election rigging, the PTI leaders demanded the formation of an empowered judicial commission to investigate the allegations and punish the characters involved in the historic electoral heist.\nWhen asked about a petition in the Supreme Court seeking annulment of the elections and re-polling in the country, Ayub stated that since Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa had been named by the commissioner, his party would request that he should not sit on the bench hearing the case.\nHe explained that the PTI was not demanding the annulment of the general elections rather it wanted that the real mandate be recognised, adding that the results of the February 8 polls should reflect the actual votes cast by the people.\nAlliance talks\nThe PTI leaders did not say which parties they would take as allies to form the government, however, they had previously said that the Majlis-e-Wahdat Muslimeen Pakistan (MWMP) and the Jamat-e-Islami (JI) would be taken onboard.\nIn this regard talks were held on Sunday with the MWMP but both sides could not finalise their alliance. According to sources, the PTI would now form an alliance with the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), which was present in the talks between the PTI and MWMP.\nThe talks at the MWMP Central Secretariat in Islamabad were attended by PTI\u2019s Barrister Gohar and Omar Ayub, and MWMP Chairman Raja Nasir Abbas, Vice Chairman Ahmad Iqbal Rizvi, Secretary General Nasir Abbas Shirazi, Political Secretary Asad Abbas Naqvi.\nOthers who were present in the meeting were Opposition Leader in Gilgit-Baltistan Assembly Kazim Maysam, Gilgit-Baltistan President Agha Syed Ali Rizvi, Malik Iqrar Hussain and Asif Raza. Besides Sahibzada Hamid Raza, the head of the SIC, also attended the meeting.\nRaza said that matters had been finalised between the SIC and the PTI in Punjab and Sindh. \u201cOur services are also available at the Centre and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces, he said.\n\u201cI stand firmly with the PTI founder and we will support them at every platform,\u201d he added.\n"

            "Text": "Former planning minister Ahsan Iqbal has stressed the need for the PPP to jump on board the coalition government bandwagon and share the load as the PML-N does not want to be left holding the bag.\nPPP leader Qamar Zaman Kaira, on the other hand, mentioned that the committee was currently discussing our proposal to allocate constitutional positions to PPP. The majority of decisions have already been made, leaving no room for further deliberation.\nAgainst the backdrop of reports indicating that PML-N and PPP have been apprised of the consequences of shilly-shallying about government formation by the establishment, both sides seem reluctant to budge from their positions.\nHowever, leaders from both sides appear optimistic about reaching an amicable resolution, asserting that there is no fundamental disagreement between the two parties.\nSpeaking to The Express Tribune, Ahsan Iqbal, while reflecting on his party\u2019s concern, said PML-N was reluctant to shoulder the entire burden of decision-making at the central government level.\u2019Ahsan pinpointed that the crux of the matter in the coordination committee revolved around the shared responsibility dilemma, adding that they are not willing to let others merely be spectators on the treasury benches.\nThe PML-N wants the PPP to take the reins of ministries and actively participate in the governmental affairs, he added.\nHe further underscored that without the PPP's presence or a prior understanding of how to tackle the day-to-day affairs of the state, steering the government ship would be a daunting challenge through and through.\nWhen pressed about whether the PML-N is having second thoughts about its decision to lead the government, Iqbal did not provide a clear answer and asked to wait for the outcome of the meeting.\nHe said will PPP want to lead in government if PML-N offered to switch sides with them which meant PMLN would get a constitutional position and the PPP would get the government.\nHowever, when questioned about PPP leading the government independently with the same terms, he switched gears, arguing that it wouldn't make sense for the third-largest party to spearhead the country.\nFurthermore, he asserted that the leadership mantle must be taken up by either PML-N or PTI-backed candidates, adding that the PTI's support lacks the numerical strength \u201cso it was up to them to save this setup.Regarding why was PML-N bothered about what PTI was doing, and why was it concerned about PTI having the required number, he said PML-N could not let this system collapse.\nWhen asked about whether the PML-N was prepared or hesitant to extend the offer for the speaker position, he responded that this would be a mutual decision based on determining the allocation of constitutional portfolios.\nPPP\u2019s ministries\nSenior PPP leader Qamar Zaman Kaira clarified that the issue of PPP not accepting any ministries has been settled, with the focus now on constitutional positions and other related matters.\nHe vehemently refuted media reports suggesting that the PPP was demanding ministries in Punjab.\nKaira shared that the PPP has even declined an offer to hold the prime ministership for half the term, highlighting its commitment to sacrificing for the sake of democracy.\nResponding to PML-N's concerns about PPP potentially abandoning them midstream, he pointed out that it was PML-N's decision to form their government and have their prime minister.\nWhen asked if PPP's participation in the government was entirely ruled out and beyond the committee's purview, Kaira stated that the committee's discussions could not be disclosed to the public.\n\u2018Pressure on PPP\u2019\nA PPP leader, speaking anonymously to The Express Tribune, acknowledged that the party was facing considerable pressure to agree to the proposed arrangement by PML-N.\nThe source expressed suspicions that PML-N might be leveraging its influence through the establishment to coerce PPP into joining the government.\nAsserting PPP's resilience in the face of this pressure, the leader noted that the party is unlikely to back down in this high-stakes negotiation. He said that apart from the visible advantage of insulating itself from any potential fallout of a government\u2019s decision-making, there was another advantage that might come PPP\u2019s way and that was an offer to make their own prime minister.\n"

            "Text": "For any country to embark on the road to socioeconomic progress, the higher education system must educate and train a sizeable population of students in a wide variety of subjects yet as admission rates for the bachelor\u2019s program at the University of Peshawar continue to observe a downward trend, any hopes for a way out of the current state of domestic instability, seems to be fading away.\nFounded way back in 1950, the University of Peshawar (UoP) once held the reputation of being the parent of higher education institutions in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) however, in recent times, a lack of administrative and academic efficiency alongside a deteriorating standard of education has led to a sharp decline in the admission rates across all departments, out of which ten, including the departments of Philosophy, Gender Studies, History, Pashto and Social Work, have no students at all.\nAccording to documents obtained by The Express Tribune, UoP has witnessed an unprecedented decline in admission to its Bachelor of Science (BS) programme, which has received only 3000 students across 53 different faculties this year, that is half of its earlier rate of enrolment, as a result of which the institution is facing a loss of Rs118 million.\nShah Nawaz Khan, an educationist was of the opinion that the UoP has been battling with a serious dearth of financial resources since the past five years due to its poor management.\nRead: Widespread concern as UoP salaries stall\n\u201cA perception has been created among parents and students that not only is the UOP degree expensive but pursuing it is also a waste of time since the teachers and other staff members were always on protest. The standard of education too is deteriorating day by day and students have very little facilities available on campus. Furthermore, since the past one year, the university is functioning without a permanent Vice Chancellor for supervising its affairs,\u201d regretted Khan\nOn the other hand, Dr Muhammad Uzair, President of the Peshawar University Teachers Association opined that apart from poor administration, the dropping rates of admission at UoP could also be attributed to the sprawling of cheaper colleges, which were offering BS degrees at a much lesser fee.\n\u201cIf students can earn a degree for only Rs12,000, why would they choose a university which costs at least Rs70,000,\u201d said Dr Uzair.\nSpeaking to the Express Tribune on the matter, Dr Muhammad Saleem, Pro-Vice Chancellor at the University of Peshawar claimed that multiple factors could explain the declining rate of admission at UoP.\n\u201cSince some time, the government has stopped releasing funds for the education sector due to which the university had to increase its fee, which led to lower admission rates. The UoP will review its admission fee policy to attract more students in the coming years,\u201d he assured.\n"

The Markhor, estimated to be around eight years old, boasted horns measuring 38 inches.\nIt may be recalled that on February 2, in the second hunt of the season, Denis Morozov, a Russian national, hunted down a Kashmir Markhor at Tooshi-Shasha Community Managed Game Reserve within the jurisdiction of Kasit VIllage.\nThe horn size of this mountain monarch was recorded 49 inches. It is mention-worthy that Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Wildlife Department is pursuing proactive conservation of wildlife species with the support of local communities as co-management partners.\nRead:\u00a0Markhor hunted in Chitral with record bid\nIn December last year, an American hunted a nine-year-old Kashmiri Markhor in Toshi Shasha Game Reserve in Lower Chitral. The US citizen, Deron James Millman, secured the bid for this hunt from the wildlife department after paying a hefty amount of Rs65 million or $232,000.\nThis is reportedly the highest bid paid for trophy hunting in Lower Chitral. According to the wildlife department, the markhor\u2019s horn measured 45 inches, with the highest recorded in the conservative areas of Chitral at 53 inches.\nA wildlife department official explained that 70% of the funds acquired from the trophy hunting permit would be retained locally, while the remaining 30% would be directed to the government\u2019s treasury.\nInitially, the number of markhors in Chitral was steadily declining but since the establishment of conservancies and game reserves with the local community\u2019s participation, they have been increasing.\nThe breeding of markhors has now increased significantly and now they number in the thousands.\n"

Similarly, Kalam in Swat, Shangla, and other mountainous districts, including Hazara Division, witnessed heavy snowfall.\nAccording to forecasts from the Met Office and Provincial Disaster Management Authority, the snowfall is projected to persist until the 21st of this month. Areas such as Torkahu, Kahot, Kabor, Lowari Top, Madak, Kashat, Kalash valley, and the picturesque Laspur valley have been blanketed in pristine white snow. Conversely, lower-lying regions like Chitral proper and Darosh experienced nominal rainfall.\nLocal residents highlighted Chitral\u2019s heavy reliance on rain for irrigation, noting a significant decrease in precipitation this year. Consequently, their wheat crops suffered from insufficient water. They also remarked on the heightened chill in the air following the onset of snow in the highlands.\nMeanwhile, the district administration in Dir Upper deployed policemen to enforce the use of snow chains for vehicles traversing the Lowari Tunnel. The prices of timber surged significantly as it became the primary source of firewood due to the absence of Sui gas.\nPDMA issued fresh alerts to all mountainous districts as another spell of snowfall was forecasted from the 18th of this month. A new weather system approaching the hilly districts is anticipated to bring heavy snowfall, rainfall, and high winds, according to a press statement issued on Tuesday.\nRead:\u00a0Murree, Galiyat on high alert in anticipation of snowfall\nDistrict authorities have been instructed to implement precautionary measures and ensure the availability of machinery to clear snow-covered roads and mitigate potential landslides. They are also tasked with disseminating weather forecasts to local residents and tourists to facilitate appropriate precautionary measures and adjustments to travel plans. Additionally, they have been urged to arrange alternative routes in anticipation of road closures due to heavy snow or landslides.\nLast year PDMA, under the guidance of the relief, rehabilitation and settlement department, had formulated the Winter Contingency Plan for 2023-24 in order to cope with various natural hazards in the winter season.\nThe plan encompassed strategies to manage hazards such as extreme low temperatures, fog, smog, snowfall, rainfall, landslides, flash floods and seismic activities in the mountainous north and west.\nIn a press statement, PDMA Director General Muhammad Qaisar Khan stated that the Winter Contingency Plan 2023-24 had been initiated in October 2023 and involved key stakeholders such as the federal government, provincial line departments, the district administration, UNDP GLOF-II and other development partners\nThe statement further said digital tools for data collection had been developed and shared, including information on district, sector-specific hazards, vulnerability profiles, hazard impacts, damages, compensation details, resource mapping, need assessment, and coordination efforts.\nThe Winter Contingency Plan 2023-24 offers a comprehensive overview of the winter hazard profiles for each district in the province. It includes details on the composite risk score for every district based on various hazards and outlines corresponding risks, along with an estimation of the vulnerable population in cases of emergencies.\nThe plan further guides districts in mapping vulnerable sites and developing contingency plans, identifying roles.\n"

He emphasized the formation of a specialized provincial legal team dedicated to this particular cause, underlining the party\u2019s commitment to upholding democratic principles and ensuring fair representation for PTI supporters.\nIn a bold statement, Gandapur expressed a willingness to surrender to lawful arrest if it would ultimately benefit the country. He also highlighted the establishment of a provincial complaint cell modeled after the Prime Minister Portal, stressing the importance of unity in safeguarding the rights of the province.\nRegarding recent incidents of unrest, Gandapur vehemently denied PTI\u2019s involvement and called for a thorough investigation to identify and hold accountable those responsible for any damages. He provided instances where PTI supporters intending to stage protests were restrained by security forces, demonstrating the party\u2019s commitment to maintaining law and order.\n\u201cWe need unity and support of all for the rights of the province,\u201d he said, adding that he would go to any lengths to secure the rights of the K-P province from the Centre.\nRead:\u00a0Gandapur to convene parliamentary party soon\n\u201cSilence is not the answer.

He cited Imran Khan\u2019s affirmation that the army and police are valued allies of PTI, closely aligned with the party\u2019s objectives.\nAcknowledging past legal challenges faced by PTI, Gandapur expressed the party\u2019s readiness to move forward, emphasizing a proactive approach to implementing significant governmental reforms aimed at improving public service delivery. He reiterated PTI\u2019s departure from retaliatory politics.\nGandapur outlined a comprehensive plan to reinstate the Insaf Sehat Card province-wide upon assuming office.\n"

        },
        "Details": {
            "Text": "In a significant move, the Punjab Healthcare Commission (PHC) has issued a plethora of notices to all private healthcare centres, hospitals and laboratories across Rawalpindi City and Cantonment, directing them to adopt the mandatory health indicators developed under the guidelines issued by the World Health Organisation (WHO).\nAccording to sources, failure to comply with the directives laid down in the notices, which emphasise the need for adherence to quality standards, will result in a ban on operations for the non-compliant entities.\nThey said patients availing services from private healthcare providers or undergoing tests at laboratories reserve the right to lodge formal complaints with the PHC if dissatisfied with the service quality.\nUpon successful registration, the second phase entails the issuance of formal licenses to healthcare facilities meeting the specified health indicators. All private healthcare establishments under the jurisdiction of the PHC must ensure the delivery of quality services and adhere to approved pricing schedules. Similarly, private pathology laboratories are obligated to conduct standardised tests.\nEarlier, the commission granted licenses to three government hospitals in Rawalpindi, namely Benazir Bhutto General Hospital, Holy Family Hospital, and District Headquarters Hospital, after fulfilling treatment-related health indicators. Notably, these hospitals incurred fines of Rs120,000 per establishment for non-compliance dating back to 2012.\nIn a bid to uphold public health standards, the Healthcare Commission has initiated crackdowns targeting counterfeit medical practitioners and unregistered healthcare facilities. Treatment provisions under Sehat Sahulat Cards have been revoked for unlicensed public or private hospitals. \nThe PHC\u2019s health indicators, introduced in 2012, encompass various aspects of healthcare delivery, ensuring patient-centric services in government hospitals.\nFurthermore, the PHC is actively combating the proliferation of vendors promoting false cures for diseases on streets and sidewalks. Citizens can report complaints against unlicensed practitioners through the prime minister and Punjab chief minister portal. Notably, substantial fines have been imposed on numerous private hospitals and laboratories for failure to register with the PHC.\nIn cases of patient harm due to medical negligence, the PHC ensures judicial proceedings against responsible medical personnel, including imprisonment and fines. Similar punitive measures are enforced against private laboratories operating without registration.\nBefore registration, the PHC conducts thorough inspections of public and non-government hospitals, medical centres, laboratories, and traditional medicine practitioners. Facilities failing to meet the designated health indicators are subject to significant penalties. However, upon rectifying deficiencies and fulfilling all requirements, healthcare facilities receive licensure from the PHC.\n"

He announced the party would kickstart nationwide protests against alleged electoral manipulation by \"anti-Islamic forces.\"\n\nDuring a press conference, Fazl expressed reservations about the Election Commission of Pakistan's (ECP) role, alleging it had been \u201cdubious from day one.\u201d\n\n\"Our central committee has rejected the election results and expressed reservations about the role of the ECP, but JUI-F will play its role in the parliament and will attend it with reservations,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe accused the election process of being manipulated at the behest of \u201canti-Islamic forces\u201d and emphasized the party's commitment to maintaining strong relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Shopkeepers in the central markets say their 80% of investment has sunk as they failed to sell items of the snowy season.\nFor almost a century, Murree has been the centre of the British government and sometimes the Hindu regime of the subcontinent. Tourist families from the Middle East and Afghanistan used to come at the hill station every year during the snow season. Families of embassies\u2019 officials in Islamabad also would visit Murree.\nThe average snowfall in Murree was up to 3.25 feet between 1900 and 1970, but later it began to decrease. Now the snowfall has been reduced from 2 to 2.25 feet in the last 30 years. Intermittent snowfall would melt half of it, while the remaining used to persist in the adjacent hills till March.\n\nRead\u00a0Murree prepares for snowy tourist season\nTraditionally, the snowfall season in Malika Kohsar Murree used to start in late November or first decade of December, and the recreational season last from December 20 to January 10. Snowfall emergency usually occurs from Dec 20 to Feb 15. However, December 2023 remained snow-free and families from across Pakistan didn\u2019t turn up at Murree on long winter vacations.\nThis winter, the snow fell in late January and attracted only 20% of the tourists. The Feb 8 elections also negatively impacted the snow activities. At present there is no snow in Murree.\nThis time, the snowfall season in Murree lasted only for 15 days contrary to average 50 days in the past. The number of tourists this year was less also because of the 2021 snow tsunami in the renowned hill station.\n\u00a0\n"

WADA Mitsuhiro, together with the other distinguished guests inaugurated the exhibition at the National Art Gallery to provide an opportunity to the visitors to witness the evolution of yakishime from its ancient roots to contemporary expressions.\nThe show focuses on a traditional Japanese ceramics technique yakishime (firing unglazed wares at extremely high temperatures) and introduces its history and evolution that has developed in distinctive directions in Japan from 4th and 5th centuries through present day. It features over 80 exquisite pieces from the earliest examples to the present through yakishime wares, tea vessels, food vessels, jars, containers and more that have become an essential part of everyday life in Japan.\n\nRead\u00a0PNCA hosts 35th National Exhibition of Paintings\nThe exhibition also presents a wide range of non-utilitarian objects created by the contemporary ceramic artists working in yakishime styles aiming to provide an opportunity to communicate this distinctively Japanese sensibility and aesthetic to the people abroad.\nH.E. Ambassador WADA, while speaking at the inaugural ceremony, expressed his deep admiration for this time-honored traditional Japanese art of producing ceramic art and crafts. \u201cOne of the unique characteristics of Japanese culture is the fusion and coexistence of tradition and innovation. We are good at adding new interpretation to tradition, while respecting old methods and tastes,\u201d he said.\nAmbassador WADA pointed out that Pakistan is also known as a production center of traditional potteries with Blue Pottery from Multan which has common attractions with Yakishime. \u201cI feel a sense of warmth and simplicity from both of them.\u201d\nThe ambassador said both Japan and Pakistan have rich and diverse cultural heritage and the cultural linkages between the two friendly nations, and it can be traced back in history such as the Gandhara civilisation. \u201cIn terms of the fusion of tradition and innovation, I am looking forward to see the new phase of Pakistan\u2019s traditional arts in next generation as well.\u201d\n\u00a0\n"

            "Text": "The Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) and the Pakistan Tea Association (PTA) have demanded that the government put an end to the misuse of tax exemptions and address other anomalies in tea imports.\nKCCI, Senior Vice President, Altaf A Ghaffar urged the Federal Board of Revenue, in a statement released on Thursday, to take notice of the widespread misuse of tax exemptions in Azad Kashmir and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas/Provincially Administered Tribal Areas. This misuse has led to a substantial loss of revenue and is pushing commercial importers of black tea, a major revenue source, out of business, he said.\nGhaffar highlighted that commercial imports of black tea face exorbitant taxes and duties totalling 53%, while importers from Azad Kashmir and FATA/PATA regions pay only 15% to 19%. This imbalance has resulted in about 75% of black tea imports being diverted to exempted areas, far exceeding their actual consumption. Most of this tea is sold throughout Pakistan, depriving the FBR of significant revenue.\nHe also noted that importers of black tea pay taxes and duties of Rs6.21 million per container, whereas those in Azad Kashmir and FATA/PATA pay Rs1.65 million. This significant disparity unfairly burdens non-exempt importers across Pakistan, resulting in additional costs of Rs4.56 million extra per 20-foot container of black tea. Ghaffar stressed that legitimate importers of black tea have seen a sharp decline in business over the past few years due to these practices.\n\nRead\u00a0KCCI decries 191% surge in gas tariffs\nHe added that black tea, imported by Azad Kashmir and FATA/PATA regions with tax exemptions, was intended solely for sale within these areas. However, it\u2019s being widely distributed nationwide, severely impacting the revenue of black tea importers, who generate Rs3.5 billion annually.\nIn addressing the issues faced by tea importers, KCCI\u2019s Senior VP demanded that the tax exemptions granted be discontinued by the end of the current fiscal year, with no further extensions granted after June 2024. This move would provide a level playing field, he said.\nSpeaking to The Express Tribune, Khalil Paracha, Senior Vice Chairman of the Pakistan Tea Association (PTA), stressed the need to halt the misuse of exempted duties and eliminate the Maximum Retail Price (MRP) duty imposed on tea imports. Paracha highlighted the anomaly of charging MRP duty at the finished product stage, while tea is imported in bulk. He expressed concerns on behalf of the entire industry, including importers, traders, and packers, calling for the removal of the MRP duty at all relevant forums, including the ministry, federation, and association.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 16th, 2024.\n"

This included vertical growth by increasing per-acre yield of crops and horizontal growth by bringing more area under cultivation through corporate farming.\n\u201cPakistan has the potential to plant crops over 22 million acres by combining both vertical and horizontal approaches,\u201d he said.\nAt present, the per-acre yield in the country is far less than the global average due to limited access to modern machinery and digital support services for farmers.\n\u201cIn this regard, artificial intelligence (AI) can revolutionise and revitalise the agriculture sector, especially horticulture, while addressing the challenges of climate change, adapting to crop patterns and attracting talent,\u201d he added.\n\nRead\u00a0Alvi calls for agricultural tech to combat climate change\nFederation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry\u2019s (FPCCI) agricultural committee chief underscored the urgency of embracing AI as the most significant step in the agriculture sector, which should also feature in the Green Pakistan Initiative.\n\u201cOur policymakers often spend excessive time in meetings, discussions and visualisations, which delays the adoption of pragmatic approaches.\u201d\nJawad pointed out that both developed and developing countries were moving towards digital revolution, recognising data as today\u2019s equivalent of gold.\n\u201cAI can help analyse historical data, weather trends and storage conditions to predict optimal harvest times and storage duration for crops.\u201d\nThe FPCCI believes that instead of viewing the agriculture sector as simply a provider of food for the poor, Pakistan must see it as an engine of economic growth for the next few decades. \u201cBut this can only be achieved if we are able to shun some of the most common and ill-advised perceptions about the sector,\u201d he added.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 16th, 2024.\n"

[PML-N President] Shehbaz Sharif completed his term as the prime minister earlier, but this time around things are different,\u201d he said.\n\nTalking with reference to the seats that the party lost, he questioned whether the party\u2019s loss in the elections was organic or someone deliberately engineered a hung parliament to steal their mandate.\n\n\"We couldn't take a definitive position on this now, particularly after the party decided to pursue forming a government.\" He said the party needed to introspect if it even wanted to form a government.\n\nHe said as the dust of the elections settles, the fate of the incoming government will be more visible, but as of now, it appeared that the PML-N will not be able to complete its term.\n\nThe PML-N is the only party that came out in support of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and accepted the election outcome, while all the while raising questions of its own about the elections process in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), where the PTI won a landslide victory.\n\nWhen asked if the party will reconsider its position on the polls at some stage, the leader said if the JUI-F chief continued his charge against these elections, then the PML-N will also have to modify its position.\n\nMaulana Fazlur Rehman on Wednesday rejected the Feb 8 election results while announcing a country-wide protest movement against alleged rigging.\n\nWhen asked if Nawaz Sharif's decision not to become prime minister for the fourth time was solely motivated by the election outcomes, he said there were various external factors taken into account before making such a decision.\nHe accepted that Nawaz's decision disappointed many within the party for different reasons.\n\nAs far as the public reaction was concerned, the PML-N\u2019s entire election campaign was based on Nawaz becoming the premier, so when he decided to nominate Shehbaz for the position, people felt betrayed and sad, he said.\n\nWhen asked if people within the PML-N felt there were internal factors or a conspiracy against Nawaz Sharif that influenced his decision, he gave a cryptic reply, stating that \"they have indeed betrayed Nawaz Sharif.\"\n\n"

            "Text": "As the uproar from various political parties over allegations of election rigging takes over the political landscape, the Supreme Court is set to address a constitutional petition filed by a former military officer on February 19 (Monday).\nIn the petition, Brig (retd) Ali Khan seeks a declaration that the February 8 elections were rigged, urging for a fresh round of general elections.\nHe has lodged a three-page constitution petition under Article 184 (3) of the constitution, which is currently awaiting formal numbering. The Supreme Court Registrar's office, however, has raised objections regarding the petition's maintainability.\nPursuant to the Supreme Court Practice and Procedure Act of 2023, every constitutional petition undergoes review by a three-judge committee to determine the case's fixation and the composition of the bench.\nTypically, a SC judge hears appeals in chambers against objections raised by the Registrar's office on the maintainability of a petition.\nHowever, this particular case has been scheduled for an open court hearing, where the three-judge bench, led by Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa and comprising Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar and Justice Musarrat Hilali, will decide whether to assign a number to the petition or not.\nInterestingly, the same bench declared on January 13 that PTI's intra-party elections were illegal, leading to the party losing its election symbol. Despite these setbacks and complaints of an uneven playing field, PTI managed to surprise its opponents by securing a majority of seats in the National Assembly.\nMeanwhile, several PTI candidates continue to voice grievances, asserting that their election victories, initially confirmed by Form 45 issued by presiding officers, were later altered through the issuance of Form 47 by Returning Officers (ROs).\nThe Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) is currently examining these cases.\nIt is pertinent to note that a perceived harmonious relationship prevails among state institutions, including the executive, the ECP, and the judiciary, under CJP Qazi Faez Isa.\nRead PTI leaders share election \u2018irregularities\u2019 with president\nThese institutions also enjoy support from esteemed legal bodies like the Pakistan Bar Council and the Supreme Court Bar Association.\nAgainst this backdrop, the scheduling of the constitutional petition holds considerable importance. The bench may scrutinise the petitioner's legal standing, questioning the locus standi.\nDespite considering itself the primary victim of purported election rigging, the PTI has not sought redressal from the Supreme Court thus far\nSenior lawyers opine that the judges must exercise additional caution during the hearing, as any remarks made could potentially bias the cases of PTI candidates currently under consideration in the ECP.\nThe ongoing discussion also revolves around the potential repercussions if the bench dismisses the petition on election rigging.\nEvery remark from the bench is anticipated to carry significance during the hearing. There is an expectation that the apex court will refrain from taking any action that might validate the entire election process.\nAccording to Article 225 of the Constitution, election disputes can exclusively be addressed by tribunals. However, this process is time-consuming. Furthermore, with the current accusation of widespread rigging, the tribunals will only address individual cases.\nThe crucial factor determining the legacy of the current CJP, Qazi Faez Isa, lies in the conduct of free and fair elections. While he played a role in ensuring the elections, questions have arisen regarding the fairness of the process.\nThe superior judiciary has been on trial since the Panama case, with lingering doubts about political leaders receiving convictions during periods of strained relationships with powerful circles.\nThis pattern was evident in the Panama case, where the Sharif family faced legal challenges since 2017.\n"

            "Text": "Following the latest round of inter-party discussions between the PML-N and PPP, it has become evident that the latter is not inclined towards participating in the forthcoming federal cabinet.\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding PPP's involvement emerged after Asif Ali Zardari, co-chairperson of PPP, hinted at the formation of a government by all parties, merely hours after his son and party chairman, Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, rejected any ministerial roles but expressed a desire for the presidency for his father.\n\nAlthough PPP delegates continue to endorse Bilawal's position, they have confirmed the party's lack of enthusiasm for cabinet positions. While talks initially revolved around key constitutional offices such as the presidency, Senate chairpersonship, and National Assembly speaker, they have since expanded to address broader, high-stakes issues.\n\nHowever, specifics of these discussions remain confidential, as all participants have pledged not to disclose core matters deliberated during the meetings.\n\nIn line with this stance, a PPP leader, speaking on condition of anonymity, reaffirmed the party\u2019s disinterest in joining the cabinet, emphasizing that it is not even on the current agenda.\n\nDespite this clarity, official statements issued after the meetings appear somewhat misleading, as they emphasize discussions on national issues such as inflation, unemployment, and poverty reduction, along with the formation of a stable government to address the country's challenges.\n\nRegarding these statements, the PPP leader wryly remarked that the media should expect such releases to continue.\nAfter the first round of talks, a statement read that both the parties had agreed that there was a need for a stable democratic government to deal with the challenges of economy, politics, security and terrorism.\n\nFollowing the meeting on Thursday, an official statement from PPP read that Bilawal was briefed by the members of the party\u2019s contact and coordination committee about the multilateral consultations among the political parties at Zardari House in Islamabad.\n\nThe members of the body included Qamar Zaman Kaira, Syed Murad Ali Shah, Nawab Sanaullah Zehri, Shuja Khan, Saeed Ghani, Nadeem Afzal Chan, and Bahadur Khan Sehar.\nEarlier, the PPP committee had contacted the PML-N and a consultative meeting was then held between the bodies of the two parties.\n\n\u201cProposals were discussed regarding inflation, unemployment and relief from poverty in the country,\u201d read the statement.\nThe representatives of the PML-N from other provinces also participated in the second round of talks. Both sides said the matters would also be put forth before other like-minded political parties after which they would be finalised.\nJust a week after the general elections, the much-desired political stability still seems to be a distant dream because of the split mandate.\n\nAmid allegations that the polls were rigged, different political parties are busy contemplating what strategy should they adopt to move ahead.\n\nOn the one hand, the PML-N is striving to form the government in the Centre and Punjab with the support of the PPP, MQM-P and other smaller parties. On the other, the PTI, which contested the polls with independent candidates and bagged more seats than the PML-N, is busy persuading JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman to launch a protest campaign against alleged polls rigging.\n\nAnother twist came on Tuesday when both the contenders for the premier\u2019s position -- PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif and Bilawal -- opted out of the race.\n\nThe PML-N then nominated for the slot its president and Nawaz\u2019s younger brother Shehbaz Sharif, who is busy persuading his previous allies to help him become the premier again.\n\n"

            "Text": "PTI founding chairman Imran Khan and the party\u2019s vice chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi on Friday challenged their respective sentences in the Toshakhana (gift repository) and cipher cases.\nImran, a former premier, and his wife Bushra Bibi\u2019s lead lawyer, Barrister Syed Ali Zafar, filed two appeals, writ petitions, and applications before the Islamabad High Court, challenging the orders passed by an accountability court in the Toshakhana reference filed by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) and the special judge adjudicating matters related to Official Secrets Act in the cipher case.\nImran and his wife were sentenced to 14 years in jail in the Toshakhana reference. The special court awarded the former premier and Qureshi 10 years\u2019 imprisonment in the cipher case during their jail trial.\nBarrister Zafar contended that the ex-premier and his wife had been erroneously convicted and sentenced by the accountability court.\nThe PTI founding chairman\u2019s appeal in the Toshakhana reference read that the available evidence on record fails to establish any connection between the appellant and the alleged violation of Section 9 of the NAO 1999.\nIt continued that the judgment had been passed without a fair trial and due process. \u201cBeing in violation of Article 10A, the [verdict] was null and void and liable to be set aside,\u201d it read.\nIt contended that the court had throughout the proceedings acted in undue haste as if the case had to be decided before the date of general elections to be held on February 8 this year.\nRead Imran, wife indicted in Toshakhana case\nIt further read that the court illegally did not allow the appellant and his lawyers to cross-examine the prosecution witnesses.\n\u201cIt is well-established that cases under the Ordinance necessitate the prosecution to substantiate allegations before drawing presumptions or inferences against the accused. In the present case, there is an absence of evidence indicating appropriation or misappropriation of any property with a dishonest and fraudulent intent to gain wrongfully. Without such proof, no offense under Section 9(a)(iii) can be deemed to have been established. The appellant, in compliance with all codal formalities, received the gifts from Toshakhana in accordance with the law.\u201d\nIn the other appeal filed in connection with the cipher case, it read that the appellant had been erroneously convicted by the special court.\nIt contended that his conviction and sentence required immediate setting aside as they resulted from misreading and non-reading of evidence and a blatant disregard of his fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution along with \u201cserious departure\u201d from the settled principles and procedure as provided under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 and Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958.\nIt added that the Supreme Court had underscored the importance of the right of an accused to engage the services of counsel of his own choice to prepare a sound defence. However, it continued that the trial court \u201ccondemned a hasty approach of appointing counsel mid-trial and requiring them to argue immediately, particularly in a case involving capital punishment.\u201d\n\u201cThe Official Secrets Act, 1923 does not stipulate any provisions outlining a timeline for the conclusion of trials. However, the learned trial court has misinterpreted the law for reasons known only to the court and has rushed through the trial, depriving the appellant of a fair criminal trial,\u201d it read.\nIn related development, Qureshi also filed an appeal in the IHC against his conviction in the cipher case.\nThe petitioner, in the plea filed through Ali Bokhari Advocate, Barrister Taimoor Malik and Salman Safdar Advocate, pleaded before the IHC that his 10-year jail sentence handed down by the special court on January 30 this year should be terminated.\nHe also asked the court to suspend his sentence till the final verdict in the appeal.\n"

Lt Gen (retd) Faiz was posted as the Peshawar corps commander when the PTI government was removed from power.\nAfter a PML-N leader pointed out this mistake at a news conference earlier in the day, the JUI-F chief swiftly acknowledged his \u201cerror\u201d but maintained his stance on Gen (retd) Bajwa and Lt Gen (retd) Faiz\u2019s alleged involvement in rigging the 2018 elections.\nIn another interview with a private TV news channel, Fazl insisted that this matter should be consigned to history instead of being discussed more.\nHe said he had disclosed everything and that was enough.\n\u201cWe wanted to remove the PTI government through a no-confidence motion.

However, he added that PTI would persist in its political endeavours, aiming to collaborate with other like-minded parties who share their stance on the unfairness of the electoral process.\n\nIn the worst case scenario, if the party was not allowed to form the government at the Centre, Gohar added, the PTI would prefer to sit on the opposition benches rather than sharing power either with the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) or the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP).\n\n\u201cWe were offered to share power with the PML-N and the PPP but we refused to accept the offers as per the principled stance of Imran Khan. The nation has given a clear mandate to Tehreek-e-Insaf for forming government in the country. Our mandate is being snatched by manipulating election results.\u201d\n\nBarrister Gohar stressed that the PTI would persevere until decisions on its pending election-related appeals in courts.\u00a0 He appealed to the courts to promptly make decisions on more than 70 petitions related to manipulation in the results of the February 8 elections.\n\nBarrister Gohar complained that the party, which he claimed had bagged more than two-thirds majority at the centre, Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) was being marginalised, saying that attempts were being made to steal PTI\u2019s mandate and give to those who could not even secure 20 seats.\n\nHe announced that the PTI, as per Imran Khan\u2019s decision, would start nationwide protest demonstrations on Saturday (tomorrow) against the \u201cblatant rigging\u201d in the last week\u2019s general election in the country.\n\nHe asked all political parties \u2013 Jamaat-e-Islam (JI), Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan (TLP), Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA), Awami National Party (ANP) and others, who believed that their mandate had been stolen \u2013 to join the protest movement for democracy, rule of law and real freedom in the country.\n\nHe appealed to the masses to come out in large numbers to register their protest against vote tampering. \u201cThe elections were the most difficult polls in the country\u2019s history in which the Pakistani nation has given a clear mandate to Tehreek-e-Insaf against all odds,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, Senior PTI leader Sher Afzal Marwat disclosed that the party had considered long march plans but Imran Khan decided that the people had to come out to protect their mandate. Imran had asked the nation to come out in large numbers on Saturday (tomorrow), he added.\n\n\u201cThey [the government] will try to harass you. They may try to stage a false-flag operation like May 9. They may attack you through police and law-enforcement agencies. But you should keep in mind that it is for the future of Pakistan,\u201d Marwat said.\n\n\u201cIf you fail to show up in big numbers such attempts to steal public mandate will continue in future elections,\u201d he warned. He added that Khan had already said that efforts were afoot to impose a money-laundering syndicate in Pakistan, but this plan was bound to fail.\n\nCiting Imran, Marwat stressed that only remittances from overseas Pakistanis could bring the country out of the current economic quagmire. He added that Imran Khan had underscored that financial stability would be impossible without political stability in the country.\n\nMarwat announced that the party would give a detailed presentation to the national and international media about the manipulation of the February 8 election results on Friday (today). \u201cIt will show Form 45 of all 80 constituencies in which election results were tempered with.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, PTI leader and former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser termed the elections as the worst in Pakistan\u2019s history and stressed the need for concerted action against electoral malpractice. He said that the PTI would reach out to other parties to launch a country-wide protest movement.\n\n"

            "Text": "The government on Thursday increased gas tariff for residential users by up to 67% and up to 700% hike for fertiliser plants, while jacked up the prices of petroleum products by up to Rs8.37 per liter from Friday (today), in a move aimed at addressing the economic dynamics and ensuring stability in the energy sector.\n\nThe federal cabinet, in a meeting chaired by caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar, approved the gas price hike to recover additional Rs242 billion from all the consumers, in attempts to bring some equity in the rates of the fast depleting natural asset.\n\nImmediately after the cabinet meeting, the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) issued notification of the new gas prices, in accordance with the International Monetary Fund\u2019s (IMF) condition of raising the prices by Thursday, February 15.\nJust before Thursday midnight, Finance Division notified that the price of MS (petrol) had been increased by Rs2.73 per litre, from Rs272.89 to Rs275.62. Similarly, the price of high speed diesel (HSD) was increased by Rs8.37 per litre, from Rs278.96 per liter to Rs287.33.\n\nThe Finance Division said that the decision came in line with the recommendations of Ogra. It added that the adjustment aimed at addressing the current economic dynamics and ensuring the stability of the energy sector in the country.\nIt was the second time in the past three months that the gas tariff has been increased. The Ogra notification, showed that the hike would take effect from the February 1, and the new bills would be issued with revised rates. The decision puts an unreasonable burden on a class of residential consumers using more than 2 cubic hectometers (Hm3) gas for creating fiscal space to pay subsidies to other domestic consumers.\n\nThe cabinet also finally took the much-delayed but needed decision to withdraw the Rs50 billion subsidies to a few fertilisers plants, which were earlier given preferential treatment by robbing the industrial consumers.\n\nCaretaker Finance Minister Dr Shamshad Akhtar played a pivotal role in the withdrawal of the fertiliser plants\u2019 subsidy, although the energy minister was in favour of continuing these subsidies. The fertiliser plants were availing these subsidies without passing on the benefit to the farmers.\n\nThe Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet held two rounds to approve these prices and finally took the decision on Wednesday. The federal cabinet ratified the ECC decision of February 14th, reads a statement issued by the Prime Minister\u2019s Office after the cabinet meeting.\n\nIt is the third increase in the prices that the consumer would bear amid double-digit inflation. The increase has thrown an additional burden of Rs242 billion on the consumers, including Rs37 billion that the government would earn in sales tax.\nIt was also the second revision in the gas prices by the caretaker government in the past three months after it earlier increased the prices up to 1108% \u2013 the highest for the most vulnerable households.\n\nResidential consumers\n\nThe fresh revision also puts maximum burden on the most vulnerable households with a 67% or Rs100 increase per unit for the domestic monthly consumption of 0.5 cubic hectometers (Hm3). For other protected domestic consumers, the increase is in the range of Rs200 to Rs250 \u2013 also ranging from 25% to 67%.\n\nThe prices for non-protected residential consumers are either now close to the prescribed price of Rs1,597 per mmbtu or even higher than the prices of imported re-gasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG). The rates for 1.5 Hm3 consumers have been increased to Rs1,450 \u2013 higher by 21%.\n\nThe new prices for the 2 Hm3 monthly consumption consumers are Rs1,900 \u2013 up by 19% - and Rs300 more than the cost of gas they need to pay. Similarly for the next slab of 3 Hms consumption, the new rate is Rs3,300 \u2013 close to the imported gas rate of Rs3,750.\n\nThe two highest residential slabs are charged rates that are even higher than the imported gas prices \u2013Rs3,800 and Rs4,300. They are now forced to pay for the subsidies of other domestic consumers, which is unjustifiable.\n\nEarlier this month, OGRA issued a determination of revised estimated revenue requirements (RERR) for FY 2023-24 for both the SNGPL and the SSGCL. According to the revised determination, the SNGPL requires a revenue of Rs592 billion and the SSGCL requires a revenue of Rs310 billion this fiscal year, the total revenue requirement has been determined at Rs902 billion, arriving at an average prescribed price of Rs1,596 per mmbtu.\n\nThe residential consumers of housing societies that buy gas in bulk will face a 45% increase in their prices. Their new rate is Rs2,900 \u2013 up by Rs900 compared to current rates that too are just three months old.\n\nThe fresh increase in prices is expected to further fuel the inflation that remains far higher than the goal set by the central bank. The inflation rate in January remained at 28.4% as against the annual target of 21%.\n\nIndustrial Consumers\n\nThe cabinet approved further increase in the gas prices for the in-house power generation of the industries for both the export and non-export sectors. Going forward, the cabinet has ended the distinction of the export and non-export and a new uniformed rate for in-house gas plants has been set.\n\nThe cabinet approved increase in the captive plants rates from Rs2,200 to 2,750 for exporters and from Rs2,500 to 2,750 for local production \u2013 an increase, ranging from 10% to 25%. The Petroleum Division had proposed Rs2,950 per mmbtu rate, which was opposed by the industry minister.\n\nThe Pakistan Textile Exporters Association (PTEA) Pattern-in-Chief Khurram Mukhtar emphasised the need for negotiating sustainable energy tariffs with the IMF and rationalising cross subsidies on industrial energy tariffs to support growth.\n\n\u201cJust raising energy tariffs is not going to work; strict enforcement requires reducing T&D losses and full bills recovery,\u201d said Mukhtar. \u201cCurrent hike in gas and electricity tariffs is disastrous for the economy and lacks any wisdom,\u201d he added.\n\nFertiliser plants\n\nThe caretaker cabinet has taken some corrective measures to stop the misuse of subsidy by the fertiliser plants. These plants were availing subsidised gas but were still selling expensive urea to the farmers.\n\nThe cabinet approved increase in the feed gas prices for Engro Fertiliser from Rs200 to Rs1,597 per mmbtu \u2013a surge of 700% that ends Rs39 billion subsidies. The effective date for revised gas tariff for Engro Fertiliser is 1st March, 2024.\nIt also approved increase in gas prices for Fauji Fertiliser Bin Qasim Limited (FFBQL) from Rs580 to Rs1,597 mmbtu, showing an increase of 175% and ending its Rs10 billion subsidy.\n\nAgritech and Fatima Fertiliser are currently getting RLNG from SNGPL network. The cabinet approved increasing their prices by 29% to Rs1,597 per mmbtu, which is the average prescribed price in case these plants are offered system gas on SNGPL.\n\nThe government still has to increase the gas prices for those fertiliser plants, which are availing the gas from the Mari Gas network.\n\n"

            "Text": "The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) on Friday dialled up its attacks against tampering with its purported mandate, alleging that a whopping 85 National Assembly seats, which it had secured in the Feb 8 polls, were surreptitiously \"snatched away\".\nThe party deemed the alleged electoral manipulation as the \"largest assault on democracy\" in the nation's political history while accusing the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) of orchestrating a nefarious conspiracy to strip the newly elected PTI MNAs of their public mandate on \"ridiculous technical grounds\".\nIn its declaration after the important meeting of the core meeting, the PTI pointed out that even other major political parties, not just the PTI, were vocalising concerns about the chief election commissioner and the ECP\u2019s alleged criminal role.\nIt alleged that with the blessings of the ECP, blatant disregard for the people's mandate, Constitution, and democracy took place.\nThe party also announced plans for \"peaceful protests\" across the nation, slamming the door on rumours of cozying up with the PPP in the big leagues and the PTI-P in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa to form a coalition government.\nAddressing reporters following a meeting with Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) leaders in Islamabad, PTI leader Asad Qaiser extended an invitation to other political parties who believe there was \"rigging\" in the elections to join the protest.\nQaiser emphasised, \"The meeting had a singular focus: the nation's mandate was pilfered in the 2024 elections,\" underscoring the collective agreement to raise a unified voice against the \"bold rigging.\"\nThe PTI's core committee has urged the public to step out of their homes in response.\nIn the post-executive committee meeting declaration, the PTI asserted that the people would not tolerate the \"insult of their mandate by the ECP\", vowing not to forgive those who were involved in undermining the Constitution and democracy.\nSalman Akram Raja @salmanAraja speaks at #PTIPressConference regarding the massive robbery in GE2024 in his constituency.\n\nClearly PDM = #MandateThieves pic.twitter.com/K8oy0OTvkU\nPTI 'won 179 seats'\nSeparately, the party, addressing the media in Islamabad, claimed that the total number of seats on which PTI-backed independents emerged victorious was 179, and the number of rejected votes cast in favour of the party outnumbered victory votes cast in favour.\nPTI Information Secretary Raoof Hasan, Sher Afzal Marwat, Rehana Dar and Salman Akram Raja among other leaders, who challenged their election results before various forums, were present at the news conference.\nElaborating on the claims further, Hasan said that the party possesses data for 46 seats, while the data for the remaining seats would be completed within the next 24 hours.\nPTI leader Shandana Gulzar said that the party bagged 1.25 million votes from Karachi, and despite contesting from so many constituencies of the port city, the party did not achieve any success.\n\"Till 3pm, we had 154 NA seats. In K-P, we had 42 seats but the Election Commission gave us only 32.\"\nShe added that the PTI's polling agents were expelled from the polling stations, and as \"night fell, the results were changed\".\nSeemabia Tahir said that PTI's Dr Yasmin Rashid was winning from NA-130, but on Feb 9, Nawaz Sharif was declared the winner from the constituency.\n\"The results of NA-47 were also rigged against Shoaib Shaheen,\u201d she said. \u201cThe PTI achieved a significant lead in NA-56 Rawalpindi, but PML-N's Hanif Abbasi stole our mandate as night fell.\n\"In a similar manner, NA-236 was also targeted for rigging. We won all the seats from Karachi but we were not declared victorious on even one.\"\nParty leader and senior lawyer Salman Akram Raja claimed that rigging took place \"from the polling station to the RO's office\".\n\"The results which should have been announced based on Form 45 were completely changed. They rigged the elections on the night of Feb 8 as much as was possible,\" Raja said. \"Before the polls, security forces were used fully and independent candidates were denied the right to campaign for elections.\"\nThe senior lawyer said, \"These elections are an open attack on democracy.\"\nEarlier, PTI founding chairman and former premier Imran Khan demanded that the US should adopt a tough stance on \u201crigging\u201d the recent general elections.\nAfter meeting Imran at the Adiala Jail, PTI leader Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif, accompanied by former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser, told the media that the former premier had pushed the US to take a tougher stance on the recent general polls.\n"

Still, he added, the alliance did not boycott the elections because they wanted to expose the massive \u201crigging\u201d.\nPir Pagara asked the power that be, who take decisions for the country, to acknowledge a concerning fact that a national party or leader was no longer available at present. \u201cNo political party or leader now exists at the national level, all are confined to their respective provinces,\u201d he observed.\n\u201cNow who is left to look after the Federation except the army?\u201d he posed a question. \u201cThe army is our own.

Friends kept asking me to hold public rallies and meetings, but I refused,\u201d he said. \u201cA large public meeting costs Rs100 million. Spending such a huge amount after knowing the outcome would have been wasteful.\u201d\nPir Pagara blamed the ECP for singling out the PTI on the basis of its intra-party elections.

GDA General Secretary Safdar Abbassi announced that their next sit-in demonstration would be held on February 20 in Moro, Naushehroferoze district.\nIn the speech, Pir Pagara\u2019s younger brother, Pir Sadaruddin Shah Rashdi, urged the Supreme Court to take suo moto notice of the \u201celection fraud\u201d, reminding the apex court that the polling on February 8 happened on its order.\nAnother GDA leader Ghulam Murtaza Jatoi demanded that the returning officers (ROs) and the district returning officers (DROs) should be booked for treason under Article 6 of the Constitution because their \u201crobbery of the people\u2019s mandate\u201d amounted to conspiracy against the country.\n"

            "Text": "With the long overdue election results now almost entirely in, it is clear that the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) and Pakistan People\u2019s Party (PPP) bagged big win in Sindh\u2019s provincial capital but the challenges that await both parties are the same as they always have been.\nKarachi seems to be engulfed in a myriad of crises relating to infrastructure, sewage, drinking water, and transportation; and both the MQM and PPP, which have been in power in the city for a significant amount of time, know so.\nHowever, it remains to be seen whether this time around the two political parties will actually be able to address the port city\u2019s issues. Qazi Sadruddin, an active social worker from the city, does not think that both parties have the capacity to help the metropolis. \u201cThe PPP and MQM have been in power for many years but they have not paid any attention to solving the problems of the city. I doubt if this time will be any different but one can certainly hope,\u201d said Sadruddin.\nYounis, a 55-year-old resident of the city, agrees. \u201cI have seen multiple governments come and go but Karachi\u2019s problems have only exacerbated.\u201d\nYounis\u2019s simple assessment carries weight in Dr Noman Ahmed\u2019s view, who while talking to The Express Tribune, said that the city\u2019s sewage was poor, water lines were faulty, road network was broken, and public transportation was miniscule in number. \u201cThose in power, both past and present, have never paid any attention to solving these problems. For instance, the city\u2019s sewage is so broken that even the slightest bit of rain can result in flooding. One can only hope that those who have come into power now, own this city and work to solve its problems,\u201d remarked Dr Ahmed, who is an urban planner.\nAgreeing with Dr Ahmed, Iftikhar Sheikh, the President of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce, said that the business community of the metropolis was also worried about the city\u2019s state. Sheikh suggested that all the stakeholders of the city, including the businessmen, must be gathered on one platform so that they could pay attention to the problems of Karachi, especially the improvement of the city\u2019s infrastructure.\nHowever, to do so would require both the MQM and the PPP to get along, according to Dr Muhammad Ali, a political analyst and associate professor at the University of Karachi. \u201cSince the PPP will be in power in the centre, in the province, and also has the mandate of local governments, the onus falls on the PPP to include the MQM and other parties as well for the betterment of the city,\u201d opined Dr Ali.\n\u201cA hefty development package should be created for Karachi to solve infrastructure, education, health, and other problems in Karachi,\u201d he added.\nBe that as it may, Dr Osama Razi, leader of the Jamaat-e-Islami in Karachi, was of the view that parties which had destroyed the city could not fix it. \u201cThe PPP and MQM are responsible for the destruction of Karachi, they cannot help it now,\u201d asserted Dr Razi while talking to The Express Tribune.\n\u00a0\n"

            "Text": "The Supreme Court was informed on Tuesday that the five judges of the Lahore High Court (LHC) bench that originally awarded the death penalty to former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto should not have sat on that bench, which was formed only to award the punishment.\n\nA nine-member larger bench led by Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa heard the Zulfikar Ali Bhutto presidential reference.\n\nDuring the hearing, amicus curie, Justice (retd) Manzoor Malik, said that there was no precedence for a murder case trial in a high court.\n\nThe late Bhutto was convicted in the murder case of Muhammad Khan Kasuri by the LHC over a year after the toppling of his government by military dictator Gen Ziaul Haq. Later, Bhutto\u2019s appeal against his conviction was rejected by the Supreme Court in a 4-3 split verdict.\n\nBhutto\u2019s Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) always contended that the party founder and the country\u2019s first elected prime minister was falsely convicted and hanged.\n\nDuring the PPP government from 2008-13, the then president sent a reference to the apex court to review the case and acquit Bhutto.\n\nAt the outset of the hearing on Tuesday, Malik gave arguments on the criminal side of the case.\nHe said that then acting LHC chief justice, Maulvi Mushtaq Hussain, who headed the five-member bench, had expressed personal grudges against Bhutto and made it part of the order, but he did not leave the bench.\n\nSitting on the bench despite a personal grudge was something that was more than malice, he continued. The remaining four judges, who signed the order, should also not have sat on the bench.\nIn fact, Malik said, they sat on the bench to punish Bhutto.\n\nAccording to Malik, a crime punishable by death could not be tried in a high court.\n\nHe added that the high court had never conducted a direct trial of a murder case in India.\n\nOn that, Justice Mansoor Ali Shah said that even martial law could not be imposed there.\n\nGiving the history of Bhutto\u2019s case, Malik said that after the investigation, the case was shelved in Oct 1976 on the order of a magistrate. However, after the declaration of martial law, the investigations started again without any written order.\n\nOn Sept 11, 1977, an incomplete challan was submitted in which seven accused, including Bhutto, were nominated. Later, accused Ghulam Hussain and Masood Mahmood were pardoned and made approvers, and on Sept 18, 1977, those two names were removed from the complete challan.\n\nLater, Malik continued, the five remaining accused, including Bhutto, were tried and sentenced to death. Bhutto was charged with conspiracy to murder, although the complainant had not mentioned any conspiracy.\n\nMeanwhile, the investigation of the murder case also started, and an incomplete challan of the murder case was submitted to a magistrate's court, which sent it to the sessions court on the same day, while a request to transfer the case to the high court for trial was submitted the next day.\n\nMalik said that Maulvi Mushtaq approved the application without giving notice to the parties and sought the record of the case.\n\nCleverly, the judges who heard the petition of the complainant were not included in the trial bench because one of the judges had approved Bhutto's bail, he added.\n\nDuring the hearing, Chief Justice Isa remarked that the manner in which the case was tried seemed to be a fixed match. At one point, Justice Sardar Tariq Masood said that the execution of Bhutto was illegal, asking how four Supreme Court judges could confirm the decision of five LHC judges.\n\nDuring the hearing, Ahmad Raza Kasuri said that the Supreme Court judges who heard the Bhutto case were no longer alive and their reputation was being damaged by the ongoing proceedings. He said that notice should be issued to his family.\n\n"

They use the same tools that are essential to connecting and enriching our global community for their transnational criminal activities,\u201d said Schofer.\n\nHe emphasised leveraging technology to better address the nexus between finance and human trafficking and better detect online exploitation.\n\n\u201cBy sharing information and resources, we can better equip front-line stakeholders to track and respond to evolving trafficking trends. By improving investigations and prosecutions of trafficking cases, we can bring more perpetrators of these crimes to justice.

            "Text": "Caretaker Prime Minister Anwarul Haq Kakar told the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday that taking the entire state as criminal because of the missing persons issue was not correct, stressing that an armed resistance was going on in Balochistan.\n\nKakar appeared in the IHC on court orders during the hearing of a case pertaining to the missing Baloch students. The court was informed that 11 more students had been recovered, while only four had yet to be traced.\n\nDuring the hearing, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani remarked that when people went missing, the state of Pakistan was blamed. The judge added that people had reached their homes because of the efforts of the authorities. However, he also said that state institutions were not above the law.\n\nAttorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan presented a report about the recovery of missing Baloch students. He said that among the 59 missing students, 11 more had been recovered, and the authorities concerned were tracing the remaining four.\n\nAmong the 11 more recovered students, AGP Awan said that two of them were with the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Afghanistan, while nine faced cases against them and were in the custody of the Counter-terrorism Department (CTD).\n\nPrime Minister Kakar told the court that the country faced an armed struggle in Balochistan, where paramilitary forces had been deployed as counter-terrorism agencies. He also said that when the people were asked about the missing persons, they would present 5,000 names.\n\nKakar recalled that a former chief justice [of the Balochistan High Court] was martyred while offering prayers in Balochistan. \u201cPeople were burnt alive on a bus on the Coastal Highway, but no one remembered the violation of human rights at that time,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cPeople were taken out of buses and asked their names, and if someone\u2019s name was Chaudhry or Gujjar, they were killed, but still, they said that there should not be profiling of students on a linguistic basis. People have the right to live. The Constitution requires its citizens to be unconditionally loyal to the state,\u201d he added.\n\nKakar also told the court that 90,000 people were martyred in acts of terrorism, but not even 90 people were punished. Justice\n\nKayani replied that it was also a failure of the state institutions that they could not prosecute the perpetrators. He emphasised that if there was a lacuna in the law, it needed to be improved. The law should be followed,\u201d he continued. Courts have also given punishments to very hardened terrorists, and no court would protect the non-state actors.\n\nJustice Kayani told the prime minister that there was no need to go to Balochistan because a lot had been seen in the federal capital. He then pointed to a senior journalist in the courtroom, saying that he was picked up in Islamabad in broad daylight.\n\nAdvocate Iman Mazari told the court that when it came to the missing persons issue, it was linked to terrorists, which became very painful for the families of the missing persons. She said that the impression that it was a propaganda against the state was not correct.\n\nThere were reports from the commission on missing persons that institutions were involved in enforced disappearances, she told the court.\n\nThe judge said that the court would direct the questions to the committee of intelligence agencies in the future.\n\nOn that, Kakar said this was the executive\u2019s domain, adding that the government had challenged the order for the formation of the committee, comprising heads of three premier intelligence agencies.\n\n"

            "Text": "Assistant Superintendent of Police Syeda Shehrbano Naqvi visited Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Syed Asim Munir at the General Headquarters on Wednesday, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) stated.\nAs per the statement, the meeting centred on her courageous intervention in a volatile situation at Ichra Bazaar in Lahore on February 26, 2024, where she successfully rescued a woman wearing a dress with Arabic calligraphy printed on it from a mob attack in Lahore.\nIn praising ASP Shehrbano, the COAS commended her selfless devotion to duty and emphasised the importance of acknowledging the vital role played by Pakistani women in all aspects of life. \u201cSince independence, Pakistani women have distinguished themselves at home and abroad by virtue of their talent, tenacity, and commitment,\u201d he noted.\nHighlighting the significance of women in Pakistani society, the army chief remarked, \u201cAn invaluable part of Pakistan\u2019s society and their respect is enshrined in our religion as well as our social ethos.\u201d He urged for recognition of women and their invaluable contributions to the nation.\nThe COAS took the opportunity to stress the importance of social harmony and the necessity for a nationwide consensus on curbing intolerance.\nHe advocated for the rule of law and discouraged resorting to vigilantism when legal avenues exist for addressing concerns and grievances. Arbitrary actions based on hearsay undermine the societal outlook,\u201d Gen Munir stated, reinforcing Islam\u2019s eternal message of kindness and benevolence.\nExpressing gratitude for the sacrifices made by law enforcement agencies, the army chief appreciated their efforts in ensuring the safety and security of Pakistani citizens.\n\n\nASP Shehr Bano Naqvi, who saved a young woman wearing a dress with Arabic calligraphy printed on it from a mob attack in Lahore, on Monday said that the incident took place due to \u201cmere confusion\u201d and \u201cmiscommunication\u201d.\nTalking to reporters, the police official refused to reveal the woman\u2019s identity. She further stated that the calligraphy on the woman\u2019s clothes did not bear Quranic verses.\n\u201cThe word written [on the clothes] is doing the rounds on social media [\u2026] the meaning of the word is literally sincerity, love, goodness, life, humanity,\u201d she said, adding that the dress belonged to a brand based in a foreign Muslim country.\nTo another question, ASP Shehr Bano said the entire incident began when a man in the locality went up to the woman \u2014 who was in the shop along with her husband \u2014 and told her to change her clothes.\n\u201cThe woman asked why should she change and during that heated argument, considering it a religious matter, people started gathering.\n\u201cSo, the situation unfolded because of mere confusion, miscommunication, lack of verification, and playing on mob psychology,\u201d the official said.\nA potentially calamitous situation was averted in Lahore thanks to the resolute intervention of a policewoman from the Punjab Police.\nNewly-elected Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif honoured Shehr Bano, recognising her exceptional courage and astuteness.\nMaryam emphasised that the policewoman's timely intervention averted a potential tragedy, underscoring the critical importance of her actions.\nRead Bare Minimum Or Vital Move: Why ASP Shehrbano Naqvi Has Made All The Difference\nExpressing gratitude to ASP Shehr Bano, Maryam remarked, \"We take immense pride in your valour.\"\nDespite facing intense pressure and challenging circumstances, the CM-elect said that Shehr Bano upheld the principles of justice and compassion, maintaining the dignity of law and humanity.\nMeanwhile, in an interview with BBC, she recounted the intense moments outside a restaurant in Punjab's capital. \u201cHad I not screamed and had I not convinced the crowd that we will do something about it, it would have turned nastier\u2026 Thank God,\u201d Gulberg Circle ASP Shehr Bano Naqvi remarked.\nThis courageous officer found herself at the forefront of a rapidly escalating confrontation when a misunderstanding led the crowd to accuse a woman of blasphemy. The woman's dress had the word \u201cHalwa\u201d printed in Arabic letters on it, meaning \u201cbeautiful or sweet\u201d in Arabic.\nDisplaying remarkable presence of mind and bravery, Shehr Bano swiftly took charge of the situation, preventing it from spiralling into tragedy.\nHer decisive actions have garnered widespread praise, with the chief of Punjab Police Dr Usman Anwar advocating for her to be honoured with an award for her exemplary courage.\nIn the face of imminent danger, Shehr Bano's steadfastness not only safeguarded the lives of those involved but also prevented potential chaos and violence.\n\"It was a critical moment. I had to act swiftly to ensure the safety of the woman and prevent any harm from coming to her,\" Shehr Bano stated, emphasising the urgency of the situation.\nThe policewoman, along with her colleagues, managed to escort the woman to safety amidst the growing crowd.

            "Text": "Justice Ali Zia Bajwa of the Lahore High Court (LHC) has instructed the law officer to present a detailed report by March 5 regarding the status of criminal records, particularly concerning requests for the removal of names from the records of underage drivers and those acquitted in other cases.\nAs the proceedings began, the law officer sought an adjournment, citing the previous focus of the caretaker government on the matter, which has now concluded. However, Justice Bajwa referenced statements from the Deputy Inspector General (DIG) IT, who claimed that names were being excluded from criminal records.\nAdvocate Rabia Bajwa, representing the petitioners, expressed concern that police officials may not be taking the issue seriously.\nIn response, Justice Bajwa suggested that petitioners should also submit applications directly to the criminal record office.\nThe petitioners\u2019 counsels argued that innocent individuals often face false accusations, leading to their names being included in criminal records.\nDespite being acquitted, their names remain, causing significant problems, especially for student minors. They urged the court to instruct police authorities to remove their names from the records.\nThe ongoing issue has resulted in difficulties for individuals seeking opportunities abroad for work or education.\nThe court awaits the comprehensive report to address these concerns effectively.\nMeanwhile, an anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Tuesday extended judicial remand of Afnan, an underage driver involved in a car accident that resulted in the tragic death of six family members in Defence, for another 13 days.\nRead:\u00a0\u2018Curbing underage driving a shared responsibility\u2019\nEarlier, the police produced the accused before ATC Judge Arshad Javed and requested to extend his judicial remand. The police submitted that the challan (Charge-Sheet) was in final stage of the preparations and it would be filed soon after removing prosecution's objections.\nAt this, the court extended the judicial remand of the teenage driver for another 13 days and ordered for producing him on March 11. Defence C police had registered a case against Afnan which revolves around charges of recklessly crashing his high-speed car into another vehicle, resulting in the tragic loss of six lives in DHA Phase 7.\nPolice investigations indicate that Afnan had harassed the victims, following them for a considerable distance before the fatal collision.\nCrash survivor and the driver of the targeted car Hasnain and his father had noticed Afnan's \u2018inappropriate behaviour\u2019 and attempted to stop him from misbehaving and following them. The suspect had been tailing the family's car from Y block, harassing them along the way.\nHasnain informed the police that he had admonished Afnan, urging him to cease his misconduct. However, Afnan responded with verbal abuse and threats against the victims.\nThe impact caused the victims' vehicle to overturn multiple times, eventually coming to rest about 70 feet away from the accident point. \nDIG Imran Kishwar suspended Sub Inspector Murtaza and Investigations Officer Umar for negligence in the case.\nThe investigations, now including sections related to terrorism and murder, were reassigned to DSP Kahna. A video interview featuring Afnan surfaced, providing his perspective on the incident. Afnan, a grade eight student, claimed to have been driving for over a year, having learned from his cousins.\nHe recounted the night of the incident, stating that his father initially prohibited him from leaving in the car but eventually relented. \n"

        "Details": {
            "Text": "Cnergyico Pk Limited, the country\u2019s largest refiner, is eyeing more than $1 billion in investment following the introduction of a new government policy aimed at stimulating the industry.\nFollowing its investment, Cnergyico plans to enhance its production of Euro-V compliant motor gasoline and high-speed diesel, simultaneously decreasing its furnace oil output in response to its declining and unpredictable demand.\nPakistan has faced several economic challenges in recent times, including political instability, soaring inflation, a weakening currency, and declining foreign exchange reserves. These factors have eroded investor confidence, making local and foreign investors hesitant to allocate capital for major projects.\nIn a move to counteract these trends, the government recently announced the Brownfield Oil Refinery Policy. This initiative, designed to stimulate investment in existing projects, follows the earlier introduction of the Greenfield Refinery Policy, which sought to draw foreign investment into the sector.\nWhile foreign investors haven\u2019t yet committed to building new facilities, the Brownfield policy has ignited interest among the five leading domestic refiners: Cnergyico, Attock Refinery Limited (ARL), Pakistan Refinery Limited (PRL), National Refinery Limited (NRL), and Pak Arab Refinery Limited (PARCO).\nCnergyico has recently announced its plans to invest over $1 billion in the modernisation and expansion of its oil refining operations. The company\u2019s oil refining complex, capable of processing up to 156,000 barrels of crude oil daily, constitutes approximately 37% of Pakistan\u2019s total oil refining capacity. \nTalking to The Express Tribune, a Cnergyico spokesperson hailed the new policy, stating, \u201cThis will spearhead the revival of Pakistan\u2019s oil refining industry, leading to a significant increase in production of environmentally friendly fuels, reduced reliance on imported fuels, substantial foreign exchange savings, job creation, and a boost in overall business activity.\u201d\n\nRead\u00a0PRL launches $1.7b refinery upgrade project\nCnergyico is actively engaged in discussions with the government to address the delays in petroleum levy payments, a situation exacerbated by the challenging economic climate that has impacted the entire oil refining sector, alongside delays in receivables from government-controlled entities. The company\u2019s outstanding receivables from these entities currently surpass the amount owed to the government for the petroleum levy.\n\u201cWe are fully committed to resolving this matter at the earliest in accordance with the approved oil refining policy,\u201d said the spokesperson.\nIn addition to Cnergyico, PRL also seeks to upgrade its plants and double its processing capacity to 100,000 barrels per day by spending $1.7 billion. PRL, a subsidiary of PSO, expects to complete the project by the end of 2028. Overall, the five oil refineries across Pakistan are poised to invest between $5 billion and $6 billion in modernising their facilities.\nThese upgrades could potentially double Pakistan\u2019s petrol production and increase diesel output by 47%, while furnace oil might see a 78% drop. Such advancements could lead Pakistan to diesel self-sufficiency, curtailing the costly need for imports that burden the country\u2019s finances.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 28th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

This increase will put a burden of Rs70 billion on the people of Pakistan, they said.\nThey also said that apart from domestic consumers, the industrial sector, especially the export-oriented sector, will suffer a huge loss in terms of foreign exchange.\n\u201cRepeated hikes in power tariffs are hitting exports and local businesses alike. The government has increased electricity prices many times, and the majority of people have been sent bills many times more than their monthly income,\u201d said Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industries (LCCI) President Kashif Anwar.\nHe said that electricity is the main input for industries. If such anti-industry measures are not avoided, the manufacturing sector will be completely destroyed, and the country will remain only a trading place.\n\u201cThe cost of electricity in Pakistan is already very high compared to other countries in the region, and Pakistani products will be completely out of competition in the international market,\u201d he said.\nThe country has already lost much of the global market to Bangladesh and India due to high production costs. More burden is being put on those customers who are paying their dues regularly and whose line losses are the least, Anwar said.\nHe added that the trend of theft will increase due to the increase in electricity prices. \u201cThe business community is unable to understand why, instead of controlling line losses and increasing the generation of cheap power through renewable resources, their problems are being compounded.\u201d\n\nRead\u00a0NEPRA orders inquiry into power rate hike demand\nThe business community said that the power distribution companies\u2019 (Discos\u2019) losses and inefficiencies stood at Rs77 billion during July-December 2023-24 as compared to Rs62 billion in the same period of 2022-23, showing an addition of Rs15 billion in total circular debt stock. The total amount of losses and inefficiencies was Rs160 billion during FY2022-23.\nDiscos\u2019 under-recoveries reached Rs149 billion during the first half of 2023-24 as compared to Rs62 billion during the corresponding period of 2022-23; however, their cumulative under-recoveries stood at Rs236 billion as of June 30, 2023.\n\u201cPolicy makers sitting in Islamabad have failed to read the writing on the wall. \u2018Out-of-the-box thinking\u2019 is required to emerge from the economic crisis,\u201d said Pakistan Business Forum Vice President Ahmad Jawad.\nHe warned that if energy prices are not slashed by approximately 43%, various industries may not survive as high input costs would lead to the loss of export markets, eventually triggering industrial closures.\n\u201cPakistan, already reeling from skyrocketing inflation for the last three years, similarly, the international competitiveness of Pakistan\u2019s textiles and apparel exports is being continuously eroded by ever-increasing energy prices that, on average, are over twice those of competing countries. One should understand that price hikes have made Pakistani exporters \u2018uncompetitive\u2019 in the export markets by a large margin,\u201d said Jawad.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 28th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

        },
        "Details": {
            "Text": "Pakistan has decided to follow the Turkish model through outsourcing the management of power distribution companies (DISCOs) in an attempt to reduce losses, bring efficiency and attract investment.\nTo adopt the Turkish model, the government of Pakistan has agreed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that it will engage a transaction adviser for long-term concessions by the end of April 2024. The World Bank has offered a grant-based technical assistance and risk guarantee instruments, which give greater confidence to the prospective private concession holders and their lenders. The International Finance Corporation has expressed interest in providing transaction advisory services.\nSources revealed that policymakers were informed in a recent meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation (CCOP) that a long-term concession model had delivered the benefits of private sector participation in Turkey, Argentina, Brazil, Uganda and other countries. Policymakers noted that under such concessions, Turkey\u2019s 20 DISCOs attracted a much larger private sector investment than under the public sector, ensured much better service quality for consumers and reduced losses by one-third in a decade.\nThe meeting was informed that Turkey secured the jobs of most of the staff of DISCOs for the first five years along with only 3-5% long-term increase in tariffs.\nPakistan\u2019s policymakers noted that a similar experience was required to be followed in Pakistan whereby the government would agree with concession holders on a gradual reduction in liabilities through loss reduction without a significant increase in tariffs.\nThey said that DISCOs would then secure a much better value from privatisation. There was unanimity of views among the policymakers that the handing over of DISCOs to provincial governments was unlikely to result in the required strategic shift.\nFurthermore, provincial authorities had laid a number of conditions for taking over the ownership of DISCOs, which may not be supportive of efforts to improve their operational performance and may delay the process further.\nThere was consensus that privatisation was the best solution. However, the policymakers stated that the sale of government assets had often come under legal and political pressure on account of valuation of assets. Any sale of assets at throwaway prices had the potential to derail the entire process.\n\nRead\u00a0Revamping DISCOs\nIn addition, legacy issues about the ownership of assets (DISCOs vs Wapda) still existed and had been a major hurdle in the way of privatisation.\nThe Power Division was of the view that the concession model would bring the desired results. It was proposed that initially two smaller DISCOs, the better-performing Gujranwala Electric Power Company (Gepco) and the poor-performing Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (Hesco), may be earmarked. The Power Division told the meeting that the power sector\u2019s longstanding difficulties stemmed primarily from the operational performance of 10 DISCOs.\nThe key challenges faced by DISCOs included poor governance and inadequate investment. Therefore, they were placed on the active privatisation list but the process could not move forward.\nDuring the tenure of the previous government, a committee was constituted for the transfer of DISCOs to provinces. The committee submitted its report to the then prime minister, who gave the directive that the summary may be placed before the new cabinet.\nDuring a meeting of the executive committee of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), held on September 26-27, 2023, the minister of privatisation called for taking an appropriate course for transferring the management of DISCOs to the private sector.\nThe SIFC apex committee, during a meeting on October 4, 2023, agreed with the proposal and decided that the recommendation of the privatisation minister about private sector participation in the management of DISCOs, including management contracts/ outsourcing, should be approved.\nA summary will be moved to the cabinet to revive its earlier decision on private sector participation and withdraw the proposal of \u201cprovincialisation\u201d.\nIt was observed that the concession model/ outsourcing would be discussed and a firm proposal would be presented by the energy minister and the privatisation minister in the next CCOP huddle.\nThe Power Division revealed that to come up with a workable solution to introduce a private sector-oriented culture of governance and management, modern expertise, information and communication technology and attract adequate investment in DISCOs, extensive consultations were held with the relevant entities and international financial institutions to develop a model for private sector participation in line with Pakistan\u2019s ground realities.\nThe CCOP observed that the case relating to private sector participation in the operation of DISCOs through long-term concession contracts fell within the domain of the Privatisation Commission rather than the Power Division. Therefore, the matter should be dealt with by the Privatisation Commission.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 28th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

Pakistan is currently paying 7.1% interest rate on the basis of the six-month Secured Overnight Finance Rate (SOFR) plus 1.715%.\n\nThe officials said that China has informally communicated its decision to further extend the repayment period and the finance ministry was waiting for a formal response.\n\nInterim Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar last month formally requested the Chinese government to rollover the maturing loans, according to the officials.\n\nPakistan paid Rs26.6 billion in interest in the last fiscal year to China, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on the $9 billion deposits that these three nations placed with the State Bank of Pakistan, the SBP balance sheet showed.\n\nIn the preceding year, the country had paid Rs12.2 billion that within a year jumped by 118%.\nThe authorities said that a major factor behind the 118% increase in the interest cost was the currency devaluation in the previous fiscal year.\n\nThe central bank\u2019s gross official foreign exchange reserves stand at $8 billion. Over the past one decade, Pakistan has adopted a policy to borrow from the regional countries during difficult economic times.\n\nIt has not been able to strengthen the repayment capacity and as a result these loans are extended at the time of their maturity.\n\nAs of June last year, the regional countries had placed $9 billion in deposits.\n\nSubsequent to a staff-level agreement with the International Monetary Fund, Saudi Arabia and the UAE had further increased their exposure to Pakistan, taking the total tally to $12 billion for the three nations.\n\nThe cost of interest on these deposits is now expected to increase substantially for this fiscal year after the increase in the size of the deposits.\n\nThe SBP\u2019s balance sheet showed that during the last fiscal year Pakistan paid another amount of Rs42.1 billion to China on account of interest for using a $4.5 billion Chinese trade finance facility for debt purposes.\n\nThe SBP report showed that the central bank fully tapped the $4.5 billion, or 30 billion Yuan, trade finance facility available under the China-Pakistan currency swap arrangement.\n\nIt added that Rs42.1 billion interest was charged on the outstanding balance at agreed rates, which was Rs5.8 billion or 16% higher than the preceding year.\n\nIn rupee terms, the bilateral currency swap value increased from Rs927 billion in the preceding year to Rs1.2 trillion by end of last fiscal year. Pakistan largely utilised the Chinese trade finance facility to repay foreign debt and keep its gross foreign currency reserves at their levels.\n\nThe $4.5 billion facility is part of the SBP\u2019s $8 billion in gross official foreign exchange reserves. China has also extended $4 billion worth of SAFE deposits, which are also part of the $8 billion reserves.\n\nPakistan\u2019s gross reserves are now not enough to service these two Chinese facilities.\n\nThe successive governments have failed to tap non-debt creating inflows, which has exposed the country to various risks. The exports are growing at a pace that is not enough to finance the imports. The foreign direct investment remains dry and stagnant.\n\nThe political instability and the ad-hoc measures such as disrupting the social media services and the internet are sending negative signals to the foreign investors.\n\nThe existing $8 billion worth of official foreign currency reserves are the result of foreign lending despite having the umbrella of the IMF.\n\nThe SBP balance sheet also revealed that Pakistan obtained the IMF loans at interest rates ranging from 1.89% to 4.98%. The country paid Rs29.5 billion in interest rate to the IMF during the last fiscal year, according to the report.\n\nPakistan\u2019s existing IMF programme is expiring in six weeks. The last tranche of $1.2 billion remains undisbursed and it will be the first task of the new finance minister to receive the IMF mission and secure a staff-level agreement in March.\n\n"

Though the allegations of corruption have always followed him, he along with his party members has always maintained his innocence as nothing has been proven against him and he has never been convicted by courts.\n\nDespite his tumultuous political career, Zardari had made history by surrendering the powers of the president during his last stint.\n\nIt was he who, being the president, had reduced the president to a ceremonial figurehead by stripping the president\u2019s office of the power to dissolve parliament, to dismiss elected prime ministers, and to appoint military chiefs, among other things, when the government had passed the 18th Amendment in April 2010.\n\nAlso, he had surrendered the power to appoint the chief election commissioner by substituting it with a mechanism that involved the opposition in the process.\n\nAll of these moves were not only unprecedented but showed Zardari\u2019s vision and maturity as a politician.\n\nWith his permanent gleeful smile, his decision to involve political opponents in making the constitutional appointments showed the kind of tolerance level he wishes to see in the country, which is otherwise engulfed by polarisation.\n\nHow president is elected?\n\nOn Tuesday, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) unveiled the timetable for the upcoming presidential election.\n\nUnder Article 41(4) of the Constitution, the presidential election must be conducted within 30 days of the general elections.\n\nSince the general elections were held on Feb 8, the presidential elections are due on March 9.\nThe ECP said that it will release the official schedule and public notice for the election of the president on March 1.\n\nIn accordance with constitutional provisions, a specific day will be designated for the submission of nomination papers, and candidates have the option to submit these papers to any presiding officer.\n\nThe ECP stated that the formation of the Electoral College, a crucial component for the presidential election, is set to be completed on Feb 29, when the members of the national and others assemblies would take oath and become eligible to vote for the president\u2019s election.\n\nThe president is elected indirectly by parliament for a five-year term and acts as a ceremonial figurehead. Though the president has no direct authority in running the government, he can directly grant pardons and reprieves; appoint higher commands in military with support from the prime minister and confirm judicial appointments, among other things.\n\nUnder Article 41(3) of the Constitution, the president is elected in a special session of parliament, Senate and all four provincial assemblies. The Electoral College of 692 votes of lawmakers includes 96 senators and 336 members of the National Assembly and 260 votes of the four provincial assemblies.\n\nCurrently, the total number of lawmakers is 1,181, which includes 96 senators, 336 MNAs and 749 legislators of the provincial assemblies.\n\nIn order to ensure equal representation, all provincial assemblies are given 65 votes each in the Electoral College as it is the smallest number of the members in Balochistan Assembly.\n\nThe MNAs and senators\u2019 vote is counted as one vote for each member. With 371 parliamentarians, Punjab\u2019s 5.7 members equal one vote; Sindh\u2019s 2.58 members make one vote; and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa\u2019s 2.2 members vote is counted as one.\n\nBeing the joint candidate of the upcoming ruling parties and having majority seats in Sindh and Balochistan assemblies, Zardari \u2013 who has earned the reputation of the one who can turn the tables anytime \u2013 is set to enter the Presidency with an overwhelmingly majority.\n\n"

            "Text": "As the curtains rise on the first session of the National Assembly today, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) found itself unable to dispel the cloud of uncertainty surrounding the allocation of reserved seats for the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), following a PTI-SIC 'merger' for this specific purpose.\nThe electoral body yet again appeared to drag its feet and let the controversy simmer after it reserved the verdict on the petitions filed by the SIC seeking the allocation of women and minority seats \u2013 leaving the matter up in the air as the maiden sitting of NA takes convenes today.\nMoreover, the PTI has decided to escalate the matter to the Supreme Court if the reserved seats were given to other parties.\nThe SIC contends that since the ball was in the ECP's court, a decision could have nipped a brewing controversy over the NA\u2019s fresh tenure in the bud by deciding whether the party deserved its share of the reserved seats.\nMoreover, the controversy deepened when the ECP disclosed that SIC Chairman Hamid Raza had written a letter refusing to accept the reserved seats \u2013 a claim vehemently denied by Raza.\nA five-member bench, chaired by Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja, conducted the hearing on Wednesday.\nThe ECP considered applications pertaining to the reserved seats of the Sunni Ittehad Council, with the presence of PTI leader Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and SIC chief Hamid Raza before the commission.\nDuring the hearing, CEC Sikandar Sultan Raja presented a letter from the SIC to the PTI counsel, stating that the party did not participate in the general elections and therefore did not desire the reserved seats.\nHowever, Zafar expressed ignorance about the letter, stating that the SIC had not informed PTI about any such decision. In response, CEC Raja questioned the insistence on the allotment of reserved seats if the SIC had expressed a lack of interest.\nPTI lawyer Ali Zafar objected that the ECP had decided yesterday to issue notices to all parliamentary parties.\nThe electoral body addressed the plea following President Alvi's refusal to sign a Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs summary requesting the convening of a National Assembly session.\nPresident Alvi insisted that the allocation of the remaining reserved seats should precede the summoning of the NA session, as mandated within 21 days of the elections under the Constitution.\nIn the previous hearing, CEC Raja consolidated petitions from SIC, MQM-P, PPP, and PML-N. Advocates Farogh Naseem, Ali Zafar, Farooq H Naek, and Azam Nazeer Tarar represented MQM-P, SIC, PPP, and PML-N, respectively, before the five-member bench.\nDuring the proceedings on Wednesday, Barrister Zafar argued that 86 independents, who won National Assembly seats, joined the SIC. \"SIC is a political party with the right to form a government and contest elections,\" he asserted.\nIn response, a commission member pointed out that SIC did not participate in the February 8 polls.\nBarrister Zafar emphasised that independents play a crucial role in presidential elections, citing constitutional provisions for reserved seat allocation.\nCEC Raja assured that reserved seats would be allocated in accordance with the Constitution. Barrister Zafar contended that a party can include independent candidates and become a parliamentary party.\nCEC Raja mentioned having a letter from SIC stating that the party neither contested nor sought reserved seats. Barrister Zafar claimed the PTI was unaware of the letter.\nPPP's Naek argued that SIC failed to submit a priority list within the deadline. PML-N's Tarar asserted that reserved seats cannot be granted to independents under the law.\nMQM-P's Naseem urged the ECP to allocate reserved seats to his party, emphasising SIC's non-parliamentary status. \"The head of the SIC also contested the elections as an independent,\" he noted.\nAfter the completion of the arguments, the ECP reserved the verdict.\nRead: SIC\u2019s reserved seat claim challenged\nSIC refutes refusal of reserved seats\nOn the other hand, SIC Chairman Hamid Raza denied that the party refused to take reserved seats in a letter addressed to the ECP.\nAddressing the media in Islamabad, Raza asserted that the letter sent to the ECP WAS being misconstrued.\nIn a media interaction after the hearing, Raza clarified that the ECP routinely sends letters to all parties after general elections, specifying a five per cent quota for women in the distribution of tickets. He emphasised that the letter in question was not exclusive to the SIC but addressed to all participating parties.\nRaza stated that since his party did not participate in the elections, the SIC informed the ECP about its non-participation, and therefore, they had no list to allocate 5 per cent of tickets to women.\nHe clarified that the SIC did not express a refusal for reserved seats, and their letter did not mention any such rejection.\n\"We have a letter, and there is no mention of reserved seats in this letter,\" Raza maintained. \"It should be read on the basis of Article 206 of the Constitution. My affidavit is also available, which says if we contest elections, we will take reserved seats.\"\nRaza asserted that his letter had been distorted and misinterpreted and left the decision on the matter to the ECP's discretion. \"It is the will of the CEC to interpret it whichever way he deems fit,\" he added.\nPTI denounces 'stealing\u2019 of reserved seats\nMeanwhile, the PTI decried the \u201cshameful\u201d plan to \u201csteal\u201d seats reserved for women and minorities in the National Assembly.\nIn a statement on X, PTI accused the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) of distributing reserved seats among \u201cmandate thieves\u201d through \u201cunconstitutional\u201d plans.\nArticle 51 of the Constitution clearly lays out the basic principle of allocation of reserved seats, which are given to women and minorities in proportion to general seats, the party said.\n\u201cThe Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) is the parliamentary party with the largest number of seats in the Centre, Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\u201cThe allocation of reserved seats to the [SIC] is part of an unconstitutional and undemocratic plan to illegally and forcibly convert the majority into a minority.\u201d\nPTI also vowed to take back the National and Punjab Assembly seats allocated through \u201cfake Form 47s\u201d and strongly resist the \u201cunconstitutional\u201d allocation of reserved seats.\"\nMoreover, the PTI announced to escalate the matter to the SC if SIC reserved seats were distributed among other parties.\nIn a media talk, Barrister Ali Zafar said he hoped a decision would be taken as per the law and Constitution.\n"

            "Text": "The senators on Tuesday condemned the \u201cignorance\u201d of a mob that attacked a young woman wearing a dress with Arabic calligraphy printed on it, demanding strict action against those who falsely accused her of committing blasphemy.\n\nThe incident occurred on Sunday in Lahore\u2019s Ichra Bazaar when police saved a woman sporting a kurta, which superimposed imprints of the Arabic words \u201cbeautiful life\u201d by a popular clothing brand that led some to believe they denoted a Quranic verse.\n\nA video circulating on social media captured the terrified woman hiding in a shop, refuting the allegations of blasphemy.\n\nLater, a police team led by Gulberg Circle Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Syeda Shehrbano Naqvi intervened and saved the woman from the mob.\n\nAmong the videos in circulation on social media, the ASP can be seen addressing the angry men with a direct stare, her voice loud and firm, reminding everyone to trust her and her team which has satisfactorily handled similar incidents in the past.\n\nAs per the ASP, no blasphemous act had occurred. She, alongside other senior police officials, examined the dress and confirmed that the Arabic calligraphy was indeed unrelated to scripture.\n\nIn her statement, the woman rejected the allegations of blasphemy, emphasising her commitment to respecting Islam as she hailed from a religious family.\n\nSpeaking in the upper house of parliament, Senator Rubina Khalid of the PPP expressed her concern over the growing intolerance in the country.\n\nDescribing the incident in Lahore as an unfortunate one, she said ignorance was spreading in the country\u2019s society.\n\n\u201cThere is a major difference between an ignorant and a Muslim,\u201d Rubina added.\n\nThe PPP senator pointed that the woman was forced to apologise for wearing an outfit with Arabic calligraphy, which the ignorant mob was unaware of.\n\n\u201cWhy was she forced to issue a public apology for something she didn\u2019t do?\u201d\n\nShe continued that the kurta worn by the woman superimposed imprints of an Arabic word, but it was compared to a Quranic verse.\n\nRubina observed that the kurta the young woman was wearing belonged to a brand based in Saudi Arabia. \u201cIt\u2019s fine there but here women are harassed in the name of religion.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the matter, MQM-P Senator Faisal Subzwari inquired what kind of a Muslim was someone, who could not identify between a Quranic verse and a simple Arabic word.\n\nHe also lamented the growing intolerance in the society, saying that it had become common to hurl accusations of blasphemy against each other.\n\nThe MQM-P senator emphasised that using religion to level false allegations was the worst form of disrespect.\n\n\u201cThis is a major problem, I wish the house could have completed the legislation over the misuse of blasphemy laws,\u201d he added.\n\nSubzwari asked who was defaming the religion. \u201cWas it that woman or is it the people who despite reading the word falsely accused her?\"\n\nThe MQM-P senator demanded strict action against the people who level false allegations of blasphemy.\n\n\u201cIslam is a religion of peace and harmony. Our country and religion are defamed by tragic incidents like the one in Lahore.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, lawmakers belonging to the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) on Tuesday protested in the Senate, demanding the immediate release of the party founder, Imran Khan, his wife, and the female activists of the party.\n\nDuring a session presided over by Deputy Chairman Mirza Afridi, Senator Kamran Murtaza of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) and Saadia Abbasi of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supported the PTI\u2019s contention for the issuance of a production order for the senators in custody.\n\nAt the outset of the session, the PTI senators raised slogans in the house for the release of the party founder and other imprisoned PTI women.\n\nSenator Ali Zafar said that the PTI women supporters were in jails for many months.\n\nHe said that the PTI won 90% of the seats in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, but the party was not being allocated the reserved seats it deserved. He warned that stealing the PTI\u2019s seats was against the law and the Constitution.\n\nPTI Senator Faisal Javed said that on Feb 8, the nation reposed full confidence in the PTI founder.\nHe added that a lack of trust would not end if those with 17 seats came to power.\n\nLater, the PTI senators staged a walkout from the proceedings in protest.\n\nPML-N Senator Saadia supported PTI\u2019s demand for the issuance of the production orders of senators Ijaz Chaudhry and Shibli Faraz.\n\nShe also demanded the resignation of the chief election commissioner for failing to conduct transparent elections.\n\nJUI-F\u2019s Kamran Murtaza deplored the treatment meted out to the PTI women supporters.\n\n"

            "Text": "With the clock ticking down on the constitutionally mandated deadline for summoning the National Assembly session, President Arif Alvi continued to stonewall the process on Tuesday, with the ball now in the NA secretariat\u2019s court to make the call.\n\nAlvi, whose presidency is nearing its conclusion, has been withholding approval for the NA session, demanding a resolution to the issue of reserved seats for women and minorities distributed among parties, in accordance with the law.\n\nHis delay tactics have drawn criticism from political parties, including the PML-N and PPP, urging him not to misuse his powers as the head of state.\n\nObservers speculate that the president aims to postpone the session until the Election Commission of Pakistan issues a notification regarding the reserved seats of the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), a group that most PTI-backed lawmakers have recently joined.\n\nThe ECP, however, clarified that the issue of SIC reserved seats is currently \"under consideration by the commission\" and is scheduled for a hearing tomorrow following today's adjournment.\n\nOn Tuesday, Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar once again advised the president to convene the session, while granting authority to the NA secretariat to call the session after the constitutional deadline.\n\nIn the summary, Kakar emphasised that calling a sitting within 21 days of the elections was a constitutional obligation.\n\nMeanwhile, in anticipation of the president's potential inaction, alternative arrangements for convening the NA meeting have been finalised.\n\nThe caretaker premier has empowered the NA Secretariat to schedule a meeting after the expiration of the constitutional deadline, with sources suggesting that the notification for the NA session is likely to be issued between Wednesday and Thursday night.\n\n\u2018Alvi violating constitution\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) stalwart and Senator Ishaq Dar levelled serious allegations against President Alvi, accusing him of attempting to once again violate the constitution.\n\nSpeaking to the media in Islamabad, Dar, expressing concerns over the obstruction of the upcoming National Assembly meeting scheduled for February 29, urged fellow members not to sign any documents supporting the alleged unconstitutional actions.\n\nHe highlighted instances where members were unable to take their oaths during previous sessions, stressing the importance of upholding constitutional procedures.\n\nDar stressed that the failure by the president to sign the necessary documents for the assembly meeting indicated a deliberate attempt to disrupt proceedings, suggesting a disregard for constitutional principles.\n\nHe condemned such actions, stating that they were tarnishing the nation's reputation on the international stage.\n\nThe senior PML-N leader underscored the clarity of the constitution regarding the convening of assembly sessions, criticising Alvi\u2019s objections and the subsequent return of the summary.\n\nDar affirmed that members whose notifications had been issued would fulfil their obligations, despite the challenges faced.\n\nExpressing frustration at what he termed as \"games being played with the constitution,\" Dar called for a proper resolution of the issue by the President. He assured that the National Assembly meeting would proceed as scheduled on February 29, dismissing any confusion surrounding the session.\n\nDar reiterated his commitment to fostering unity among members of both national and provincial assemblies, stressing the importance of inclusivity in the political process.\n\nHe also refuted President Alvi's assertion that the constitution was incomplete, citing reports of a federal government response to the objections raised.\n\nIt is pertinent to note that development took place a day after National Assembly Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf had to convene the inaugural session of the lower house of parliament at 10 am on Feb 29.\n\n"

            "Text": "The PTI has asked the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to factor in the country's political stability in any further bailout talks, it emerged on Wednesday.\nAddressing a news conference in Islamabad, PTI stalwart Barrister Gohar Ali Khan confirmed that the party had sent a letter to the IMF, adding that it would reveal its content after it reached Washington.\nGiving hints of what the letter might read, Gohar said the PTI had reminded the IMF of its promise that transparent elections would be held in Pakistan.\nHowever, The Express Tribune has obtained a copy of the letter. Addressed to IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, the PTI in the letter claimed that it did not want to stand in the way of any global lender\u2019s facility for Pakistan.\nHowever, the party stressed the need for the necessary reforms along with the facility to facilitate the repayment of the loans.\n\u201cThe IMF can negotiate only with an elected government that has the confidence of the people,\u201d it stated.\nThe party urged the Washington-based lender to take into account its policy guidance note prepared in 1997.\n\u201cIt is a well-established reality that a government without legitimate representation, when imposed upon a country, carries no moral authority to govern, and, in particular, to carry out taxation measures.\u201d\nThe letter pointed out that in the last interaction held between PTI founding chairman and former premier Imran Khan and IMF representatives in 2023, the party had agreed to support the global lender\u2019s financing facility involving Pakistan on the condition and reassurance of a free and fair election in the country.\nAlso read: PTI says not an obstacle to IMF programme\n\u201cIn the foregoing backdrop, it is noteworthy that the general elections conducted in Pakistan on February 8, 2024, on which public expenditure of about PKR 50 billion (or US$ 180 million) was incurred, were subjected to widespread intervention and fraud in the counting of votes and compilation of results. This intervention and fraud have been so brazen that the IMF\u2019s most important member countries including the US, Great Britain, and countries forming part of the European Union have called for a full and transparent investigation into the matter. A mission of the European Union has carried out an examination of the general elections of February 8, 2024. The report of the said mission must be examined by the IMF and made available to the people of Pakistan.\u201d\nThe letter continued that it was not just the PTI, but several other political parties in Pakistan, along with a number of western governments, Commonwealth observers, local civil society organisations, as well as international print and electronic media, have called for an independent probe into the claims of intervention and electoral fraud in the country on and after February 8 this year.\n\u201cWe do not call for the IMF to adopt the role of an investigative agency. There are at least two indigenous organizations in Pakistan namely the Free and Fair Election Network (FAFEN) and PATTAN-Coalition38 that have proposed comprehensive methodologies to conduct an audit of the General Elections 2024 which, with some modifications, could be implemented locally to the satisfaction of all stakeholders. Such a role by the IMF would be a great service to Pakistan and its people, and could become the harbinger of enduring prosperity, growth, and macroeconomic stability in the country.\u201d\nSpeaking at the news conference, PTI\u2019s Omar Ayub maintained that his party had neither stood in the way of an IMF programme in the past, nor would it do so in future.\nAlso read: Imran wants IMF loan contingent upon vote audit\nHe added that the IMF had reached an understanding with the PTI that fair and free general election would be held in the country.\nHowever, he lamented the alleged massive rigging that took place in the recent polls\nAyub maintained that the \u201cPakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) 2.0\u201d could not introduce any reforms.\nHe added that these people could not use money properly.\nAyub demanded that FAFEN should audit the general polls and bring out the facts.\nHe claimed that the PTI wanted the loans to be used for reforms and not wasted on lavish spending.\nTalking to the media, PTI\u2019s Muzzammil Aslam said his party had been falsely accused of sabotaging the IMF programme.\nHe pointed out that Pakistan had received 14 programmes from the IMF and managed to complete only one of them.\nAslam noted that 12 of the 14 programmes were taken by the PPP and PML-N.\n\u201cThe largest of them was taken by the PPP in 2008.\u201d\nIn an email to Reuters, the IMF confirmed it had yet to receive the PTI\u2019s letter.\nLast week, the IMF declined to comment on the country's political situation after the PTI founding chairman\u2019s aides said they would urge the lender to call for an independent audit of the country\u2019s disputed February 8 elections before engaging in further talks with Islamabad.\nSohail Ahmed of Karachi-based Topline securities said the letter was unlikely to have a major market impact. \"The IMF will do its own due diligence,\" he added.\n"

            "Text": "PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif on Wednesday named party president and his younger brother Shehbaz Sharif as the candidate for the country\u2019s next prime minister and nominated Ayaz Sadiq for the slot of National Assembly speaker.\nAnticipating the challenges facing the nation, the PML-N Quaid forewarned that the next one-and-a-half to two years would be difficult for the country, advising his party\u2019s parliamentarians to maintain unity in the face of impending adversity.\nThe development took place during the PML-N\u2019s joint parliamentary meeting in the provincial capital.\nAddressing the huddle, Nawaz praised his younger brother, stating that Shehbaz must be commended for his \u201cdedicated and courageous service\u201d during the last sixteen months of his tenure as premier, which helped prevent the country from defaulting.\nThe PML-N supremo remarked that if he were in Shehbaz's position, he would not have been able to work effectively under those conditions.\nHe stated that Shehbaz was the \u201cbest choice\u201d in\u00ac\u00ac the given circumstances, underscoring that during their tenure they would focus on \u201chealing Pakistan\u201d and lead it out of crises.\nHe observed that fixing the country today appeared to be a daunting task, adding that the next one-and-half to two years would be challenging, as tough decisions were needed to be made.\n\u201cIf we perform our duties with good intention, Almighty will extend his help,\u201d Nawaz said.\n\u201cPrimary goal is to provide relief to people in gas and electricity prices, tackle inflation and stabilize rupee dollar parity. We will have to proceed with a preplanned roadmap in order to succeed.\u201d\nRead more: NA inaugural session summoned on Thursday despite president\u2019s objection\nTaking a jibe at PTI, Nawaz stated that his party leaders should not pay heed to allegations of rigging, emphasizing t\u00achat they stood against those who disregard logic.\nHe noted that only those elections were deemed fair by the former ruling party where they emerged victorious, whereas they cried foul and claimed rigging if they lost.\nThe PML-N supremo recalled that in 2013, the PTI made similar \u201cfalse claims\u201d that later turned out to be \u201cnothing but a pack of lies\u201d.\nHowever, he conceded that given the overall scenario, the mood of the current parliamentary meeting was not as upbeat as it used to be in past.\nRead more: Alvi strikes defiant note on NA session\nWithout naming Imran, Nawaz recalled that when the PTI founder fell off stage at a rally in 2013, he visited him in the hospital and suspended his election campaign for the day.\nNawaz recounted that following the election victory, he paid another visit to Imran at his Bani Gala residence where they agreed to work together towards enhancing living standards in the country.\nHe said despite the PTI\u2019s plans to organize sit-ins and rallies in London against them, the PML-N remained committed to fulfilling its election promises.\nTaking a swipe at the retired judges who had issued his disqualification decision, the PML-N supremo questioned their whereabouts, asking whether they could even face the public.\nHe reiterated that he was ousted for not accepting salary from his son.\n\u201cWhere is Justice Saqib Nisar?\u201d he asked.\nHe criticized the terms used in the judgment against him, asserting that they reflected a personal vendetta. He expressed that if the momentum achieved by 2017 had persisted, they would have been among the G20 nations. Additionally, he reminded his party parliamentarians of the projects initiated during his tenure.\nEarlier in the meeting, Shehbaz extended a warm welcome to independent MNAs Barrister Aqeel Malik, Waseem Qadir, Rashid Akbar Khan Nawani and Raza Hayat Hiraj to the party.\nHe also expressed admiration for his brother, stating that counting the project planks laid during Nawaz\u2019s tenures would be an extensive endeavour, taking months to complete.\n\u201cNawaz laid a network of infrastructure projects, nearly ended loadshedding and eradicated terrorism during his term. Despite being ousted unfairly Nawaz did not resort to arson or vandalism.\u201d\nIn a reference to the PTI which is accused of being involved in the May 9 incident, Shehbaz remarked that while Zulfiqar Bhutto was hanged and Benazir was assassinated, no one directed their attention towards GHQ.\nHe also censured President Arif Alvi for \u201ctrampling Constitution under his feet\u201d by not calling the assembly session within the constitutionally defined timeline.\nShehbaz said they would take decisions in consultation with other parties while ensuring the participation of state institutions.\n"

            "Text": "The stage is set for the commencement of the 16th National Assembly\u2019s five-year term on Thursday with lawmakers preparing to gather in the lower house of parliament to take the oath and assume their positions on the treasury and opposition benches to formally initiate legislative proceedings.\nIn a late night development on Wednesday, the president signed a fresh advice for convening the assembly session on Thursday.\nAccording to the sources, at the very last moment, President Dr Alvi signed the second advice sent by the caretaker premier and approved the convening of the first session of the newly elected lower house of parliament.\nDespite his reservations, the president fulfilled his constitutional obligation by calling a session of the NA to put an end to the ongoing speculations and debates.\nEarlier, the National Assembly Secretariat has convened the inaugural session of the lower house of Parliament at 10am on Thursday.\nIn a notification issued by NA Secretary Tahir Hussain, it was disclosed that Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar has granted approval for the session under Article 91(2) of the Constitution.\nThe decision follows consultations with the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs and the Ministry of Law.\nThe political landscape has seen a shift towards a smoother transition as typically, a parliament's duration spans from one general election to the next.\nRead more: Alvi strikes defiant note on NA session\nHowever, the preceding NA marked the third instance of a legislative body completing a full five-year term, demonstrating a seamless transition even though it was dissolved merely three days before reaching its scheduled conclusion.\nThis marked a departure from the historical trend where no prime minister managed to stay in office for the complete five years, and assemblies before 2008 failed to fulfil their constitutional terms.\nEven though the assembly successfully concluded its five-year term from 2018 to 2023, it was punctuated by the unprecedented instance of a prime minister \u2013 in this case, PTI founding chairman Imran Khan \u2013 being removed through a vote of no-confidence in April 2022.\nThe void left by this departure was swiftly occupied by PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif, who, as the joint candidate of the opposition alliance at the time, assumed the role of the premier before subsequently dissolving it in August 2023.\nSubsequently, the era of the caretaker government commenced, originally intended to span three months. However, it established a novel precedent by extending its term to six months due to the inability to conduct general elections within the constitutionally mandated period of 90 days.\nHowever, the general elections were ultimately held on February 8, and amid allegations of rigging, they concluded with a split mandate.\nThis forced the major political parties to opt for wheeling and dealing following which the PML-N, PPP, MQM-P and others are set to form the federal government.\nAlso read: SIC chairman refutes refusal of reserved seats in letter to ECP\nOnce again, Shehbaz is the joint candidate of a newly stitched alliance of the PML-N, PPP, and MQM-P as well as others, and is expected to become the premier for the second time.\nHis previous stint lasted for only 16 months as the government had come to complete the term.\nDespite the \u2018hiccups\u2019, the tradition of the NA completing the five-year term has been going smoothly since 2008.\nUsually, the five-year terms are nothing less than a rollercoaster ride, and this time around the turbulence started even before taking the first step as President Dr Arif Alvi refused to call the inaugural session of the assembly on grounds that the reserved seats for women and minorities should be first distributed among the parties as per law.\nThe refusal prompted the outgoing NA Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf to call the maiden sitting of the lower house of parliament on February 29.\nOn that day, the newly-elected lawmakers will be sworn in to mark the beginning of the tenure of the assembly.\nIf the NA session is held on February 29, the schedule for the new speaker will be released on the same day after the MNAs-elect are sworn in.\nSubsequently, on March 1, the papers for the speaker's election will be submitted to the NA secretary, On March 2, the speaker and their deputy will be elected.\nThis way, the process for submitting the nomination papers for the election of the prime minister is slated for March 3. This is followed by the premier\u2019s election in the NA on March 4.\n"

The former zoo site, which spans over 28 acres of land, offers ample space to create a sanctuary for the two leopards, she added.\n\u201cThe common leopard, classified as critically endangered in Pakistan by WWF-Pakistan, faces severe threats from hunting across the country. It is imperative that we take all necessary measures to protect and preserve these majestic animals before they vanish from our forests,\u201d she said.\nShe said the board had close collaboration with K-P, AJK, Punjab and Sindh wildlife departments as it was the only rescue centre of its kind that provides expert care for rehabilitation and releases wild animals into their natural habitats as its top priority.\n\u201cThe feed is expensive, and these leopards are eating chicken. We have civil society donors, and a diplomatic community supporting us, so we have no funding constraints,\u201d she added.\nShe said as per the two-year-old camera trap study of IWMB there are around a dozen, or eight leopards inhabiting the Margalla Hills National Park and show a thriving trend of growth. However, the World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF-Pakistan) has provided to hold the next phase of the camera trap study to ascertain the exact situation, she said.\n"

            "Text": "A murder accused was shot and killed allegedly by his brother-in-law in the premises of the judicial complex in Rawalpindi city on Tuesday, witnesses and police said. The daylight shooting at the \u201cwell-guarded\u201d place in the city\u2019s downtown left a question mark on the so-called and tall police claims of tight security.\nThe shooting incident took place in the jurisdiction of the Civil Lines police station. The suspect was taken into custody from the crime scene moments after he confessed to the crime at the crime scene and invited the cops present nearby.\nThe firing at the judicial complex, which is usually visited by hundreds of complainants and a good number of judges and their staff daily, once again exposed the security cover for courts by the police. Soon after the incident, an investigation was launched to determine how the accused entered one of the most sensitive places with a weapon.\nAccording to the details, accused Ali Shah, who had allegedly murdered his wife Aleema Khan in the Rawat area and was imprisoned at the Adiala Central Jail in connection with the June 2023 murder case, was brought to a court for hearing in the case.\nGhafar Khan, the brother of Ali\u2019s wife, was already present there. As soon as Ali reached the premises around 9am, suspect Ghafar crossed the police barricade and opened fire at Ali, who was handcuffed. The victim collapsed on the spot.\nSoon after the incident, the suspect shouted, \"My mission is complete. I am surrendering for arrest. He [Ali] was my enemy and I killed him.\u201d Some cops escorting the victim and deployed at the judicial complex rushed to capture the suspect along with the weapon.\nAli had to appear in the court of an Additional Sessions Judge while Accused Ghaffar entered the judicial complex with a pistol at 9am. The accused said that the pistol was in his shalwar/trousers and he was waiting for the deceased.\nRead:\u00a0Senior hospital staffer murdered\nAli, who was being taken back to Bakshi Khana after appearing in the court, made a TikTok video of himself and also talked to his relatives over the phone on the second floor of the building. Over time, Ghaffar approached Ali and opened an indiscriminate fire.\nThree cops escorting Ali first sped away in panic but returned a few moments after the suspect confessed to the crime. The body was shifted to the district headquarters hospital for a post-mortem examination and later handed over to the heirs.\nCPO takes notice\nRawalpindi City Police Officer Syed Khalid Hamdani took notice of the incident and asked for a report of the incident from the Pothohar SP. An hour after the incident, the CPO claimed that the police took timely action and arrested the accused.\nTwo weeks ago, the Punjab police chief had announced while standing at the judicial complex that he had made the Rawalpindi security \u201cA plus\u201d after spending billions of rupees. A week ago, Adnan Chaudhary, the former provincial parliamentary secretary of the PTI was killed close to the judicial complex.\nIt was established after the shooting that all six security walk-through gates at the entrances of the judicial complex and the District Courts were completely dysfunctional. Accused Ghaffar told the police that he was not frisked at the entry. Most of the CCTV cameras were also found damaged.\nTaking notice of this horrifying murder, the District and Sessions Judge also expressed his anger and ordered to update the security immediately. President of the District Bar Association, Intizar Mehdi Shah also expressed his anger over the security lapses and demanded that all faulty security cameras and walk-through gates be fixed.\nFifth major incident\nThe fifth major incident in the Rawalpindi courts and judicial complex in the last three years has raised questions over the security measures of the police. A senior judge of the Lahore High Court\u2019s Rawalpindi bench and the Punjab also sought a report of this incident.\nMeanwhile, the Civil Lines police station registered a murder case and would seek Ghaffar\u2019s physical remand on Wednesday (today).\nAfter the incident, a good number of policemen intensified the checking of visitors at entry points of the judicial complex and the district courts.\nAccording to the sources, the security system of the judicial complex and the district courts has been declared completely ineffective and it has been decided to upgrade. The District and Sessions Judge has issued strict orders to repair all defective walk-through gates.\n"

The report was released on Wednesday.\nThis unprecedented surge brings the total number of registered voters to 128,585,760 in 2024, marking a significant rise from 106,000,239 in 2018 and 86,189,828 in 2013.\nThis makes Pakistan the fifth largest democracy in the world after India, Indonesia, United States and Brazil. This is also the first time that Pakistan registered more women voters as compared to men in-between two elections.\nPresently, the number of registered voters constitutes 53.2 percent of the 241.49 million population. Nevertheless, there are regional disparities in voter-to-population ratios, with Punjab (57 percent) and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (53 percent) registering over half of their populations as voters.\nSindh and Islamabad have voter-to-population ratios close to 50 percent, while Balochistan lags behind with 36 percent population registered as voters.\nThe voter-to-population ratio can be indicative of potential under-registration with a caveat. The ratio only accounts for voters registered in their native districts and not those who are registered as voters on their temporary addresses outside their native districts.\nAt the district and constituency levels, the disparity in voter proportions becomes increasingly apparent. Among the 136 districts analyzed by Fafen, 78 have more than half of their populations registered as voters, while nine districts including Upper Kohistan, Lower Kohistan, Kohistan Palas, Kech, Kharan, Panjgur, Sherani, Surab and Washuk have less than 30 percent population registered.\nA comparable trend is noted at the National Assembly constituency level, with 159 out of 266 constituencies registering over 50 percent of their populations as voters.\nThe registration of women has experienced an unprecedented increase since 2018, following the implementation of special measures introduced by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in accordance with Section 47 of the Elections Act, 2017.\nThe final electoral rolls reflect encouraging progress in narrowing the gender gap in voter registration. The collaborative efforts by the ECP, the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA), and civil society have played a vital role in raising awareness, mobilizing communities, and facilitating women\u2019s participation in the electoral process, leading to significant improvements in most regions.\nThese targeted initiatives have positively impacted gender parity in voter registration, reducing the overall gender gap from 12.4 million (11.8 percent) in 2018 to 9.9 million (7.7 percent) in the final electoral rolls for 2024 general elections.\nSince 2018, as many as 2.5 million more women have been registered than men out of the 22.5 million new voters added to the electoral rolls.\nThe number of districts with a gender gap exceeding 10 percent has decreased from 85 in 2018 to 29 in 2024, and the number of National Assembly constituencies with a gender gap above 10 percent has declined from 173 in 2018 to 38 in 2024.\nHowever, challenges persist, particularly in Balochistan, where the overall gender gap remains above 10 percent. The regional distribution of the 9.9 million gender gap reflects women\u2019s registration as a national issue.\n"

            "Text": "Lower-caste Hindus in Pakistan are carving a niche for themselves in the political arena, boldly stepping into the electoral fray on general seats.\nThe surge in participation is particularly pronounced in the Mirpur Khas division, home to districts such as Mirpurkhas, Umerkot, and Tharparkar, where a majority population of non-Muslims, especially Hindus, resides.About a dozen Hindus are participating in elections from Hyderabad and Mirpurkhas divisions, with a key focus on NA-215 Mithi, NA-213 Umerkot, and PS-45 Mirpurkhas. Notably, all three candidates in these constituencies are up against Muslim opponents.\nIn NA-215 Mithi, PPP\u2019s Mahesh Kumar Malani, who secured victory in the general elections 2018, faces Arbab Ghulam Rahim, a prominent leader of the GDA and former chief minister of Sindh. Local analysts believe Malani, with Hindu voter dominance, is well-positioned to defeat his archrival.\n\"Malani is a public figure and knows how to maintain a strong connection with the masses,\" Sajid Bajeer, a journalist based in Mithi, said.In Mirpur Khas\u2019s PS-45, Seth Hari Ram Kishori holds a favourable position despite contending against a Muslim candidate from an upper caste \u2013 Syed.\nSenior journalist Muhammad Hasham Shar from Mirpur Khas commented: \"Despite the other candidate being Syed, Kishori is in a winning position.\" He said that the competition among both is interesting as well.\nIn another Hindu-majority district Umerkot, former PTI National Assembly member Lal Malhi, now vying for the general seat from NA-213, faces stiff competition from PPP\u2019s Nawab Muhammad Yousuf Talpur.\nSpeaking to The Express Tribune, Malhi expresses optimism, stating, \"This constituency is Hindu majority, and I hope to win this seat.\"Interestingly, PTI has emulated PPP by nominating candidates from lower castes, including Lekhraj from PS-50, Pehlaj Kolhi from PS-53, Lajpat Bheel from PS-54, and Bhanji Kolhi from PS-55.\nMalhi emphasized the importance of political party backing for candidates, stating that: \"a candidate without a political party\u2019s support cannot win a seat.\"\nIn contrast, the major political party PML-N has not nominated any candidates for general seats, citing its direct support for the Grand Democratic Alliance as one of the reasons.\nHowever, Kheeal Das Kohistani, a senior leader and former MNA, clarified that PML-N has recommended candidates from lower castes for reserved seats.Neelam Kumari represents women on the reserved seat in the National Assembly, he said.\nKohistani highlighted that PML-N interviewed 118 non-Muslim candidates, claiming that the selection process was based on pure merit. \"We have given due space to those who were ignored in the past [by any political party],\" he maintained.\nPolitical analyst Ashfaq Laghari views the inclusion of lower-caste Hindus in the 2024 general elections as a positive development. He commended PPP\u2019s Krishna Kumari, a rights activist and Senator since 2018, for serving as a source of inspiration and symbolising inclusivity.\nEducationist Partab Shivani attributes this progress to increased awareness, emphasizing that despite the reluctance of upper-caste Hindus, the presence of lower-caste Hindus in parliament is essential. Shivani noted that Hindus reside not only in the Mirpur Khas division but also in significant numbers in Badin, Ghotki, Jamshoro district, and Karachi.\nPolitical and social activist Mukesh Meghwar highlighted the challenges faced by Hindus in securing general seats, stating that political parties are hesitant to allocate these seats to Hindus due to the anticipated lack of support from Muslim voters.\n\"Muslims will not support if a Hindu is given a chance by a political party, and parties are well aware of this fact.\"\n"

She called for reconsidering the decision of suspending the UNRWA funding.\nThe spokesperson said that on February 5, the government and the people of Pakistan would observe the Kashmir Solidarity Day to reaffirm their solidarity with the Kashmiri people in their just struggle for the realisation of their inalienable right to self-determination.\n\"Pakistan will continue to extend political, diplomatic and moral support to our Kashmiri brothers and sisters for the just and peaceful settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with the UN Security Council Resolutions,\" the spokesperson reiterated.\nBaloch said that Caretaker Foreign Minister Jalil Abbas Jilani attended the Third European Union (EU)-Indo-Pacific Ministerial Forum in Brussels, where he also held bilateral meetings with a number of EU officials. Jilani, she added, will also attend a session on \u2018Economic Resilience and Investment\u2019.\nShe informed the media persons that Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian visited Islamabad on January 29 and held in-depth talks with Foreign Minister Jilani, and met with Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar and Chief of Army Staff Gen Asim Munir.\nThe two sides agreed to immediately appoint liaison officers in Turbat and Zahedan, besides establishing a joint coordination mechanism at the foreign ministers level to oversee and steer progress on a common agenda for prosperity and development, she added.\nBaloch reiterated that Pakistan shared credible evidence linking Indian agents to extra-territorial and extra-judicial killings of two Pakistani nationals on the Pakistani soil, which contained striking similarities with the pattern observed in other countries, including Canada and the United States.\n"

        },
        "Details": {
            "Text": "Retired judges, once aligned with the camp of former chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) Mian Saqib Nisar, now face a precarious situation as the federal government is urging the Supreme Court to revisit its previous order, which shielded retired or resigned judges from action by the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC).\nThe judicial politics has been buzzing with activity ever since the filing of the presidential reference against the current CJP, Qazi Faez Isa, back in May 2019.In attempts to unseat CJ Isa, a faction of judges made not one but two determined efforts, yet they fell short, and Justice Isa emerged unscathed.\nNevertheless, this intense legal tussle has resulted in a clear division among judges, aligning themselves into two distinct camps.At the forefront of this divide was the group led by CJP Saqib Nisar, which was in the driving seat in the superior judiciary until the retirement of the former CJP, Umar Ata Bandial.\nThe landscape shifted as judges who weathered the storm with CJ Isa are now at the helm.The tides turned dramatically for ex-CJP Saqib Nisar's camp, facing a significant setback when judges Justice Ijazul Ahsan and retired Justice Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi tendered their resignations.As the SJC, led by CJ Qazi Faez Isa, was poised to act against Justice Naqvi following his resignation, Attorney General for Pakistan, Mansoor Awan, announced the government's intent to file an intra-court appeal (ICA) against a prior decision that said the SJC could not proceed against resigned or retired judges.\nThe judgement, authored by Justice Munib Akhtar, was handed down during the tenure of the ex-CJP Umar Ata Bandial.Recently, the government, through the AGP, filed an ICA against the division bench.\nThe appeal was heard by a larger bench of five judges, presided over by Justice Aminuddin Khan on Wednesday. The bench is set to decide on the maintainability of the ICA within the next two weeks.\nIt is noteworthy that the Independent Group, which holds sway in the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) and Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), also aligns itself closely with CJP Isa, PML-N, PPP and \u2018powerful circles\u2019.\nTherefore, the superior bars, under the Independent Group, are not supporting the PTI in the current political climate. Notably, this legal faction backs every move made by CJP Isa during his tenure. They had filed complaints of misconduct against Justice Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar in SJC.\nWhen the media buzzed with criticism of the three-judge bench led by CJP Isa's January 13 order on the illegality of PTI intra-party elections, both superior bar representatives demanded government action against those allegedly tarnishing the image of SC judges via a campaign.\nIn response, the government notified a Joint Investigation Team (JIT) to probe the matter, summoning dozens of journalists, including senior court reporters. However, the court reporters express disappointment over the bench's response to JIT notices.\nThe government, in tandem with powerful circles, will wholeheartedly endorse CJP Isa's decisions regarding the accountability of retired judges. If the apex court greenlights the government's ICA, retired judges aligned with ex-CJP Saqib Nisar could face the heat from the SJC led by CJP Isa.The government's support for CJP Isa has not gone unnoticed.\nThe executive is content with the fact that, unlike in the past, PTI has not secured relief from the SC during CJP Isa's tenure. An ideal relationship has been observed among the government, judiciary, and the bar since September of last year.\nIf they remain on the same page, sets the stage for potential trouble for social media activists and retired judges. However, the larger bench may reject the government\u2019s ICA.\nIt is pertinent to note that in an unprecedented move during CJP Qazi Faez Isa's tenure, the conduct of retired CJs has become a subject of open court discussions.\nDuring the hearing of petitions against the Supreme Court Practice and Procedure Act 2023, CJP Isa questioned the judgment of ex-CJP Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry in the Reko Diq case, which led to a multi-billion-dollar fine for the country. However, during the proceedings, Justice Munib Akhtar expressed reservations about scrutinising the conduct of retired CJPs.\nSimilarly, when review petitions against the Faizabad dharna judgement were taken up, CJP Isa had expressed bewilderment about why these review petitions had not been addressed in the past four years.\nIn a recent development, Chief Justice Isa expressed astonishment at the prolonged delay in deciding the elections matter of former deputy speaker of the National Assembly, Qasim Suri, which remained unresolved for four years.\nFormer CJP Bandial had granted a stay in Suri's favour after he was disqualified by the election tribunal. The bench, headed by CJP Isa, subsequently summoned Suri to address this matter.\nPBC member Muneer Kakar, affiliated with the Professional Lawyers Group, has strongly condemned the demand made by SCBA and PBC representatives for action against social media activists critical of CJP Isa.\nHe has questioned why the Independent Group remained silent when judges were being ridiculed during the tenure of ex-CJP Bandial, adding that the bar's approach should not be selective.\n"

            "Text": "Days after China formally accepted a full time Ambassador of Afghanistan under the Taliban regime, President Xi Jinping\u2019s close aide travelled to Islamabad on Friday apparently to take Pakistan into confidence.\nThe Chinese president earlier this week accepted the credentials of Bilal Karimi, a Taliban-appointed ambassador to China. The move was seen as tantamount to recognition of the Afghan Taliban government by Beijing.\nNo country has yet officially recognised the Taliban government since they returned to power in August 2021. But China became the first country to accept its full-time ambassador.\nThough China has not clarified, diplomatic sources and observers believe that the move was a \u201ctacit recognition\u201d of the Afghan Taliban government, which is, otherwise, struggling to convince even neighbours for recognition let alone the Western countries.\nFollowing the development, Chinese Special Envoy on Afghanistan Ambassador Yue Xiaonyoung held meetings with Pakistani authorities, including Foreign Secretary Cyrus Qazi and Additional Foreign Secretary, Afghanistan and West Asia, Ambassador Rahim Hayat Qureshi.\nA statement issued by the Foreign Office said that both sides underscored their commitment to a peaceful and stable Afghanistan and emphasised the need for enhanced coordination for regional stability. \u201cThey also underlined the crucial role of neighbouring countries of Afghanistan for a peaceful, stable and prosperous region,\u201d it added.\nAdditional Foreign Secretary (Afghanistan & West Asia) Ambassador Rahim Hayat Qurehi @rahimhayat today received Chinese Special Envoy on Afghanistan Ambassador Yue Xiaoyong. They underscored their commitment to a peaceful & stable Afghanistan and emphasized the need for enhanced\u2026 pic.twitter.com/WrrmzLzkBs\nNo further details were provided but sources said that the current Chinese move was also part of the discussions. China took Pakistan into confidence about its decision.\nThe sources said that China apparently took a \u201csolo flight\u201d in a disregard to the regional countries\u2019 earlier understanding. They added that regional countries, particularly the immediate neighbours of Afghanistan, decided that the decision to recognise the Taliban government would be taken with consensus and collectively.\nBut, the sources continued, China\u2019s close engagement with Taliban government could enhance its leverage that might help Pakistan in the long-run. China might have accepted a full time Taliban ambassador but the sources said that its concerns regarding Afghanistan being used by terrorist outfits remained.\nChina is particularly worried about the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), which Beijing considers a terrorist outfit, activities in Afghanistan. A recent UN Monitoring Team report revealed that the Afghan Taliban relocated ETIM from Badakhashan to Baghlan province.\nAlso read: Has China formally recognised Taliban govt in Afghanistan?\nHowever, the report noted that the ETIM was active in various parts of Afghanistan and busy recruiting young people. That was the reason that Chinese move to inch a step closer to recognise Taliban came as a surprise for many, including Pakistan.\nThe international community has set certain benchmarks before the Taliban were recognised. Those benchmarks include the inclusive government, permission for girls to go to school and women for work and on top of it no terrorist group would be allowed to operate from Afghan soil.\nBut it seems major players have adopted a more pragmatic approach compelled by their respective strategic interests. The US is also cautiously exploring the possibility of reopening its consulate in Kabul, according to the new strategy approved by the State Department.\nThe US, however, clarified that reopening the diplomatic mission in Kabul did not mean the recognition of the Taliban government.\n"

            "Text": "The buzz around judicial resignations continued on Friday, with another judge from the superior judiciary throwing in the towel, marking the third such departure within a month during Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa's tenure.\nUnder the watchful eye of CJP Isa, the resignation tally has reached three, with two from from the Supreme Court and the latest one hitting the Lahore High Court (LHC).\nJustice Shahid Jameel Khan, performing at the LHC bench since 2014, decided to step down, adding to the recent exits of Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi, both SC judges.\nLahore High Court\u2019s (LHC) Justice Shahid Jamil Khan on Friday tendered his resignation from his office, citing \u201cpersonal circumstances\u201d in which he had decided to \u201cturn the page and start a new chapter\u201d.\n\"I Justice Shahid Jamil Khan, after having served as a Judge of [the] Lahore High Court, Lahore for about 10 years, hereby exercise the option to resign under Article 206(1) of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan 1973, with immediate effect,\" read his resignation letter, which he has reportedly sent to President Dr Arif Alvi.\n\u201cIt was an absolute honour to hold the office, but for personal circumstances I have decided to turn the page and start a new chapter,\u201d the letter added.\nThe judge also added an old proverb \u201cAn ounce of discretion is worth a pound of wit\u201d in the letter \u2013 that means that being discreet and thoughtful in your actions can have greater value and long-term benefits in comparison with relying solely on cleverness.\nJustice Shahid Jamil also drew inspiration from the poetry of Allama Iqbal, incorporating verses into his resignation letter.\nReflecting on the disparity between freedom and servitude, he highlighted the importance of enlightened thinking for those who seek true liberty.\n\u201cAzad Ki Ek Aan Ha Mehkoom Ka Ek Saal, Kis Darja Garan Sair Hain Mehkoom Ke Auqat! [A free man\u02b9s breath can match a subject year, How slowly moves the time of serfs, is clear!] Azad Ka Andesha Haqiqat Se Munawar, Mehkoom Ka Andesha Giraftar-e-Khurafat [The thoughts of persons free with truth are lit, But the thoughts of slaves do not own sense a bit] Mehkoom Ko Peeron Ki Karamat Ka Soda, Hai Banda-e-Azad Khud Ek Zinda Karamat [A slave has craze for marvels wrought by guides, Himself a wonder live, his memory fresh abides] Iqbal! Yahan Naam Na Le Ilm-e-Khudi Ka,\nMozoon Nahin Maktab Ke Liye Aese Maqalat [Iqbal! Don\u2019t talk about the self here, As such sermons are not suitable for schools],\u201d he wrote.\nHowever, sources said that the reasons behind the resignation of the two apex court\u2019s judges differ from the resignation of the LHC judge. There is no apparent nexus between the LHC judge's resignation and the resignations of the other two judges.\nWhen Shahid Jameel Khan contemplated resigning shortly after Ijazul Ahsan's resignation, he was advised to hold off for a couple of weeks, steering clear of creating the impression of a continuous string of resignations.\nShahid Jameel Khan had already decided to submit his resignation, aiming to begin a career in legal practice after serving as an LHC judge for a decade. Despite having the option to serve four more years, he chose to step down.\nRanking as the 11th most senior judge at the LHC, he was known for his expertise in tax matters. He was close to ex-CJP Umar Ata Bandial.\nMeanwhile, sources told The Express Tribune that his disappointment over not being assigned constitutional cases might have played a role in his decision. The situation might have seen a shift following the retirement of the incumbent LHC chief justice, but the judge did not wait to see any changes in this regard.\nSenior lawyers point out that adding complexity to the situation is the mention of Urdu poetry in Shahid Jameel Khan's resignation letter.\nSome who are displeased with CJP Isa's judicial decisions are attributing the LHC judge\u2019s resignation to the current political climate, where the judiciary faces criticism for not providing relief to the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).\nWhile some lawyers demand an inquiry into the reasons behind the resignation of Ijazul Ahsan, others point to elements of judicial politics at play amid swirling speculations and rumours.\nAt a superior bars event on Thursday, CJP Isa expressed his astonishment upon learning about Justice Ijazul Ahsan's resignation.\nIt has been reported that the vice chairman of the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) raised concerns about the credibility of LHC judges during his speech.\n"

            "Text": "Pakistan\u2019s inflation rate slightly moderated to 28.3% in January 2024 but prices in all groups of commodities showed a double-digit rise, an outcome of frequent increases in energy prices to meet conditions of the International Monetary Fund\u2019s (IMF) loan programme and supply disruptions.\nThe 28.3% inflation was in line with the projection of the Ministry of Finance, which a day earlier significantly raised its old forecast. The interim government too is leaving behind a high inflation as general elections are slated for February 8 after which a new government will take over.\nFor many years, forecasts of the federal government and the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) have proved incorrect. Now, price stability is the primary objective of the central bank after it was granted autonomy two years ago under an IMF deal.\nPakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) reported a slight moderation in inflation, both in urban and rural areas. But the inflation was still higher than the two-month-old projection, which both the central bank and the finance ministry later revised upwards.\nLast month, prices of food and energy items increased further in both rural and urban areas. On the back of an alarming surge of up to 520% in gas prices during the first round, the overall inflation kept soaring across the country. It increased to 30.2% in cities and to 25.7% in rural areas.\nNon-food inflation eased to 32.3% in urban areas and to 26.3% in rural areas, though it was still very high. Commodities like wheat flour, rice, tea, sugar, beverages, potatoes and pluses saw a significant increase in their prices last month compared to a year ago.\nFood inflation decelerated in both cities and rural areas. In urban centres, it slowed down to 27.4% while in villages and towns, it eased to 25.1%.\nPeople\u2019s purchasing power has taken a hit due to a constant double-digit increase in prices of essential and durable goods. Successive governments have also significantly increased the tax burden, particularly on the salaried class.\nThe interim government increased prices of electricity and gas under the IMF deal, which kept overall prices high. PBS bulletin showed that gas got expensive by 520% while electricity charges surged 71% in January compared to a year ago.\nRead Inflation to stay at 28.5% despite \u2018economic stabilisation\u2019\nHowever, the core inflation, which does not include energy and food items, eased to 17.8% in urban areas and 24.6% in rural areas. It is still above the central bank\u2019s policy rate of 22%.\nFormer SBP Governor Dr Reza Baqir had agreed with the IMF that Pakistan would set the policy rate in line with the general inflation by delinking it from the core indicator. As a result, the central bank has not been able to slash the policy rate despite a slowdown in the core inflation.\nThis has massively increased the cost of interest payments on loans, which is now more than the federal government\u2019s net income.\nThere was a double-digit increase in prices of all 12 groups of commodities monitored by the PBS. Prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages went up 25% in January compared to a year ago. Non-perishable goods got dearer by 24% while perishable goods saw a surge of 31%.\nThe inflation rate for the consumer transport group rose 26% despite a reduction in fuel prices. However, the finance ministry on Thursday announced an increase of Rs13 per litre in the price of petrol while reversing the downward trend.\nThe government and the central bank are again set to miss their annual inflation target of 21%. PBS reported that for the July-January period of the current fiscal year, the average inflation stood at 28.7%. It was far higher than the official target of 21%.\nAverage inflation in rural areas was 29.3% for the first seven months whereas it was 28.3% in urban areas. The central bank\u2019s hopes that the inflation rate would dip below 20% on the back a higher reading during the second half of last fiscal year have once again been dashed. The government has also agreed with the IMF on a further increase in gas prices with effect from February.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 2nd, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

            "Text": "The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) has experienced a tumultuous ride, mirroring the frenzy leading up to the upcoming general elections. The once-positive election fervour has morphed into election anxiety, temporarily shattering short-term business confidence, despite the prevailing promising medium-to-long-term outlook.\nThe KSE 100 Index, a benchmark for PSX, witnessed a remarkable 27% surge since the announcement of the election date in the first week of November 2023. Scaling unprecedented heights, it peaked at over 67,000 in mid-December 2023.\nScheduled for the next week on February 8, 2024, the parliamentary polls initially ignited a rally fuelled by optimism surrounding early signs of economic recovery and the anticipated substantial rise in low-priced stocks across the board. However, as the year 2023 drew to a close, investors chose to sell stocks to secure profits. Unfortunately, this trend failed to be accompanied by renewed buying, leading to an almost 8% decline from the all-time high. The index hit a one-month low at 61,842 points on January 30, 2024.\n\n\u00a0\nIn a conversation with The Express Tribune, Muhammad Awais Ashraf, Director of Research at Akseer Securities, pointed out that election uncertainty is unsettling investor sentiments, temporarily impacting business confidence and contributing to the downturn of the PSX index.\nHe highlighted the crucial role of the electorate, urging the nation to vote for the formation of a robust political government at both the central and provincial levels. He stressed that a strong government, secured through winning a majority of seats, is essential to implementing the necessary economic reforms. Conversely, a weaker coalition government or a hung parliament he said would be inadequate for steering the economy, entering into a new IMF loan programme, and addressing the promising future. A weak government, he argued, could exacerbate pre-election uncertainty.\nDirector of Research at Chase Securities, Yousuf M Farooq shared an optimistic outlook, stating that the end of political uncertainty would spur renewed buying. He highlighted the continued rise in sale revenue and net profit of listed companies.\nPolitical uncertainty escalated following the sentencing of former Prime Minister and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf founding Chairman Imran Khan to a 10-year jail term in a cypher case, leading to extended sales at PSX.\n\n\u00a0\nFarooq clarified that political uncertainty is just one of the contributing factors to the recent correction in the bourse. Other factors include extended foreign selling over the past few days and the State Bank of Pakistan maintaining a record-high policy rate of 22% for the next six weeks.\nFitch Ratings, a globally renowned credit rating agency, reported last week that most frontier market nations, including Pakistan, are set to hold general elections in 2024. The agency observed a slowdown in reform momentum leading up to elections, with Asia-Pacific\u2019s GDP growth (including Pakistan) expected to outperform other regions amid a global economic slowdown.\nSeveral local research houses anticipated a 25-30% growth in the benchmark index in late November and early December 2023. They projected the PSX to reach somewhere in the range of 75,000-81,000 points by the end of the current calendar year 2024, up from the levels of around 60,000 points.\nRead Bulls take charge over election timing clarity\nDespite the recent return of sharp volatility, these research houses maintained their projections for the year, anticipating that the rally would resume and reach the projected levels post-elections.\nPSX AND ELECTION HISTORY\nArif Habib Limited, Head of Research, Tahir Abbas reiterated the necessity of political stability for economic growth and its reflections in the PSX.\nReflecting on the historical context, Abbas stated that elections impact the capital market based on the provided pre-election situation, economic roadmap, and policies given by new governments.\nComparing the past four general elections in the country since 2002, Abbas noted that the PSX declined before and after the 2018 elections, while it grew before and after the prior three elections.\nIn the three months before the last polls held in 2018, the PSX declined by 9%, dropping by another 8.8% in the three months after PTI came into power through the elections. The market witnessed a significant 21% decline in the one year post the 2018 election, marked by political polarisation and protests impacting the market in both pre and post-election periods.\nContrastingly, the benchmark KSE 100 Index increased by 15% in the three months before the 2013 elections, surging by 16% in the three months after the election when the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz formed the government. The market experienced a notable 41.5% surge in the one year post the 2013 elections.\nBefore the 2008 election, the PSX went up by 8% in the three months leading to the election but declined by 1% in the three months post the election when the Pakistan People\u2019s Party formed the government. In the one-year period post the elections, the market slumped by 59.3%, influenced by the historical financial crisis of 2008.\nRead more Political, security fears drive PSX down\nIn 2002, the market saw an 18% increase in the three months before the election, followed by another 32% surge in the three months post the elections. It spiked by 97% in the one-year period post the elections.\nAbbas expressed confidence in the market\u2019s upward trajectory post the 2024 elections. He believed that the next government, regardless of its composition, would provide a solid economic roadmap. Additionally, stocks are still available at attractive prices.\nIn December 2023, the benchmark index hit a record high at over 67,000 points, though majority share prices were still below their historical peak prices, presenting attractive buying opportunities, he said.\nTo recap, the market surged by almost 15% net since November 8, 2023, three months ahead of the February 8 election.\nPOPULAR SLOGANS VS INFLATION\nTopline Research provided a detailed commentary on the 2024 election, highlighting that major parties are not adequately addressing key economic challenges. Instead, they focus more on popular measures to gain public confidence amid record-high inflation.\nInvestors are keenly interested in whether the new government will secure a majority or if it will form a weak coalition government. According to Topline Research, if one party secures 50% plus seats, it would boost investors\u2019 confidence, leading to positive market reactions and signalling positively to the International Monetary Fund and other lenders.\nConversely, a coalition government with the support of smaller parties is predicted to remain fragile and may struggle to implement much-needed economic reforms.\nThe recovery of the Pakistan Stock market is expected to continue in 2024. Projections indicate that the benchmark KSE-100 total return index will reach 75,000 by December 2024. Key drivers for equities in 2024 include a smooth transfer of power to the new government after elections, a new long-term funding programme from the IMF, and an expected fall in interest rates.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 2nd, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

Their recommendations include introducing a customised low-cost financing scheme, evolving an urban and consistent industrial policy, revamping crumbling road infrastructure, and implementing a one-window operation, among other initiatives.\nSpeaking to the Express Tribune about expectations from the upcoming elected government after the 2024 general poll, business leaders stressed the need for a customised low-cost financing scheme specifically for the construction of industrial units in the small and medium-sized sector. They highlighted the significance of SMEs as the backbone of any country.\nPresident of the Site Association of Industry (SAI), Muhammad Kamran Arbi, stressed the importance of proper utility services for industrial operations. He called for the upcoming government to address utility issues, including gas, electricity, and water, with regionally competitive rates and improved services to support economic growth. Arbi suggested the establishment of a mechanism for a one-window operation to streamline interactions with the more than 65 federal and provincial departments that impact industrialists, traders, and investors throughout the year.\nHe also underscored the promotion of e-commerce to save time and transportation costs, facilitating ease of doing business. He urged the government to ensure law and order in Karachi and promptly establish an urban and consistent industrial policy with input from all stakeholders, especially industrialists, to address industry challenges on a top priority basis.\nAnother prominent industrialist, Salahuddin Qureshi, called for a comprehensive revamping of the road infrastructure in all industrial zones of Sindh, including Karachi and Hyderabad. Poor road conditions contribute to increased transportation costs, affecting productivity. Qureshi suggested emulating successful models, like Bangladesh\u2019s planning commission, for swift issue resolution. He urged the newly-elected government to follow similar initiatives to enhance exports, control inflation, generate jobs, and ensure facilities for local industrialists and investors.\nRead\u00a0Karachi\u2019s industrialists pin hopes for revival on 2024\nQureshi specifically called for supplying electricity and allocating an Express Feeder for Sindh small industries in Phase-II on Tando Mohammad Khan road. He also highlighted the importance of giving possession to an industrial plot spreading 300 acres of land allotted in 2007 in SITE Hyderabad. He pleaded for the government to provide maximum facilities for local investors and industrialists, encouraging public-private partnerships in rural areas to eliminate poverty and generate employment.\nPresident of the Federal B Area Association of Trade and Industries (FBATI), Syed Raza Hussain, proposed a financing scheme of up to Rs500 million through commercial banks, with a favourable markup rate of 5\u20136% over 20 years. This scheme aims to encourage small and medium-sized entrepreneurs to construct industrial units, focusing on domestic and export markets. The emphasis is on construction activities to accelerate economic activities in major cities, preventing the loss of precious foreign exchange through machinery imports.\nHussain highlighted that the financing scheme would revive growth in allied sectors, generate employment, and contribute additional revenues through taxes. He urged the government to introduce an easy markup scheme for local brands and SMEs, enhancing economic activities across the country and curbing imports of foreign brands that burden the current account and foreign exchange reserves.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 2nd, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

of Sanaullah to the party.\nShe said, \"We tagged him as 'Hakeem Sanaullah', who prudently tackled the situation by promoting unity among the PML-N cadres.\"\nShe said that when Sanaullah was implicated in a fake drug-smuggling case, she went to see him.\nHe was wearing a mask marked with the symbol of tiger.\nWhen asked, Sanaullah replied that if he was only two per cent with Nawaz, after that case, he was turned into a man 1,000 times with Nawaz because of the oppressive and illegal act of the ruling party \u2013 PTI.\nShe said that the people of Faisalabad fully honoured the commitment of Sanaullah by making the gathering a historic one.\n\"It seems that the people still love Nawaz Sharif, as he was always among them,\" she added. \u201cWe believe in the politics of

If you have to stop the tiger and you do not want to see Nawaz as the PM for a fourth time, then vote for the PPP.\u201d\nIn response to the PML-N\u2019s criticism over the PPP\u2019s governance in Sindh, Bilawal questioned how many times Shehbaz Sharif or Maryam Nawaz visited Sindh.\n\u201cShehbaz Sharif became the PM and how many times did he visit Sindh. Nawaz is going to become the PM for the fourth time but how many times did he visit.\u201d\nHe maintained that a perception had been generated that other provinces lagged behind Punjab in terms of development.\nAlso read: Bilawal vows to resolve missing persons issue\n\u201cAs if the two brothers are flowing canals of milk and honey in Punjab and their all roads are made of gold and their educational institutions have a standard higher than the Oxford University.\u201d\nHe said he was fighting the general elections from Lahore and had witnessed that the ground realities there were no different from the rest of the country.\nOn the Jamaat-e-Islami\u2019s criticism of the PPP, he responded that the JI was in search of a dictator like late Gen Ziaul Haq because they \u201cknow that only a dictator can make them a part of the government.\u201d\n\u201cThe people haven\u2019t yet forgiven the JI\u2019s mistake of supporting Ziaul Haq.\u201d\n\u0634\u06a9\u0627\u0631\u067e\u0648\u0631 \u06a9\u06d2 \u0639\u0648\u0627\u0645 \u0646\u06d2 \u067e\u0627\u06a9\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u067e\u06cc\u067e\u0644\u0632 \u067e\u0627\u0631\u0679\u06cc \u06a9\u06d2 \u062d\u0642 \u0645\u06cc\u06ba \u0627\u067e\u0646\u0627 \u0641\u06cc\u0635\u0644\u06c1 \u0633\u0646\u0627 \u062f\u06cc\u0627\u06d4@BBhuttoZardari #\u0686\u0646\u0648_\u0646\u0626\u06cc_\u0633\u0648\u0686_\u06a9\u0648 pic.twitter.com/Es2GNASnOl\nBilawal said parties like the JI and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan wanted to divide the people in the name of religion and ethnicity unlike the PPP.\nHe claimed that six attacks had been carried out on the PPP\u2019s candidates in Balochistan.\nHe questioned the efficacy of the ongoing security operation in that province, saying that the way in which the ordinary people and political activists were being targeted in the name of law and order could not be condoned.\n\u201cI want all political parties to form a code of conduct after these elections so that politics can be done within the ambit of political norms and not personal revenge. This is necessary also for earning legitimacy for the electoral process in which no one is barred or impeded from the contesting.\u201d\nAlso read: Hard to vote for PML-N, we'll form own govt: Bilawal\nOn the visit of Iranian Foreign Minister to Pakistan, he expressed his wish to see the security and terrorism challenges confronting the two countries resolved in an amicable way.\nHe also desired to complete the Pak-Iran gas pipeline project which he said was a dream of his father, former president Asif Zardari.\nThe PPP chairman said when he was the country\u2019s foreign minister, he opened border markets so that the people living in the two countries along the borders could prosper.\n\u0634\u06a9\u0627\u0631\u067e\u0648\u0631 \u06a9\u06d2 \u063a\u06cc\u0648\u0631 \u0639\u0648\u0627\u0645 \u0646\u06d2 \u06c1\u0645\u0627\u0631\u06d2 \u0639\u0648\u0627\u0645\u06cc \u0645\u0639\u0627\u0634\u06cc \u0645\u0639\u0627\u06c1\u062f\u06d2 \u06a9\u06d2 \u062d\u0642 \u0645\u06cc\u06ba \u0627\u067e\u0646\u0627 \u0641\u06cc\u0635\u0644\u06c1 \u0633\u0646\u0627 \u062f\u06cc\u0627\u060c \u0622\u0626\u06cc\u06ba \u0645\u06c1\u0646\u06af\u0627\u0626\u06cc\u060c \u063a\u0631\u0628\u062a \u0627\u0648\u0631 \u0628\u06cc\u0631\u0648\u0632\u06af\u0627\u0631\u06cc \u06a9\u0627 \u0645\u0642\u0627\u0628\u0644\u06c1 \u06a9\u0631\u0646\u06d2 \u0645\u06cc\u06ba \u06c1\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0627 \u0633\u0627\u062a\u06be \u062f\u06cc\u06ba \u0627\u0648\u0631 8 \u0641\u0631\u0648\u0631\u06cc \u06a9\u0648 \u062a\u06cc\u0631 \u06a9\u06d2 \u0646\u0634\u0627\u0646 \u067e\u0631 \u0645\u06c1\u0631 \u0644\u06af\u0627\u0626\u06cc\u06ba\u06d4@BBhuttoZardari #\u0686\u0646\u0648_\u0646\u0626\u06cc_\u0633\u0648\u0686_\u06a9\u0648 #ShikarpurWithBilawal pic.twitter.com/u1zAlNFrV6\nHe emphasised the need for simplifying trade and tourism relations with Iran as a long-term measure.\n"

He questioned the wisdom of the people in K-P for supporting Imran despite the achievements of his government.\n\u201cIf there was Nawaz Sharif\u2019s government here, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa would have been the most beautiful province.\n"

            "Text": "Although this season\u2019s first snowfall ended the prolonged dry spell in Murree, it also brought about significant disruptions to the traffic system on the highways between Wednesday and Thursday night, prompting authorities to scramble to avoid any untoward situation. The popular hill resort received around 8.5 inches of snow over a short period, drawing a significant number of tourists.\nAccording to sources, the district administration, law enforcement, and relief agencies collaborated to manage the situation and ensure the smooth flow of traffic. All tourist entry points, including Satra Meel in the federal capital, were closed overnight, impacting thousands of vehicles.\nThe Meteorological Department forecasted intermittent rain and snowfall until February 4. Approximately 4,000 vehicles entered and 1,800 exited Murree during the snowfall, causing congestion and stranding vehicles on the roadways from 8pm to 12:30am on Wednesday. The district administration, city traffic police, and Rescue 1122 Murree jointly worked to clear the expressway, successfully restoring traffic after 1am.\nFollowing the snowfall, the picturesque landscape of Murree, adorned with a thick layer of snow on roads and trees, provided a visual treat for tourists. The local administration and municipal bodies promptly initiated road-clearing operations after the snowfall ceased. However, dissatisfaction was expressed by Murree Deputy Commissioner Agha Zaheer Abbas Shirazi when he visited the express highway, pointing out the National Highway Authority's alleged delay in utilising suitable equipment for snow clearance.\nTo manage the influx of visitors and ensure safety, entrance to Murree was restricted for travellers, except for its residents who were allowed after verifying their identity cards. A considerable volume of traffic entered and left Murree during the 24 hours, contributing to the challenges faced by the city's traffic police and administration. An advisory issued by the City Traffic Police and the Murree DC urged visitors to check weather forecasts and adhere to guidelines provided by the district administration.\nAmidst these challenges, visitors also raised concerns about fleecing in the name of parking. A visitor from Multan reported paying Rs1,800 for covered parking, only to find his vehicle stranded in the open snow upon return. The tourism department registered the complaint and pledged to take appropriate action against those responsible, highlighting ongoing issues faced by tourists in the region.\nMore snow expected\nThe Meteorological Department has forecasted additional rains and snowfall in various hilly regions, including Murree, Galiyat, Naran, and Kaghan, over the next 24 hours.\nThis weather update comes with a cautionary advisory for tourists and relevant departments to remain vigilant.\nOn Wednesday, the upper regions of Punjab, KP, and Gilgit Baltistan experienced continuous rain and snowfall. The forecast until February 4 predicts moderate to heavy rain and snowfall, raising concerns about potential landslides and road closures in Murree, Galiyat, Dir, Swat, Kohistan, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Shangla, Astor, Hunza, Skardu, Neelum Valley, Bagh, Poonch, and Havelian.\nTourists have been urged to exercise caution during this period.\nWednesday night saw cloudy conditions with gusty winds, thundershowers, and rain and snowfall on mountains in Gilgit-Baltistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Kashmir, Islamabad, and the Potohar region. Heavy rain and snowfall are anticipated in certain locations in Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan, Murree, Galiyat, and Upper Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, with the possibility of hailstorms in some places. Cold weather persisted in other parts of the country, with fog reported in specific areas of southwestern Punjab and upper Sindh. Islamabad and its surroundings are expected to be partly cloudy with strong winds and thundershowers.\nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa, including Chitral, Dir, Swat, Kohistan, Shangla, Bunir, Malakand, Abbottabad, Balakot, Mansehra, Haripur, Swabi, Peshawar, Mardan, Charsadda, and Nowshera, may experience strong winds, thundershowers, and mountain snowfall. Most districts in the Punjab province will encounter cold weather, with the upper districts expecting partly cloudy conditions. Rainfall accompanied by strong winds and thundershowers is predicted for Attock, Rawalpindi, Chakwal, Jhelum, Mandi Bahauddin, Gujarat, Gujranwala, Hafizabad, Lahore, Kasur, Sialkot, Narowal, Jhang, and Faisalabad. Additionally, fog is a potential concern in Bahawalpur, Bahawalnagar, Okara, Multan, Khanpur, Rahimyar Khan, Dera Ghazi Khan, and nearby areas.\n"

The mobile services were suspended because the terror attack was \"not a suicide attack, but a device bomb attached to a motorcycle\".\nThe minister highlighted the necessity of such measures for the protection of human lives, stating: \"These actions were crucial for ensuring the safety of individuals.\" Furthermore, he reported that \"there were 56 incidents on the day of the election, and there were intelligence reports of terrorist incidents taking place.\"\nEijaz said that \"February 8 was a challenging day\" as he referenced the terrorist incidents of February 7 in which 26 people were martyred. In light of the Qilla Saifullah incident, he said, \"We decided to close mobile signals\" in a high-level meeting.\nHe acknowledged the difficulty of the decision, saying, \"It was not an easy decision to close mobile signals\", justifying it as one taken to \"secure lives\".\nExpressing pride in the security forces, he posed the question, \"Shouldn't we be proud of our security forces?\"\nThe minister stated, \" 56 incidents occurred despite mobile signals being off, in which the Pakistan Army and police personnel were martyred.\" Additionally, he said, \"As the sitting government we have to protect lives.\"\nThe caretaker minister paid tribute to the fallen security personnel, stating, \"We salute the Pakistani forces' personnel who gave their lives yesterday.\" He concluded that \"All institutions collaborated to conduct a peaceful election. We have many enemies who attacked us. The election result is in front of you. It is the voice of the nation.\"\n\"As per our commitment, the caretaker government conducted elections, and the process of receiving results is ongoing,\" stated Information Minister Murtaza Solangi.\nSolangi said, \"We the voters of Pakistan should choose the future ruler.\" He also underscored the overall \"peaceful\" nature of the election and the caretaker government's commitment to ensuring a tranquil electoral process.\nCellular services suspension\nPakistan witnessed a countrywide shutdown of internet and cellular phone services a day earlier during the polling process with the authorities attributing the move \"to maintain law and order\" in the wake of the violence that occurred a day earlier.\nHowever, the suspension was denounced by Amnesty International, which described it as a \u201creckless attack on people\u2019s rights\u201d, as well as experts and political stakeholders, particularly the PTI, a political party that relied heavily on social media platforms for its electoral campaign.\n\"It has been decided to temporarily suspend mobile services across the country,\" an interior ministry spokesman said in a statement.\n"

Official sources claimed that the initiative was taken by the protesters, when they attacked a security camp in the area.\nHowever, the protesters maintained that the police personnel stationed near the stadium gate opened fire on them, in which three of them were killed -- Ayub Wazir, Wahab Khan Dawar, and Wahabullah.\nThe injured protesters were first shifted to Miran Shah Hospital and then Bannu. The NDM chief was shifted to Peshawar, where sources said his condition was out of danger.\nRead Dawar's convoy escapes attack in North Waziristan\nAfter the incident, the situation in the entire area became tense, while JUI-F candidate Mufti Misbahuddin's victory from NA-40 was also announced.\nNDM supporters have blocked roads in various areas against the incident, affecting the flow of vehicular traffic.\nBefore the incident, Dawar had shared a post on social media platform X that he was leading the polls as per the latest results received in his constituency NA-40 but there were \u201cblatant attempts\u201d to rig the final results. He claimed that 27 presiding officers were being held hostage at Shewa Qila and FC personnel were forcing them to sign a blank Form-45.\nTaking to X after the firing, NDM leader Bushra Gohar held the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) responsible for the attack.\nAfrasiab Khattak, another NDM leader, maintained that the law-enforcement agencies opened fire on Dawar and the other protesters.\nBNP-M chief Sardar Akhtar Mengal also condemned the attack on Dawar in post on X, maintaining that it was carried out to change the results.\nPPP leader Farhatullah Babar in post on X demanded a probe into the attack on the NDM chief.\nHe further called for punishing the \u201ctrigger happy\u201d police personnel, who had fired the gunshots at the protesters.\nThe K-P Bar Council also condemned the murderous attack on Dawar, saying that unrest was increasing in the country, raising a question mark on the performance of security agencies.\nSeparately, one person was killed and two injured in a bomb blast near the residence of newly elected PTI-backed independent MNA Zubair Wazir, who won from NA-42, in the Karikot area of Wana tehsil, Lower South Waziristan district.\nThe person, who died in the attack, has been identified as Hayatullah.

Moreover, over three dozen PTI workers were taken into police custody.\n\nThe unrest unfolded in the aftermath of Thursday's elections when the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) declared Ameer Muqam, a senior leader of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), as the victor.\n\nAccording to unofficial results, Ameer Muqam emerged triumphant in the National Assembly constituency NA-11, clinching victory with a total of 59,863 votes, while Fareen trailed Muqam, amassing 54,311 votes.\n\nInfuriated by what they alleged to be rigging, the PTI-backed candidate\u2019s supporters took to the streets demanding a recount and the submission of Form 45.\n\nThe situation escalated as violent protests erupted, causing gridlock on the Alpuri-Basham main highway from 6 am onwards. The PTI-backed independent candidate and other party leaders formally announced a sit-in, addressing the crowd.\nAt around 4 o'clock, the protesters headed towards the District Returning Officer but faced resistance from the police, leading to a violent clash with stone pelting, tear gas and shelling.\n\nThe Alpuri Main Chowk transformed into a battlefield, with the Assistant Returning Officer's car set ablaze by the protestors.\nThere were also protests against allegedly rigged results in Peshawar and Quetta.\n\nThe PTI released a video of the incident, asserting that four of its members succumbed to gunshot wounds inflicted by the police.\n\n\"Our results have been changed,\" claimed 28-year-old shopkeeper Muhammad Saleem, who joined around 2,000 PTI supporters marching in Peshawar.\n\n\"The government should recount all of our votes.\"\n\nIn response to the heightened tensions, the police took control of Alpuri, implementing strict checks at entry and exit points to maintain order and security.\n\n"

They also vandalized and set fire to memorials and other properties.\nIn July of the same year, a high-level joint investigation team (JIT) decided to nominate the former premier in two terrorism cases, including one related to the attack on the GHQ. Additional sections were added to the cases, charging the PTI leader with plotting and incitement to violence.\nIn total, Imran was implicated in 12 different cases related to the May 9 rioting. Shah Mahmood Qureshi faced accusations in 13 such cases, while Sheikh Rashid was named in one rioting case. These politicians later filed separate bail applications in these cases.\nRead Imran arrested in GHQ attack case\nDuring Saturday's hearing, Judge Asif expressed extreme displeasure at the absence of public prosecutors. He adjourned the court for an hour, directing the prosecutors to appear immediately for arguments.\nWhen the court resumed, the prosecutors were still absent. The judge then ordered the investigation officers (IOs) to present case details and respond to court questions. However, the IOs failed to provide satisfactory answers.\nSubsequently, the judge granted bail to Imran in all 12 cases upon submission of a surety bond worth Rs100,000 for each case. Qureshi was granted bail in all 13 cases upon submission of a bond worth Rs100,000 for each case, while Rashid was granted bail upon submission of a bond worth Rs200,000.\nIn its written order, the court noted that the accused were not initially named in the original First Information Reports (FIRs). Their names were added to the reports four to five months after the rioting incidents. The court stated that there was evidently no evidence against the accused.\nThe court also observed that while many accused in such cases were out on bail, there was no justification for detaining the accused politicians.\nImran Khan was recently convicted in three different cases, while Qureshi was sentenced to 10 years in prison in the cipher case. The bail relief, however, will not result in their immediate release from prison. Nevertheless, Sheikh Rashid was released from jail following the court's order.\n\u00a0\n"

The party however, won one remaining seat from there. In the five divisions, the party lost 9 provincial assembly seats, compared to 14 losses in 2018 elections.\nFour of the candidates who could succeed against the PPP were the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI)-backed independents, three belonged to Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) and two to the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA).\nThe Mirpurkhas division, with 5 national and 11 provincial assembly seats turned up as the strongest electoral fortress for the party with no defeat. In the 25-seat Larkana division and 19-seat Nawabshah division, the PPP lost just one constituency each.\nOut of 41 constituencies in Hyderabad division, the PPP's candidates were trounced only on six seats, all in Hyderabad district \u2013 one of the nine districts in the division. Three seats were also lost in Sukkur division which consists of 21 constituencies.\nThe PPP also won on five National Assembly constituencies in Jacobabad, Shikarpur, Ghotki, Mirpurkhas and Badin districts, which were won by the PTI, GDA and one independent in the 2018 elections.\nThe party caused upsets for the GDA in Sanghar and Khairpur districts, which had been considered as strongholds of Pir Pagara Syed Sibghatullah Rashdi, who heads the alliance. The GDA managed to secure one seat each from the two districts against its five provincial assembly seats in 2018.\nThe big shock surfaced in Badin, where Dr Zulfiqar Mirza and Dr Fehmida Mirza, whose sons and supported candidates could not defend their previous victories. Besides the Arbabs of Tharparkar, the Jatois of Naushehroferoze, the Abbassis of Larkana and the Syeds of Mirpurkhas were also vanquished.\nRead: Independent springs surprise against PPP\nThe Jamaat-e-Ulema-Islam-Fazl also put up a strong fight in some constituencies in Jacobabad, Kashmore-Kandhkot, Shikarpur, Kambar-Shahdadkot and Sukkur. But, its candidates could not secure success.\nHowever, despite such a massive inroad, the PPP did confront setbacks on at least in two provincial constituencies in Jacobabad and Ghotki districts. It lost its seat, PS-3 Jacobabad III, to PTI's independent candidate Mumtaz Hussain Khan and PS-19 Ghotki II to independent candidate Nadir Akmal Laghari.\nApart from the conquests and defeats, there were constituencies which witnessed very close competitions in terms of the results.\nThe PPP's Ali Jan Mazari was declared winner on NA-191 Jacobabad-cum-Kashmore with a margin of over 3,000 votes against his JUI-F's opponent Shahzain Khan who was polled 100,652 votes.\nFormer Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) chairperson Shazia Marri of the PPP received 156,002 votes in NA-209 Sanghar, against 139,604 votes of GDA\u2019s Muhammad Khan Junejo.\nPPP's Mahesh Kumar Malani and GDA's Arbab Ghulam Rahim, a former chief minister of Sindh, also had a massive fight in NA-215 Tharparkar with the former getting 132,061 votes and the latter 113,346 votes.\nSimilar, electoral battle was seen between PPP's Makhdoom Jameeluz Zaman and PML-N's Bashir Memon, a former director general of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on NA-216 Matiari and between PPP's Irfan Ali Laghari and GDA's Liaquat Ali Jatoi on NA-227 Dadu.\nDynasty's victories\nPPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, Co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari and his sisters Faryal Talpur and Azra Afzal Pechuho were all elected on their respective seats with a large margin. Bilawal was polled 135,112 votes on NA-194 Larkana and 85,370 votes on NA-196 Qambar-Shahdadkot. His opponents from the JUI-F received 35,311 and 34,499 votes, respectively, on the two seats.\nSimilarly, Zardari secured 146,989 votes against PTI-supported independent candidate Sardar Sher Muhammad Rind Baloch's 51,916 votes on NA-207 in Benazirabad district. Faryal Talpur received 85,917 votes in PS-10 Larkana and Azra Pechuho secured 75,260 votes in PS-36 Benazirabad.\n\u00a0\nMQM-P vs PTI\nThe battle between the two parties unfolded only in Hyderabad district. However, MQM ended up winning two National Assembly and three provincial assembly seats, giving only one provincial constituency to a PTI-backed independent candidate, according to RO's results.\nThe results of the MQM\u2019s victory in NA-219, NA-220 and PS-64 were announced late on Friday night, around 30 hours after the end of the polling process.\nKarachi Division\nThe MQM appeared as the largest party with 12 National Assembly seats in Karachi, with a clean sweep in the Central and Korangi districts. The PPP got six of 18 seats in Karachi division. Similarly, with 20 provincial assembly seats, the MQM was leading in the city.\n"

            "Text": "Amidst the challenges faced by the auto industry, several local companies have embarked on diversification strategies to mitigate losses and tap into new revenue streams.\nWith the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent import bans, numerous companies within the auto sector, also known as the engineering industry, have pivoted towards manufacturing a diverse range of products to serve both national interests and their own profitability.\nSpeaking to The Express Tribune, Auto Sector Expert and Pakistan Association of Automotive Parts and Accessories Manufacturers (PAAPAM) former chairman and Director of Mehran Commercial Enterprises, Mashood Khan said, \u201cThey can deploy their resources--- existing technologies to reduce the swelling import bill and develop local products while benefiting locals and the country. We should continue the diversification process and form a cluster of Small Medium-Sized Enterprises with a view to manufacturing a host of products and try our best to make brands from within the country catering to both the local and international markets.\u201d\nHe said the auto industry, which is, in fact, an arm of the engineering industry, has been operational for more than 35 years, and can utilise its machinery and expertise to help various industries such as textile, pharmaceuticals, leather, chemical, and others by building small machines (or parts) that are currently being imported. He cautioned, however, that the industry may continue to face challenges in 2024 as it struggled with operations disruptions in the preceding year.\nOne such company that has successfully diversified is the Alsons Group, boasting over 70 years of experience in precision engineering and manufacturing experience in the automotive, aerospace, defence items, energy, oil-cum-gas, lighting, and medical device industries of the country.\n\u201cDiversification is imperative as the automotive industry continues to experience fluctuations. While our core business revolves around auto parts, we\u2019re expanding our product range to mitigate losses and cater to high-demand innovative products,\u201d stated Akbar Allana, Director of Alsons Group.\n\nRead Auto industry anticipates sales boost post elections\nHe said now the group has been manufacturing defence items, a complete range of lighting products, auto parts, various assemblies, fixtures CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) medical devices, state-of-the-art electro-mechanical ventilator including a range of ventilation, auto lock, accuracy, user-friendly, waveforms display, touchscreen LCD, trolley, and humidifier option.\nHe explained that initially established as a clock manufacturing company in 1953, the company ventured into producing timing devices and artillery fuses after being approached by the Pakistan Army in 1965. By the late 1960s and early 1970s, it had fully transitioned into diversifying its product range.\nThe group has since become a key supplier of defence products to Pakistan Ordnance Factories (POF) and has expanded its reach globally, exporting to countries including Germany, France, Switzerland, Spain, Belgium, and others. Its exports are valued at approximately $6 to $7 million annually.\nSimilarly, Sherani Engineering, a company with three decades of experience, has diversified into manufacturing welding jigs, armoured vehicle jigs, molds, and machine fixtures, among other products.\nDirector Saad Sherani of Sherani Engineering highlighted the pivotal role his company plays in meeting the demands of both local and international markets with a diverse product range. Additionally, he outlined the company's expansion into manufacturing jigs for Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), thus enhancing its portfolio. Sherani Engineering also specializes in producing dies, molds, and fixtures for both internal and external clients, further solidifying its position as a versatile industry leader.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 10th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

            "Text": "In the aftermath of the electoral storm that swept through Thursday's general elections, leaving behind allegations of pre-poll trickery and delayed results, PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif put on a brave face by claiming a victory even though the final results were still awaited on Friday, that shows a lack of democratic spirit.\nThe former premier extended an olive branch, pledging to accept the mandate bestowed upon all parties and independent candidates, ushering in a spirit of cooperation as uncertainty reigned the political landscape.\nIn a strategic move, Nawaz unveiled plans to build a coalition, nominating key figures of his party former prime minister Shehbaz Sharif and Ishaq Dar to engage the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) and other smaller groups, mainly the component parties that were allies in the previous 16-month term of PDM to form a coalition government with his party at the forefront.\nHowever, his optimistic vision clashes with the stark reality portrayed by the Election Commission of Pakistan's (ECP) dashboard, which paints a different picture of electoral outcomes.\nIndependent candidates, an overwhelming majority of them backed by PTI, dominate the tally, and questions arise regarding PML-N's ability to secure a majority to form a government.\nEven three hours after Nawaz Sharif\u2019s \u201cvictory\u201d speech (at 11pm), independents were leading the table with 96 seats followed by PML-N\u2019s 66 and PPP\u2019s 51 followed by other smaller parties while results on 29 National Assembly constituencies were still waiting.\nSharif's apparent omission from the prime ministerial candidacy further underscores the intricate web of legal, constitutional, and political complexities awaiting resolution in the post-election phase.\nOne thing became abundantly clear amid the uncertainty surrounding PML-N: the prospect of forming a government independently was simply out of reach, given their lack of a single majority. It was evident that they would need to forge alliances with other parties to cobble together a governing coalition, if at all possible.\nFurthermore, Nawaz Sharif's speech hinted at a significant shift in ambitions within PML-N. The notion of him vying for the coveted position of Prime Minister for a fourth term, a cornerstone of the party's election campaign and prominently featured in full-page advertisements, now appears to be a thing of the past.\nThe unexpected outcome of the elections has sent shockwaves across the political spectrum, prompting serious legal, constitutional, and political deliberations among all stakeholders, including political parties, the judiciary, and the powers that be.\nThese deliberations are expected to unfold over the next two weeks, paving the way for the transition of power to the government elected as a result of the February 8, 2024 elections.\nRead:\u00a0Solangi congratulates nation on successful conduct of elections\nOf paramount importance in these deliberations is the handling of PTI's mandate. Once hailed as the favoured party of the powerful establishment, PTI fell out of favour nearly two years ago.\nDespite the contentious nature of Thursday's election results, it's undeniable that PTI has emerged victorious against all odds, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), where it secured an unprecedented majority in both the National Assembly and provincial assembly seats.\nThis sweeping victory has effectively marginalised other parties that once held strongholds in the province. Additionally, PTI has solidified its position across Punjab, garnering significant support in terms of votes, if not necessarily seats.\nThe mandate of PTI cannot be disregarded, yet the decision by the ECP to strip PTI of its election symbol, later endorsed by the Supreme Court, poses unprecedented challenges for the party, not only during the election phase but also in the post-election period.\nOnce the final results are revealed, the allocation of reserved seats for women and minorities to political parties across all legislatures will commence.\nHowever, the current constitutional and electoral laws do not address the allocation of reserved seats to legislators without party affiliations, as is the case in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa now where there is no way other than giving PTI-backed independents to form a government.\nThis dilemma is compounded by the largest group of independents returning to the National Assembly and Punjab Assembly as well since the non-party-based elections of 1985.\nVarious scenarios are being considered: the larger parties, PML-N and PPP, may seek to court independents to bolster their numbers before the allocation of reserved seats, potentially leading to unprecedented horse-trading. Alternatively, a major political party like PPP could absorb this independent chunk into a coalition government.\nHowever, none of these scenarios promises stability.\nGiven the country's dire economic crisis and the need to adhere to IMF programs requiring further austerity measures, governance without public legitimacy will be exceedingly challenging, if not impossible.\nThe solution lies in a thorough reconsideration of stakeholder positions, grounded in an understanding of the ground realities and the people's mandate. This process is crucial not only among political leaders but also within the corridors of power.\n"

            "Text": "Amidst the inordinate delay in election results and growing apprehension of potential rigging, clashes erupted between activists of two political parties outside an election centre, resulting in a fierce confrontation. \nWorkers engaged in physical altercations, exchanging blows and hurling stones. The situation escalated further with intense aerial firing by unidentified individuals, leaving five people injured, including two shot, purportedly belonging to Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf and one from MQM Pakistan. \nResponding to the chaos, police and Rangers intervened, dispersing the agitated workers through baton charges and tear gas shelling. Two individuals were subsequently detained.\nThe incident unfolded at Public School Latifabad, designated as an election centre for the distribution of electoral materials and result compilation related to three national assembly seats and six provincial assembly seats in Hyderabad district. Initially tasked with returning election items, the center was later repurposed for recounting votes. \nDespite the timely cessation of polling, only two unofficial and unconfirmed results for the provincial assembly, PS 60 and PS 61, were disclosed late on Thursday night. This led to a continuous influx of officials and party workers throughout the night, causing unrest.\nIn the presence of a significant police and Rangers presence, candidates, and activists representing various political parties, including DRO and Deputy Commissioner Tariq Qureshi, District Election Commissioner Pervez Kalwar, and relevant ROs, anxiously awaited the delayed results. \nOn Friday, as candidates and activists sought explanations for the prolonged delay, tensions rose, leading to bitter verbal exchanges and slogans between MQM and PTI supporters inside the school. Subsequently, PTI and MQM activists gathered outside the school, resulting in verbal clashes and minor physical altercations.\nSenior members of both parties intervened multiple times, urging restraint among their workers. Police and Rangers also intervened, guiding them away from the election centre gate, attempting to quell the rising tensions and maintain order in the aftermath of the clash.\n\nRead\u00a0Results announced amidst rigging allegations\nLate on Friday night, the tension surrounding the preparation of election results for NA 219 and PS 64 escalated as a large gathering of workers from both political parties converged outside the gate Public School. A verbal clash quickly escalated into physical altercations, with activists engaging in fistfights, wielding sticks, and hurling stones at each other, transforming the area into a battlefield. The situation took a more ominous turn with heavy aerial firing initiated by unknown individuals, heightening tensions.\nRangers and police took swift action, charging the agitated political workers with tear gas shelling and baton charges. Two individuals were apprehended by the police in the aftermath. The volatile mix of aerial firing, fistfights, and baton charges resulted in injuries to six individuals, namely Noraiz Khan, Rashid Abdul Ghaffar, Nadeem Rajput, Babar Sheikh, Sufyan, and Tufail.\nMussarat Iqbal, PTI leader and UC Chairman, disclosed that Noraiz Khan and Rashid Abdul Ghaffar, both from PTI, sustained serious injuries. Noraiz's leg was hit by a bullet, causing continuous bleeding, necessitating his transfer to Karachi for treatment. Rashid Abdul Ghaffar, the UC Councillor from UC 107, suffered a bullet wound in his stomach and is undergoing treatment at Civil Hospital. \nBabar Sheikh, nephew of senior journalist Shahid Sheikh, was shot in the neck and is in critical condition, being transported to Karachi due to uncontrolled bleeding.\nMQM Pakistan's spokesperson stated that their UC joint in-charge, Nadeem Rajput, sustained injuries to his face. Edhi spokesperson confirmed the transfer of Babar and another unidentified person from the public school to Civil Hospital, both having gunshot wounds. Following the dispersal of activists, additional police reinforcements were called, and the arrested youths were taken by Rangers officials to an undisclosed location. Tension lingered outside the Public School until late at night\n"

He further said that the JI will expand the protest across the country.\nThe ECP will have to explain what outcome it wants to achieve by violating the mandate of masses time and again, he said. The entire exercise has cost Rs48 billion to the national exchequer. He said, what was the purpose of such an expensive exercise, if the ECP had to announce the results under a pre-planned mechanism. \nDetailing the anomalies, he said the ECP had announced that form 45 and 46 would be issued the same night but it was not done. \nHe said that form 45 and 46 were issued on Friday which proves the worst kind of rigging and insult to the mandate of masses. He highlighted several examples, including one of PS-91 where Muttahida Qaumi Movment bagged 5,000 votes but in the connected NA, the MQM was bestowed 88,000 votes. \nHe also highlighted that according to the announcement, JI's candidate in NA-236 only received 21,000 votes. Similarly, he said, Alamgir bagged only 10,000 votes as per the announcement, whereas both the candidates received much more votes as per form 45 and 46.\n\nRead\u00a0Western capitals call for probe into election irregularities\nHe further said that the JI's candidate Muhammad Farooq in PS-91 stood first with 23,000 votes whereas Muhammad Ahmed, Junaid Mukati, and Abdul Rasheed won in PS-124, 104 and 106 respectively.\nMeanwhile, Pakistan Central Muslim League Karachi president, Ahmed Nadeem Awan, said that any change in the election results will not be acceptable. He said that counting of votes have not been completed even until the evening on the second day. It was the responsibility of the ECP to hold fair and transparent results of the general elections but the commission failed to do so. \nHe alleged that results are being changed under a planned conspiracy. He said that the results in various constituencies are surprising. The candidates who were rejected by the people are being declares as winners. All the claims made by the ECP regarding the preparations for the elections turned out to be false. \nAwan said that voters turnout was shown less deliberately. He said that such actions on the part of the ECP and administrative machinery are regrettable and shameful. \nThese actions will shatter public confidence in the electoral system. Pakistan cannot afford any more chaos. The mandate of the people should be respected and political parties should be given their right.\n"

            "Text": "The apex court on Tuesday dismissed a report presented by the Punjab government on the Jaranwala incident, noting that Punjab Police knew the people involved in vandalizing the places of worship of the Christian community but were afraid to name them.\n\nThe court also asked authorities to submit a new report on the incident in ten days, warning that in case of submission of an unsatisfactory report, the court will dismiss or suspend the relevant officials.\n\nA three-member bench led by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJ) Qazi Faez Isa and comprising Muhammad Ali Mazhar and Justice Mussarat Hilali on Tuesday took up a constitution petition filed by members of the Christian community for an inquiry into the August 2023 incidents.\n\nOn August 16, 2023, communal violence erupted at Jaranwala tehsil of Faisalabad after alleged desecration of the Holy Quran. During the riots, dozens of churches, places of worship and properties belonging to the Christian community were attacked and vandalized.\n\nThe petitioners noted that never in the history of Pakistan have so many churches been destroyed in a single incident in a single day. \u201cAt least 24 churches and several dozen smaller chapels were burnt, thus, the present petition is of great public importance and is maintainable,\u201d it said.\n\nDuring the proceedings, CJ Isa said people complain about Islamophobia in other countries but here they are themselves involved in mistreating the minorities. \u201cDo we want to emulate the treatment meted out to minorities in India?\u201d he asked.\n\nThe judge lamented that police did not try to stop the mobs on August 16 and acted like silent spectators. He said police know the real culprits of the Jaranwala incident, but are displaying weakness and cowardice.\n\n\u201cBy failing to stop the attackers, the police undermined public confidence in themselves. Apparently, the Punjab police appeared intimidated by the attackers of the Jaranwala incident,\u201d the judge observed.\nJustice Isa said as a citizen, it is embarrassing for him that Pakistan reports the highest number of blasphemy cases in the world. Some people, he said, have turned it into a business.\n\n\u201cThose who have no knowledge about Islam are pretending to be authorities. Islam prohibits attacks on places of worship,\u201d he said.\n\nThe court also issued notices to the federal government, all the provincial governments, the Pakistan Broadcasters Association (PBA) and the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA)\nIt noted that both the government and the media must play their roles in combating extremism, violence, terrorism, sectarianism, and hatred.\u00a0 The media should publish special messages promoting religious harmony under Section 20 of the PEMRA Ordinance, it said.\n\nThe court also gave the government two months to submit a report containing details of all the places of worship belonging to minority communities.\n\n"

            "Text": "The Lahore High Court on Wednesday granted bail to PTI president and former Punjab chief minister Chaudhry Pervez Elahi in an illegal recruitment case.\nElahi was booked by the Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) Punjab on charges of illegally recruiting a low-ranking officer as his principal secretary by misusing his powers when he was serving as the chief minister.\nA single-judge bench, comprising Justice Shehram Sarwar Chaudhry, heard Elahi\u2019s bail petition.\nAmir Saeed Rawn, Elahi\u2019s lawyer argued that the police had no justification for keeping the PTI\npresident behind bars after the completion of the investigation, and requested the court to approve his client\u2019s bail.\nHowever, the law officer strongly opposed the bail request, and asked the court to dismiss the plea.\nHe added that there was substantial evidence to develop the nexus of Elahi with the offence.\nThe law officer contended that the then Punjab CM Elahi had illegally recruited Muhammad Khan Bhatti, a low-ranking officer, as his principal secretary, and no due process was adopted in the appointment.\nReplying to this, Elahi\u2019s lawyer told the court that all due process was adopted while appointing the principal secretary.\nHe argued that a bogus FIR was registered against his client merely to humiliate and embarrass him even though he had nothing to do with the case.\nHe added that Bhatti had been discharged from this case by a judicial magistrate, while Elahi was being subjected to political victimisation.\nThe lawyer asked the court to grant Elahi post-arrest bail.\nThe court directed Elahi to furnish surety bonds of Rs100,000 for availing the relief of bail.\nThe jail officials then produced Elahi and Bhatti before Accountability Court Judge Zubair Shahzad Kiyani in connection with the Gujrat development projects case.\nRead: LHC accepts policemen\u2019s apology in Elahi case\nDuring the proceedings, the defence counsel submitted to the court that clear copies of challan had not been furnished and requested it to adjourn the indictment proceedings till their provision.\nAt this, the court adjourned further proceedings till February 22 and directed the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) to provide clear copies of challan to the accused.\nNAB has accused Elahi and his son Moonis of receiving over Rs1 billion as kickbacks through intermediaries in more than 200 development projects of Gujrat district.\nIt is pertinent to mention here that Moonis has already been declared a proclaimed offender in the case because of continuous absence.\nMoreover, an anti-corruption court also delayed the indictment of Elahi and other accused till February 22 in the Punjab Assembly illegal appointments case.\nThe court delayed the indictment because of the absence of a co-accused, Abdullah, during the proceedings.\nIt directed to produce the medical certificate of the co-accused before the court at the next hearing.\nThe ACE Punjab had registered the case accusing Elahi of unlawful appointments and receiving kickbacks.\nQualified candidates were allegedly denied positions while those who had not taken the exams were appointed.\nThe ACE claimed that as the then chief minister, Elahi had misused his authority by influencing appointments after taking bribes.\n"

            "Text": "The Islamabad High Court (IHC), angered by the government\u2019s inability to recover missing Baloch students, has summoned Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar once more. He is ordered to appear before the court on February 19.\nPresided over by IHC Senior Puisne Judge Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, a single-member bench resumed hearing a petition filed by human rights lawyer Imaan Mazari regarding the alleged enforced disappearance of over 50 Baloch students.\nDuring the proceedings, Assistant Attorney General Usman Ghuman informed the court that another missing student had been recovered. Requesting an adjournment, he stated that Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Awan was unavailable. The Islamabad advocate general also sought an adjournment, citing the government's need for additional time.\nExpressing extreme displeasure at the government\u2019s failure to recover the students, Justice Kayani remarked on his benevolence in refraining from summoning the directors general (DGs) of the country's two prime intelligence agencies.\nHe noted that the punishment for kidnapping for ransom is capital punishment and advocated for multiple death sentences for those involved in enforced disappearances.\nThe court directed the caretaker prime minister to appear on Monday morning at 10 o'clock to explain why a case should not be filed against him. The court later adjourned until February 19.\nEarlier, on November 22, 2023, the court had instructed the government to recover 55 missing students from Balochistan within seven days.\nRead:\u00a0\u2018If anyone can resolve missing person issue, it\u2019s me\u2019, says Bilawal\n\u00a0\nFailure to comply would result in the caretaker prime minister appearing in court on November 29, 2023, accompanied by the caretaker ministers and secretaries for interior and defense, it had said.\nHowever, on November 29, the interim PM had not appeared in court due to a foreign visit.\nDuring the hearing, attended by caretaker Interior Minister Sarfraz Bughti, the court had warned that if the missing individuals were not found, it would order the registration of a first information report (FIR) against the interim PM and interior minister.\nThe court had later released a written order reviewing the implementation of recommendations proposed by a commission on the missing Baloch students. According to the order, 69 Baloch students were subjected to racial profiling, harassment, and forced disappearance.\nOf these students, some later returned home, while 50 remained missing. \"Former IHC chief justice Athar Minallah had constituted the commission. The additional attorney general confessed that some students were still missing,\" the order stated.\nThe order criticized the interim prime minister and interior minister, both from Balochistan, for failing to take positive steps on the matter.\n\"Even after 21 hearings, the absence of positive results is an insult to the Constitution of Pakistan.\n"

            "Text": "As the tenure of the caretaker government officially comes to an end following the conduct of the General Elections 2024, a look back at the haphazard developmental projects initiated by the ad hoc administration, especially the upgradation of the Lahore Zoo and the Safari Park, gives interesting insight into the viability of reconstruction projects with a tight deadline. In November last year, the caretaker government of Punjab, under the guidance of the ad hoc Chief Minister Mohsin Naqvi, had laid the foundation stones for the upgradation of two wildlife sanctuaries namely, the Lahore Zoo and the Safari Park, with a strict directive to complete the reconstruction projects by January 31st.\nUnfortunately however, where the project has visibly failed to meet the fixed deadline given the nature of the work, wildlife experts have expressed ample scrutiny on the viability and quality of such hurried projects, which in their urgency to meet a given deadline and display a nameplate, end up compromising the quality of the refurbishment work on wildlife sanctuaries.\n\u201cThere is a difference between the construction work for wildlife sanctuaries and regular infrastructure. It is fairly simple to construct a road, underpass, or bridge, but there are numerous considerations to take into account when constructing a living habitat for birds and wild animals. Expediting such projects can result in substandard facilities among other pitfalls in the future,\u201d explained Mian Hafeez, Former Director of Project for Punjab Wildlife and the Green Pakistan Program.\nRead:\u00a0Bahawalpur zoo shut\n\u201cThe reconstruction project of the Lahore Zoo and Safari Park, which is slated to reach completion within a matter of months, requires at least one and a half to two years for quality upgradation,\u201d he added.\nFurthermore, experts from the Planning and Development Board have also specified that since concrete, cement and sand is to be used in the construction structure due to their increased sustainability and durability, it may take more time for the construction structures to solidify and mature adequately given the cold winter season. What is interesting to note is that despite, several wildlife experts voicing their skepticism about the completion of the project in a time frame of less than six months, the caretaker Chief Minister remained adamant at completing the project within just three months of its commencement.\nThe zoo\u2019s sources further claimed that after the January 31st deadline passed, the caretaker Chief Minister gave another close deadline of mid-February for completing the reconstruction project of the Lahore Zoo and the Safari Park, costing a sum total of Rs5 billion.\nAccording to the speculations of some policy experts, politicians push for projects to be completed quickly so that they may claim credit for them and have their names added to the plate before the next government takes charge.\nWhether or not this applies to the case of the current caretaker administration, cannot be ascertained but what is for sure is that the reconstruction work is being unreasonably rushed with 70 per cent of the work already completed in the Lahore Zoo including the completion of the parking area, walkway, bridge over the lake, and the animal hospital with only a few areas including the lion\u2019s enclosure, bear\u2019s cage and reptile house still under construction.\nMoreover, reportedly the Secretary of Forest and Wildlife Punjab has met with the officials of the Federal Ministry of Climate Change, including the DG Wildlife of the Lahore Zoo and Safari Park, requesting the federal government to issue permits for importing animals including elephants, pandas, and kangaroos from abroad, among a total of 146 wild animals that are being brought in from across the country.\nSpeaking to The Express Tribune on the matter, Mudassir Hassan, Lahore Zoo and Safari Park\u2019s Project Director said,\u201d Much of the work has completed, the remaining will conclude by the end of February.\u201d\n"

The court referred to the Supreme Court's orders, directing the ECP to hear all petitions and issue orders according to the law by February 22.\nThe written judgment highlighted that the ECP should examine the records of Form 45 or 47 of the petitioners, rectify any irregularities, and allow the affected party to approach the relevant forum if the issue persists. The court directed the petitioners to address concerns under the Election Act, 2017.\nIn the end, the SHC bench disposed of the petitions against the election results of over 40 national and provincial constituencies, including those involving Syed Mustafa Kamal, Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, and others.\n"

            "Text": "The interim government spent Rs191 billion on development projects during the first seven months of this fiscal year \u2013 a sum that is over Rs300 billion or 61% less than the target and underscores the implications of tough economic conditions.\n\nThe Ministry of Planning reported on Tuesday that the development expenditures amounted to just under Rs191 billion during July-January period of the current fiscal year. Its one-page summary sheet showed that the expenditures were equal to just 38% of the amount that the planning ministry had authorised for the spending for this period.\n\nUnder the Development Funds Releases Strategy, the government was required to spend Rs494 billion or 52% of the total annual budget during the first seven months of the fiscal year. But the actual spending was Rs300 billion less than the target.\n\nThe interim government has slowed down spending as part of its plan to meet the annual primary budget surplus target set by the International Monetary Fund. Despite slowing down expenditures during the first quarter, the government missed the target. The IMF gave a waiver to make Pakistan eligible for the $706 million tranche.\n\nThe significant gap between authorisation and actual expenditures underscores challenges in the fund release process, slow progress on schemes, and the capacity to spend allocated funds. Deliberate slowing down of development expenditures aims to offset higher current expenditures.\n\nDuring the first review talks, Pakistan assured the IMF to fast-track spending after admitting delays in the expenditure of Public Sector Development Program (PSDP). Pakistan also committed to expedite the PSDP prioritisation and rationalisation process in line with recommendations, aiming to achieve savings of at least PRs 61 billion.\n\nLast month, the National Economic Council asked provinces to take over 68 projects costing Rs121 billion. The NEC also placed a ban on further spending on parliamentarians\u2019 schemes and prime minister\u2019s initiatives. These three steps will save the centre a cost of Rs202 billion, including Rs112 billion during the current fiscal year.\n\nNonetheless, the chief ministers of Sindh and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) raised questions over the mandate of the caretaker government to make financial decisions having long-term implications. The chief minister of Sindh also cited Section 230 of the Election Act that limited the role of the caretaker government.\n\nIn its separate review of Pakistan\u2019s public investment framework, the IMF has deemed Pakistan\u2019s PSDP \u201cunaffordable\u201d due to limited fiscal space, noting a total cost of Rs12 trillion to complete approved projects, requiring over 14 years.\n\nRead City\u2019s development projects opened for Japan investors\n\nThe planning ministry\u2019s report showed that 19% of total spending in seven months, or Rs35.6 billion, was on parliamentarians\u2019 schemes. The last PDM government authorised Rs61.3 billion spending for these schemes, but the interim government slowed down the process. The annual budget is Rs90 billion.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the government estimated the release of Rs75 billion in foreign loans. The disbursements reached Rs43 billion in seven months.\nDevelopment budget allocations for provinces, special areas, Azad Jammu & Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan were affected in the first four months. Against the annual allocation of Rs170 billion, only Rs40 billion was spent, still the biggest spending head followed parliamentarians\u2019 schemes.\n\nThe National Transmission and Dispatch Company (NTDC) and Pakistan Electric Power Company (PEPCO) spent Rs7 billion on its projects against the annual allocation of nearly Rs55 billion.\n\nThe National Highway Authority (NHA) has an annual budget of Rs157 billion. The planning ministry authorised Rs94 billion in spending, but actual expenses remained at only Rs21 billion. There was Rs30 billion spending on the water sector projects against the annual budget of Rs90 billion.\n\nOnly Rs261 million was spent against the Rs70 billion special programme for prime minister\u2019s initiatives. The interim government stopped these releases, which former Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had set aside for projects of his own liking.\n\nWhere the federal government spent little on development, the provinces accelerated expenses under this head. The provincial spending exceeded projections in the first quarter, partly due to a Rs115 billion payment by the Punjab government to clear commodity operations debt and faster execution of PSDP.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 14th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

Including non-PAMA (Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers Association) members, car sales totalled 11,700 units, up 72% month-on-month.\nDespite a 5% year-on-year decline from January 2023\u2019s 11,100 units, PAMA car sales in the first seven months of FY24 stood at 49,990 units, down 48% compared to 7MFY23\u2019s 95,240 units. Factors contributing to the decline include escalating car prices, expensive auto financing, and low consumer purchasing power. Sunny Kumar, Deputy Head of Research at Topline Securities, said car sales reached their highest level in eleven months, driven by increased sales in January with demand for new year registrations.\nOn a positive note, tractor sales surged by 46% MoM and 12% YoY to 3,814 units in January 2024, reaching 27,225 units in 7MFY24, up 82% YoY.\n\nRead\u00a0Despite YoY decline, sales reach highest level in eleven months\nArif Habib Limited Auto Analyst Muhammad Abrar Polani attributed the spike in January 2024 sales to the new year\u2019s buying effect, ease of import restrictions, and increased affordability due to declining car prices. He anticipates further sales recovery as interest rates are projected to be cut in March, boosting auto financing.\nIndus Motors saw a significant increase in car sales, up 304% MoM to 2,762 units in January 2024, driven by the launch of the new Corolla Cross. Honda Car MoM sales also rose by 49%, with 1,339 units sold in January 2023 compared to 901 cars in December 2023.\nPak Suzuki Motors recorded 4,550 unit sales in January 2024, a 22% increase from December 2023\u2019s 3,735 units. Motorbike and three-wheeler sales also surged by 27% MoM to 104,619 units in Jan-24, although sales declined by 5% YoY.\nWith the emergence of SUVs featuring Hybrid-Electric transmissions, Adeel Usman, CEO of Regal Automobiles Industries Limited, anticipated a sustained shift away from traditional Internal Combustion Engines in the coming years.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 14th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

        },
        "Details": {
            "Text": "Federal cabinet members remained divided on Tuesday over a proposed increase of up to 69% in gas prices, amid warnings that any delay beyond Thursday could cost Pakistan $1.2 billion, the last loan tranche from the International Monetary Fund.\n\nThe Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet had to defer approval after supposedly pro-IMF programme cabinet members also spoke against the fresh price hike, according to meeting participants.\n\nThe Industry Minister, Dr Gohar Ejaz, representing the textile sector, opposed increasing gas prices for in-house power generation plants of industrialists fuelled by cheaper gas. Two other members opposed gas price increases for residential consumers ahead of Ramazan. They also sought time to study the proposal, which was not part of the regular meeting agenda.\n\nThe finance minister, also chairperson of the Sui Southern Gas Company Limited, advocated for the withdrawal of cross subsidies paid by industrialists to fertiliser plants.\n\nAs a result, the ECC had to defer the summary that had sought up to a 69% increase in prices for residential consumers and up to a 45% raise for other consumers aimed at recovering an additional Rs242 billion.\n\nThe ECC will meet again today (Wednesday) to consider the summary. The IMF has set a February 15th deadline to increase gas prices effective from February 1st.\n\nThe secretary finance plainly told the ECC that without a price increase, the IMF would not complete the next programme review, which carries the bonanza of the $1.2 billion last tranche of the loan package.\n\nThis would be the third proposed increase in prices that the government has made in the past year. The proposed increase would throw an additional burden of Rs242 billion on consumers, including Rs37 billion that the government would earn in sales tax.\n\nIt was the second revision in gas prices by the caretaker government in the past three months after it earlier increased prices up to 1108% \u2013 the highest for the most vulnerable households.\n\nThe fresh revision has also placed the maximum burden on the most vulnerable households with a 67% or Rs100 increase per unit for domestic monthly consumption of 0.5 cubic hectometers (HM3).\n\nEarlier this month, OGRA issued a determination for revised estimated revenue requirements (RERR) for FY 2023-24 for both SNGPL and SSGCL. According to the revised determination, SNGPL requires revenue of Rs592 billion and SSGCL requires revenue of Rs310 billion this fiscal year. The total revenue requirement has been determined at Rs902 billion, arriving at an average prescribed price of Rs1,596 per mmbtu.\n\nSources said that there were heated arguments on the proposal of increasing gas prices for industrialists in the range of 18% to 34%. The Petroleum Division has proposed that the existing distinction between export and non-export industries using gas for in-house electricity generation should be abolished.\n\nIt proposed that one unified price of Rs2,950 per mmbtu may be fixed for all types of industries. This would result in an increase of Rs750 per mmbtu \u2013 or 34% for exporters and Rs450 or 18% for the non-export sector using gas for captive plants.\n\nThe industry minister claimed in the meeting that captive power plants were using 90% of the allocated gas while the rest of the 10% was used by processing industries. His claim was confronted by the energy minister who said that the use of captive gas was 55%.\n\nOnly five sectors \u2013 textile, carpets, leather, sports, and surgical goods \u2013 were using subsidised gas, while other exporters did not benefit.\n\nThe industry minister also objected to putting nearly Rs100 billion burden of subsidising fertiliser and residential consumers. The finance minister backed Ejaz and asked to prepare a fresh proposal for ending the cross subsidy being availed by fertiliser plants.\n\nHowever, in case the government decides to fix a uniform gas price for all fertiliser plants, it will put the fertiliser plants on the Mari Gas network at a disadvantageous position. The revenue requirement for the Mari gas network plants requires the per-unit price at Rs555 per mmbtu, but the average prescribed price set by the OGRA is Rs1596. This would put an additional burden on farmers who would pay Rs175 billion extra \u2013 a sum that would go into the pockets of provinces in the shape of Gas Development Surcharge.\n\nRead\u00a0Govt unveils new tight gas policy\n\nThe Petroleum Division has proposed that the feed and fuel gas price for Engro Fertiliser should be set at Rs760 per mmbtu \u2013 a surge of 31% \u2013 and Fauji Fertiliser Bin Qasim plant should be increased to Rs1,750 mmbtu, showing an increase of 29%.\n\nThe effective date for revised gas tariff for Engro Fertiliser should be March 1st, 2024.\n\nAgritech and Fatima Fertiliser are currently getting RLNG from the SNGPL network. The proposed price for these plants will be Rs1,596 per mmbtu, which is the average prescribed price in case these plants are offered system gas on SNGPL.\n\nThe Petroleum Division had proposed that for protected consumers, the existing tariff slabs should be increased in the range of Rs80 to 100 per mmbtu \u2013 an increase of 40% to 67%.\n\nFor unprotected consumers, an increase in the range of Rs200 to 300 per mmbtu has been proposed that translates into a surge of 5% to 67%.\n\nThe domestic category will still avail a cross subsidy of Rs108 billion as the protected consumers category and the first four slabs of the unprotected category are priced lower than prescribed price, according to the proposal.\n\nThe prices for bulk consumption are proposed to be increased from Rs2,000 to Rs2,900 mmbtu \u2013 an increase of 45%.\nFor the CNG sector, the government has proposed that the prices should be increased from Rs3,600 per mmbtu to Rs3,750 per mmbtu, equivalent to the RLNG price, being the fuel for the majority of CNG producers in the country.\n\nOther decisions:\n\nA finance ministry handout stated that the ECC approved a proposal to allow the flour mills to import wheat and export wheat flour products.\n\nThe ECC also approved a summary of the Power Division regarding the \u201cCommissioning of 1263 MW CCPP Punjab Thermal Power (Pvt) Limited, Jhang (PPTL)\u201d. The plant would not be entitled to idle capacity payments for a certain period.\n\nThe ECC approved a Rs6 billion subsidy for the import of urea. It was clarified that no subsidy on this account has been allowed by the government during the current year. The ECC also directed that the provincial governments be approached to clear their respective arrears of subsidy on urea.\n\nIn order to provide relief to the general public during Ramazan, the ECC approved Rs7.5 billion subsidy for the Benazir Income Support Programme beneficiaries that is already given in the budget.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 14th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

            "Text": "Jamshoro Joint Venture Limited (JJVL) has proposed deregulating the base-stock price of local Liquefied petroleum gas or imported LPG in the new proposed LPG Policy, allowing market forces to determine pricing. The government is currently formulating this policy to bolster local LPG production.\n\nJJVL advocates for producers and importers to have the autonomy to set prices based on market conditions, fostering fair competition, which previous LPG policies failed to achieve. Chairman JJVL, Iqbal Z Ahmed, in a letter to the Director General of LG Petroleum division, highlighted the need for a transparent, fair, and investment-friendly policy.\n\nHe underscored that the only successful regime, which attracted investments exceeding $1 billion, was the LPG Deregulation Letter of 2000. However, this progress was revered with the LPG Policy of 2006, he said. He urged the government to refrain from favouring one segment of the industry over another, stressing the importance of a policy conducive to investment.\nRead LPG price jacked up by Rs19 per 11.8kg\n\nThe proposed policy outlines obligations for LPG producers or Exploration & production (E&P) companies suggesting that the field owner of a discovered LPG extraction site should have the first right to set up an extraction facility. If, however, the E&P companies fail to do so within 12 months, the opportunity should be open to third parties under agreed terms, he said. He added that producers should also have the freedom to market LPG directly or through third parties, without granting exemptions of PPRA Rules to State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) for LPG imports.\n\nIncentives for local production are essential, Ahmed asserted, proposing a 10-year tax holiday from the Commercial Start Date (CSD), zero Petroleum Levy, a maximum GST of 5%, and duty-free import of production equipment. He added that private LPG producers should not be compelled to allocate LPG to SOEs, allowing them freedom in distribution while SOEs should establish transparent marketing mechanisms.\n\nThe JJVL chairman also highlighted the importance of quality control and import regulations, advocating for preventing the import of substandard LPG and permitting only companies with valid OGRA Marketing Licenses to import LPG.\nImplementing these measures, Ahmed believes, will create a transparent, competitive, and investment-friendly environment in the LPG sector, benefiting both producers and consumers.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 14th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

            "Text": "Sui Southern Gas Company Limited (SSGC) is awaiting the government\u2019s approval signal to create a cost-effective gas import substitution of over $1 billion a year. This strategy involves reutilising closed wells and encouraging exploration firms to discover tight gas. The move comes as imported gas (Liquefied natural gas) has become unaffordable due to massive rupee devaluation in recent times.\nWhile briefing journalists at his office, SSGC Managing Director Imran Maniar highlighted the challenges associated with completing international gas pipeline projects. Projects like the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) and Iran-Pakistan (IP) lines are proving to be \u201cvery, very tough\u201d. Additionally, gas prices through these pipelines have risen beyond domestic consumers\u2019 purchasing power.\nManiar stated that supplying low-cost indigenous gas to industries is no longer feasible for SSGC. Therefore, blending imported gas (LNG) has been proposed as a way forward.\nFurthermore, the supply of gas to SSGC from local fields is projected to further deplete to 500 mmcfd (million cubic feet per day) in the next four years, declining over 30% by 2028 from the current 720 mmcfd, he added.\nThe gas marketing firm was receiving 820 mmcfd from local fields this time last year, marking a 12% reduction to date. This decline is attributed to depleting domestic reserves of oil and gas, with no significant discoveries in the past two decades.\nManiar revealed that SSGC has identified closed wells with the potential to supply a total of 200 mmBtu (million British thermal unit) in the system. Reactivating these wells could save $80 million a month and $1 billion annually in gas imports, he said.\nOil and Gas Development Company (OGDC), Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL), Pakistan Oilfields Limited (POL), and Mari Gas have closed wells due to production costs exceeding the selling price of $6/mmBtu. Reactivating these wells would require an additional investment of up to $50 million. However, even with increased costs of $7-7.5/unit, SSGC could sell gas to local industries at $8.5-9/unit, which is still lower compared to imported LNG sold at $15-16/unit, said the MD.\nThe caretaker government has also approved a tight gas policy, offering $7/mmBtu to exploration firms compared to $6/mmBtu for natural gas at present. This policy aims to tap into tight gas reserves estimated at 25 trillion cubic feet, nearly double the reserves of Sui gas currently standing at 13 trillion cubic feet.\n\nRead\u00a0SSGC seeks hike amid Rs47b shortfall\nManiar stressed the need to encourage exploration firms by offering competitive prices, suggesting a rate of $7-8/unit to reduce import burdens and lower gas prices nationwide.\nPakistan currently imports 11-12 cargoes of LNG a month. The proposed solutions could potentially cut imports by 3-4 cargoes a month, according to SSGC MD.\n\u201cOur local exploration firms lack the expertise and technology to find the tight gas. The policy should encourage foreign firms to return to Pakistan along with their external investment,\u201d he suggested.\nAdditionally, Maniar proposed the introduction of a coal-to-gas policy, leveraging Pakistan\u2019s vast coal reserves in Tharparker to potentially produce 1,200 mmcfd, exceeding current natural gas supplies. While gas prices through IP and TAPI pipelines could overcome gas supply shortfalls, Maniar cautioned that residential consumers may find it unaffordable, highlighting its suitability for industries.\nHe also mentioned that gas marketing companies were paying local oil and gas exploration firms in US dollar-denominations instead of in rupee-value, contributing to increased costs due to recent rupee devaluation against the greenback. Regarding subsidised gas for fertiliser manufacturers, Maniar suggested ending subsidised gas sales to them and instead providing direct subsidies to farmers.\nPPL, Mari find POL products\nIn related news, Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) announced significant discoveries in the Hala Block, including 6 mmcd of gas and 452 barrels per day of oil from development well Adam 2.\n\u201cThe development well will add hydrocarbon reserves, enable the energy sector to reduce the gap between the supply and demand of oil & gas during the current energy crisis in the country and will save significant foreign exchange for the country,\u201d said a notification to the Pakistan Stock Exchange.\nThis discovery, a joint venture between PPL and Mari Petroleum, with 65% and 35% working interest.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 14th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

Interestingly, 140 independent candidates backed by the PTI have also reached the assembly.\nThe PPP has announced its support for the prime ministerial candidate of the PML-N. However, the party has not issued any policy statement regarding Punjab, where it holds ten seats.\nThe decision to nominate Ali Amin Gandapur as the next K-P chief minister was announced by the PTI\u2019s incarcerated founder Imran Khan during an informal interaction with the media inside Adiala Jail.\n\"Ali Amin Gandapur will be the K-P's chief minister,\" he said, highlighting his party's strong position with 84 seats in the K-P Assembly. PTI\u2019s Central Information Secretary Raoof Hasan later announced the decision at a news conference in Islamabad.\nAli Amin Gandapur served as the federal minister for Kashmir Affairs in the last PTI government. However, Maryam Nawaz has no experience serving in a legislature or working in any executive position in a federal or provincial government.\n"

He expressed the possibility of reconciliation if the PTI's stance changed.\nFazl concluded by stating that the JUI-F would initiate a protest movement across the country to press for the approval of their demands.\nFazl emphasised that the extent of rigging in the recent election surpassed even that of the 2018 polls.\nHe accused the Election Commission of Pakistan of being under the control of the establishment, claiming that the entire election process was manipulated.\n\"The election process was held hostage, with bribes influencing both victories and defeats. In response, we are initiating a nationwide protest movement to advocate for democracy. The decisions will now be made in the field, not just within the confines of parliament,\" Fazl declared.\nClarifying the party's stance, he emphasised their preparedness and independence, asserting, \"We did not come to the field hastily; we have made thorough preparations. We are not aligned with any political party, including PML-N. We will not endorse Shehbaz Sharif as the prime minister candidate in parliament, as our party has prohibited him from forming the government. Therefore, we will not be part of any government. Those who believe in the rigged nature of elections should join our cause, while others can choose to remain indifferent.\"\nAlso read: PTI loses JI\u2019s cooperation on K-P government formation\n\u00a0\nGDA plans mass sit-in\nMeanwhile, the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) is gearing up to stage a sit-in in Hyderabad on February 16 against alleged irregularities in the general election.\nThe party has invited opponents of the PPP in the province to participate in the protest.\nGDA leader and Qaumi Awami Tehreek (QAT) head, Ayaz Latif Palijo, extended invitations on Tuesday to Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) and Sindh Taraqi Pasand Party (STP) to join the sit-in protest at Hyderabad Bypass.\nReportedly, Palijo held discussions over the phone with JI's Hafiz Naeemur Rehman and STP's chairman Dr Qadir Magsi, informing them that the alliance's leader Pir Pagara Sibghatullah Shah Rashdi, who also leads the spiritual Hurr Jamaat, will spearhead the sit-in.\nPalijo asserted that hundreds of thousands of people are expected to attend the protest to voice their opposition to the alleged electoral malpractices.\n\"Pakistan's establishment seems to have disregarded the lessons from the partition of Bengal,\" he remarked, condemning the filing of FIRs against GDA's election candidates.\nMeanwhile, at a press conference in Larkana district, GDA's Moazzam Abbassi and JUI-F\u2019s provincial leader Nasir Khalid Mehmood Soomro highlighted Pagara's recent press conference, which they claimed, has exposed the extent of rigging.\n\"The primary purpose of elections is to foster stability in the country, but the post-election stock exchange downturn reflects a different reality,\" Abbassi remarked.\n"

            "Text": "The PML-N is on the brink of clinching majority in both the federal and Punjab assemblies, solidifying its status as a dominant political force in the country's political landscape.\nThe party has reached the requisite numbers to establish governments at both levels, owing to the inclusion of independent members and the backing of allies such as the PPP, PML-Q, and MQM.\nCurrently, these parties collectively hold 159 general seats in the National Assembly.\nAlongside 7 independent members, the PML-N commands 82 seats, the PPP holds 54, the MQM secures 17, the PML-Q claims 3, while the IPP and BAP have 2 and 1 seat respectively in the National Assembly.\nThe PML-N stands poised to secure 18 out of the total 60 reserved seats for women in the lower house of parliament. It is also positioned to claim 3 out of the 10 minority seats. Meanwhile, the PPP is anticipated to secure 12 reserved seats for women and 2 minority seats based on its current position.\nEfforts by the MQM aim to secure 4 reserved seats for women, while smaller parties collectively strive for 3 women seats.\nThese concerted efforts could potentially bolster the coalition's strength in the National Assembly to 202 members, comfortably exceeding the support needed for a simple majority of 169 members.\nRead more: Half a dozen newly-elected independents join PML-N in Punjab\n\u00a0\nFurthermore, the inclusion of numerous independent members into the PML-N has paved the way for government formation in Punjab, bolstering the party's influence in the province. The addition of these independents has elevated the PML-N's tally in Punjab to 151 seats.\nTo establish government rule in Punjab, a political party must secure 186 seats out of the total 371 seats in the provincial assembly. These comprise 297 general seats, 66 seats reserved for women, and 8 seats reserved for minorities.\nIn Punjab, each political party will be allocated one seat for women for every 4.5 general seats it secures, and one minority seat for every 37.12 general seats obtained.\nAs per the current party standings, out of the 66 seats reserved for women in the Punjab Assembly, the PML-N is set to secure 33 seats, while the PML-Q and PPP will each secure two seats. Independent candidates supported by the PTI may contribute to winning 28 such seats.\nWith support from 151 members, the PML-N has positioned itself to secure 4 minority seats. Once women and minority seats are filled, the party's strength will rise to 188 members.\nHowever, with the inclusion of the PPP, PML-Q, and IPP in the government alliance, the coalition's membership in the Punjab Assembly will swell to 214.\nFollowing a meeting at PML-Q chief Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain's residence, PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif nominated Maryam Nawaz as the candidate for Punjab CM on Tuesday.\n"

            "Text": "In Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, the Jamat-e-Islami (JI) faces internal discord regarding the inclusion of PTI-backed independent candidates into the JI fold in the provincial assembly. \nCentral Naib Amir of JI, Liaqat Baloch, affirmed this alliance, while the K-P Provincial Amir, Professor Muhammad Ibrahim, refuted it.\nLiaqat Baloch stated that JI had been in communication with PTI, aiming for an alliance to form the provincial government. He expressed JI\u2019s willingness to welcome PTI-backed independent candidates. \nConversely, Professor Ibrahim asserted there was no alliance with PTI, criticizing the ethical implications of using JI\u2019s name without consensus.\nThis divergence in opinion among the JI leadership, as reflected in contrasting statements from the central and provincial tiers of the party, underscores the complexity of coalition-building and the intricacies of political alliances in the region.\nBaloch\u2019s statement highlights JI\u2019s proactive engagement with PTI and its readiness to embrace potential allies from within PTI\u2019s support base.\nIbrahim\u2019s position underscores a more cautious approach, expressing skepticism regarding the reported collaboration and raising ethical concerns about the unauthorized use of JI\u2019s name in conjunction with PTI without formal consensus within the party.\n\nRead\u00a0JI confirms contact with PTI over possible government formation\nBaloch had a telephonic conversation with PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar, Ali Amin Gandapur, and Senator Azam Swati in this regard, following which JI gave its consent for unified action.\nAmidst these divergent perspectives, the internal dynamics within JI are further complicated by recent electoral setbacks. \nJI suffered significant setbacks in Tuesday\u2019s recounting of votes, losing all three provincial assembly seats it initially secured in K-P. The recounting process, conducted in PK-20 Bajaur II, PK-21 Bajaur III, and Dir Lower, revealed a shifting political landscape, with PTI candidates emerging victorious in the aftermath of contested results.\nIn PK-20 Bajaur II and PK-21 Bajaur III, where JI candidates had initially clinched victory, the recounting of votes resulted in a reversal of fortunes, with PTI candidates securing the seats previously held by JI. \nSimilarly, in Dir Lower, JI\u2019s candidate faced defeat in the recounting process, signaling a sobering reality for the party as it grapples with the implications of electoral setbacks and recalibrates its political strategy.\nMeanwhile, the broader political landscape in Pakistan witnesses strategic maneuvering by PTI, as it seeks to consolidate its position and forge alliances to strengthen its grip on power. \nPTI\u2019s announcement of its intention to form governments in both the Centre and Punjab, alongside alliances with the Majlis-e-Wahdatul Muslimeen (MWM) and JI in K-P, reflects a calculated approach to coalition-building aimed at maximizing political leverage and securing stability in governance.\n"

The shops and stalls have almost turned red with red-coloured gifts and the lights are giving a fascinating look at night.\nEvery gift shop is crowded with people buying Valentine's Day gifts. Youth, men, women and children are also buying these gifts in large numbers. Fresh flower vendors are also crowded with buyers of red roses and bouquets, while shops and stalls are beautifully decorated with red-coloured gifts.\nThe security of all parks and recreational places has been tightened and special instructions have been issued to monitor parks and recreational areas from dawn to dusk.\nShopkeepers and traders have prepared both fresh and artificial red flowers in new styles and designs. Apart from flowers, small red pillows, red coloured gift packs, red coloured small birds, animals, bears, monkeys and children's toys have also been displayed for sale.\nYoung flower vendors were seen selling red roses at intersections and traffic signals on Tuesday.\nThis year, the prices of Valentine\u2019s Day gifts have also increased enormously due to high inflation. Fresh rose flowers with small sprigs are being sold for Rs100, six-inch artificial red rose flowers and leaves from Rs150 to Rs200, while gift packs of new designs are available from Rs500 to Rs3,000.\nYoung teachers, professors, youth and scholars have given mixed reactions on the occasion of Valentine's Day.\nNasir Mehmood and Faisal, both youngsters, say that Valentine's Day is misinterpreted as there is no shame if a brother presents flowers to his sister, son to mother and a husband gives flowers to his wife on this day. People of a certain mindset consider it a sin to celebrate Valentine\u2019s Day and Basant and use firecrackers on Shab-e-Barat, but there is no harm in celebrating these small festivals, they add.\nProfessor Ilyas Qureshi puts weight behind celebrating any festival but within the ambit of Sharia limits. However, he says indecency couldn\u2019t be allowed in the name of Valentine's Day.\nShopkeepers Sharif Qureshi and Nadeem Sheikh are of the view that they sell flowers and gift packs every year on this day and there are record sales in wholesale and retail markets every year. However, the prices of gift items this time are higher than last year owing to inflation.\nAllama Izhar Shah Bukhari, the Chairman of the District International Peace Committee for Interfaith Harmony, has suggested halting internet service on Valentine's Day. \u201cToday, the threat is not of terrorism but of vulgarity. Messaging any na-mehram (men who do not have an Islamic legal relationship with the woman) woman isn\u2019t allowed in Sharia, it is a mischievous act,\u201d he said.\nAllama Izhar thinks that Valentine's Day is not a religious festival but rather a failed drama of lovers and Jews. True love is a message of peace, he said, adding no one could tolerate any man sending a love message to their female family members. Muslims who value the Prophet (pbuh)'s love should boycott Valentine's Day, he suggested.\n"

NP has been protesting in Kech district against alleged election irregularities. \nThe Quetta-Chaman Highway, Quetta-Dera Ghazi Khan Road, Quetta-Sibi Road, Kolpur, Kech Turbat Road, and Zero Point in Gwadar are among the vital routes affected by the blockades which have caused significant disruptions to travel and hindrance in the movement of goods.\n\u201cI will not be part of this parliament until our seats are restored,\u201d Mehmood Khan Achakzai, the chief of the Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party (PKMAP), said. \nIn Quetta, the provincial capital, various political and religious factions have blocked major intersections, including the Eastern Bypass, Western Bypass, Imdad Chowk, Gwalmandi Chowk, GPO Chowk, Spini Road and Brewery Road. The disruptions have paralyzed vehicular movement within the city and disrupted the daily routines of residents.\n\u201cOur protest will continue until all our concerns are addressed by the ECP,\u201d Syed Abdul Wahid Agha, a JUI-F candidate, said while talking to The Express Tribune.\nThe protest movement has escalated dramatically in Chaman where demonstrators halted a passenger train, further intensifying the chaos and amplifying the impact of the protests against the alleged poll rigging.\nDespite calls for restraint and appeals for dialogue, political and religious groups have persisted in holding rallies and demonstrations and have intensified their demands for electoral transparency and accountability.\nProminent political figures such as Dr Abdul Malik Baloch, Mehmood Khan Achakzai and Akhtar Mengal have all voiced their reservations over poll delays and alleged election rigging. They have accused presiding officers of deliberately stalling the announcement of results, heightening suspicions of foul play in the electoral process. As protests continue to grip Balochistan, the pressure mounts on authorities to address the grievances of the protesters and restore confidence in the integrity of the electoral system.\n"

He has already served as opposition leader for two terms--from 2008 to 2013 and 2018 to 2023.\nIf elected leader of the opposition, he would serve in the position for a third time. The JUI-F has the largest number of Members of the Provincial Assembly (MPAs) among all opposition parties. Durrani also has the seniority for the post.\nThe JUI-F has seven MPAs in the K-P Assembly.\nDurrani had contested provincial as well as National Assembly seats in the February 8 elections and had won provincial assembly seats from his home district of Bannu.\nIt may be recalled that Akram Khan Durrani had also served as K-P chief minister from 2002 to 2008 during the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA) government, a stint during which he had kept the ruling alliance alive against heavy odds. His last two years in power had been especially difficult with the province experiencing a rise in militancy in both rural and urban areas for the first time, a trend that had worsened despite all his efforts.\n"

            "Text": "Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar has said that voters in the currently held general elections exercised their constitutional rights, and generally, they voted for their favorite candidates despite security challenges.\n\u201cIt is the beauty of a vibrant democracy, and in Pakistan, it is a transformational democracy, also a brave democracy, considering the security challenges,\u201d he said in an interview with the Turkish broadcaster TRT.\nTo a question, he said the next parliament would decide to hand over the power to that party which would meet the required magical number to form the new government.\nThe prime minister said their responsibility as a caretaker government was to ensure security, and ahead of the elections, two terrorist incidents in Balochistan province occurred, which reminded the people of the real-time threat.\nThe government always had more responsibility when it came to security, he added.\nResponding to a question about the suspension of the mobile services, he said to face the security challenge, they had to block the communication channels; otherwise, they did not have any political motive whatsoever.\nElaborating his viewpoint, he said that considering that the terrorists would confine themselves to these two provinces would be a fallacy, there might be other potential attacks in other provinces.\nHe said they did their best to secure the country. It was only mobile services that were suspended while the internet service was available. He did not think that this suspension had hindered the huge democratic exercise.\nRead:\u00a0PTI secures two-thirds majority in NA, claims Imran\nThe results showed that it was, by and large, a free and fair exercise.\nThe caretaker prime minister said that even though people went out and peacefully exercised their right to vote, for the time being, he didn\u2019t have figures as to how many people had voted.\nProbably it would have been a record, which meant that everyone was allowed and their votes were counted. So else was democracy, he added. Two provinces were badly hit by terrorist attacks but people came out and bravely voted for their candidates, which was quite unusual, he opined.\nHe said, \u201cThe people of Pakistan are quite brave; they came out and voted.\u201d\nTo a query regarding change in previous governments, he said there were perceptions and realities, and in the last two decades, the change in governments, like in post-2002, happened on the floor of the parliament.\nThe vote of no confidence against the previous PTI\u2019s government was passed on the floor of the house with 179 votes, he added.\n\u201cSo how can anyone call it an undemocratic exercise and intervention from outside forces?\u201d he said, adding that even when Imran Khan was elected, people called it a product of a so-called selection process. But the reality was that he (Imran Khan) was elected with the support of 179 members of parliament, he added.\nThe prime minister said that the people were unfair in their criticism of Pakistan\u2019s political system. \u201cPolitical parties and the parliament are the biggest stakeholders in this whole exercise of statecraft arrangements,\u201d he asserted.\n"

        "Details": {
            "Text": "The poultry industry, facing multiple challenges, including high volatility in price manipulation following feed mills in the country, has witnessed a downfall instead of growth, with an overall 40% reduction in the industry due to ill-planned strategies.\nIndustry pundits attribute this decline to the ill-planned and mismanaged broiler breeding sector, lack of ideal husbandry practices, unhygienic conditions, poor bio-security, quarantines, return on investment (ROI), and risky feed transactions based on credit, among other factors. They highlight the sector\u2019s volatility, where chicken meat prices often fluctuate from Rs550 per kilogram (kg) to Rs250 per kg for various reasons, occasionally shooting up due to a poor mechanism of demand and supply in the local market.\nIn discussions with The Express Tribune, they note that the poultry industry has faced challenges for over six years, with the industry\u2019s growth rate of 7% to 8% annually reduced by 40%. The feed industry has shrunk to hardly 5.5 or 6.5 million tonnes per year compared to the 9 or 9.5 million tonnes produced six years ago.\nHi-Tech Group of Companies CEO, Dr Muhammad Arshad, believes that tuning the return on investment (ROI) logically will lead the industry to reinvest at least 50% of its profit in the commercial broiler rearing sector, regaining expansion at 6% to 8%, as it used to be when feed profits on listed feed rates were 8% to 10%.\n\nRead\u00a0Poultry prices go up by 30pc\n\u201cThe poultry industry has been facing a shrinking phase, with one of the main reasons being the infeasible prices of feeds, making it a more capital-intensive industry. Feeds are sold on credit basis, mostly risky transactions where defaults occur frequently. Feed mills practically function as banks, with raw material suppliers as depositors and customers as borrowers. If banks do not charge adequate markup [the feed industry does not earn reasonable profits], they become incapable of extending more loans. Furthermore, if borrowers [feed buyers] do not pay back on time, the bank\u2019s investment is further scaled down,\u201d he explains.\nAs the feed industry is not earning reasonable profits, they lack the financial capacity to offer more credit to customers, sharply decreasing the industry\u2019s volume. Dr Arshad points out that a few years ago, when the industry was growing, profits of 8% to 10% were being earned on listed feed prices, whereas these gains are now only around 3%.\n\u201cThis is an integrated system run by the entire poultry industry, including feed mills, poultry farms, volatile rates of broilers, and others. Aside from demand and supply, the government manipulates poultry rates to set or develop a political narrative in the short term, impacting the industry in the long term. During Ramazan, the government reduces prices, taking a heavy toll on small shed farmers. This system is luck-dependent; once the weather is cold, birds catch some infected diseases, and rates fall, the entire chain of the industry or system has to face major losses,\u201d says Salva Feed Mills Private Limited Okara Director, Mohammad Usman Ghani.\nHe notes that poultry demand significantly slumps ahead of Eidul Azha when mutton and beef are in demand, impacting lacklustre sales across each section of the industry. Ghani stresses that this is a vulnerable sector requiring government support, suggesting incentives for exports, opening Letters of Credit (LCs) for importing necessary ingredients of chicken feed, and stopping the manipulation of rates in the broiler market, which significantly matters.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 11th, 2024.\n"

        "Details": {
            "Text": "The government is considering permitting fertiliser manufacturers to increase urea prices by up to Rs358 per bag, shifting the entire burden of over Rs30 billion in imports onto farmers. As part of the plan, manufacturers have been granted the basket price of imported and locally manufactured urea to pass on the full burden of Rs220,000 imported urea to farmers.\nAgritech, a prominent player in the industry, has proposed a hike in its Maximum Retail Price (MRP) from Rs3,936 per bag to Rs4,095 per bag, indicating an increase of Rs159 per bag. Similarly, Engro and Fauji Fertiliser Company (FFC) have proposed an increase in price per bag to Rs3,766, up from the existing Rs3,595, reflecting an increase of Rs171 per bag. Fauji Fertiliser Bin Qasim Limited (FFBL) may see a more significant leap, with a proposed price of Rs4,339 per bag, compared to the current Rs3,981 per bag. This substantial increase of Rs358 per bag is poised to have widespread implications in the agricultural sector.\nFurthermore, the Fatima Group has proposed varying increases for its products. Fatima (SDO - Single Drum Oven) is set to witness a hike from Rs3,671 per bag to Rs3,839 per bag, reflecting an increase of Rs168 per bag. Likewise, both Pak Arab and Fatima (SHP - Sulphate of Potash) have proposed increases in their MRPs, each by Rs159 per bag.\nThe Economic Coordination Committee (ECC), in a recent meeting, observed that fertiliser manufacturers would charge financing costs on the entire production of 6.2 million tonnes of fertiliser, providing them with undue benefits and increasing fertiliser prices in the country. The ministry was urged to resolve the issue at its own end, and in response, it was clarified that the financing cost would be charged only on 220,000 tonnes of imported urea. Regarding the supply of gas to fertiliser manufacturers, the ECC was informed that, as per past practice, the Petroleum Division would assess the existing arrangement of supplying gas/RLBG and provide gas to them on the best endeavour basis.\nThe ECC noted that the mechanism shall be further revised, and approval for an implementation mechanism, based on the principle of basket pricing, shall be placed before the cabinet. It was agreed that the National Fertiliser Marketing Limited (NFML) should determine the release price of imported urea. The Finance Division reiterated its stance that no additional subsidy would be provided on the supply of urea once the proposed mechanism of basket price is enforced.\n\nRead\u00a0Farmers await imported urea supply\nIn earlier decisions, the ECC had allowed the Trading Corporation of Pakistan to import 220,000 MT of urea from SOC 8, Azerbaijan, which was ratified by the cabinet on November 25, 2023. On October 23, 2023, the ECC decided that the subsidy on the imported Urea would be borne by the provinces. Another decision on November 15, 2023, determined that the cost recovery of the imported fertiliser would be made from the provinces. Since then, the government of Punjab conveyed that it would lift the imported urea by sharing the subsidy at a ratio of 50:50 between the federal and provincial governments. The government of Sindh committed to lifting its share of supply \u2013 52,800 MT (24% of 220,000 MT) on a full-cost basis. Replies from Balochistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa were awaited.\nIn short, provinces have not been able to commit to carrying the entire burden of subsidy. The Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP) informed that cost estimates for imports of Urea for the quantity 220,000 would be Rs27.489 billion, and the landed price of a 50 kg bag of Urea had been estimated at Rs6,248/bag. The National Fertiliser Marketing Limited (NFML) informed that the cost to be incurred by it on incidentals \u2013 transportation charges \u2013 storage/warehousing, etcetera, would be approximately Rs4,918.45 million.\nThe Ministry of Industries & Production further informed that the above situation was discussed in a meeting chaired by the prime minister on January 1, 2024. The following decisions were made: It was decided that locally manufactured urea and imported urea would be treated as one basket; Based on previous practices regarding local urea and full cost recovery of imported urea, a price matrix will be determined for local manufacturers of urea; A committee consisting of the following will engage urea manufacturers and finalise an implementation mechanism: secretary Petroleum Division; secretary, Ministry of Industries & Production; secretary Ministry of National Food Security & Research; secretary, and Ministry of Commerce.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 11th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

He met with PPP co-chairperson Asif Ali Zardari and his son, party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.\nHowever, in reality this was the second meeting between the two sides, with the first somewhat clandestine one held at Punjab caretaker Chief Minister Mohsin Naqvi\u2019s residence on February 9, where Nawaz\u2019s message was communicated to the PPP leadership.\nAccording to an insider, the PML-N supremo was expected to be present in the second meeting.\nHowever, a party source claimed that within the PPP, Shehbaz bringing a fleet of leaders along with him was also seen as the PML-N\u2019s lack of seriousness.\nThe PML-N delegation that met with the PPP leadership included Azam Nazeer Tarar, Ayaz Sadiq, Ahsan Iqbal, Rana Tanveer, Khawaja Saad Rafique, Malik Ahmad Khan, Marriyum Aurangzeb, and Shaza Fatima.\nIn light of the PML-N\u2019s proposal, the PPP has called its Central Executive Committee meeting in Islamabad on Monday (today) where its demand for the premiership was expected to be decided.\nMultiple sources have already told The Express Tribune that the PPP wanted the premiership for itself and not keen on giving this position to the PML-N leadership.\nPPP spokesperson Faisal Kareem Kundi has reportedly said his suggestion before the Central Executive Committee would be for his party to either have their premier or sit in the opposition benches if the PML-N did not agree to it.\nAccording to an official statement issued after this meeting, the participants expressed their commitment to putting the nation's interest and well-being above everything.\nThe leaders of both parties engaged in substantive discussions about the prevailing political landscape and the imperativeness of collaborative efforts for the betterment of the country.\nReflecting a spirit of consensus-building, the leaders acknowledged the importance of establishing a framework for sustained political cooperation between the PML-N and PPP, laying the groundwork for a stronger as well as more united approach to address the challenges faced by the nation.\n\u0644\u0627\u06c1\u0648\u0631: \u067e\u0627\u06a9\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u067e\u06cc\u067e\u0644\u0632\u067e\u0627\u0631\u0679\u06cc \u06a9\u06cc \u0642\u06cc\u0627\u062f\u062a \u0633\u06d2 \u0645\u0633\u0644\u0645 \u0644\u06cc\u06af \u0646 \u06a9\u0627 \u062d\u06a9\u0648\u0645\u062a \u0633\u0627\u0632\u06cc \u06a9\u06d2 \u0644\u0626\u06d2 \u067e\u06c1\u0644\u0627 \u0628\u0627\u0636\u0627\u0628\u0637\u06c1 \u0631\u0627\u0628\u0637\u06c1\n\n\u0644\u0627\u06c1\u0648\u0631: \u0645\u0633\u0644\u0645 \u0644\u06cc\u06af \u0646 \u06a9\u06d2 \u0635\u062f\u0631 \u0645\u06cc\u0627\u06ba \u0634\u06c1\u0628\u0627\u0632 \u0634\u0631\u06cc\u0641 \u067e\u0627\u06a9\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u067e\u06cc\u067e\u0644\u0632\u067e\u0627\u0631\u0679\u06cc \u0633\u06d2 \u062d\u06a9\u0648\u0645\u062a \u0633\u0627\u0632\u06cc \u0645\u06cc\u06ba \u062a\u0639\u0627\u0648\u0646 \u06a9\u06cc\u0644\u0626\u06d2 \u0628\u0644\u0627\u0648\u0644 \u06c1\u0627\u0624\u0633 \u067e\u06c1\u0646\u0686 \u06af\u0626\u06d2\n\n\u0644\u0627\u06c1\u0648\u0631: \u0635\u062f\u0631 \u067e\u06cc \u067e\u06cc \u067e\u06cc \u067e\u06cc \u0622\u0635\u0641 \u0639\u0644\u06cc \u0632\u0631\u062f\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u060c \u0686\u06cc\u0626\u0631\u0645\u06cc\u0646 \u067e\u06cc \u067e\u06cc \u067e\u06cc \u0628\u0644\u0627\u0648\u0644 \u0628\u06be\u0679\u0648 \u0632\u0631\u062f\u0627\u0631\u06cc \u0627\u0648\u0631\u2026 pic.twitter.com/bFTAo6JOPW\nThe key points of the discussion included the assessment of Pakistan's overall situation; deliberations on future political strategies; as well as exchange of recommendations aimed at promoting stability and progress across the board.\nBoth parties affirmed their dedication to steering the country away from political instability and towards a path of prosperity as well as resilience.\nHighlighting the mandate bestowed upon them by the majority of the nation, the leaders underscored their unwavering commitment to fulfilling the aspirations of the people.\nThey stressed the need for ensuring that the people\u2019s voices were heard and heeded.\nAs a concrete step towards further dialogue and collaboration, the PML-N committed to present its suggestions to the PPP\u2019s Central Executive Committee meeting, underscoring its willingness to actively contribute to the ongoing efforts aimed at enhancing political cohesion and efficacy.\nTalking to a private TV news channel, Irfan Siddiqui, a PML-N leader, when asked about PPP\u2019s desire of having their prime minister in the coalition set-up, said his party in its internal meeting had not decided its position on its former ally\u2019s demand for the premier\u2019s slot.\nHe said the PML-N was the majority party and that was why it had the prerogative of making its own premier.\nRead more: No talks on forming next govt, says MQM-P after PML-N moot\nSiddiqui added that the PML-N hoped that all parties in the alliance would adhere to democratic principles and norms.\nHe maintained that as of now, there had been no such concrete demand from either side in this connection.\nResponding to a query about the Nawaz being the PML-N\u2019s candidate for the premiership, he said if his party was in majority, this would have been a \u201cno questions asked\u201d scenario.\nHowever, he continued that as the PML-N lacked the simple majority, it would not want any decision to be imposed on its partners. He added that his party and its partners would want to collectively decide the matter.\nA PPP insider said his party wanted to see its leadership at the helm of affairs, but at this stage it was taking a cautious approach.\nHe said the PPP was busy roping in independent candidates quietly as opposed to the PML-N, which was celebrating its small victories.\nHe added that as the PML-N had the numerical advantage, the PPP wanted the dust to settle before makings its final decision.\nA senior PML-N leader said as of now both parties had in principle agreed to work together to prevent the country from drifting into anarchy and denied the impression of any impasse between the two sides.\nHe added that the PML-N had put forth its suggestions before the PPP leadership and they would further be presented before the party's Central Executive Committee meeting for ratification.\nThe PML-N leader said Nawaz was not the only candidate for the premiership and the party was ready to nominate Shehbaz for the position if it came to that.\nSeparately, an MQM-P delegation led by its convener Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, that was in Lahore since Saturday, held its meeting with Nawaz, Shehbaz and other PML-N leaders at the party supremo\u2019s residence in Jati Umra.\nApart from Siddiqui, the delegation included Dr Farooq Sattar, Kamran Tessori, and Mustafa Kamal.\nAfter the meeting, Siddiqui refuted reports about talks on forming the next government in the meeting.\nHe also denied that his party had sought the slot of the Sindh governor.\n\u0644\u0627\u06c1\u0648\u0631:

well as various options to get the country out of this quagmire have been discussed,\u201d Siddiqui told the media in Lahore.\n\u201cPakistan is facing a challenging situation and all the political parties as well as institutions should pull the country out of it,\u201d he added.\nHe stressed the need for saving democracy in the country even if politics had to be sacrificed.\n\u201cThe issue is not about power, but about the authority of the people and the stability of democracy.\u201d\nMQM-P leader Kamal, while talking to a private TV news channel, said even prior to the elections, his party had an understanding with the PML-N that they would work together in a coalition.\n\u201cSo this meeting [with the PML-N leadership] was not to discuss the number of ministries and positions we would receive,\u201d he maintained.\nKamal said the MQM-P\u2019s decision revolved around the issues faced by the people.\nHe continued that his party wanted to ask the PML-N what it would to address the grievances of the people.\n\u201cThis is the last chance for political parties to deliver.\u201d\nAfter the meeting, the PML-N released a statement saying the two parties had reached a \u201cprinciple agreement\u201d on working together.\n\u201cWe will work together in the interest of the country and public,\u201d the statement read, adding that \u201cbasic points\u201d had been agreed upon by both the parties.\nApart from contacting other parties, consultations were under way within the PML-N as well.\nA consultative meeting of the PML-N central leadership was held at the Jati Umra residence under the chairmanship of Nawaz in which the overall situation -- including the party\u2019s position, government formation, as well as relations with other political parties and independent members \u2013was discussed in detail.\nThe PML-N supremo was entrusted with the authority to nominate and convene meetings of party forums.\nNawaz was scheduled to pay a visit to PML-Q leader Chaudhry Shujaat at his residence. However, the meeting, apparently given its insignificance, was postponed. The PML-N supremo is expected to hold a meeting with JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman.\n"

            "Text": "The PTI-backed independent candidates have outperformed all other political parties in the general elections. Yet, the question being asked nowadays is whether these candidates can unite to form the next central government.\nAccording to party leader Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, the PTI was leading at 170 National Assembly seats before the election results were allegedly rigged in the PML-N\u2019s favour. He stated that the party intended to use legal avenues to highlight this rigging.\nBarrister Gohar\u2019s statement has come a day after PML-N supreme leader Nawaz Sharif declared in his victory speech that the PML-N has emerged as the single largest party in Center and Punjab following the February 8\u2019s general elections.\nTechnically, Nawaz was correct when he claimed that the PML-N emerged as the largest political party following the polls. This is because the PTI contested the general elections through independent candidates after losing its election symbol weeks before the polls due to failure to hold proper intra-party elections.\nCurrently, PTI-backed candidates hold 100 seats in the National Assembly, followed by the PML-N with 73 and the PPP with 54, out of a total of 266 seats in the lower house\nIncluding the 70 reserved seats brings the total number of seats to 336. For a simple majority, a party needs to have at least 169 seats in the National Assembly.\nPakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (PILDAT) President Ahmed Bilal Mehboob while answering different questions said, apparently, the PTI is not in a position to form the government without forming an alliance with major political parties like the PML-N or the PPP as it doesn\u2019t have the required number for claiming majority in the lower house of the Parliament.\nThe PILDAT chief also explained in detail what will happen if the PTI-affiliated independent candidates can join the PTI again during the three-day post-election period.\nHe said it was possible. However, Mehboob explained, it will be a long route as it is mandatory that the party that the independent candidates want to join must have a party symbol.\nTherefore, he said, if they want to join the PTI again, the PTI will have to hold intra-party elections and get its symbol back or any other symbol.\nThis exercise would enable PTI to get reserved seats in the National Assembly as well, he added, saying the condition about having a party symbol has been defined in Rule 94 of the ECP Rules of 2017.\nRead: PTI secures two-thirds majority in NA, claims Imran\nAnswering the question if PTI backed independents can join other registered parties like the MWM, Mehboob responded affirmatively, saying they can join the MWM or any other party.\nIf they do so, he said, they will be bound to follow that party\u2019s discipline. If the PTI-backed candidates join the MWM or any other party, they can get reserve seats as proportionate to their total number of seats in the NA.\nRoughly, if it happens, then they can get 25 to 27 seats provided their total seats remain around 100.\nTo get reserve seats after joining the MWM, Mehboob said the PTI-backed candidates will have to submit affidavits to the ECP stating that they were joining MWM or any other party.\nSubsequently, he said, the head of the MWM or the party they join will have to give in writing to the ECP that he/she has accepted the independent candidates. He said this can take place within the 72 hours once the ECP issues the final poll results.\nMehboob replied in the affirmative again when asked whether the MWM can form a government if it gets the most seats. \u201cFor forming a government or electing a PM,\u201d he said, \u201ca party needs to have at least 169 seats in the NA.\u201d\nHe said the question arises how will that number be achieved as the PTI-backed candidates\u2019 current strength is around 100. However, he explained another scenario in which the PTI can form a government.\nIf no one gets the magic figure of 169 out of 336 NA seats in the first round when the house elects the prime minister, he said, then anyone having majority in the house that day can elect the PM of their choice or form the government. \u201cWhoever has the majority in the second round can get the PM of their choice or form the government,\u201d he said.\nWhen asked as to what role the PTI-affiliated candidates can play if they combine into a non-party bloc, he said the independent candidates will not get reserve seats in that case and the 70 reserve seats will then be given to other parties based on their strength in the NA.\n"

PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh moved the SHC against NA-238 results and Arsalan Khalid against NA-248 results.\n\nThe petitions in the LHC requested the courts to set aside the Form-47 prepared by the Returning Officers (ROs) in their absence, hence depriving them of their right to witness consolidation process of the election\u2019s results.\n\nThe runner-ups contended that the police officials at the whims of the ROs of different constituencies forcefully restrained them from witnessing the process of result\u2019s consolidation. Their eviction from the ROs offices was a sheer violation of the fair electoral process.\n\nThe petitioners challenged the victories of Nawaz Sharif from NA-130, Maryam Nawaz from NA-119, Khawaja Asif from NA-71 Sialkot, Hamza Shehbaz from NA-118, Atta Tarar from NA-127, Saiful Maluk Khokhar from NA-126, Aleem Khan from NA-117 and in other constituencies.\n\nOn the five seats of the provincial assembly, the PTI\u2019s backed independent candidates challenged the results of PP-169, PP-53, PP-47, PP-62 and PP-46 on same ground of being evicted from the ROs offices, depriving them of their right to witness the consolidation process of the election\u2019s results.\n\nOn Friday, LHC Justice Ali Baqar Najafi restrained the authorities concerned from proceeding further on the results of NA-128 in absence of the petitioner, PTI-backed independent candidate Salman Akram Raja or his agent.\n\nIn Islamabad, PTI-backed Shoaib Shaheen told reporters on the IHC premises that they filed the petitions with the request for the immediate hearing of their petitions. \"Today, I and Ali Bukhari have filed petitions. We have requested the registrar's office to schedule an immediate hearing,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the results announced a day earlier, independent candidate Raja Khuram Shehzad Nawaz won the election for NA-48 Islamabad-III by securing 69,699 votes. However, Bukhari claimed that he was winning in the initial results but later he had been declared as the runner-up with 59,851 votes.\n\nA day earlier, Shaheen had slammed NA-47 results, where Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz\u2019s (PML-N) Tariq Fazal Chaudhry was declared victorious. Shaheen blamed the powers that be for \u201cpressuring the returning officers.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, you are replaying the crime you committed in the past. Now the only hope left is the judiciary,\u201d he said. \u201cThey took away our bat [PTI\u2019s electoral symbol]. I had a lead of more than 50,000 votes, my opponents had a total of 40,000 votes polled.\u201d\n\nIn the petition filed in the SHC, Haleem Adil Sheikh said that he received more than 71,000 votes in NA-238 constituency, but Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan\u2019s (MQM-P) candidate Sadiq Iftikhar was declared successful by changing the results in Form 47.\n\nArslan Khalid contended in his plea that he got 65,000 votes in NA-248 constituency according to Form 45 but the RO concerned declared MQM's Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui as successful in Form 47. He requested the court to suspend the Form 47 result.\n\nNawaz also challenged the electoral result of NA-15 Mansehra-II. In a writ petition, Nawaz stated that several areas of Manshera were facing difficulties in communication due to snowfall. The request mentioned that over 125 polling stations did not submit Form 45, yet the results were announced.\n\nMeanwhile, the ECP ordered re-polling at those polling stations in NA-88, Khushab, PS-18, Ghotki, PK-90, Kohat, where the polling material was snatched or destroyed. The re-polling would be held on February 15, after which the results would be announced, according to a press release.\n\n"

They clean-swept the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, and won a sizeable chunk in Punjab, according to the ECP Form-47 results.\nThe PTI could not contest the elections on Thursday because it was denied it electoral symbol of \u2018bat\u2019 due to its controversial intra-party elections.

            "Text": "The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) once again found itself under the hammer on Sunday after its workers and supporters hit the streets nationwide, accusing the system of electoral trickery and result manipulation in the general elections.\nA number of PTI workers, leaders, candidates, voters, and supporters mobilised across various constituencies, alleging tampering with election outcomes to undermine their democratic mandate.\nDemonstrations mushroomed across several cities including Lahore, Sialkot, Rawalpindi, Jhelum, Sumundari, Multan, Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Gujrat, Mansehra, Peshawar, Islamabad, Hyderabad, Karachi, and others.\nProvincial administrations responded by deploying substantial police forces in most of these areas where the party announced assemblies to voice their dissent against alleged attempts to undermine the public mandate bestowed upon the nation's most prominent political entity.\nIn Lahore, a robust police presence, bolstered by prisoner transport vehicles, was observed at Liberty Chowk to deter PTI activists and supporters.\nThroughout the day, officials from the police, anti-riot forces, elite units, and the Dolphin Squad convened at Liberty Chowk, instigating crackdowns against PTI demonstrators, voters, and their families gathered to protest alleged electoral manipulations in various National Assembly and provincial assemblies constituencies.\nAuthorities have also apprehended and detained numerous PTI workers and candidates, including Shehzad Farooq, the PTI candidate from NA-119 who contested against PML-N's Maryum Nawaz, for their involvement in protesting against purported election tampering.\nIn addition, law enforcement agencies resorted to dispersing PTI protestors in other cities through the use of tear gas and baton charges. Roads leading to returning officers\u2019 (ROs) offices across various cities have also been barricaded by police.\nPTI candidate Samira Elahi from Gujrat took to social media to draw attention to the purported house arrest of herself and her sister, Qasira Elahi, by the district administration, citing an excessive police presence.\nShe decried such treatment towards candidates as incomprehensible, affirming their commitment to counter all perceived conspiracies with the help of Allah Almighty.\nRawalpindi\nIn Rawalpindi, several PTI supporters were arrested by police after the latter sealed routes leading up to the entrance of the district election commission's office.\nA number of police officers were deployed in the area. The closure of the district office also impacted the road leading to the press club, resulting in journalists encountering challenges in gaining access to the press club.\nFollowing the closure of the ECP office, the PTI supporters gathered near Murree Road. The demonstrators expressed support in favour of party's incarcerated founding chairman Imran Khan.\nAll police stations have been directed to take action against protests taking place within their respective jurisdictions. The decision emphasises strict actions against any gathering or attempt to organise a rally within the jurisdiction of a police station.\nIn a related development, Rawalpindi Regional Police Officer (RPO) Syed Khurram Ali and City Police Officer (CPO) Rawalpindi Syed Khalid Hamdani took notice of violence against media personnel from a news channel during the protest in the Sadiqabad area.\nThe police authorities appointed an SP as the inquiry officer and summoned a report within the next 24 hours.\nRPO and CPO Rawalpindi acknowledged the severity of the violence against professional journalists, expressing deep concern over the incident.\nCPO Rawalpindi assured that stringent departmental measures would be initiated against the responsible official once a thorough investigation into the matter has been conducted.\nKarachi\nMeanwhile, demonstrations were also held outside the provincial election commission office in Karachi, where protesters raised concerns about alleged rigging and manipulation of election results.\nPTI leader Khurrum Sher Zaman, accompanied by fellow leaders, led the protest.\nDenouncing the \"robbery of public mandate,\" Khurrum asserted that Karachi was, and still is, PTI's turf.\nAlleging the theft of PTI\u2019s mandate, he alleged there were attempts to sow discord between PTI and the police.\n\u201cWe are peaceful Pakistanis,\u201d the PTI leader asserted while encouraging demonstrators to maintain peace and clarified that PTI had no intention of clashing with law enforcement.\nRead Protests against poll \u2018rigging\u2019 rock Balochistan\nHe further declared the party's decision to take the battle to the courts, submitting relevant applications to address their grievances.\nKhurrum Sher Zaman announced plans to present Form 45 in court, adding that the PTI has already filed an application in this regard.\nIn a later statement, he revealed that his residence underwent a raid the previous night.\nCondemning what he termed \"unjust and intimidatory tactics,\" Khurrum called on the Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP), Chief of Army Staff (COAS), and Inspector General (IG) Sindh to take notice of the alleged harassment against him and his family.\n"

We will proceed and form a government in accordance with the constitution and the law,\" he clarified.\n\"We will constitute the government in Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and the Centre, and the announcement of the KP chief minister will be made in two days.\u201d\nTaking a dig at former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, Gohar stated, \"Nawaz Sharif does not have a majority in the NA, but he still considers himself the prime minister.\"He said the elections were held freely and peacefully and today is a very important day in the democratic history of Pakistan. The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) should immediately announce all results.\nHe highlighted that, according to the law, it was the commission's duty to release results by 2am, yet the announcement was delayed until 10am. The reasons for this deviation from the scheduled time need clarification, he added.\nHe said that presiding officers counted votes and prepared Form 45, however, results were stopped around midnight and an attempt was made to snatch public mandate. The PTI chief said the results should be made according to Form 45 as they had received all those forms.\nHe also announced to hold peaceful protests on Saturday outside those RO offices, who have not announced the result yet. He warned that the economy would not be able to tolerate the suppression of peoples' voice and forming a desired government.\n\u201cNo obstacle should be created for the PTI and results should be announced as soon as possible. As per the law, the final result is extracted from Form 45 and we have received all the results,\u201d he said adding that the final results should be announced before 12am tonight.\nRead: Public\u2019s poll participation reflects confidence in Imran: PTI\nGohar said their independent candidates were in contact with the party. They were loyal to the party and would remain so, he added. He said that the party would make their independent government while ruling out the possibility of collation with the Pakistan Peoples\u2019 Party (PPP).\nHe said the PTI would go towards intra-party elections within 15 days after completion of the process. The people had given a big mandate to the PTI, he maintained.He underscored that all cases against the PTI founding chairman Imran Khan were fake and fabricated. \"It was merely political victimisation. It is the responsibility of the superior judiciary to look into the affairs of the lower courts.\"\nAnswering a question, Gohar said Imran Khan is the chairman of PTI and will remain the party chairman.\n\u201cThough, I may be in the driving seat but Imran Khan is my leader and he will decide who will be the next prime minister of Pakistan. The party will soon announce its strategy regarding reserved seats as well as what party they should join.\u201d\nGohar also gave a call for peaceful protest in front of returning officers\u2019 offices across Pakistan where results are being delayed or an attempt is made to snatch public mandate.\n\u201cThe workers are requested that protest is a right, but it should be peaceful. Workers should bring national and party flags with them. They should remain peaceful in all circumstances,\u201d he stressed and asked police and other law enforcement agencies not to create hurdles in peaceful protest.\nHe said advertently an attempt was made to defeat them on the seats they had won. He claimed that the PTI had won elections on 170 seats of the National Assembly. He further claimed that the party has secured a two-thirds majority in the K-P and bagged 180 seats of the Punjab Assembly.\n"

            "Text": "Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said on Saturday that no government could be formed at the Centre and in Punjab and Balochistan provinces without the inclusion of his party, but made it clear that so far, no such had taken place with any political party.\nIn an interview with a private news channel, Bilawal said he still awaited the completion of the vote count in all constituencies before engaging in discussions on cobbling up alliances for the formation of governments.\nAccording to Bilawal, any party taking shot at the government formation at the Centre, and in Punjab, besides Balochistan, would require the support of the PPP lawmakers, whose number is 54 in the National Assembly, 10 in Punjab Assembly and 11 in Balochistan Assembly.\nThere is no majority party in these assemblies. The PTI-backed independents are the largest group in the National Assembly with nearly 100 members, followed by the PML-N with 73, while both are tied at 134 in the Punjab. The PTI-backed independents won in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and the PPP in Sindh.\n\"So far, there have been no formal talks with either the PML-N, PTI, or any other political party,\" Bilawal told the channel. \"We are waiting for the completion of the vote count in all constituencies, and the results to be unveiled,\" he added.\nThe interview came a day after the PML-N Quaid Nawaz Sharif announced that his party intended to form a government at the Centre and in Punjab with support of potential allies. He tasked former prime minister Shehbaz Sharif to contact the potential allies and win over their support.\nIn this regard, reports had suggest that Shehbaz had met the PPP leadership, including Bilawal and former president Asif Zardari in Lahore. He also reached out to the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) by the telephone, inviting them to Lahore for further talks.\nBefore Thursday\u2019s elections, the PPP Central Executive Committee had nominated Bilawal as their candidate for prime minister. Bilawal said that if this decision needed to be changed, \u201cwe will once again convene\u201d the CEC meeting.\nBilawal underscored the importance of a \u201cpolitical consensus\u201d and a \u201cnational unity\u201d government, without which, he stressed, the government would face challenges in delivering effective governance. \"A government should be formed with national unity to bring political stability,\u201d he said.\nRead:\u00a0PPP clean sweeps Sindh\nWhen asked about any contacts with the PTI-backed independents, who formed the largest group in the National Assembly, the PPP chief remarked: \"Some informal contacts are present in our relationships, but so far, there has been no contact with the PTI bloc.\"\nSpeaking about his own agenda for the future government, Bilawal stressed that that people\u2019s problems could not be address without addressing the core national issue of political instability. He emphasised that he wanted political stability in the country.\n\"I want to end the politics of hate and division. I cannot indulge in the old style of politics. We want to bring political stability in our country,\" he told the interviewer. \"It is in the country's interest to build political unity,\u201d he added.\nAsked about the credibility of the elections, Bilawal said that he was not disappointed with the voting. However, he appeared critical, when he said that he was winning in Lahore with a big margin at midnight on February 8 but the situation was entirely changed in the morning.\nPolitical analysts indicate that any coalition, involving the PML-N, the PPP and the MQM-P would be another version of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM)-led coalition government in the country after the removal of the PTI government through a no-confidence motion in April 2022.\nSome media reports suggested that in their overnight talks in Lahore, the PML-N and the PPP agreed to form a coalition government at the Centre and Punjab but sides were reluctant to confirm the development.\n\u201cHe [Bilawal] clarified the PPP party position with unambiguous clarity: at NO point after the election has the party spoken with N League on Federal, Balochistan or Punjab government formation,\u201d PPP Senator Sherry Rehman said in her tweet.\nSimilarly, PML-N spokesperson Marriyum Aurangzeb said in a separate tweet that no final decisions had been taken in the meeting between Shahbaz and Zardari. \u201cFurther discussion has been agreed upon; Mr. Asif Zardari will definitely consult his party,\u201d she wrote in a tweet on \u2018X\u2019.\nAurangzeb underscored that independent winners were \u201cvery important\u201d in the electoral process but said that the PML-N remained the largest party in the federation. \u201cWe recognize the mandate of all. Tomorrow is an important meeting,\u201d she added.\n"

He entered the National Assembly in 1993 by defeating Mir Murtaza Bhutto, the brother of Benazir Bhutto, in Badin.\nAfter a break from politics, Dr Fehmida entered the political arena and won as MNA from her husband's constituency in 1996. She continued her electoral success in the same constituency until the 2018 general elections.\nDr Zulfiqar distanced himself from the PPP leadership in 2010, while Dr Fehmida and their son Hasnain remained with the party until 2015. In 2018, the family joined the Grand Democratic Alliance, securing MNA and MPA positions from Badin and Tando Bago seats.\nIn 2018, Dr Zulfiqar faced defeat at the hands of the PPP's Muhammad Ismail Rahu from Shaheed Fazal Rahu taluka. The family also introduced their younger son, Muhammad Hassam Mirza, in local government and general elections, but he failed to secure a prominent position.\nIn 2024, the Mirza family faced uncertainty as their nomination papers were initially rejected, only to be approved by the court a few days before the election day.\nHasnain Mirza was defeated by the PPP's Arbab Ameer Amanullah from Tando Bago, while Hassam Mirza faced losses in both provincial and National Assembly seats in Badin.\n"

            "Text": "A day after the election results were announced, protests erupted in several districts of Sindh on Saturday, as losing candidates and their political parties alleged irregularities in the vote counting system. The Jamaat-e-Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) has called for widespread protests on February 11.\nMaulana Rashid Mehmood Soomro, the provincial leader of JUI-F, led a sit-in outside a temporary office of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in Sukkur district on Saturday. Soomro claimed that the results were manipulated to favour the Pakistan Peoples Party and warned of blocking the National Highway at 28 different locations in Sindh from Karachi to Kashmore. He set a deadline of 8am on February 11 for the ECP to accept their demands.\nSoomro demanded the issuance of Form 47 declaring JUI-F's Mubeen Ahmed as the winner from Sukkur and other candidates from their respective constituencies in the districts of Larkana division. Close contests were observed in some constituencies of Larkana division between the PPP and JUI-F. The PPP secured NA-191 Jacobabad with a slim margin of around 3,000 votes against JUI-F's Shahzain Khan, who garnered 100,652 votes.\nIn Badin district, candidates from the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA), led by former speaker of the National Assembly Dr Fehmida Mirza and former Sindh home minister Dr Zulfiqar Mirza, along with their supporters, held a sit-in protest at DC Chowk. Dr Zulfiqar alleged organised rigging through the District Returning Officers (DROs) and Returning Officers (ROs) in these elections, accusing the PPP of imposing mafias in the guise of elected representatives on the people of Badin.\nMeanwhile, in Dadu district, former Sindh chief minister Liaquat Ali Jatoi, fighting on GDA's ticket, accused the ROs of rigging the polling outcomes. Jatoi lost both his seats, NA-227 and PS-81, to his PPP rivals, claiming that rigging occurred, and his supporters and polling agents were assaulted in many places. Another GDA candidate from Dadu on PS-82, Aashiq Ali Zaunr, asserted having evidence of rigging which he plans to submit before the tribunal.\nEven the PPP faced protests against alleged rigging. Ali Muhammad Sahito and Abdul Jabbar Khan, the party's contestants from NA-219 and PS-62 in Hyderabad, blocked Hyderabad bypass in protest late on Friday night, burning tires and disrupting traffic. They alleged unjustified delays in announcing results for their constituencies and NA-220 and PS-64, accusing the changes to favour MQM-P.\nIn Mirpurkhas, supporters of independent candidate Salamat Lakho reportedly assaulted presiding staff with batons at polling station number 313 at Iqra Higher Secondary School on Friday. The presiding officer, Ali Hassan Panhwar, lodged a complaint with the Satellite police station on Saturday, nominating Lakho and his supporters for attacking them with batons and axes.\n"

As many as 13 independent candidates also succeed in reaching Sindh Assembly. In case of independent candidates joining political parties, the quota of specific seats of these parties will increase further. The Election Commission has ordered a re-poll at two polling stations of PS-18.\nAccording to the election results, PPP won 10 seats from Karachi, 74 seats from other districts of Sindh and a total of 84 provincial assembly seats. According to conservative estimates, the PPP is likely to get 19 seats for women and 6 seats for minorities. In this way, the number of People's Party members in the Sindh Assembly by completing the century will reach to 109.\nMQM Pakistan won 25 seats from Karachi, 3 from Hyderabad and a total of 28 seats. MQM is expected to get 6 reserved seats for women and 2 reserved seats for minorities, after which MQM-P number of seats in in Sindh Assembly is expected to reach 37 seats, while GDA and Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) are expected to get 1 reserved seat each for women. Thus their number of candidates will reach to three each in the provincial assembly.\nThe electorate in Karachi has also chosen 10 independent candidates, while three independents were elected from other districts. These 13 successful candidates are required to affiliate with a political party within three days of receiving notification of their victory. Following their affiliation, the party they join stands to benefit from an expanded quota of reserved seats. The House of Sindh Assembly consists of 168 members. There are 130 general seats, 29 reserved seats for women and nine for minorities.\nIf we look at the 2018 general elections, GDA failed to save the mandate it got in 2018. In 2018, GDA had won 11 general seats of Sindh Assembly from Badin, Shikarpur, Larkana and Khairpur.\nThree former Chief Ministers Ghous Ali Shah, Liaquat Jatoi and Arbab Rahim also faced defeat in 2024 general elections.\nIn 2018 general elections, MQM won 13 Sindh Assembly seats, out of which 10 were from Karachi and 3 from Hyderabad. MQM won 15 more Sindh Assembly seats in 2024 general elections than in 2018.\nIn 2018, Jamaat-e-Islami had won one seat in Sindh Assembly, while in 2024 it got two seats. Similarly, in 2018 elections TLP had won two seats of Sindh Assembly, while in 2024 it failed to win even a single seat.\n"

He urged them to recognize and address the grave human rights violations perpetrated by the Indian authorities and to work towards the implementation of United Nations resolutions that guarantee the Kashmiri people\u2019s right to self-determination.\nHe emphasized that the decades-long struggle of the Kashmiri people for freedom and justice is unparalleled and deserves the earnest attention and support of the global community.\nThe chief minister vehemently condemned the unilateral decision of the Indian government to revoke the special status of occupied Kashmir and the subsequent imposition of a stringent lockdown by Indian forces.\nHe emphasized that such actions only serve to exacerbate tensions and perpetuate suffering among the Kashmiri populace. He stressed the urgent need for a peaceful and equitable resolution to the Kashmir issue in accordance with the aspirations of the Kashmiri people, emphasizing that sustainable peace in the region hinges upon addressing this longstanding conflict.\nMeanwhile, the Arts Council organized a poignant event to commemorate Kashmir Solidarity Day, featuring a series of activities aimed at raising awareness and expressing solidarity with the Kashmiri people.\nThe event commenced with a solemn flag hoisting ceremony, where the flags of Pakistan and Azad Kashmir were raised in unison as a symbol of solidarity and resilience. A minute of silence was observed to honor the countless Kashmiris enduring oppression and hardship in occupied territory, underscoring the gravity of the situation and the urgent need for international intervention.\nThe exhibition showcased a variety of artistic expressions, including thought-provoking tableaus, impassioned speeches, and soul-stirring Kashmiri song competitions, all aimed at highlighting the plight of the Kashmiri people and amplifying their voices on the global stage.\nRepresentatives from the All Party Hurriyat Conference Azad Kashmir Pakistan Chapter, including Sheikh Abdul Mateen and Information Secretary Imtiaz Wani, reiterated the urgency of addressing the Kashmir issue and reaffirmed the Kashmiri people\u2019s steadfast demand for self-determination as a prerequisite for lasting peace and stability in the region.\n"

Leveraging the power of social media and national newspaper advertisements, they vie for the attention and support of Mardan\u2019s electorate.\nAll eyes are fixed on the electoral battleground of NA-22 Mardan-II, where ANP has pinned its hopes on former chief minister Hoti, while PTI rallies behind the candidacy of Atif Khan.\nThe contest is expected to be intense, given Hoti\u2019s previous victories in 2013 and 2018, where he secured the seat with 44,769 and 78,911 votes, respectively, narrowly defeating his PTI rival by a slim margin of 35 votes in the latter election.\nAs the political rivals vie for support from influential clans and communities, the electoral landscape of Mardan unfolds with multiple contenders across various constituencies.\nIn NA-21 Mardan-I, former MNA Mujahid Khan, now an independent candidate, faces off against candidates from ANP, PPP, and JUI-F. Mujahid Khan\u2019s previous victories in 2013 and 2018 underscore his electoral prowess, having secured successive wins against competitors from JUI-F and ANP.\n"

            "Text": "With barely a few days left in the general election, turnout for the democratic exercise in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) is expected to be lower compared to previous elections owing to multiple factors.\nPopulace of the northwestern province, which is home to sixteen per cent of National Assembly seats of the country, might not turn out to vote in large droves come February 8th due to an increase in terrorism, target killings, and large scale arrests of the supporters and leaders of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).\nK-P was rocked with 631 instances of terrorism in the preceding year, 2023, and so far this year 23 incidents of terrorism have been reported in the southern and tribal districts of the province. In this regard, a retired official of the armed forces, Mehmood Shah, who is an independent security expert, told The Express Tribune that increasing attacks in the province, especially by the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), suggest that election day will be violent.\n\u201cEven in the last general election, the TTP targeted ANP, and this time around we have seen the organisation target Jamiat-e-Ulema Islam Fazl (JUI-F). Therefore elections will need to be conducted with a foolproof security plan to avoid any untoward incident,\u201d he elaborated.\nHowever, whether the security plan is foolproof or not, the security expert predicted that due to the threat of terrorism, the populace in the southern and tribal districts of the province would not turn out in large numbers.\nApart from the terrorism threat, the crackdown on PTI, after the May 9th protests, might serve as a deterrent for voting as well, especially for those who support the party and wish to vote for it. This deterrence might also have exacerbated ever since the founding chairman of the party, Imran Khan, was convicted in two separate criminal cases. In this regard, Dr Shah Nawaz, assistant professor in the political science department of Islamia College, Peshawar, was of the view that turnout in the election would indeed decrease in the upcoming general election compared to the 2018 general election. \u201cThere are other reasons for why the turnout may be low as well. Firstly, the extremely cold weather in the upper regions. Secondly, people have lost hope in the system and might not wish to vote,\u201d Dr Nawaz explained.\nIt is pertinent to mention that election turnout has already seen a downward trend in the province. As per the Election Commission of Pakistan, the turnout in the elections held in the country in 2013 was more than 55 per cent, however, in the 2018 general elections, the turnout decreased to between 50 to 51 per cent.\n\u00a0\n"

            "Text": "The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) failed to meet the legal requirement of keeping the variation in population to less than 10 per cent in a total of 135 constituencies \u2013 70 National Assembly and 65 provincial assembly seats, it emerged on Sunday.\nShocking as it may seem, voters in these 135 constituencies would be electing a member of the National Assembly each but the difference between the highest and lowest number of registered voters in some constituencies is so huge that, in one case, one constituency equals to almost five.\nFor instance, NA-67 Hafizabad has the highest number of registered voters \u2013 810,723 \u2013 while NA-244 Karachi West-I has the lowest number of registered voters 155,824; showing that varying voter-to-population ratios among NA, PA constituencies weakens the equal suffrage.\nThe disparity has been detected by the Free & Fair Elections Network (Fafen) in its report pertaining to delimitation of constituencies. It was released on Sunday, just four days before the country is all set to go to the Feb 8 general elections.\n\u201cEquality of population among the constituencies in an assembly also needs to be adhered to in the spirit of Section 20 (3) of the Elections Act 2017 (Principles of Delimitation), which restricts the population variation to 10 per cent,\u201d Fafen said.\nNotwithstanding Rule 10(5) of the Elections Act, 2017 that enables the ECP to restrict the population variation among the constituencies in a district, Fafen holds the population variation must be seen on the basis of the constituencies in an assembly as specifically provided in the law.\nOn that basis, it said, at least \u201c70 NA and 65 PA constituencies did not comply with the legal requirement of Section 20 (3) of the Elections Act 2017\u201d.\nIt said that Punjab has the highest number of National Assembly constituencies (28) with a variation in population of more than 10 per cent, followed by 21 in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, 18 in Sindh, and three in Balochistan.\nOf the 65 provincial assembly constituencies that did not fulfil the legal requirement, it reads, 20 are in K-P, 18 in Punjab, 16 in Balochistan and 11 in Sindh.\nIn K-P, the report reveals, NA-18 Haripur has the highest number of registered voters (724,915), while NA-12 Kohistan Upper-cum-Kohistan Lower-cum-Kolai Pallas Kohistan has the lowest (196,125).\nIn Sindh, NA-209 Sanghar-I has the highest number of registered voters (607,638), whereas NA-244 Karachi West-I has the lowest number of registered voters (155,824).\nIn Balochistan, NA-255 Sohbatpur-cum-Jaffarabad-cum-Usta Mohammad-cum-Nasirabad has the highest number of registered voters (532,537), while NA-264 Quetta-III has the lowest number of registered voters (196,752).\nRead:\u00a0ECP admits grappling with shortage of special security papers\nIn Punjab, NA-67 Hafizabad has the highest number of registered voters (810,723), while NA-124 Lahore-VIII has the lowest number of registered voters (310,116). Among the three NA constituencies in Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), NA-47 ICT-II has the highest number of registered voters, with 433,202, while its neighbouring constituency, NA-48 ICT-III, has the lowest 292,380 voters.\nExamining the provincial assembly constituencies also reveals similar trends.\nIn Punjab, it reads, PP-7 Rawalpindi-I has the highest number of registered voters (386,073), while PP-11 Rawalpindi has the lowest number of registered voters (125,852).\nIn Sindh, PS-110 Karachi South-V has the highest number of registered voters (315,655), whereas PS-116 Karachi West-I has the lowest number of registered voters (43,045).\nIn K-P, PK-93 Hangu has the highest number of registered voters (325,951), while PK-33 Kolai Palas Kohistan has the lowest number of registered voters (43,481).\nIn Balochistan, PB-51 Chaman has the highest number of registered voters (194,081), and PB-45 Quetta-VIII has the lowest number of registered voters (50,160).\nThe voter-to-population ratio across different regions and constituencies also exhibits a diverse pattern.\nPunjab leads in voter registration, with 57 per cent of its total population registered as voters, while Balochistan has the lowest voter registration, with only 36 per cent of its total population registered.\nK-P shows a 53 per cent voter registration rate, Sindh follows closely with 48.5 per cent voter registration, and Islamabad records a voter registration rate of 45.8 per cent.\nOf the 216 NA constituencies with available population statistics, 45 constituencies have over 60 per cent of their population registered as voters.\nAdditionally, 114 constituencies fall within the range of 51 to 60 per cent of their population being registered as voters, while 52 constituencies have voter registration rates between 30 and 50 per cent.\nNotably, five constituencies, including one in K-P and two each in Sindh and Balochistan, have less than 30 per cent of their population registered as voters.\nAcross NA constituencies, NA-51 Rawalpindi-cum-Murree has 84.3 per cent of the constituency\u2019s population registered as voters, which is the highest across Pakistan.\nConversely, NA-244 West-I has only 16.5 per cent voter-to-population ratio.\nIn K-P, NA-16 Abbottabad-I has 79.3 per cent population registered as voters, while NA-12 Kohistan Upper-cum-Kohistan Lower-Cum-Kolai Pallas Kohistan has only 18.8 per cent population registered as voters. In Punjab, the registered voters in NA-51 Rawalpindi-cum-Murree are 84.3 per cent of the constituency\u2019s population, while in NA-125 Lahore-IX, the share of registered voters in the constituency\u2019s population is only 37.9 per cent.\nIn Sindh, NA-241 South-III has 60.7 per cent of population registered as voters, while NA-235 East-I and NA-244 West-I, the share of voters in the population is only 16.6 per cent and 16.5 per cent, respectively.\nIn Balochistan, the constituencies with the highest and lowest share of registered voters are NA-263 Quetta-II (46.9 per cent) and NA-274 Quetta III (21.6 per cent).\nRevealing the reason behind the disparities, Fafen said that multiple factors may contribute to these disparities, including the presence of Afghan, Behari, Bengali, Burmese, etc, populations in specific geographical pockets; internal migration patterns play a role, as individuals may be counted in one geographical area based on their residence for work or other reasons, while their voter registration remains in their native areas; and under-registration plausibly of women.\nHowever, it said, \u201cThe ECP may dwell into specific reasons in an effort to ensure the principle of equal suffrage in its true spirit.\u201d\n"

            "Text": "Kashmir Solidarity Day will be observed on Monday to express whole-hearted support of the Pakistani nation to the just struggle of Kashmiri people for their inalienable right to self-determination under the UN resolutions.\nThe Ministry of Kashmir Affairs said in a statement on Sunday that arrangements had been made to observe the day at home and abroad in a grand manner. A one-minute silence will be observed at 09:30 am to pay homage to the Kashmiri martyrs, it added.\nTo mark the day, the ministry said, solidarity walks would be organised across the country. In Islamabad, it added, a rally would be held in solidarity with the Kashmiri people on the Constitution Avenue to be led by cabinet members.\nThe event would be joined by the parliamentarians and people belonging to different walks of life. Posters and billboards would be displayed on important roads, airports, and railway stations to highlight the plight of Kashmiri people.\nIn connection with the day, debate and declamation contests as well as essay writing competitions will be organised in educational institutions. The media will broadcast special programmes to express solidarity with the oppressed Kashmiris of IIOJK.\nIn his message on the eve of Kashmir Solidarity Day, Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar said that India\u2019s illegal and unilateral actions of August 5, 2019 were a blatant violation of international law including the UN Charter, 4th Geneva Convention and the relevant UN Security Council resolutions.\n\u201cIndia has since been engaged in efforts to further entrench these illegal measures through a series of steps aimed at altering the demographic structure and political landscape of IIOJK [Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir],\u201d the prime minister said.\nHe said that the \u2018Kashmir Solidarity Day\u2019 was an occasion to pay rich tribute to the sacrifices made by their Kashmiri brothers and sisters during the last 76 years, he added. \u201cPakistan will continue to extend its unstinted moral, diplomatic and political support for this just cause,\u201d he added.\nMeanwhile, Special Assistant to Prime Minister for Human Rights and Women Empowerment Mushaal Hussein Mullick has said that Kashmir Solidarity Day serves as a reminder that the people of Jammu and Kashmir are not alone in their struggle against the Indian illegal occupation.\nRead:\u00a0PAC hosts vibrant Kashmir solidarity event\nAddressing a press conference along with senior Hurriyyat leaders Farooq Rehmani, Ghulam Muhammad Safi and Mehmood Ahmad Saghar, the SAPM reiterated the unwavering support of the people of Pakistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), for their Kashmiri brethren in their just struggle.\nShe described the people of Jammu and Kashmir as a barrier against Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s attempts to create an Akhand Bharat. She likened the Hindutva regime of India to the Zionist regime of Israel, terming them significant threats to world peace.\nShe asserted that both Modi and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were in a race to committee genocides \u2013 with Modi pursuing a brutal genocide in Kashmir and Netanyahu in the Palestine territory of Gaza.\nExpressing deep concern over the situation in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK), Mullick lamented the Indian government\u2019s ban on representative political parties that voice the aspirations of the people in IIOJK.\nShe expressed the fear that her husband, Yasin Malik, a prominent figure in IIOJK, might be unfairly targeted and made a scapegoat for Modi\u2019s electoral triumph. She asserted that India was actively altering the demographics of the IIOJK by granting Kashmiri domiciles to non-Kashmiris.\nShe highlighted the historical stance of the people of IIOJK in boycotting farce elections in the region.\nShe cautioned that any potential increase in turnout during the upcoming September elections could be attributed to the illegal settlements and the illegal issuance of Kashmiri domiciles to non-Kashmiris.\nMullick expressed concern about the eradication of Muslim heritage under the auspices of the Modi government. She said that the inauguration of the Ram Mandir by Modi at the site where the historic Babri Masjid once stood was seen by the RSS and extremist Hindus as a triumph for Hindutva.\nShe further said that the RSS had a transnational terror network, actively conducting operations in various countries, including the US, Canada, Australia, the UK and Pakistan. She urged the international community to make concerted efforts to curb the expansion of the RSS terror network.\nMullick mentioned the establishment of the Kashmir Consultative Committee under her leadership, aimed at formulating recommendations on Kashmir issue for the upcoming administration\u2019s consideration.\nShe also highlighted her collaboration with the Higher Education Commission (HEC) to establish Kashmir cells in universities throughout Pakistan and AJK. She also highlighted the creation of district-level Kashmir committees, designed to raise awareness about the Kashmir issue at the grassroots level.\n"

            "Text": "Citizens and experts expressed their concern about the Capital Development Authority (CDA) moving to re-establish the Islamabad zoo in what they believe is a violation of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) verdict, in a meaningful discussion held on an online forum.\nTheir main objection was that in the absence of technical and financial capacity to regain the land required to establish a proper zoo facility, the CDA would attempt to keep the zoo animals caged in improper conditions, which they described as \u201cthe worst form of cruelty\u201d.\nThe online discussion was organised by Development Communications Network (Devcom) Pakistan and DTN on Saturday afternoon.\nDuring the discussion, the well-known biodiversity expert, Zahid Baig Mirza said, \u201cThe CDA cannot fool the cabinet to take a favourable decision on its summary in the presence of IHC verdict that had asked to end the cruelty against animals, and free the animals in their habitats\u201d.\n\u201cThe CDA\u2019s attempt to re-establish the zoo in Islamabad by grabbing the land is a \u2018mischievous\u2019 act by the officials. They know they cannot do it except by misguiding the Federal Cabinet, but the biodiversity lovers will not support any uncalled-for decision by the CDA Board or the Federal Cabinet.\u201d\nIslamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB) chairperson, Rina Saeed Khan, was of the view that the reopening of Islamabad Zoo should not be included in the agenda of the cabinet meeting without thoroughly consulting law and climate change ministries.\nThe now-closed Islamabad Zoo was handed over to Islamabad Wildlife Management Board in July 2019 by the Federal Cabinet by the IHC\u2019s orders which were given following the deaths of almost all animals inside the old zoo.\nShe said, \u201cIn 2020 when the Islamabad Zoo was shut down by the landmark judgment of the IHC, the IWMB converted the site into the only wildlife rescue centre of its kind in Pakistan, helping all species of wild animals in distress.\u201d\nSince its formal inception in 2021, the centre has successfully rescued and rehabilitated approximately 381 animals. IWMB rescues orphaned and injured wildlife to implement the IHC order the specifically states that \u201cNo animal (shall be) treated in a manner that subjects it to unnecessary pain and suffering\u201d.\nAnother senior biodiversity expert, Dr Ejaz Ahmed said, \u201cThough zoos play an important role in education and awareness regarding different species and their behaviour, it is only the case if animals are kept with care.\u201d\n\u201cBut we have seen that due to poor management and lack of care, the majority of species are depressed and kept in a very unhygienic environment, which results in poor health conditions and abnormal behaviour in animals,\u201d he explained.\n"

            "Text": "As voters brace for the upcoming general elections on February 8, the electoral landscape of the NA-57, spanning Rawalpindi\u2019s urban, cantonment, and rural areas, promises an intriguing battle among candidates from various political affiliations.\nThe contest features candidates from Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), an independent female candidate supported by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Awami Muslim League (AML), Jamat-e-Islami (JI), and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), setting the stage for a closely watched electoral showdown.\nRemarkably, this election marks a historic departure from conventional political fervour.\nNotably absent are the flags of political parties adorning the rooftops, motorcycles, or vehicles across Rawalpindi city and cantonment. Equally striking is the absence of dedicated electoral offices, despite enticing offers. Previously, the election rallies at Liaquat Bagh have faltered in pulling huge crowds.\nThe public's non-participation in corner meetings has prompted candidates to try wedding-party-style gatherings with delectable food for participants.\nWith a total of 29 candidates in the fray, key contenders include Barrister Daniyal of PML-N, Mukhtar Abbas of PPP, independent woman candidate Seemabia Tahir Satti with PTI's backing, Sheikh Rashid Shafiq of AML, Mirza Khalid Mehmood of JI, Abdul Majid Hussain of JUI, Syed Rashid Hussain Shah of Pakistan Falah Party, and Chaudhry Rizwan Younis of TLP.\nNA-57 boasts a voter count of 0.43, with 222,434 male voters and 209,077 female voters. The constituency encompasses 326 polling stations\u2014156 for men, 155 for women, and 15 combined stations\u2014supported by 780 polling booths, 398 for men and 382 for women. A team of 326 presiding officers, 1,560 assistant presiding officers, and 780 polling officers will oversee the electoral process.\nGeographically, NA-57 includes sections of Chak Lala Cantonment, Tumhasimabad, Rahmabad, Scheme 3, Railway Colonies, City areas, Muslim Town, Khurram Colony, Chah Sultan, Duhok Khaba, Duhok Farman Ali, Chamanzar Colony, City, Shakrial one, two, and three, Khanna Dak one and two, and surrounding settlements.\nWhile no indigenous community resides here, the constituency is home to a diverse population, including Rajas, Abbasis, Sattis, Chaudharys, Maliks, Sheikhs, and Kashmiris. Former PML-N adviser Chaudhry Sarfraz Afzal and Sheikh Arsalan Hafeez have expressed discontent over ticket distribution.\nA unique aspect of this election is the candidates' individualistic approach, with many seeking votes for themselves rather than their party panels. Even candidates for provincial seats are individually campaigning for their positions. The electoral landscape is marked by various incentives, including flour, sugar, monetary gifts, and pots of biryani delivered to households.\nHowever, candidates express astonishment at the overall lack of cooperation from the public, evident in the non-participation in corner meetings and the reluctance to offer services for polling agents. Door-to-door campaigns face challenges, with voters barely opening their doors to accept manifesto brochures without engaging fully with candidates' speeches. This election stands out in history as the first where candidates collectively experience a palpable sense of apprehension.\nPrevious winners of this seat include Sheikh Rashid Ahmad, Sheikh Rashid Shafiq, Imran Khan, and Hanif Abbasi.\n\u00a0\n"

            "Text": "The National Assembly (NA) 56 constituency of Rawalpindi city is anxiously awaiting a neck-and-neck electoral contest among 31 candidates including political big guns Sheikh Rashid Ahmad, Hanif Abbasi and Shehryar Rizwan on February 8.\nThe constituency, labelled as the Lal Haeli constituency and is a hub of commercial activities, will have Sheikh Rashid of the AML, Hanif Abbasi of the PML-N, Shehryar Riaz of [the PTI], Sameera Gull of the PPP, Sajjad Akbar Abbasi of the TLP, Imran Shafiq of the JI, Sharjeel Mir of the IPP, and 21 independent candidates in the electoral fray.\nSince 1985 Sheikh Rashid has completed a double hat-trick of electoral wins from this constituency, but this time the situation doesn\u2019t look favourable for the former federal minister who is incarcerated in Adiala Jail and will contest the polls while remaining in jail.\nThe NA-56 has 523,683 voters, of which 272,459 are male voters and 251,274 are female voters. A total of 326 polling stations including 156 for men, 155 for women, and 15 joint polling stations have been established. As many as 31 polling stations have been declared sensitive. There are 780 polling booths out of which 398 are for men and 382 for women. A total of 371 Presiding Officers (POs), 1.880 Assistant Presiding Officers (AOs), and 940 Polling Officers (POs) have been appointed.\nMajor communities in the constituency are Sheikh, Chaudhary, Malik, Kashmiri, Khan, Rajgan, and Sadat, while religious voters are in good numbers. Locals don\u2019t seem enthusiastic about political activities as corner meetings by candidates are seen without active participation, while residential and commercial properties lack displays of flags and banners. Even motorists and motorcyclists are not displaying flags of their favourite parties.\nNo large convoys from commercial centres participated in public rallies of the PML-N and the PPP at Liaquat Bagh. Business leaders and leading traders in the markets are seen avoiding physical contact with the candidates.\nThe AML chief will face the toughest election this time as he \u201clacks active political support\u201d. His nephew Sheikh Rashid Shafique, who is contesting elections from NA-57, is burned with electoral campaigns of himself and Sheikh Rashid.\nThis is the first time the PML-N candidates have filed cases against their opponents during the campaign. PPP\u2019s Samira Gill, who got her bail suspended in 2018, is trying her luck again.\nPTI-backed Shehryar Riaz, who was elected MPA on the PML-N\u2019s seat, quit the Nawaz-led party around seven years ago. He also organised PTI rallies in 2018, but this time he is contesting elections as an independent candidate because of a symbol issue. Though the JI and the TLP also have a reasonable vote bank in the constituency.\nFor the first time, Markazi Anjuman-e-Tajran president Sharjeel Mir is contesting on the ticket of the IPP, but his voters\u2019 circle is limited to a few commercial markets.\n\u00a0\n"

            "Text": "Nestled amidst the heart of Punjab, the tehsil of Pind Dadan Khan has seen its population growth nearing 0.7 million.\nOften labelled as the most backward tehsil in the region, Pind Dadan Khan is now at the centre stage of a transformative narrative, shaped by both challenges and aspirations.\nAt the epicentre of this tale stands the ambitious dual carriageway Jhelum Road project, a vision set in motion three years ago by the then federal minister Chaudhry Fawad Hussain better known as Fawad Chaudhry. Backed by a substantial budget of Rs16 billion, this venture, though commendable, faced a stumbling block \u2014 a shortfall in funding that cast a shadow over its completion.\nChampioned by Chaudhry, the road project, along with the trauma centre in Toba, the passport office, and the EOBI office in Pind Dadan Khan City, symbolises the vigour of his leadership.\nThe wheels of development also set in motion with the initiation of the Jalalpur-Kundwal Canal during Chaudhry\u2019s tenure, marking a promising chapter in the region\u2019s progress. Yet, the journey to completion of these endeavours has been fraught with challenges.\nDespite the commendable efforts, projects linger in delays, awaiting the release of full funds. Only the Jalalpur-Kundwal canal, with the backing of the World Bank, forges ahead, signalling hope for the tehsil\u2019s future.\nBeyond the infrastructure hurdles, the tehsil grapples with the critical issues of drainage and clean drinking water. The failure of the sewage system, introduced by former MPA Chaudhry Nazar Hussain Gondal, reveals a need for larger pipes. The absence of a sanitation and drainage system compounds the woes, highlighting the collective responsibility of the community and the Municipal Committee.\nThe Tehsil Headquarters Hospital, a vital lifeline for the community, faces its own set of challenges. A lack of specialist doctors, attributed to inadequate accommodations, leaves residents without essential medical care. Outdated medical equipment further exacerbates the situation, leaving the hospital functioning as more of a \u201cpost office\u201d than a healthcare facility.\nAs one navigates through the myriad issues plaguing the city \u2013 from Wapda hanging wires to the precarious drop in gas pressure \u2013 it begs the question: Who shoulders the responsibility for the tehsil\u2019s backwardness?\nThe call to action resonates \u2013 it is time to select representatives committed to eradicating backwardness, representatives who transcend mere photo sessions and embody true sincerity.\nAmidst the shadows of neglect, Pind Dadan Khan\u2019s potential flickers. A reflection in the neighbouring districts of Mandi Bahauddin and Chakwal serves as a stark reminder of what is achievable.\nIt beckons the residents to look beyond political affiliations and make informed choices, for in the power of their votes lies the transformative key to propel Pind Dadan Khan into a future unbound by backwardness.\n"

            "Text": "In a recent report launch, speakers emphasised the critical role of innovative indigenous solutions and the digital integration of agricultural data in unlocking the potential of regional agriculture trade.\nThis approach is seen as crucial for supporting progress towards food security and the second Sustainable Development Goal (SDG2). The report, titled \u201cPotential of Innovation for Food Security and Regional Trade in Agriculture,\u201d was unveiled by the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) in collaboration with the Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI).\nSDPI Joint Executive Director, Dr Vaqar Ahmed, addressed the audience and highlighted the impact of recurrent climate events, pandemics, and supply chain disruptions on food security in Pakistan and the broader region. He stressed that agricultural productivity and regional food security can be enhanced through technological innovations and the strengthening of regional agricultural trade.\nDr Ahmed pointed out that the 2022 floods had severely affected the ability of 73% of households in flood-affected areas to afford basic nutrition, impeding progress towards SDG2. The situation was even direr in Afghanistan, where 95% of the population struggled to meet their nutritional demands. The hackathon, organised by SDPI, provided a platform for start-ups to network, showcase their ideas, and contribute to advancing regional agriculture trade integration and food security.\nDr Haroon Sarwar, Economic Consultant at the Ministry of National Food Security & Research, commended SDPI\u2019s initiative to host a Hackathon in 2023 focused on start-ups working in food security. He highlighted the positive signs of participation from start-ups in Balochistan and Afghanistan, indicating a promising outlook for food security. Dr Sarwar emphasised that addressing the challenges faced by agriculture in Pakistan and the region, particularly the poor access of smallholding farmers to finances, could significantly improve profitability and reduce food insecurity. He called for bridging the gap between small farmers and financial institutions.\nDr Sarwar also emphasised the untapped potential for agriculture trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan, acknowledging existing barriers and proposing collaborative efforts between SDPI and the Ministry of Food Security and Research to overcome these obstacles.\nDr Samreen Babar, Associate Professor at Bahria University, applauded the Hackathon organised by SDPI for providing a platform for students and start-ups to present their innovative ideas and connect with mentors. She stressed the importance of bridging the gap between academia, start-ups, mentors, and partners to foster innovative indigenous solutions.\nDr Babar proposed the development of a mobile application facilitating bilateral agriculture trade by connecting buyers and sellers, thereby boosting food security and supporting economic development.\nRija Tayyab, Corporate Affairs and Sustainability Manager at Roshan Packages emphasised the significant stake that the youth have in addressing the climate crisis. She highlighted the need to enhance the capacity of youth to propose indigenous solutions for climate-induced challenges.\nTayyab stressed the importance of developing mechanisms to scale up these solutions for effective implementation.\n"

He said the increase in poultry business inputs and cost of doing business was seen across the country due to which the market was in crisis.\nHe added that many people related to the chicken business in the country were affected by the current crisis and especially small businesses and poultry farms were closed. Sajjad said that the country\u2019s economic conditions were also an important issue and the poultry feed ingredients imported from foreign countries were very expensive, in which soybean is important. He said many soybean ships stopped at Karachi port, which had an inevitable impact on poultry prices.\nThe PPA has also called for a further increase in the prices of chicken and there was an increase observed in the prices of poultry items in the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi.\n"

            "Text": "Anthems, through their poetic lyrics and memorable melodies, are a discreet yet enterprising way of delivering a captivating political message to the balloting citizenry.\nThus, in recent times, a large number of mainstream parties in the country have fervidly invested in the composition of catchy campaigning tracks that are sure to have brainwashed voters subconsciously dancing to their tunes come Election Day.\nWith the preparations for the General Elections 2024 in full swing, many political parties including the Pakistan Muslim League \u2013 Nawaz (PML-N), Pakistan People\u2019s Party (PPP) and the Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) have followed suit of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) by orchestrating an expansive music production arrangement, which includes live and recorded song performances by renowned singers and lyricists like Sahir Ali Bagga, Malkoo, Farhan NTF and Mazhar Rahi, whose quirky hip-hop party anthems played repeatedly during election gatherings, rallies and advertisements, hold the potentiality to not only elevate the spirits of the listeners but also to surreptitiously alter their political allegiances with striking subtlety by leaving them in a partially hypnotic state.\n\u201cSince music is a highly effective tool for brainwashing people, it has been used extensively across time and space by leaders and revolutionists, who hoped to unite people under a special cause or social movement. A look back at history shows that music has played an important role in the success of many revolutions and movements in the world,\u201d analyzed Dr Hannan, a psychologist.\nAccording to sources of The Express Tribune, special arrangements have been made by parties for playing the anthems in their rallies and campaigns at the appropriate time in order to amplify the effect of a particular word or phrase spoken by the leader during their speech.\nAdeem Anwar, a connoisseur of the arts, expressed his belief that tunes and melodies have a profound effect on the human mood. \u201cThere is a reason that music is called the food of the soul.\nIf a person listens to a sad song, they might start feeling depressed. Conversely, if someone listens to an upbeat song with a fast melody, a transfer of energy occurs, and the person feels uplifted. Hence, it is seen how the loud music and sentimental lyrics of songs played during election rallies, keep the supporters \u2018charged\u2019 for the elections,\u201d observed Anwar, who felt that music was a smart way of attracting the youth of the country, which comprised 63 per cent of the population, to the polls.\nPrecedent supports Anwar\u2019s assessment when one looks retrospectively at the PTI\u2019s journey towards gaining popularity among the youth of the country. Indeed, PTI was the first mainstream party to introduce the use of originally produced music in Pakistan\u2019s politics during its rally in October 2011 at the Minar-e-Pakistan and from there on it has continued to produce several party anthems featuring the voices of famous musicians like Abrarul Haq, Salman Ahmad and Ataullah Khan Esakhelvi.\nImtiaz Sheikh, former President of PTI Lahore proudly rejoiced that PTI had given a new color to political rallies and processions in Pakistan through its usage of revolutionary songs.\n\u201cInitially, people were criticizing PTI for promoting the music and dance culture (indecency), but now all major parties are using a similar strategy,\u201d scoffed Sheikh.\nTalking to The Express Tribune on the matter, Khawaja Imran Nazeer, the central leader of PML-N Lahore, which has organized the biggest music campaign this year, said, \u201cPlaying songs during election campaigns helps in increasing the enthusiasm of the voters, especially the youth.\u201d\n"

            "Text": "In \u201cA Template for Understanding the Economy\u201d, Arthur Laffer cautions rightly that \u201cNext to a bad money, I know of nothing that will bring an economy to its knees faster than an unjust, inefficient, anti-growth, excessive system of taxation. This principle is universal.\u201d\nI add its corollary here: Pakistan\u2019s tax system is unjust, inefficient, anti-growth and excessive. Pakistan\u2019s economy has been brought to heels.\nEchoing the same principle, PIDE Reform Manifesto concludes that \u201cthe (Pakistan) tax regime is highly complicated and primarily revolves around meeting tax-to-GDP targets, often sidelining fundamental principles like fairness, certainty, efficiency, and convenience.\u201d\nIt is disappointing to see that both PML-N and PPP, which are leading contenders for the government in Islamabad, have failed to articulate a business and people-friendly tax policy in their manifestos. The Jamaat-e-Islami, on other hand, has made a clear commitment to reduce tax rates and increase the tax base, while withdrawing tax exemptions available to the elite.\nPPP\u2019s New Peoples Economy Plan is slightly better on one account: fairness. It promises to eradicate untargeted subsidies and tax expenditures and reduce reliance on exemptions to broaden the tax base and achieve a fairer system.\nIt also accords right emphasis on leveraging provincial and local taxation and harmonisation of general sales tax.\nSimilarly, one good thing in PML-N tax-related manifesto is that it has promised to keep tax regime unchanged for five years for stability. Hopefully, this does not mean maintaining the current tax regime!\nWithout clarity on tax policy, reforms and mechanism, no economic reform can work. Ambiguity also results in ad hoc measures which only aim to increase tax revenue or tax exemptions for selected sectors which distort competition.\nBoth PPP and PML-N have promised to increase tax-to-GDP ratio, a misguided target which has achieved the status of gospel, thanks to bad economics we teach and poor advice we receive.\nRead:\u00a0Revenue shortfall to be met with more taxes\nWe need to break down this consensus. For this, we need a tax policy, and here is a framework.\nIn his book, Laffer attributes the following text to Rizwan Rawji, as \u201cSeven Keys to a Good Tax Policy\u201d. It is worth to share these pillars:\ni \u2013 Tax these items most that can escape the least, and conversely tax those least that can easily escape. It makes no sense to tax something that then flees the jurisdiction, goes underground, or stops working. You not only don\u2019t get the revenue, but you also lose the benefits of productive services.\nii \u2013 Tax those things most that you least like (sin taxes). An additional benefit or sin tax is that they do reduce the activity being taxed.\niii \u2013 Tax those things least where the collection costs are highest.\niv \u2013 Broad-based, low-rate taxes provide people with the least incentives to evade, avoid and otherwise not report taxable income and the least number of places where they can escape taxation.\nv \u2013 Tax people fairly. People in like circumstances should have similar tax burdens. The perception of fairness is the key to voluntary compliance.\nvi \u2013 Make sure that taxation is not arbitrary or easily subject to discretionary changes. The power to tax in the wrong hand is an ugly weapon for exploitation.\nvii \u2013 Lastly, collect only as much as you really need. Wasteful spending will always rise to the level of revenues.\nWe believe that these principles can offer starting point to develop a tax policy, which will be just, efficient, and pro-growth. These principles can lead to a new tax policy, which has been outlined already by writers Ikramul Haq and Huzaima Bukhari in their publication \u201cTowards Flat, low-rate, broad and predictable taxes\u201d by PRIME, which presents a roadmap towards tax reform.\nThere is an urgent need for Pakistani institutions, taxpayers, think tanks, and academics to sit down and develop consensus on tax reforms soon after the new government assumes office. While political dynamics will take their own turn, we should all strive together to debate and agree on these points.\nIf we can sign on a \u201cFair Tax Charter\u201d, it can produce decent pressure on the new government to agree on this charter before it goes into the exercise of its first annual budget.\nTinkering and incrementalism will not work. We need a Milei effect in Islamabad.\nThe writer is founder and executive director of PRIME, an independent economic policy think tank based in Islamabad\n\u00a0\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 5th, 2024.\n"

            "Text": "Supporters call for more customised benchmark aligning with unique requirements and values"
        },
        "Details": {
            "Text": "With the global Islamic financial sector approaching close to $4 trillion in assets and having surpassed the Rs8 trillion assets milestone in Pakistan, a common question in Islamic finance revolves around the use of conventional benchmarks like Kibor or Libor when pricing an Islamic finance transaction or Sukuk. Considered one of the common myths is the belief that using a conventional benchmark rate to calculate rental for an asset or to determine the profit amount in a credit sale of goods in an Islamic financing contract makes the transaction impermissible.\nThis question gains significance in the context of the ongoing conversion in Pakistan\u2019s banking sector. In light of the Federal Shariat court\u2019s decision, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) aims to transition from an interest-based banking system to a more just and ethical Islamic banking system by the end of 2027. Additionally, concerns arise about what Islamic financial institutions will do when conventional benchmarks cease to exist after the conversion of the financial system in Pakistan. There is a strong desire among supporters of Islamic finance for the pricing mechanism to move away from benchmarks rooted in conventional banking, advocating for a more customised benchmark for Islamic finance that aligns with its unique requirements and values. Regulators also support the development of benchmarks that reflect the economy, create a positive economic impact, and are less prone to market manipulation, as seen in the case of Libor.\nTo understand the answers to these questions, we need to examine the issue in three dimensions: Shariah compliance, customer perception, and market competition.\nFrom a Shariah compliance perspective, the majority of Shariah scholars, jurists, and Shariah standards issued by The Accounting and Auditing Organiaation for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI) Bahrain allow the use of conventional benchmark rates for pricing an Islamic transaction, provided that the transaction follows all the requirements of Islamic rules of contract. These rates are considered a measure or a number to calculate the return of a permissible transaction. Scholars clarify that the permissibility depends on the mode of finance, process, and steps followed. If all the required steps of a valid transaction are followed, it cannot be considered impermissible merely because the profit earned in the Islamic deal is similar to the interest earned in a loan transaction.\nFor instance, providing an interest-based loan at 10% to a customer is not permissible. However, earning a profit of 10% in a valid sale of raw material to a factory is allowed. Even if someone uses the Islamic rate of Zakat at 2.5% or the rate of Ushr at 10% to provide an interest-based loan, that act would remain impermissible as per Islamic rules.\nRead:\u00a0BankIslami calls for more Islamic banking\nIn addition, scholars strongly advise Islamic financial institutions that, while the use of conventional benchmarks is permissible, it is not preferable in Islamic finance to determine profit using conventional banking rates and benchmarks. They recommend exploring options for developing benchmarks based on Islamic banking markets or linked to some real economic parameter, aligning with the objectives of Shariah. In 2011, Thomson Reuters introduced the Islamic Interbank Benchmark Rate (IIBR) as a potential solution, addressing concerns related to interest-based benchmarks. The methodology involves contributions from a panel of Islamic banks, ensuring Shariah-compliant funding costs are reflected.\nSecondly, customer perception related to the use of benchmarks is crucial. From a behavioural economics point of view, understanding the perception created by the use of an interest-based benchmark is essential. Many customers perceive it negatively when Islamic banks use conventional benchmarks, creating a hurdle in spreading the share of Islamic finance. Introducing a new benchmark is not just about rules; it could remove confusion for the common man and create a positive image for industry growth. A separate benchmark can enhance trust among stakeholders and help differentiate Islamic financial products. The SBP has acknowledged the need for a separate benchmark for the Islamic banking industry to boost public confidence.\nThe third dimension of the Islamic benchmark is market dynamics and competition. It will be interesting to observe how much the Islamic benchmark will differ from conventional benchmarks. The difference will depend on market dynamics, calculation methodology, and underlying factors such as linking to economic factors, market share of Islamic banks, and the activity of the Islamic inter-bank market. In markets allowing both conventional and Islamic banking, benchmarks may be closer, while in markets exclusively permitting Islamic banking, the benchmark may evolve differently.\nBased on the above deliberations, developing an Islamic pricing benchmark merits serious efforts. For successful development and wider acceptability of such a benchmark, stakeholders need to ensure Sharia compliance, industry collaboration, transparent underlying methodology, wider dissemination, and close monitoring within the Islamic finance community. As the industry progresses, it is the right time for policymakers, regulators, industry players, and academics to sit together with the guidance of Shariah scholars to explore working models for Islamic pricing benchmarks. The development of an Islamic benchmark will not only foster confidence and trust in customers but also fuel the growth of Islamic finance in Pakistan.\nAHMED ALI SIDDIQUI IS THE DIRECTOR OF IBA CENTRE FOR EXCELLENCE IN ISLAMIC FINANCE.

            "Text": "At the crossroads of electoral change, Gaddi Nasheen Pirs, traditionally seen as architects of the nation\u2019s political story, are now redefining their roles with socio-economic transformations. A journey that dates back to the Mughal era is undergoing recalibration by these spiritual leaders.\nTraditionally aligned with power centres, the heirs of the saintly lineage, representing the traditional Barelvi school, face the challenge of syncing with evolving public sentiments. The historic sway they held over \u2018mureeds\u2019 (disciples) is now encountering a reshaped political terrain, necessitating direct engagement with voters.\nMany prominent Gaddis have shown a tendency to switch electoral allegiances when deemed necessary. Their influence has traditionally hinged on the unwavering support of their \u2018mureeds\u2019 who adhered to the voting recommendations of their spiritual leaders. However, as the population grew and constituency sizes expanded, Pirs found themselves compelled to actively engage with voters to secure their support.\nIn electoral politics traditionally, their sphere of influence extended to rural areas, primarily in Punjab and Sindh provinces, where most major Gaddis are located.\nWhile historically rooted in rural strongholds, the political landscape has morphed, turning villages into towns and rural spaces into semi-urban hubs. The proliferation of social media, economic prosperity, and improved education accessibility have redrawn the contours of influence.\nWhile there hasn\u2019t been an independent study to precisely gauge the impact of these socio-economic changes on the Pirs\u2019 vote bank, a closer look at the country\u2019s recent electoral history reveals potent challenges in maintaining their political influence alongside spiritual standing.\nThese challenges have intensified, particularly since the last general elections, with the emergence of Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), a hardline Barelvi party founded to tackle the issue of preserving the Namoos-e-Risalat (ensuring the utmost respect for the Prophet PBUH) and protect the country\u2019s blasphemy laws \u2013 issues that are highly sensitive for Barelvis.\nRead\u00a0Shifting sands of power in Multan\nThe rising influence of TLP poses a serious threat to the traditional stronghold that Gaddi Nasheens have maintained over their followers in electoral matters. The transformation in the political landscape, coupled with the growing resonance of TLP\u2019s messaging, prompts an exploration into whether Gaddi Nasheens\u2019 historical influence on the electoral choices of their followers is now under renewed scrutiny.\nIn the last elections, TLP presented a significant surprise. The party, founded in 2015 on the back of support for the issue of hanging Mumtaz Qadri, a serving police bodyguard of sitting Punjab governor Salman Taseeer, TLP secured 2.2 million votes in the 2018 general elections and won two provincial assembly seats in Sindh.\nMoreover, it altered the outcome in around 20 National Assembly seats, where winning margins were less than TLP votes. The hardline party also influenced results in another 17 constituencies, securing second place in three National Assembly constituencies and standing at number three in around 70 constituencies for the National Assembly and provincial assemblies of Punjab and Sindh.\nThese results showcased an unprecedented influence of the Barelvi vote that had never been pronounced in the past like this. While Jamiat Ulma-e-Pakistan (JUP) and some other Barelvi parties in the past secured few seats and influenced voting patterns in certain pockets, TLP demonstrated a much broader countrywide impact.\nAs the upcoming elections approach, questions arise about TLP\u2019s performance without a singular agenda item, unlike in 2018 when they campaigned to protect the country\u2019s blasphemy laws and the finality of prophethood.\nReports suggest that TLP back then also enjoyed tacit support from influential quarters to challenge PML-N, which had fallen out with the powers that be of the country.\nThis time PML-N seems to be the first choice of powerful quarters to form the next government. It has made alliances and seat adjustments with a number of parties and groups to ensure its dominance in the centre and Punjab.\nTLP has fielded 223 candidates for the national assembly, more than PML-N\u2019s 212 and PPP\u2019s 219 across Pakistan for the 266 directly elected seats. In the absence of their firebrand leader Allama Khadim Rizvi and the aforementioned issues, it is yet to be seen if TLP will act as a fringe party in this month\u2019s polls or if it emerges as a serious player capturing the votes of major parties and the majority Barelvi vote on which Pirs traditionally had their banking.\nAmidst the prevailing uncertainty, spiritual leaders, the Pirs, are delicately navigating the intricate balance between tradition and contemporary dynamics. The backdrop of this electoral scenario witnesses a significant shift in traditional patterns of choices of Pirs. Below is a summary of influential Gaddis and their party preferences for the upcoming elections.\nShrine Bahu Sultan \u2013 Central Punjab (Jhang)\nThis shrine holds considerable sway in Jhang\u2019s political landscape. Notable Pirs: Sahibzada Mehboob Sultan and Sahibzada Amir Sultan and contesting for National Assembly seats NA-108 and NA-110 respectively.\nShah Jeevna \u2013 Jhang\nThe Gaddi Nasheen of a significant shrine in Jhang former federal minister Faisal Saleh Hayat is contesting for National Assembly and Punjab Assembly seats NA-108 and PP-125 on a PML-N ticket after leaving PPP a few weeks back.\nShrine of Sial Sharif \u2013 Sargodha\nIn the court\u2019s electoral politics especially in Punjab\u2019s politics, this shrine has historical significance. Gaddi Nasheens of this shrine have also been elected multiple times for the National and Provincial legislatures. Pir Naeem Uddin Sialvi is contesting for the Punjab Assembly seat in the upcoming elections. He was PTI\u2019s candidate for National Assembly in 2018 but he joined PPP in January 2022.\nTaunsa Sharif \u2013 South Punjab\nKhawaja Sheraz and other members of this significant Gaddi in South Punjab are contesting for the National Assembly and Punjab Assembly. Sheraz would be contesting for National Assembly seat NA-183. He is backed by PTI. His uncle Khawaja Salah Uddin Akbar is contesting from PP-285, another close relative Khawja Nizam ul Mehmood is contesting on the PML-N ticket while another family member Khawja Muddasir is contesting for the National Assembly seat on JUI-F ticket.\nDargah Jalalpur Sharif \u2013 Central Punjab\nCentral Punjab shrine with political importance has also played an important role in the country\u2019s politics in the past, however no direct descendant in the current race for the national legislature.\nGilanis of Multan\nPPP\u2019s face in South Punjab, former prime minister Syed Yousaf Raza Gillani is contesting from NA-148, while his sons Ali Musa Gillani from NA-151, and Abdul Qadir Gillani from NA-152.\nShrine Bahauddin Zakariya Multan\nFormer foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi is currently in jail and has been convicted along with PTI founder Imran Khan under the official secret act in the Cypher case.\u00a0 His son Zain Qureshi is contesting from NA-150, while his daughter Mehr Bano Qureshi will be facing Ali Musa Gillani in NA-151. They are independent candidates backed by PTI.\nShrine Khawaja Fareed Pakpattan\nTwo important politicians who derive their support from Gaddi Nasheens of this shrine, the brothers of Khawar Manika, former husband of Imran Khan\u2019s wife, Ahmed Manika and Farooq Manika are contesting on PML-N ticket for NA-139, and PP-193 respectively.\nDargah Hazuri Kasuri \u2013 Central Punjab\nGaddi Nasheen of this shrine, Pir Imran Ahmed Shah is contesting for the National Assembly on PML-N ticket from Sahiwal.\nPir Amin ul Hasnaat of Bhera Sharif who contested the last election on the PTI platform is not in the race this time.\nImportant Gaddi\u2019s of Sindh province in the run for 2024 elections:\nBharchundi Dargah, Ghotki\nMian Abdul Haq Mitthu who is widely accused of forced conversions of non-Muslims is contesting for the National Assembly seat from Ghotki.\nGaddi Nasheens from Khairpur\nPir Niaz Hussain Shah representing Gaddi of Pirs of Rani will be facing Pir Sadaruddin Shah Rashdi of Pir Pagara family for NA-203. Two other members of the Pagara family Pir Ismail Shah Rashdi are running for Sindh Assembly\u2019s seat PS-28 and Pir Rashid Shah Rashdi for PS-31 on GDA tickets.\nHala Shrine\nSajada Nasheeen of this shrine Makhdoom Jamil ul Zaman is contesting from NA-216 Mityari while Makhdoom Mehboob Zaman is in the contest for PS-56 on PPP tickets.\nThe diverse range of political parties on whose platforms these Gaddi Nasheens are vying for seats illustrates a shift in traditional political dynamics. Historically, political parties would seek the endorsement of Pirs for their support. However, the current scenario reflects a reversal, indicating that Pirs now actively seek party tickets to maintain their relevance in the evolving political landscape.\nThe choices of these influential Gaddi Nasheens are poised to shape the political landscape after the elections, providing a nuanced interplay between tradition, spirituality, and contemporary political dynamics.\nSabookh Syed, a journalist and researcher closely monitoring issues related to religious parties and extremist groups, notes that Gaddi Nasheens have traditionally aligned themselves with the powers that be, playing on their whims.\nRead more\u00a0South Punjab electoral scene dominated by elite\nAt the same time, these Pirs have typically prioritized local interests over any party\u2019s national ideology. They often sided with a party that caters to their local concerns, given that their economic ties revolve around local groups and parties.\nMore organised religious parties of the Deobandi school of thought, such as Jammat-e-Islami and JUI-F, have been criticising the Pirs for using the Namoos-e-Risalat issues publicly while supporting secular parties like PPP and PML-N, who, at times make attempts aimed to amend laws on matters dear to Barelvis.\nHe believes the emergence of TLP has posed a challenge for many Pirs. TLP, by championing the cause of Khatam-e-Nabuwwat, has shifted the dynamics by becoming the self-proclaimed sole guardian of laws related to the finality of the Prophet (PBUH).\nInstead of making any other traditional Gaddi as the centre of their politics, they propagated Mumtaz Qadri\u2019s ideology, with his shrine at the centre, and after the demise of the party founder Allama Khadim Rizvi, they integrated his shrine into their assertive political stance.\nDr Adeel Malik, an academician at Oxford University, offers a different perspective. He suggests that the power of traditional shrine families is increasingly contested due to the penetration of social media and the breakup of household votes.\n"

            "Text": "In an escalation of violence days before the upcoming general elections, at least ten policemen including members of an elite force were martyred on Monday in a brazen attack in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\u2019s (K-P) restive Dera Ismail Khan district.\nAccording to officials, dozens of terrorists attacked the Chaudhwan police station located in the district\u2019s Daraban tehsil first with sniper guns. The attack started at 3 am, as reported by Reuters.\n\"More than 30 terrorists launched the attack from three directions,\" K-P provincial police chief Akhtar Hayat Gandapur told AFP. \"There was an exchange of fire for over two-and-a-half hours.\"\nThe attackers later entered the building, firing with automatic weapons and lobbing hand grenades, resulting in the deaths of ten policemen and injuries to at least six others. The Chaudhwan police station\u2019s station house officer (SHO), however, remained unharmed.\nDaraban Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Malik Aneesul Hassan told Reuters that most of the police casualties occurred due to grenade blasts.\nSpeaking to Express News, the DSP identified the martyred as four personnel of the K-P Elite Police Force\u2014 Assistant Sub-Inspectors (ASIs) Kausar, Ihtiram, Rafiullah, and Hamidul Haq. A platoon of Elite Force from Swabi was deployed at the police station, he added.\nOther martyred policemen were Muhammad Islam, Ghulam Fareed, Muhammad Javaid, Muhammad Idris, Muhammad Imran, and Mansoor. The injured included Ahmad Hussain, Akbar Zaman, Anayatullah, Sohrab Khan, Ibrahim, and Nasib Khan.\nUpon receiving reports of the attack, heavy contingents of police rushed to the police station. Security forces cordoned off the area and initiated a search operation in surrounding areas, including forests.\nThey established pickets on roads leading to South Waziristan, Drazanda, and Dera Ghazi Khan. The Pakistan Army was later deployed for the security of the police station.\nCaretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar \"strongly condemned\" the attack. \"The entire nation stands with the police and security forces and salutes the martyrs,\" he said in a statement.\nRead Three more cops martyred as terrorists step up attack on K-P police\nA senior government official informed AFP about the \"severe threat\" in southern areas of the K-P, where Monday's assault took place.\n\"Terrorists have now begun to blend in with civilian populations in urban areas, making it difficult to conduct operations against them,\" the official said, requesting anonymity.\nIt was not immediately clear who was behind the attack and whether it was related to the election. On Wednesday, a National Assembly candidate was shot dead elsewhere in K-P, while another political leader was shot dead in his party's election office in Balochistan.\nOn Tuesday, a bomb attack following an election rally killed four people in Balochistan. The Islamic State terrorist group claimed responsibility.\nIn December, at least 23 soldiers were killed when a six-man suicide squad drove an explosive-laden truck into a military camp set up in a police station complex, also in Daraban.\nPakistan has seen a resurgence of attacks by terrorists, especially targeting security personnel, since 2022, when a ceasefire between the outlawed Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and the government broke down.\nThe Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) last week confirmed that general elections would proceed as planned after holding an urgent meeting with security officials following a spate of violence in the K-P and Balochistan provinces.\nDaraban lies in an area considered a stronghold of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI-F). The party chief, Maulana Fazlur Rehman, traveled last month to Afghanistan to meet the Taliban's supreme spiritual leader, one of his few known meetings with foreign dignitaries.\nThe party has also called for a delay in Pakistan's polls due to security concerns.\n"

Three people lost their lives due to the heavy rainfall, which also resulted in flooding in both residential and commercial areas of the city. This led to power outages and the failure of the traffic management system.\nReacting to Karachi's urban flooding, PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif, earlier taunted by Bilawal on governance, quipped that if Lahore mirrored Karachi's situation after rain, he would have withdrawn from the electoral race!\nThank you Kemari! I am a son of Karachi and want to do great things for our city. The people of Karachi want an end to the ethnic and religious division and hatred that has held the progress of this city ransom for decades.

We will form our government at the federal level and work on historic projects in Karachi. This city will be given representation as it deserves.\"\nBilawal assured that the provincial cabinet of Sindh would grant Karachi its due rights, and together, they would serve the city. He urged the residents of the city to be aware and not vote for those who seek to divide and spread hatred based on religion or language.\nThe PPP chairman remarked that on February 8th, people should vote against all elements that indulge in politics of hatred and violence. He expressed confidence that their elected representatives would work in the city, providing opportunities for progress and ensuring equal opportunities for women.\n\"My and my mother's birth took place in Karachi. This city is like my home, and serving Karachi means serving my home. I will serve my home in the best possible way, and I will instruct your representatives to stand by you in every joy and sorrow,\" Bilawal added.\nRead more: Bilawal wary of joining forces with Nawaz following polls\n\u2018No alliance post-polls\u2019\nSeparately, the former foreign minister ruled out the possibility of forming an alliance with PML-N following polls.\n\u201cIt [PML-N] is no longer a party that says [the slogan] respect the vote (vote ko izzat do) or that agrees to Charter of Democracy but rather it has become the one which was part of IJI,\u201d Bilawal said in an interview with Voice of America\nIJI or Islami Jamhoori Ittehad was an alliance formed in 1988 to oppose the PPP in the elections that year. It comprised nine parties including the PML-N, which at that time was called PML.\n\"This is the PML-N that dreams of becoming 'Amir-ul-Momineen,' so it is very difficult for me to continue with the PML-N.\"\nHe accused Nawaz of exerting pressure on the administration to manipulate the elections, alleging that the caretaker government and administration were favouring the former prime minister.\n\u201cThe caretaker prime minister was appointed following deliberations between Shehbaz Sharif and Raja Riaz and now Raja Riaz was contesting elections on a PML-N ticket,\u201d he added.\nExpressing concern over the arrest of their supporters in Sindh by FIA, Bilawal said that attempts by PML-N to divide the political structure would fail.\nAlso read: PPP faces backlash from rivals\nTo reduce the role of the establishment in politics, Bilawal suggested that the first step must be taken by politicians themselves, urging political leaders to confine their differences within the political arena.\nThe former foreign minister emphasised that politicians should adhere to the rules and principles of politics. \u201cIf we don\u2019t work within our limits and cross it then we should not expect others not to cross their limits as well,\u201d he said in an apparent reference to the military establishment.\nBilawal pointed out that the May 9 incident was not within the boundaries of politics and stressed the need for politicians to establish a code of conduct and all should adhere to it.\n\u0644\u0627\u0626\u06cc\u0648: \u0686\u06cc\u0626\u0631\u0645\u06cc\u0646 \u067e\u0627\u06a9\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u067e\u06cc\u067e\u0644\u0632 \u067e\u0627\u0631\u0679\u06cc \u0628\u0644\u0627\u0648\u0644 \u0628\u06be\u0679\u0648 \u0632\u0631\u062f\u0627\u0631\u06cc \u0634\u06cc\u0631\u06cc \u062c\u0646\u0627\u062d \u06a9\u0627\u0644\u0648\u0646\u06cc \u067e\u0631 \u0631\u06cc\u0644\u06cc \u06a9\u06d2 \u0634\u0631\u06a9\u0627\u0621 \u0633\u06d2 \u062e\u0637\u0627\u0628 \u06a9\u0631\u0631\u06c1\u06d2 \u06c1\u06cc\u06ba\u06d4 https://t.co/vknj6XLQne\n\"If Nawaz Sharif becomes the prime minister, we will see what ideology he pursues.

            "Text": "Saturday's downpour in the metropolis wreaked havoc, literally paralysing the routine life. The repercussions lingered into Sunday, witnessing thousands stranded overnight on rain-drenched streets, leaving behind damaged vehicles and disrupted routines.\nThe deluge crippled Karachi for several hours, with flooded roads and accumulated sewage creating widespread difficulties. Election activities took a back seat as political parties shifted focus to door-to-door campaigning amidst the chaos.\nThe one-hour rain on Saturday swamped the entire city, affecting both main roads and inner streets. Pedestrians faced challenges navigating waterlogged areas, with thousands forced to abandon their vehicles, leading to extensive damage to motorcycles.\nDisturbingly, exorbitant rickshaw fares, reaching up to Rs2,000 for short distances, added to citizens' plight.\nDespite the dire situation, the Karachi Municipal Corporation (KMC) failed to implement adequate water drainage measures. The city mayor's visits to different areas revealed a scene of destruction, highlighting the inefficacy of local government representatives, including town supervisors from various political affiliations.\nRescue services, especially Rescue 1122, were conspicuously absent during the crisis, exacerbating the challenges faced by citizens. Sindh Solid Waste Management Board's failure to provide relief further compounded the situation.\nThe rain not only disrupted daily life but also cast a shadow over political activities. Political parties postponed scheduled events, while the TLP convened a meeting to assess the situation.\nElected local government representatives found themselves in a challenging position as citizens criticised their response, opening opportunities for rival political parties to exploit the situation.\nAs Karachi gears up for the upcoming general elections, the rain-induced difficulties pose a challenge for political parties seeking votes. While the long-term impact on the political landscape remains uncertain, the immediate aftermath paints a grim picture of the citizens' plight after enduring 10 to 12 hours of hardship.\nDespite the predicament, local government-affiliated political parties face an uphill battle as they strive to connect with the public for votes amidst the aftermath of the rain. The coming days will reveal the lasting impact of this rain-induced crisis on the city and its political dynamics.\nWall-less nullah annihilates another life\nThe body of a 45-year-old unidentified man was found in the drain of Baldia Town No2 within the limits of the SITE-B police station around midnight on Saturday.\nOn receiving the information, the police reached the spot and after taking the body into custody, shifted it to Dr Ruth KM Pfau Civil Hospital mortuary.\nSITE-B SHO Muhammad Masood said police were searching for the heirs of the deceased, who were finally located.\nThe victim of the city authority\u2019s incompetence, Syed Muhammad Fakhr Alam, was a resident of Baldia Town Sector 5L and was employed at a factory named Kausar Dyeing in the SITE area.\nAccording to SHO Masood, the deceased Syed Muhammad Fakhr Alam had left home to go on duty during the heavy rain in the city on Saturday night and went missing.\nHis body was found in the Nallah on Sunday morning. He suspected that the deceased fell into the Nallah that had no safety wall.\nPolice have handed over the body of the deceased to his brother Syed Tanveer Alam after legal proceedings.\nIn a separate incident, a young man died due to electrocution at his home in the Jut Lines area. Family of 19-year-old Dilawar said he got a fatal shock from a naked electric wire during the rain.\nMeanwhile, two people were injured due to the fall of the wall of China Park on Kashmir Road in Ferozabad area. Edhi volunteers took them to Jinnah Hospital for immediate medical assistance.\nAccording to rescue officials, the victims were identified as 65-year-old Junaid and 35-year-old Waseem\nRoof collapse\nRoof of a house collapsed in Moinabad, Shrafi Goth leaving two women injured.\nPer Sharafi Goth police 26-year-old Samar and 40-year-old Firdous were injured when the delipidated roof of their house caved in during the heavy rainfall. They were rushed to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre. SSP Malir Tariq Elahi Mastoi has issued instructions that Malir district police is always vigilant to protect the lives and property of its citizens. SSP Malir has directed all DSPs and SHOs to help the rain-affected citizens in their respective areas.\n\u00a0\n"

He pointed out that Mayor Murtaza Wahab, elected after what he referred to as 'sham' elections, received substantial funds from the federal government, but the state of Karachi did not reflect the investment.\nSiddiqui further lamented that the rains exposed the PPP government's performance over the past 15 years and highlighted the extensive traffic delays he personally experienced. He claimed that Karachi was crying under the rule of its enemies.\nJamaat-e-Islami's (JI) Karachi chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman echoed the sentiment, blaming the mayor's poor performance for the chaos during the rains.\nRehman criticised the lack of arrangements made by the mayor despite prior predictions of rain by the meteorological department. He asserted that the newly constructed roads and sewage systems had been destroyed in the downpour, challenging the PPP's claim of transforming Karachi into Paris before the general elections slated for February 8.\nRehman also highlighted the timely response of Jamaat-e-Islami and Al-Khidmat volunteers in different areas for rescue efforts immediately after the rain. This comes as a counterpoint to the perceived failures of the PPP-led administration in managing the aftermath of the heavy rainfall.\nAs the criticism intensifies, the PPP finds itself in the midst of a political storm, facing questions about its governance and preparedness for weather-related challenges in one of Pakistan's most populous cities.\n\u00a0\n"

            "Text": "As parties and patrons remain engrossed in their campaigning drives for the upcoming General Elections 2024, many seem to have forgotten that the multitudes of displaced flood victims spread across the country, with devastated homes and lost identification documents, are also eligible voters.\nAbdul Jabbar, a resident of a village located in Larkana had his house completely destroyed during the heavy rainfall and massive flooding in 2022. \u201cOur home has still not been reconstructed, and my family continues to be displaced. Therefore, we cannot cast in our votes in the elections,\u201d shared Jabbar, who was still awaiting the financial assistance announced by the last PPP government.\nSimilar to Jabbar, Gulab Jamali, another flood victim from the katcha area of Larkana, revealed that all of his family members had lost their CNIC\u2019s during the flooding. \u201cAll our belongings including major identification documents were swept away by the flood water,\u201d bemoaned Jamali, who could not obtain a new CNIC since the NADRA center was located far away from his village.\n\u201cAlmost 10 to 15 percent of the flood affected population will be unable to cast their votes in the forthcoming elections since they do not possess their CNICs, which were misplaced during the floods,\u201d validated Rehmatullah Buriro, an analyst and social worker based in Sukkur.\nAccording to a recent survey conducted by the Center for Peace and Development Initiatives, in the aftermath of the 2022 floods in Khairpur and Naushahro Feroze, which witnessed the displacement of 1,500,000 people and the destruction of over 400,000 houses and a road network spanning 1349 kilometers, many flood affected families have still not been able to return to their native areas, where their votes are registered.\nSince polling stations are usually set up in government schools and at least 40 percent of the government school buildings in Sindh have been damaged as a result of the floods, it is evident that the polling process will be downsized in flood affected areas. Even though, the current caretaker government has released funds worth Rs3.3 billion last December to repair the buildings of 9901 schools in the province, the state of the road network is such that it will be difficult for the voters of the affected areas to reach the polling stations on time.\nNaseer Memon, a renowned columnist and social activist, after a recent visit to the flood affected areas, confirmed that it will be difficult for the voters to access the polling stations due to the destruction of the road network.\n\u201cA large number of people have still not been able to recover from the catastrophe even after the passage of 18 months. Many families are still displaced from their homes. The damaged road network in the affected areas is yet to be restored. The effects of this situation will be seen in the upcoming elections on February 8th,\u201d seconded Riaz Sohail, a senior journalist, while speaking to The Express Tribune.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n"

Overnight, a plethora of PTI candidate banners has emerged on central highways, intersections, roads, and neighbourhoods of Latifabad, featuring election symbols and utilizing the signature red and green colours of the PTI flag. Additionally, PTI workers are actively distributing pamphlets and small-sized sticky posters to promote their candidates.\nInterestingly, the banners put up by PTI do not explicitly mention Imran Khan's name but prominently display the PTI acronym, adopting the party's distinct red and green colour scheme.\nConversely, the PTI Hyderabad spokesperson has raised concerns about the continued harassment of their candidates by individuals in uniform and plain clothes. Allegedly, on Friday night, individuals in black uniforms attempted to forcefully enter the residence of National Assembly candidate Dr. Mustansar Billah in the Kohsar area. The intruders surrounded the house, beat on the main gate, and damaged CCTV cameras by cutting their wires. Despite no reaction from the occupants, the intruders eventually left.\nSimilar incidents were reported at the residence of Provincial Assembly candidate Rehan Rajput in Latifabad unit number five. Officials approached the house, knocked on the door, and retreated when it remained unopened. The PTI spokesperson expressed concern over these incidents, emphasizing the need for a fair and secure electoral environment.\n\u00a0\n"

Reports indicate that the attack coincided with a crucial meeting concerning the general elections, adding a political dimension to the incident.\nThese targeted attacks highlight the delicate security situation prevailing in certain areas of Balochistan, ahead of the elections. Authorities are anticipated to enhance security measures to safeguard candidates, political gatherings, and electoral processes.\n"

            "Text": "Additional Director General (ADG) Haroon Shinwari on Monday said that the Election Management System (EMS) hitches have been successfully addressed as the country prepares for the ballots on February 8.\nDuring a media briefing in Islamabad, Shinwari assured that the problems encountered during the experimental phase of EMS have been rectified, allowing individuals with expired ID cards to cast their votes.\nHe emphasised that those with expired IDs would not face hindrances in exercising their voting rights.\nShinwari said that a directive has been issued to all staff members, emphasising that individuals with expired ID cards should be permitted to vote.\nTo facilitate the election process, 3,000 laptops have been secured for EMS, and 3,600 operators have undergone training.\nA dedicated control room has been established to monitor the elections, functioning independently of the internet through a private network. Shinwari highlighted the implementation of a state-of-the-art system with special provisions for monitoring.\nMoreover, complaints from across the country can be filed via email and a universal phone number.\nAt the provincial level, control rooms have been set up, complemented by 32 regional monitoring control rooms overseeing the election process.\nTo address grievances, 144 district monitoring teams are actively involved. Shinwari announced the launch of a WhatsApp platform for registering complaints, marking a first in the election monitoring process.\nSince December 26, notices have been served to 625 individuals, with 252 candidates receiving show-cause notices and 156 facing fines for violating the code of conduct.\nNotably, 12,236 wall chalkings and hoardings have been removed, and candidates could face disqualification for serious code of conduct violations.\nRead:\u00a0ECP successfully conducts EMS mock exercise\nShinwari revealed that 221 complaints have been received, of which 198 have been resolved. Notices have been issued to Inspector Generals and chief secretaries regarding incidents in Sindh, Balochistan, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\"As of February 8, the eyes of the entire nation will be on the ECP, so the elections are being closely monitored at the district, provincial, and central levels,\" he added.\nHe expressed satisfaction with the EMS performance during trials, asserting that results will be transmitted through the system.\nAll control rooms are operational 24/7, with the central room continuing uninterrupted until the election results are announced. EMS is designed to function both offline and online, he added.\nECP readies for polls with updated procedures\nMeanwhile, the ECP has finalised all necessary preparations. According to sources, the chief election commissioner has opted to oversee operations from the control room on polling day instead of physically visiting the four provinces.\nWhile the commission members are set to cover all four provinces, the ECP encountered challenges, including appeals from high courts related to polling stations, changes in election symbols, and nomination papers.\nUnlike the previous election, the result management system will not be utilised this time. Instead, the EMS will be employed, wherein the returning officer in each provincial constituency will have three computers for result compilation.\nThe national constituency returning officer will be equipped with four computers, and Result Form 45 will be displayed outside each polling station.\n"

This film is the first in a series shedding light on the lives of death row prisoners in Pakistan.\nSixty-seven judges from the Federal Judicial Academy, along with representatives of foreign missions, institutions, and NGOs involved in the promotion of human rights, also attended the event.\nFrench Ambassador to Pakistan Nicolas Galey said, \"As for the supposed deterrent nature of capital punishment, it is an illusion and a lie, demonstrated by so many international statistics.\"\nJPP Executive Director Sarah Belal remarked that every country\u2019s journey towards compliance with international standards on the death penalty is tethered to its own sociocultural context.\n\"The most important yet often overlooked step is understanding the contextual landscape within which executions have historically taken place in the country,\" she said.\nRead:\u00a0Police probe jail threats\nDirected by Sikander-Vincent Khan, the film delves into the hardships and injustices faced by Pakistani death row prisoners throughout their lives, from childhood labor and hazardous work environments to mental illness and dire poverty. It also highlights the challenges within the criminal justice system, both during trials and on death row.\nEvery year, the JPP publishes an annual statistics report, \"Death Penalty in Pakistan: Data Mapping Capital Punishment,\" analyzing current trends in Pakistan's criminal justice system.\nThe JPP is a legal action non-governmental organization dedicated to representing the most vulnerable Pakistani prisoners facing the harshest punishments, including those facing the death penalty, mentally ill prisoners, victims of police torture, juvenile prisoners, and overseas Pakistani prisoners.\nFormed in Lahore in December 2009, the JPP investigates, advocates, educates, and litigates, building public and political support as well as legal precedents that will lead to systemic reform of the criminal justice system in Pakistan.\n"

Sources had then revealed to The Express Tribune that the jail authorities had received a call in which an unknown caller had threatened to attack the jail in the coming days.\nBushra has, however, moved an application, requesting the IHC to set aside the chief commissioner\u2019s notification and allow her to serve her sentence like \u201cother PTI workers\u201d in an ordinary jail.\nIn her writ petition, the convict noted that she does not feel safe to be confined alone in the premises of the sub-jail due to potential security issues. She said there has been movement of unidentified people in her house contributing to her sense of insecurity.\nShe said in the absence of compelling reasons, transferring her to a sub-jail is not feasible owing to security concerns and ensuing hardships.\nBushra stated that special treatment meted out to her while other political workers are detained in ordinary jails goes against the very spirit of equality guaranteed under the Constitution and is consequently discriminatory.\n\u201cThe impugned notification also goes against the principle of justice and equality as provided under Islam whereby each and every citizen is to be afforded equal treatment and no individual is superior to another or is given preferential treatment,\u201d she added.\nShe said notwithstanding any grievances that the petitioner has with the mode and manner in which she was convicted and the basis of the said conviction, she as a law abiding citizen of Pakistan wishes to serve her sentence \u201clike any other convict\u201d at Adiala Jail.\n"

            "Text": "Even though the regular reconstruction or renovation of public infrastructure is wholly welcomed by the local populace of any locality, the pre-election overt involvement of mainstream political parties in the completion of development projects worth billions of rupees in their constituencies, qualifies to be taken with a pinch of salt.\nWith the General Elections 2024 just a day away, ample media coverage has focused on highlighting the campaigning efforts made by political parties, be it through their rallies or social media presence however, very little attention has been drawn to a fairly unobtrusive yet observable manifestation of the urge of contesting candidates to appeal to a maximum number of voters; the initiation of several development projects by mainstream parties in their respective constituencies ahead of the elections.\nWhile an optimistic outlook might allow this to pass as a matter of pure coincidence, fundamental philosophical principles governing the human self-interest theory alongside live testaments from members of other political parties indicate that this might not, in fact, be the case.\n\u201cIn my constituency, there were complaints on the supply of gas and the roads were also dilapidated. Within a month, my opponent candidate from the Pakistan Muslim League \u2013 Nawaz (PML-N) started resolving the issues of the locals. \nThis is pre-poll rigging and it is a murder of justice,\u201d lambasted a candidate contesting for a seat in the National Assembly with a wicket sign, who further questioned the caretaker government\u2019s decision to release development funds worth billions of rupees per seat to the candidates of PML-N, who were already at a clear advantage.\nOn the other hand, Uzma Bukhari, the Information Secretary of the PML-N denied the claims that PML-N was the only party invested in such pre-election endeavors. \nRead:\u00a0Election promises\n\u201cThis has been an on-going trend since several years where most political parties kick start development activities as part of their election campaign,\u201d maintained Bukhari.\nBukhari\u2019s assertion was confirmed by the candidate of a political party contesting for a National Assembly seat from Lahore. \u201cAll candidates including me have received development funds worth more than Rs5 billion, which we have invested in our respective constituencies. We have repaired the roads, improved the sewage system and implemented clean water supply projects in our constituencies,\u201d asserted the candidate, on the condition of anonymity.\nAccording to sources privy to The Express Tribune, despite the restrictions placed by the Election Commission of Pakistan on pre-election development work in constituencies, a sum total of Rs300 billion have been spent on so-called development endeavors by political parties across 19 mega and small cities in Punjab during the past one year, involving the construction and renovation of overhead bridges, underpasses, sewage facilities, clean water reservoirs, educational institutions, hospitals, and police stations in their constituencies.\nIn his defense, a representative of the Punjab Finance Department assured that only the development funds allocated in the budget had been released. \u201cNow, whether those funds have been used for political purposes or for development projects, we cannot say,\u201d he added.\nSpeaking to The Express Tribune on the matter, the spokesperson for the Election Commission of Punjab said, \u201cThe ECP only takes action against pre-election development works in the constituencies where a candidate officially files a complaint. So far, we have received very few complaints. But the ones that we did receive have been addressed and the development works have been halted.\u201d\n"

            "Text": "Karachi\u2019s business leaders have urgently called for the formulation of a comprehensive master plan to address the city\u2019s deteriorating road infrastructure. Recognising the pivotal role of smooth roads in fostering economic growth, these leaders stress the need for a strategic approach to improve transportation efficiency and accessibility.\nWell-maintained roads, they argue, are crucial for facilitating the movement of goods and people, reducing transportation costs, and increasing overall productivity. The ripple effect extends to attracting investments, stimulating trade, and enhancing economic activity. Improved connectivity is seen as a catalyst for development in both urban and rural areas, creating a plethora of opportunities for businesses and communities alike.\nThe business leaders advocate for an approach akin to enterprise diplomacy, where diplomatic skills are employed to navigate the complexities of the global business environment. They stress the importance of building partnerships, resolving conflicts, and addressing regulatory challenges as integral components of economic statecraft.\nChairman of All Karachi Tajir Ittehad (AKTI), Atiq Mir highlights the severe impact of dilapidated road infrastructure on local businesses. Increased transportation costs, supply chain delays, and vehicle damage, he argues, escalate operational expenses for businesses, affecting their competitiveness and profitability. Additionally, unreliable transportation infrastructure deters potential investors and customers, hindering economic activities and potentially leading to a decline in local business growth.\nMir said that revamped road infrastructure could particularly benefit small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by improving transportation efficiency. Reduced transit times and enhanced connectivity enable faster movement of goods, ultimately reducing logistical costs for SMEs. The creation of a more conducive atmosphere for markets to operate and thrive is seen as a direct result of better roads.\nThe current state of affairs is attributed to a lack of coordination among government departments responsible for road construction, gas lines, sewerage, and water supply. \u201cWhen the city government was functional, significant progress was lacking. During Waseem Akhtar\u2019s tenure as Karachi mayor, various obstacles impeded his work. However, since Barrister Murtaza Wahab assumed the mayoral role, development efforts continue to be in a state of suspension.\nThe persistent issues of dishonesty, criminal negligence, and a lack of will within the Sindh government contribute to the deterioration of the city\u2019s roads. Historically, despite receiving substantial grants\u2014amounting to Rs10 billion and Rs20 billion\u2014Karachi has not witnessed visible improvements. The city has become a victim of corruption within local government departments.\nA glaring absence of a master plan further exacerbates the situation in Karachi. Departments responsible for road construction or repair operate independently, leading to a lack of coordination. This disjointed approach is evident when one department constructs or repairs a road, only for another to lay gas, sewerage, or water supply lines. The result is dilapidated roads, particularly affecting markets and bazaars.\u201d\nMirza Tariq, a supplier of confectionery and food items, provides firsthand accounts of the poor conditions of key roads in Karachi. He points to specific sections, including Shahjehan Avenue, Water Pump Chowrangi to People\u2019s Chowrangi, and People\u2019s Chowrangi to Sakhi Hassan, as well as sections of Nishter Road, Jehangir Road, and roads in Lyari, Malir, Korangi, and Landhi. Tariq lamented the higher cost of vehicle maintenance compared to transportation costs due to the state of these roads.\nKarachi Citizens\u2019 Forum (KCF) Convenor Nargis Rahman said, \u201cThe actions of government officials in Karachi can be described as merely cosmetic. The main highways and thoroughfares suffer due to a thin layer of poor construction material, exacerbated by heavy vehicular traffic and a collapsed sewerage system. The investment in road infrastructure is inadequate, leading to substantial losses.\nThe consequences extend beyond damaged roads, impacting the health and productivity of commuters, including staffers, traders, students, and women. The overall well-being of the public is compromised, resulting in a trust deficit in government services. Despite the evident challenges in road conditions, there is an ironic lack of citizen complaints against the substandard services provided by the government bodies. This situation leaves everyone as a victim of malpractice and contributes to a collective loss.\u201d\nRiazuddin, a leading industrialist and former president of the Site Association of Industry (SAI), called for the implementation of a master plan for the entire city. He stressed that the prime responsibility of the Sindh government is to allocate funds for infrastructure, eliminate corruption, improve construction materials, and ensure the functionality of the traffic engineering bureau of the Karachi Development Authority (KDA). He lamented the disproportionate allocation of funds, and alleged that only 30% to 40% are spent on roads while the remainder is pocketed.\nRead\u00a0IESCO starts process for infrastructure uplift\nHighlighting specific instances, Riazuddin pointed to the main Mangopir Road, reconstructed three years ago, where major chunks are already broken. He attributed the inability of contractors to build roads with proper construction materials to pervasive cuts and kickbacks, leading to compromised quality. He deemed a comprehensive revamping of infrastructure as essential, requiring a redesign of Karachi\u2019s master plan, especially in areas with informal settlements (Katchi abadis).\nLeading builder and town planner Hanif Gohar, former chairman of the Association of Builders and Developers of Pakistan (ABAD), underscored the need for honest institutional commitment and merit-based awards for road contracts. He stressed the potential for gradual improvement if institutions work honestly and road contracts are awarded based on merit.\nWhile some road schemes are managed by the Sindh Works and Services Department, the majority fall under the jurisdiction of the Sindh local government and Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), with support from other authorities.\nA senior official from KMC provided details on the condition of anonymity, stating, \u201cThere are approximately 200 Annual Development Programme (ADP) schemes for road infrastructure in Karachi. The KMC has allocated around Rs1,500 million for road-related projects since the significant flood of 2022 up to the present date. However, approximately Rs4,000 million is needed to revamp or repair the dilapidated roads under the jurisdiction of the KMC. The KMC oversees a vast network of 106 main thoroughfares, including Shahrah-e-Faisal, M A Jinnah Road, Shahrah-e-Pakistan, and others.\nThe inadequate sewerage system and blocked storm drains pose significant challenges, causing damage to roads and impacting various sections of the city's arteries. A proper sewerage system and well-maintained storm drains are essential to safeguard roads from deterioration.\"\nAnother official mentioned that KMC has not received a single instalment of the allocated budget for the fiscal year 2023-2024, which amounts to approximately Rs3.6 billion annually. This budget is distributed into four instalments and provided on a quarterly basis. Despite the delay in budget disbursement, the KMC is utilising its own earnings to fund minor road projects.\nRegarding the development schemes for road infrastructure in Karachi, a senior official from the Sindh Works and Service Department stated that there are four categories of schemes. These include four ongoing improvement schemes, one ongoing construction scheme, one new construction scheme, and three pre-stressed bridges. The total approved cost for all nine schemes is Rs3,109.322 million.\nA resident of Defence Housing Authority (DHA) Phase-V main Khayaban-e-Bahria expressed concerns, stating, \u201cThe gas utility stopped the old line and laid a new line two months back. However, they could not connect the new line to the system. As a result, residents in this affluent area have been dealing with clouds of dust and broken roads for approximately two months due to ongoing work for the installation of gas, telephone, and sewage lines successively.\u201d\nDean Faculty of Architecture and Sciences at NED University of Engineering and Technology, Prof Dr Noman Ahmed called for a comprehensive road condition survey to identify defects and plan a phased rehabilitation programme. He underscored the importance of including rehabilitation projects in budget proposals and developing a strategy for scientific and proper road repairs. Ahmed identified collapsed sewerage systems, poor construction materials, increased vehicular traffic, defective road design, and deteriorating drainage systems as the main issues contributing to poor infrastructure.\nAs preparations for the next year\u2019s budget loom, Ahmed advocated for a strategy to initiate scientific road repairs, benefiting all Karachiites. Moreover, he said that traffic police play a crucial role in monitoring the diverse dynamics of vehicular traffic situations. Their role extends to informing commuters about traffic information services, providing details about under-construction roads, and suggesting alternative routes to avoid traffic congestion. He pointed out that in foreign countries, traffic police operate an FM channel to keep travellers updated, and a similar pilot channel was previously introduced in the country. He argued the need to popularise such channels again for the benefit of the public.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 6th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

            "Text": "Tyre dealers and manufacturers have appealed to the government to take stern action against the smuggling of tyres, aiming to improve the competitiveness of the local industry and provide equal business opportunities. They stressed the need to curb the flow of smuggled tyres to protect local customers from substandard or inferior quality products and to promote the local industry.\nSharing views with The Express Tribune, they said the annual consumption of tyres in the country is 14.5 million, with approximately 25% of the demand met by domestic production and 10% imported legally, while the rest is through grey channels.\nThey estimate that the smuggling of tyres alone costs the national exchequer more than Rs70 billion annually, also severely impacting the local tyre industry. Although there was a visible slowdown last year when the government took action to overcome smuggling for a few months, it seems business as usual for the smugglers now.\nGhandhara Tyre & Rubber Company Limited (GTR) CEO Hussain Kuli Khan expresses concern, stating, \u201cSmuggled tyres of inferior quality and of all sizes are now easily available in the market. Unfortunately, due to their low prices, people are buying them without knowing the repercussions.\u201d Last year, the Collectorate of Customs Enforcement (CCE) confiscated over 55,000 smuggled tyres, mainly larger car tyre sizes worth about Rs540 million in Karachi, indicating the heavy influx of smuggled tyres.\n\u201cThe government needs to reassess the data on items imported through the Afghan Transit Trade (ATT) and verify whether the quantity of tyres imported aligns with the vehicle population in Afghanistan. Items supposedly under the purview of ATT are either offloaded in Karachi or return from the Afghan border through smuggling, and this issue requires urgent attention,\u201d he lamented.\nRead\u00a0Traders urge FBR chief to tackle smuggling\nThe local industry, he noted, plays a significant role in providing revenue to the exchequer, along with providing opportunities of employment. GTR alone contributes over Rs3.20 billion annually to the national exchequer. \u201cApproximately 60% to 70% of smuggled tyres flood the local markets, causing harm to the domestic industry and, more critically, dissuading potential investors and industrialists keen on establishing new ventures, which is imperative in the current situation. Tyres for various vehicles, including cars, trucks, tractors, and buses, are illicitly brought in from countries such as China, Japan, Thailand, and Indonesia through the Chaman borders,\u201d said Khurram Mustafa Suriya, a prominent tire dealer from Suriya Motors Karachi.\nHe explained that customers who opt for smuggled tyres due to lower prices often complain about poor quality after some time. He suggested that government relief and incentives for the local industry could lead to more job generation and increased variety and designs in the local market.\nMeanwhile, other dealers pointed out that smuggled tyres often arrive in substandard conditions, exhibiting torn tyre beads and structures, along with tampered dates. Subsequently, smugglers use mechanical tools to rectify the deformed tyres, reducing their operational lifespan and posing risks to public safety.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 6th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

            "Text": "Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari concluded his election campaign with a fiery speech in his hometown of Larkana, issuing stern warnings against vote tampering and launching veiled attacks on his political adversaries.\nAddressing a charged crowd, Bilawal refrained from directly naming his rivals but offered a biting critique, singling out former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and referencing past controversies surrounding his ousting from office.With conviction, Bilawal asserted that should Sharif return to power for a fourth term, his tenure would likely be short-lived.\n\"If elected for a fourth term, within six months, he will face removal,\" Bilawal boldly stated, hinting at the instability that could characterize Sharif's potential leadership.\nIn addition to warning against the dangers of vote tampering, Bilawal issued a stern caution that any attempts to manipulate election results would provoke a robust response from the PPP. \"They will forget Imran Khan if our votes are tampered with,\" he proclaimed, suggesting that his party would not hesitate to challenge any perceived electoral interference.\nThe rally at the Shaheed Benazir Bhutto Municipal Stadium in Larkana concluded the PPP\u2019s election campaign for February 8 elections, which took Bilawal to all the provinces of the country, including several stops in Punjab, which offers more than half of the National Assembly seats.\nBilwal, who is the PPP candidate for the premiership should the party win the elections, set two immediate goals \u2013 uniting the country and providing relief to the masses. He claimed that only the PPP was capable of steering the country out of this difficult situation.\n\u201cToday, I have returned to my home after campaigning and touring the whole country,\u201d he started his speech. It\u2019s been a long time no one from Larkana has become the prime minister. When the people of Larkana elected prime minister, entire country developed. So, now it is Larkana\u2019s turn,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIf you want to get out of the current crises, want economic stability and resolution of the problems, neither the Muslim League [PML-N] nor the PTI [Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf] can do this. Only PPP can do this,\u201d Bilawal told the crowd.\n\u201cLook at all the other political parties participating in the elections, they have become a thing of the past, playing their last innings. The old politicians, who are still in politics, know nothing but the politics of hate and division. They are endangering the country with their politics,\u201d he charged.\nWith their stubbornness and ego, these old politicians have damaged Pakistan\u2019s democracy, economy and the federation. If any of them gets the government again, they will start the politics of sit-ins the next day. They say something else before elections and do something else afterwards,\u201d he continued.\nHe warned of the repeat of same old politics of hate and vendetta if rivals won the elections. He said that those who turned politics into personal enmity, wanted to sit in the prime minister\u2019s chair for the fourth time to do what they had been doing previously.\n\u201cI am saying today, that if one of them wins, then instead of serving the people, they would start sit-ins the next day and take political revenge again. We have seen this movie three times and know what will happen the fourth time. Within six months, the same cry will start, why did you remove me?\u201d\nThe PPP chief said that those who played with the country\u2019s economy did not realise the difficulties of the masses. \u201cThese people have given nothing to the people in their manifestos. They are not worried about inflation, unemployment and poverty but they are worried about power,\u201d he continued.\nHe added that a PPP government would do two things immediately after assuming power. \u201cOne is to end the politics of hate and division, as Pakistan should be united, not divided. The second task is to give relief to the people through the Public Charter of Economy [the PPP\u2019s election manifesto],\u201d he stressed.\nBilawal said that he had travelled all over the country while on the campaign trail. He predicted that Nawaz Sharif would lose the election from the NA-15 Mansehra in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. On the other hand, he added, he would win his seat from Lahore, the home of the Sharifs.\nHowever, he added, regardless of the result, if the election were held transparently, the PPP would want this country to move forward to stability and development. \u201cIf my vote was stolen, I know who you are, I will come after you and then you will forget Imran Khan,\u201d he warned.\n"

The first time on December 17, second on January 7 and the latest one on January 20. The suspensions coincided with the PTI\u2019s virtual events.\nThe interim government attributed the internet outages across the country to \u201ctechnical issues\u201d, stating that there was no assurance that such incidents would not recur in the future.\nOn January 24, the Sindh High Court (SHC) restrained the relevant authorities from suspending internet services till the general elections.\nThe SHC ordered the caretaker federal government and the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) to ensure uninterrupted internet services till the polling day.\nThe order came on a petition filed by human rights defender and lawyer Jibran Nasir, who was contesting the polls for PS-110 as an independent candidate, against the frequent \u201cunconstitutional\u201d internet outages in the country in recent days.\nRecently, the PTI moved the Supreme Court, urging it to take notice of the disruption of popular social media platforms including X, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube.\nAddressing a news conference in the federal capital on Tuesday, interim Interior Minister Goher Ejaz dispelled rumours surrounding the elections on Feb 8, saying until now the authorities had not received any directives to shut down the internet services on the day.\nHe added that any such action would only be taken upon a request from a province or a district.\n\u201cAs of now, no decision has been made to shut down mobile or internet services. However, if necessary, considerations are made based on security requests from specific districts or provinces [internet and mobile service will be suspended],\u201d he remarked.\nThe interior minister was flanked by Caretaker Information Minister Murtaza Solangi and Interior Secretary Aftab Akbar Durrani.\nExpressing his commitment to ensuring security, the minister stressed that no compromise would be tolerated on maintaining law and order during the elections.\nHe underscored the collaboration between security agencies and the administration to prevent any unlawful interference.\nHe highlighted the presence of trained commandos in Balochistan and the support of the armed forces in ensuring the safety of the electoral process.\nProviding an overview of the election preparations, the interior minister shared that out of 90,777 polling stations across the country, 44,000 were declared normal, 29,985 deemed sensitive, and 16,766 had been labelled as highly sensitive.\nHe urged the nation to vote \u2018honestly\u2019 on Feb 8, and added that the country\u2019s reputed media had a significant role to play as it enjoyed the trust of 250 million people.\nHe said seven to eight security personnel would be deployed at each polling station, along with CCTV cameras installed at those declared sensitive. He added that thousands of police personnel will be deployed across the nation to ensure security on election day.\n\u201cAll the CCTV cameras have been installed by us, we have 90,777 polling stations, 40,000 polling stations are normal but security is also deployed here. more than 16,000 polling stations are highly sensitive, while the federal government has marked 135 polling stations as sensitive,\u201d the minister said.\nSpeaking on the occasion, interim information minister noted that the government had no directives yet to suspend mobile and internet services on election day.\nEmphasising the gravity of the security situation, Solangi maintained that no such orders had been passed yet, while underscoring the authority of local administrations to assess security conditions and make decisions accordingly, particularly in areas experiencing a deterioration in security.\nSolangi revealed that the information ministry had taken steps to facilitate local and foreign journalists and observers. An online helpline had been established to provide assistance and support to media professionals and observers, he said.\nFurthermore, the minister acknowledged that while extraordinary situations necessitated extraordinary solutions, the current circumstances did not warrant such measures.\nHe drew attention to the proliferation of fake news, and propaganda on social media platforms, highlighting the severity of the security challenges. Despite these challenges, he affirmed that Pakistan remained resolute in its commitment to combat terrorism.\nMeanwhile, the AI, in collaboration with other human rights organisations, urged the authorities to ensure uninterrupted access to internet and digital communication during the upcoming polls.\nExpressing concern over the potential limitations on internet access, the AI underscored the importance of upholding the right to freedom of expression and ensuring that citizens can freely share and access information online.\nIn the light of these developments, the rights organisations specifically called upon Prime Minister Anwarul Haq Kakar and the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to take proactive measures to guarantee full internet access and social media usage throughout the election period.\nThe ability to access the internet and utilise social media platforms is vital for citizens to participate in democratic processes, engage in informed discourse, and exercise their fundamental rights, the organisation said.\nThe AI and its partners emphasised that any disruptions in internet access during the election would not only undermine the democratic process but also impede the ability of citizens to access crucial information and express their viewpoints freely.\nMeanwhile, the period for chanting convincing slogans, enticing people with their manifestos, and soliciting votes came to a close as the deadline set by the ECP expired at midnight on Wednesday.\nNow, the nation prepares to go to the polls on February 8 (tomorrow).\nThough the political parties had initiated their electoral campaign after the announcement of election schedule by the polls supervisory body, a notable surge in their activities was witnessed after they were allotted election symbols on January 13.\nAround 111 political parties are set to contest the Feb 8 polls to woo more than 128 million registered voters, while the PTI is out of the fray due to the non-allotment of election symbol.\nThe PTI\u2019s candidates are contesting as independents.\nWith much hue and cry over the conformity of holding polls and the incarceration of PTI founding chief, the caretaker government was grappled with a formidable law and order situation during this period.\n\u00a0\n"

            "Text": "In just a few days, albeit after much ado, the populace of Balochistan will have their say on who gets to represent them in the provincial and National Assembly.\nDespite the pervasive terrorism threat in the province, political parties from various backgrounds, including religious, Baloch, and Pashtun nationalist factions, are actively engaging in the electoral process and are all set for the February 8th showdown.\nThe province, encompassing a vast geographical area, has witnessed record-breaking participation this time around with 1,729 candidates contesting for 51 Balochistan Assembly seats and 16 National Assembly seats.\nThis surge in candidates indicates a competitive electoral environment, highlighting the fervour and determination of political entities to secure victory in the upcoming general election and shape the political landscape of Balochistan.\n\nCandidates galore in Quetta\nIn contrast to previous elections where competition for most National Assembly and provincial assembly seats involved only 2 to 3 candidates each, this time, all 9 provincial assembly seats in Quetta city boast more than 40 candidates each. Notably, in the constituency known as PB-43 Quetta, formerly referred to as PB-1, a staggering 50 candidates are vigorously vying for victory, which is a departure from the earlier dominance between Senator Saeed Ahmed Hashmi, founder of the Balochistan Awami Party (BAP), and Pakistan People\u2019s Party\u2019s (PPP) Shafeeq Ahmed Khan, on the seat.\nMultiple former chief ministers of Balochistan contesting elections\nCurrently, eight former chief ministers of Balochistan including Nawab Muhammad Aslam Raisani, Nawab Sanaullah Zehri, Mir Quddus Bizenjo, Jam Kamal Khan, Dr Abdul Malik Baloch, Mir Jan Muhammad Jamali, and Sardar Saleh Bhootani are contesting elections on provincial and national assembly seats from the province.\nBe that as it may, political analysts are of the view that apart from Sardar Saleh Bhootani, who has served as the caretaker chief minister of the province, there seems to be no easy win for all the other former chief ministers of Balochistan, as they are facing tough competition in their respective constituencies.\nElectables: Kingmakers or not?\nEarlier during campaign season PPP\u2019s Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari spent 3 days in Quetta and met with party supporters and leaders; and also addressed supporters in Khuzdar. Furthermore, the PPP Chairman\u2019s father, former president, Asif Ali Zardari, also visited Turbat and addressed party supporters.\nAnd it seems efforts of both decision makers of the PPP bore fruit as they succeeded in gaining the support of influential electables from Balochistan, including Sardar Sarfaraz Domki, Nawab Sanaullah Zehri, Mir Quddus Bizenjo, and former caretaker federal minister, Sarfaraz Bugti.\nIn stark contrast with the PPP\u2019s campaigning, the Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) has not focused as much on Balochistan. This is evidenced by the fact that the party\u2019s supremo Nawaz Sharif, along with former prime minister Shahbaz Sharif, and the party\u2019s senior vice president Maryam Nawaz, only visited Quetta once during the campaign cycle and held meetings with a handful of electables.\nHowever, their efforts seemed to have worked as well as a significant number of electables from the province joined the PML-N after parting ways from BAP, despite being provincial ministers in the former BAP-led provincial government.\nNevertheless, it is pertinent to mention that analysts expect that the PPP\u2019s electables are in a stronger position compared to their political rivals PML-N.\nRead: Balochistan govt bans public meetings, electoral gatherings in Quetta\nJUI-F and PKMAP cozying up\nWhile only Feb 8 will tell if electables win at all whether it be for the PPP or the PML-N, two electoral heavyweights in the province are all set to take on the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf in Quetta and Pishin.\nMaulana Fazl ur Rehman, Chief of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) will face off against former governor of Balochistan, the PTI\u2019s Syed Zahoor Agha; whereas Mahmood Khan Achakzai, Chief of the Pashtoonkhwah Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), will go head-to-head against the PTI\u2019s General Secretary for Balochistan, Salar Khan.\nIt is pertinent to mention that the PKMAP\u2019s Chief as a goodwill gesture, has withdrawn from NA-265 Pishin and is backing the JUI-F Chief. As a reciprocal, the JUI F, withdrew its candidate Mufti Rozi Khan in support of Mehmood Khan Achakzai on NA-263 Quetta City. It is also worthwhile mentioning that the PKMAP was expecting that the JUI-F would withdraw its candidate Salahuddin Ayub on NA-266 to ensure the victory of Mehmood Khan Achakzai based on cordial relations between the JUI-F and PKMAP\u2019s Chief, and an electoral alliance was expected between the JUI-F and PKMAP in the Pashtoon-dominated areas of Balochistan but that did not happen.\n\nInteresting contests all around\nApart from the JUI-F and PKMAP, the Balochistan National Party (BNP) is also vying for key seats in the province. The BNP\u2019s Chief Sardar Akhtar Jan Mengal is contesting elections on 2 national assembly seats from Khuzdar and Quetta and 1 provincial assembly seat from his native town Wadh.\nIt is worth recalling that the nomination papers of the BNP Chief were initially rejected by the Returning Officers for holding an Iqama. However, the election tribunal of the Balochistan High Court (BHC) later allowed Sardar Akhtar Jan Mengal to contest elections. Now the BNP Chief is going to face Mir Shafique Rehman Mengal of the Jhalawan Panel on the provincial assembly seat from Wadh and Nawabzada Jamal Raisani of the PPP on NA-264 Quetta.\nAnother Balochistan electoral heavyweight, Chairman Senate Sadiq Sanjrani, is contesting elections on PB-32 from Dalbandin Chaghi. Sadiq Sanjrani is all set to face Mir Arif Jan Muhammad Hassani of PPP and Sakhi Amanullah Notezai of the JUI-F; and political analysts expect that the Chairman Senate will face a tough contest.\nSimilarly, Jam Kamal Khan, the former chief minister of the province, is also facing tough competition from his political rival Wadera Hussain Jamot in Lasbela, who is a PPP candidate and is backed by the influential Bhootani brothers.\nBalochistan anticipating yet another coalition government\nBe that as it may, political observers expect that Balochistan, which has consistently had a coalition government due to the intricate political landscape preventing any single party from securing a majority in the province since its establishment as a province in the 1970s, will have yet another coalition government.\nHowever, analysts are of the view that as the province grapples with its distinctive sociopolitical dynamics, the formation of coalition governments remains a pragmatic response to accommodate the diverse interests and perspectives that characterise the political landscape of Balochistan.\nAnd once the anticipated coalition government takes charge, political analysts expect that one of former federal caretaker minister for interior, Sarfaraz Bugti, Dr Abdul Malik Baloch, Nawabzada Gazeen Marri, Nawab Muhammad Aslam Raisani, Mir Sadiq Sanjrani, and Jam Kamal Khan, will be considered for chief ministerial slot of the Balochistan.\nCampaign season marred with terrorism\nWhile only time will tell who eventually gets to be Chief Minister of the province, it is pertinent to mention that Balochistan\u2019s electoral campaign cycle was marred with terrorism. Over a dozen bomb explosions targeting election campaign offices and candidates of political parties temporarily impacted the momentum in Balochistan, which might affect election day turnout as well.\nFormer provincial president of the PPP, Ali Madad Jattak, former provincial minister, Mir Zahoor Buledi, Agha Shakeel Durrani, and Mir Nooruddin Nowsherwani's residences and election campaign offices were targeted during the campaign cycle; consequently, around 2 dozen people were injured and 8 died.\n"

            "Text": "Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) on Monday vehemently criticised the election of Maryam Nawaz as Punjab's chief minister, accusing those in the \"unconstitutional Punjab Assembly\" of handpicking a \"fake chief minister\" through rigged results.\nPTI alleged that the Sharif family, notorious for years of plundering the country and stashing wealth abroad, was once again in action in Punjab, trying to set the stage for another round of looting.\nIn a statement, the PTI spokesperson expressed disdain, stating it was \"unconstitutional and shameful\" for the police to impose a curfew outside the Punjab Assembly, preventing nominated PTI-backed candidates and elected members from participating in the meeting.\nThe spokesperson said that after the alleged theft of the people's mandate, the sanctity of the House is now being trampled upon.\nThe spokesperson stated that a woman who failed to secure a single seat, even amid alleged state oppression and rigging, should reconsider her aspirations against the people's will.\nHe accused Maryam Nawaz, who has been convicted in corruption cases worth billions, of prioritising the Sharif family's wealth over the welfare of the nation.\nThe PTI warned that the people of Punjab would not tolerate insults to their mandate in the case of an allegedly unconstitutional and fake chief minister.\nThe party spokesperson asserted that an unconstitutional government established through a rigged election would not last long and predicted its eventual collapse under its own weight.\nMaryam Nawaz, the newly-elected chief minister, took the oath of office shortly after securing 220 votes in the provincial assembly, becoming the first woman chief executive in Pakistan's history.\nThe opposition candidate, Rana Aftab Ahmad, did not receive any votes as the party boycotted the elections after being reportedly silenced.\nMeanwhile, addressing a news conference outside the Punjab Assembly, PTI leader Shaukat Basra said that the \u2018fraudsters\u2019 not only stole the people\u2019s mandate, but they were treating the voters ruthlessly and also demanded the immediate resignation of the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC).\nAlso read: Maryam Nawaz takes oath as first woman chief minister of Pakistan\n\u00a0\nHe was flanked by a large number of PTI-backed candidates claiming to have won the recent elections in their respective constituencies. All the losing candidates felt cheated and showed Form 45, in their hands, proof of their victory.\nBasra observed that the denial of the party symbol \u2018bat\u2019 made the ground for the rigging, adding that the \u2018fake chief minister\u2019 along with her \u2018fake legislators\u2019 were elected in the Punjab Assembly. He claimed that Maryam Nawaz had lost the election to PTI-backed candidate Meher Sharafat.\nHe averred that they (the PML-N) claimed that a deal had been made (with the establishment), but they did not seek the people's support. \u201cToday, Pakistan was being ridiculed after the farce elections. After this sham election, there will be chaos in the country and subsequently, its economy will deteriorate and become unmanageable,\u201d he added.\nHe castigated the Sharif family for taking turns (in the Prime Minister's office); they are \u201cseasoned money launderers\u201d. He added that they (the Sharif family) have cheated on the rights of the people.\nHe claimed that the PTI has a two-thirds majority in the Punjab Assembly after winning 250 seats.\n\u201cHence, we will call an Assembly\u2019s session, which will be attended by our elected candidates, and we will elect a chief minister, a speaker and a deputy speaker,\u201d he added.\nTalking about the rigging claims of former Commissioner Rawalpindi Liaquat Ali Chattha, Basra said that he (Chattha) took the name of the Chief Justice of Pakistan and the Chief Election Commissioner; thus, they request the Chief Justice to constitute a full court and excuse himself from it. \u201cThe full court proceedings should be shown live on TV,\u201d he added.\nMoreover, PTI leader Naeem Haider Panjutha told the media that their candidates were leading the polls with a margin of over 100,000 votes in PP-71 and still he lost the election. He also claimed that his voters registered in his constituency were transferred to other constituencies while their polling agents were not allowed access (to the polling stations) so that the results could be rigged in the evening.\n\u201cAlso, in my constituency all ballot boxes were broken; when \u2018they\u2019 realised that I was leading the polls, the final result was altered to declare my opponent victorious by 5,000 votes,\u201d he added.\nHe also complained that they have filed petitions against rigging at various platforms but all have been rejected.\nPTI-backed candidate Ruba Omar also claimed, \u201cMy results were rigged to defeat me; I had a lead of 20,000 votes till midnight, but by the next morning, the results were rigged and we had lost the elections.\u201d She also highlighted that they have filed complaints against the rigging and they will continue with our legal battle.\n"

            "Text": "Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa has summoned the meeting of the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) on February 29 to consider the complaints of misconduct against resigned top court judge Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi.\nIt has been learnt that the council's meeting will be held to record the statements of prosecution witnesses in Naqvi\u2019s case.\nPerhaps Naqvi will be the first judge, who is facing proceedings of misconduct after his resignation.\nLast week, an SC larger bench by a majority of 4 to 1 held that the proceedings, which had already been initiated by the SJC against a judge, shall not abate on his resignation or retirement.\n\u201cIt is the prerogative of the SJC to proceed with the matter accordingly,\u201d read the order.\nHowever, one section of lawyers is expressing serious concerns over the majority order.\nArticle 209 of the Constitution clearly states that the SJC can proceed against a judge.\nBut those lawyers argue that a constitutional amendment is required to extend the jurisdiction of the SJC to proceed against judges who have either retired or resigned.\nThey are also comparing the order with the decision wherein Article 63-A of the Constitution was being interpreted.\nHowever, several other lawyers believe that in order to restore the people\u2019s trust, it is essential that the SJC should proceed against a judge who retires before the council's final decision in order to secure the benefit of pension.\nIn view of the judicial order, the proceedings of misconduct against Naqvi will be valid. Earlier, he wrote a letter to the SJC questioning the proceedings of misconduct against him.\nIt is likely that the SJC will conclude the proceedings in the next couple of hearings as two members -- namely Justice Sardar Tariq Masood and Lahore High Court Chief Justice Muhammad Ameer Bhatti -- are retiring next month. One other member, Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan, has also been recommended for his appointment as an SC judge by the Judicial Commission of Pakistan on February 23.\nFormer SC judge Naqvi had expressed his lack of trust in SJC members including CJP Isa.\n"

The prices of all items have been increased by 30% in the context of Iftar.\nThe prices of vegetables, fruits, dates, gram flour, pulses, ghee, white gram, chicken and meat have increased dramatically. The prices of dates, a regular item for breaking fast, have jacked up to the highest rate of Rs800 per kg, and gram flour is being sold at Rs300 per kg. The prices of dates and gram flour and dates are expected to increase further next week.\nLive chicken is being sold at Rs475 per kg, chicken meat Rs650 per kg, eggs Rs250 per dozen, mutton Rs2,200 per kg, beef Rs1,200 per kg, white chickpeas Rs400 per kg, black gram Rs350 per kg, red beans Rs380 per kg, lentils Rs300 per kg, lentil mash Rs510 per kg, and potato is being sold in Rs45 to Rs50 per kg.\nSimilarly, onion is being charged for Rs250 per kg, tomato Rs150 per kg, lemon Rs150 per kg, garlic Rs600, ginger Rs630, okra Rs260, karela Rs300, cucumber Rs100 per kg, radish Rs40 per kg, carrot Rs60 per kg, cabbage Rs130 per kg, brinjal Rs120 per kg, green chilli Rs200 per kg, and coriander is being sold in Rs50 per packet.\nShopkeepers and vendors are selling apples from Rs250 to 300 per kg, pomegranates from Rs350 to Rs400 per kg, guava from Rs150 to Rs200 per kg, bananas from Rs150 to Rs160 per dozen, citrus fruits from Rs150 to Rs250 per dozen, while strawberries are being sold in Rs600 per kg.\nRead:\u00a0Inflation spikes on food, energy costs\nPresident of Anjuman Tajaran Sabzi Mandi, Ghulam Qadir Mir says that as Ramazan nears, the wholesale markets lack a supply of vegetables and fruits. The supply of pulses is even not in full quantity.\nThe Ramazan shopping is expected to start next week. Due to the low supply of eatables, the prices of vegetables, fruits and grocery items are much more likely to increase to a record this year in Ramazan, leaving the citizens under acute financial stress.\nAnd if the prices of petroleum products are also increased in Ramazan, the price control mechanism would flop. It appears that the Rawalpindi district administration has [apparently] no price control strategy ahead of the holy month.\nFlower price hike\nOn the other hand, flower sellers also increased the prices of fresh flowers and flower petals on the eve of Shab-e-Barat. The people buy flowers to place on the graves of their near and dear ones.\nIn the open market, flower petals were sold at a record price of Rs600 per kg and fresh flowers at Rs650 per kg. A large number of citizens, who went to the cemeteries to buy flower petals for praying on the graves of their loved ones, were forced to buy flower petals at a record-high price.\nThe sellers charged Rs600 per kg for rose petals, Rs550 per kg for mixed leaves of various wildflowers including roses and chrysanthemums, Rs700 per kg for fresh rose petals, Rs500 for normal dry flower wreath and Rs1000 for fancy wreath, Rs1,800 for wreath of fresh flowers, and sold a packet of incense sticks in Rs250.\nFlower seller Asghar Abbasi said that the prices have shot up due to rising demand for flowers and flower petals on the occasion of Shab-e-Barat and wedding season before Ramazan.\n\u00a0\n"

The move aims to eliminate manual acceptance of pension cases in the designated districts, a step welcomed by teacher organisations.\nTeachers bodies believe that online filing of pension cases will effectively combat corruption and bribery.\nTeachers and non-teaching staff are expected to benefit from the digital process, eliminating the need for physical visits to offices and reducing associated distress. The online pension system will commence initially in South Punjab, with a dedicated app already released for the project following a successful trial. The entire process, including the scrutiny of pension documents and obtaining pension approval, will be conducted through the online platform.\nLeaders of teacher organisations, Muhammad Shafiq Bhalwalia and Basharat Iqbal Raja, commend the education department for the decision to transition to an online system, considering it a positive step for the education sector.\n\u00a0\n"

The constable is then observed forcefully grabbing the young man's hair and beard.\nUpon receiving reports of this serious incident, CPO Rawalpindi Khalid Hamdani took action, suspending ASI Shehzad and ordering an inquiry led by SP Rawal Faisal Saleem. Subsequently, a case was registered against the ASI under police orders.\nRead:\u00a0Preteen housemaid \u2018tortured to death\u2019\nRawalpindi CPO emphasised a zero-tolerance policy towards police abuse, underscoring the gravity of the situation.\nIt's noteworthy that this incident follows a previous case where the nominated Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz took notice of the mistreatment of a Taxila woman by the police, resulting in the dismissal of the responsible officer.\nIn another distressing incident in Sadiqabad, Rawalpindi, police and Dolphin Force personnel were captured on video torturing youths in public.\nThe incident, which occurred three days prior, involved the police and Dolphin Force personnel assaulting young boys on the street. The video also showed a mother coming out of her house to intervene and protect her children, while gunshots fired by a police officer added to the chaos.\nAfter the video went viral, the police issued a statement claiming that the youths had resisted arrest, although this explanation surfaced only after public outrage.\nSadiqabad SHO Anwarul Haq was seen in the video arriving at the scene to restore order.\nThis incident marks the fourth instance of Dolphin Force and police personnel being involved in violence in the Sadiqabad police station area.\nThe police officials maintained that, on February 23, the accused youths engaged in aerial firing and resisted arrest during the Basant festival. As a result, six individuals were apprehended, and weapons were seized.\nThese incidents of police violence highlight a growing concern for the safety and rights of civilians in Rawalpindi, prompting authorities to take immediate action to address and rectify the alarming situation.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n"

This positive trend continued into January 2024, with a recovery amounting to Rs120 million.\nThe tariff hike prompted resistance from consumers in both domestic and commercial sectors, with a majority of the non-payments emanating from commercial consumers who sought relief through legal channels.\nHowever, the Lahore High Court\u2019s Pindi Bench, in response to an appeal by 16,000 commercial consumers, redirected the case to the Secretary Housing Punjab.\nRead:\u00a0WASA to register cases against defaulters\nConsequently, the WASA MD received explicit instructions to adhere to established regulations, leading to the formation of five specialised teams for the recovery of outstanding amounts from commercial customers.\nA stern notice has been issued to all private schools, hotels, restaurants, and other commercial establishments, emphasising the imperative to settle outstanding debts promptly or face legal consequences. Simultaneously, a revenue recovery review meeting endorsed the decision to file FIRs against defaulters, individuals involved in illegal connections, and those obstructing the revenue recovery process.

            "Text": "In view of the expansion of the real estate sector, a large number of housing companies have started replicating trendy construction models and designs from across the globe in the hopes of attracting heavy-pocketed clients, with many societies importing vast varieties of plants and seeds from abroad for accentuating the natural greenery of their landscapes. Yet, the marketing strategy which guarantees promising revenue, is covertly creating an alien habitat for the local population of plants and birds, who might soon face annihilation.\nApart from their usage in housing societies, foreign plants like Aglaonema, Lucky bamboo, Anthurium, Bonsai, Canary Island date palm, Copernicia palm, silver date palm, Box hedge plant, Alexander and Olive trees, which are imported from China, Thailand, India, Sri Lanka, Netherlands and other European Union countries, are also available for indoor use, and outdoor decoration of courtyards, gardens and green belts. However, many of these foreign plants which are sold across Pakistan are illegally imported into the country and not only pose a risk of allergies to humans but are also considered harmful to the local population of birds, insects, crops and plants.\n\u201cSome non-local plants have negative effects on our environment, since they hinder biodiversity by affecting the process of pollination in many plants. As a result, many types of local trees have started disappearing and are facing extinction,\u201d warned Dr Asad Shabbir, a former professor of botany at the Punjab University, who believed that before introducing non-native vegetation, the benefits and pitfalls should be analyzed.\n\u201cMost people question why fireflies, butterflies, bees, parrots, sparrows, bulbuls and other birds are becoming extinct. The main reason is that foreign plants have led to the extinction of local plants, which were the habitat of local birds. Since these birds do not have a habitat, they are unable to thrive,\u201d said Fahad Malik, an environmental and wildlife conservation activist, who further added that no research activities were conducted in the country for sustaining the indigenous plant and bird species.\nOn the other hand, Mohammad Zeeshan, a local nursery owner revealed that the demand for foreign plants was surging because of their accelerated growth period. \u201cThe price of these plants ranges from Rs1000 to Rs100,00 and they are very popular among people who want to beautify their homes,\u201d he added. While there is no record of the exact number of foreign plants available in Pakistan, it is estimated that more than 700 species of non-native plants are planted across the country, many of which have become a threat to local plants and animals.\nFor instance, the Kikar tree has affected the growth of many local herbs, including the acacia and shisham trees. Similarly, water ferns imported from South America have damaged the water ecosystem of Sindh.\nIn this regard, Dr Waseemul Hassan, former Director General of the Plant Protection Department said, \u201cBefore importing, the local environment and climate of the place where these plants are to be planted, is analyzed. If the department thinks that foreign plants can affect our environment, or that they cannot grow in our environment, then the import of such plants is not allowed.\u201d\n\u00a0\n"

However, a former official from the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) dismissed this assertion.\nThe PTI-leader-turned-president was sent a summary by the caretaker parliamentary affairs ministry, urging the initiation of the NA session on Monday.\nDespite the plea, President Alvi utilized his constitutional authority to defer the session by 15 days, citing apprehensions about the completion of the reserved seats allocation process.\nNevertheless, the president received information that, in accordance with the Constitution, the NA session must be summoned on February 29. In addition, he was apprised that the constitution dictates the necessity of convening the NA session within 21 days of the elections.\nSubsequently, on March 1, the papers for the NA speaker will be presented to the assembly secretariat. Following this, on March 2, the election for the new speaker and their deputy will take place.\nSimilarly, the process of submitting the nomination papers for the election of the prime minister will take place on March 3. The election for the post of the premier will be held in the NA on March 4. The election of the new president will be conducted by the ECP on March 9.\nIt was also mandatory to convene the session of the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Assembly by February 29.\nThe ECP has allocated reserved seats to political parties but not granted any to the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) after the PTI-backed independent candidates merged with it for this very purpose.\nOn February 21, the SIC approached the ECP, seeking the allocation of reserved seats in the NA and provincial legislatures after the PTI sealed its alliance with the council.\nHowever, the ECP has yet to decide whether to entertain the request or not.\nThe SIC had neither applied for any reserved seat to the ECP \u2013 a requirement under the law \u2013 nor had it filed a priority list of candidates before the elections.\nSpeaker\u2019s authority\nSpeaking to the media outside the Punjab Assembly in Lahore, PML-N stalwart Senator Ishaq Dar on Sunday said if the president did not convene the inaugural session despite the submission of a summary to him for this purpose, its speaker could constitutionally do so by himself on February 29.\nThe PML-N leader said it was clearly mentioned in the Constitution that if the new NA session was not called, the speaker had the authority to convene it on the 21st day.\nHe added that according to the constitutional 21-day deadline, February 29 was the last date.\nDar elaborated that even in the provinces if the governor did not convene the session of the provincial legislature, the same principle would apply there.\nAddressing a news conference at the PML-N\u2019s secretariat in Lahore\u2019s Model Town, party leader Attaullah Tarar claimed that the issue of the NA session was being deliberately made controversial and there was no justification to ruin the matter after the notification of the reserved seats.\nTarar further maintained that the PTI had always tried to derail democracy in Pakistan and its founding chairman Imran Khan writing a letter to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), urging the global lender to give the poll results a thorough once-over before cutting any new cheques for Islamabad, was a proof of the party\u2019s involvement in conspiracies against the country.\nIn a related development, PPP leader Shazia Marri said the president was \u201cmisusing his authority\u201d by delaying the summoning of the new NA session.\n\u201cIt is necessary for the president to call a session of the National Assembly without delay on the summary of the [interim] prime minister,\u201d Marri said in a statement, adding that Dr Alvi should follow the Constitution rather than the \u201corders of one individual\u201d.\nThe PPP leader further said Dr Alvi was the same president who had tried to \u201cunconstitutionally\u201d dissolve the NA in the past as well. She continued that Dr Alvi\u2019s \u201cviolation of the Constitution\u201d and \u201cmisuse of office\u201d would remain a part of history.\n\u201cThe National Assembly elections have been completed. The president is bound to convene [its] session.\u201d\nHowever, Kanwar Dilshad, a former secretary of the ECP, refuted the claim of Dar that the NA speaker had the power to convene the session by himself.\nHe said if the president was refraining from calling the NA session, one-third of its members could write to the speaker for its requisition.\n\u201cBut the question which then arises is that since they [elected representatives] have not taken the oath yet, then the speaker cannot requisition the session. So it seems that the speaker does not have the power, the president does,\u201d he maintained.\nHowever, the ex-ECP official conceded that the Constitution clearly stated that it was mandatory for the sessions of the NA and provincial legislatures to be called 21 days after the general elections were held.\nHe continued that the president should summon the sessions within 21 days \u2013 that was on February 29.\nIn a parallel development, PPP Parliamentary Leader Ali Haider Gillani raises eyebrows over President Alvi's alleged misuse of the office for personal vendettas and opposition agendas.\nIn a statement issued here on Sunday, he emphasised the importance of upholding democratic principles and stated that the presidency is once again being used for undemocratic actions.\nHe highlighted the constitutional obligation, as per Article 91, that the president is bound to convene a session of the National\nAssembly within the prescribed time frame on the advice of the premier.\n"

            "Text": "Amid reports that President Dr Arif Alvi wants the reserved seats allocated before summoning the inaugural session of the National Assembly, experts said on Sunday that the lack of completion of the electoral college in the lower house of parliament would not affect the constitutionality of the election for the head of the state so he should not delay the process.\nNevertheless, the outgoing president appears to have once again deliberately refrained himself from signing a summary seeking the summoning of the NA session, inviting criticism from not just the political parties but experts as well that Dr Alvi has been repeating something that has been a blot on his stay in the office: delaying the approval of his opponents\u2019 summaries.\n\u201cEven if a large number of seats are vacant in each legislature, the assembly is intact,\u201d said Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat) President Ahmed Bilal Mehboob.\n\u201cIt will not impact the constitutionality of the president\u2019s election.\u201d\nThe Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) is reportedly gearing up to hold the election for the office of the president by March 9 -- two days before the retirement of half of the senators after completing their six-year term.\nIn fact, the Pildat chief said Article 41(4) of the Constitution referred to postponing the presidential election only if the NA was dissolved.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t even refer to the provincial assemblies.\u201d\nArguing that narrow technicalities should be dispensed with, Mehboob was of the view that the ECP should resolve the issue of the pending reserved seats by allotting them to the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) and if not, they should be distributed among other political parties.\nRenowned constitutional expert Hafiz Ehsaan Ahmad Khokhar also observed that vacant seats in the NA would not affect the schedule of the presidential election.\n\u201cIt is not for him [the president] to be involved [in the matter of the reserved seats] as the ECP acts independently,\u201d he explained.\nThe expert elaborated that the president was constitutionally bound to summon the NA session under Article 91(2) of the Constitution within 21 days from the day of holding the general elections.\n\u201cHe [the president] cannot withhold the summary; cannot keep it pending and cannot return it as well as the advice of the [interim] prime minister as he is bound under Article 48 and 91 of the Constitution [to act on it],\u201d Khokhar said.\n\u201cThe president cannot stop the holding of the NA session for the formation of a new government.\u201d\nReferring to Article 91(2) of the Constitution, Khokhar said the president could not deviate from this constitutional provision and its command obligations.\n\u201cThis extraordinary ordinary session is not dependent upon the discretion of the president or the prime minister.\u201d\nAccording to the expert, the president is bound as per Article 48(1) of the Constitution to act on the advice of the caretaker prime minister, and he has no legal option to deviate or keep the matter pending as it has to be carried out within 21 days of the general polls as per Article 91.\nAs for returning the summary, Khokhar said the president had some flexible mandate for legislation under Article 75 of the Constitution but not at all under Article 91 in the present scenario on any other pretext.\n\u201cIf the president refuses, then the NA secretary can be asked under the rules for summoning the session. This provides the NA secretary [the authority] to issue a gazette notification. In the present situation, the NA secretary can initiate the summoning process of the session under Article 91(2) of the Constitution,\u201d he explained.\nThe expert noted that the longest-serving president could have ended his innings at a positive note as he could not stop the process in any case.\n"

            "Text": "President Dr Arif Alvi again struck a defiant posture on Monday as he returned a caretaker government\u2019s summary for convening the inaugural session of the National Assembly, prompting Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf to call the maiden sitting of the lower house of parliament on February 29.\nAlvi, whose presidency is coming to a conclusion within a few weeks, emphasised that he would only approve the summary if the issue of reserved seats for women and minorities was resolved and distributed among the parties, as per law.\nHowever, soon after the president returned the summary, the National Assembly Speaker reportedly summoned the inaugural session on February 29. On that day, the newly-elected lawmakers would take an oath to mark the beginning of the tenure of the assembly.\nAccording to Article 91(2) of the Constitution, the National Assembly \u201cshall meet on the 21st day following the day on which a general election to the assembly is held, unless sooner summoned\u201d by the president.\nSince Alvi returned the summary, as confirmed by officials of the Presidency, National Assembly officials said that the speaker had no other option but to call the session. However, a formal statement about summoning the session has yet to be issued.\nRenowned constitutional experts as well as those who keenly observe the parliamentary activities have already conveyed in unequivocal terms that the president was constitutionally bound to summon the assembly session under Article 91(2) within 21 days from the day of holding the general elections.\n\u201cHe [the president] cannot withhold the summary; he cannot keep it pending and cannot return it, as well as the advice of the prime minister, as he is bound by Articles 48 and 91 of the Constitution [to act on it],\u201d Hafiz Ehsaan Ahmad Khokhar, a law expert, said. \u201cThe president cannot stop the session.\u201d\nAlso read: Controversy engulfs convening of NA session\n\u00a0\nHe explained that the president could not deviate from this constitutional provision and its command obligations as the National Assembly\u2019s extraordinary ordinary session was not dependent upon the discretion of the president or the prime minister.\nKhokhar maintained that the president had no mandate to delay things as defined in Article 75 of the Constitution about the president\u2019s assent to bills. He said that the National Assembly secretary could initiate the summoning of the session under Article 91(2) upon the president\u2019s refusal.\nOn the day of the inaugural session of the National Assembly, the schedule for the election of a new speaker will be released. It is expected that papers for the posts of speaker and deputy speaker will be submitted on March 1, and the voting will take place on March 2.\nAfter the election of the speaker and deputy speaker, the process for submitting nomination papers for the election of the prime minister is likely to be slated for March 3, followed by the prime minister\u2019s election in the National Assembly on March 4.\nOnce the new government takes the helm, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) is expected to go for the election for the new president on March 9 \u2013 just days before half of the senators would complete their six-year term and new senators would be elected.\n"

No one is perfect, but if you don\u2019t criticise, then how would we learn?\"\nExpressing gratitude, Murad added, \"I want to thank people on both sides and also the people of this province.\"\nMaryam, beyond being the trailblazing first female chief minister, joined the illustrious ranks of the Sharif family, becoming its fourth member to hold such a position and the first woman from the family to claim the CM seat.\nMaryam secured her triumph with 220 votes, while her opponent, Rana Aftab Ahmad of the Sunni Ittehad Council, garnered zero votes due to the boycott.\nThe session commenced nearly two hours behind the planned schedule due to claims from the SIC that its MPAs were denied entry to the assembly premises. When proceedings eventually commenced at 1pm, 103 SIC lawmakers opted to stage a walkout.\nAs proceedings began, opposition lawmakers sought time to speak, but Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmed Khan focused on the agenda of the CM's election. The opposition boycotted, chanting slogans against PML-N thrice premier Nawaz Sharif.\nMaryam, in an attempt to persuade the opposition, requested the speaker to send lawmakers to engage with them. However, as the election process started, the opposition once again boycotted and left the House.\n\u00a0\n'No revenge'\nIn her victory speech, Maryam directed her focus inward, emphasising the performance of her own party. She asserted that her competition lies in enhancing her party's efficiency rather than engaging in opposition battles.\nTaking charge as CM Punjab, her inaugural address in the Punjab Assembly conveyed an open-door policy, welcoming all, especially the opposition, to collaboratively uplift the province by swiftly resolving the challenges faced by the underprivileged masses.\nDuring her hour-and-a-half-long victory speech, Maryam expressed disappointment at the opposition's boycott, holding a framed photo of her late mother Kulsoom. She lamented their absence, stating, \u201cI wish they had been a part of the political and democratic process.\u201d\nExpressing sorrow over the opposition lawmakers' departure before the election, Maryam emphasised the importance of staying engaged in the democratic process. Despite political challenges, she thanked her allied parties, Punjab's supportive citizens, and her educators who contributed to her becoming the chief minister.\nAddressing the opposition, she said, \u201cThe doors of my chamber and heart will always remain open for them as they are for the members of my party.\u201d Maryam clarified her stance, expressing no desire for revenge and harbouring no hatred.\nHighlighting the historic nature of her election, Maryam dedicated the victory to all women in the country, emphasising that being a woman or a daughter should not hinder one's dreams. She pledged to launch over two dozen projects and announced immediate orders, including providing free medicines in government hospitals' emergencies and the upcoming launch of an air ambulance.\n\u0645\u0631\u06cc\u0645 \u0646\u0648\u0627\u0632\u0634\u0631\u06cc\u0641 \u0635\u0627\u062d\u0628\u06c1 220 \u0648\u0648\u0679 \u062d\u0627\u0635\u0644 \u06a9\u0631\u06a9\u06d2 \u067e\u0646\u062c\u0627\u0628 \u06a9\u06cc \u067e\u06c1\u0644\u06cc \u062e\u0627\u062a\u0648\u0646 \u0648\u0632\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0639\u0644\u06cc\u0670 \u0645\u0646\u062a\u062e\u0628 pic.twitter.com/s03uBs9KBq\nMurad\u2019s hat-trick\nMeanwhile, down in Karachi, Murad Ali Shah clinched his third consecutive term as Sindh's chief minister, securing 112 out of the 148 votes cast. His rival, Ali Khurshidi of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan, managed to gather 36 votes.\nAddressing the PTI-backed MPAs in the assembly, he said: \u201cWe are never scared of criticism, no one is perfect [\u2026] but if you don\u2019t criticise, then how would we learn?\u201d\n\u201cI want to thank people on both sides and also the people of this province,\u201d he added.\n\u201cThrow it out of your minds that Karachi is not a part of Sindh [\u2026] it is time to move past this flawed thinking,\u201d he asserted. CM Murad recalled that he had grown up in Karachi and knew the city like the back of his hand.\nHe also expressed hope that the opposition would play its due part in the assembly.\nRead High stakes as Punjab readies for CM vote today\nSindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah has said his new mission is to provide clean drinking water across the province.\nHe said Sindh is leading among all provinces when it comes to the provision of free healthcare.\nCiting examples of the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, Gambat Institute of Medical Sciences and other facilities, he stated that people across the country came to Sindh for free medical treatment.\n\u201cYou ask how we secured votes in Sindh, that is because we have shown our performance to the people,\u201d CM Murad added.\nHe said he is honoured to take over the position of provincial head for the third consecutive term.\n"

            "Text": "The aspiration for accessible sports grounds continues to elude the youth of Hyderabad.\nDespite the inauguration of key officials belonging to the Pakistan Peoples Party on June 19, 2023, in seven out of nine towns in Hyderabad, the promised relief from civic issues remains elusive after nine months.\nAccording to a survey conducted by the Daily Express team, while sports grounds dot the densely populated areas of the city, their neglect and lack of maintenance render them unsuitable for athletic activities.\nFormer District Nazim Kunwar Naveed Jameel, affiliated with MQM, had initiated efforts to revitalize these grounds, aiming to provide accessible sports facilities to the residents. However, since then, there has been a noticeable absence of upkeep, leading to their gradual deterioration. Presently, the city's playgrounds resemble desolate wastelands.\nHyderabad, with a population exceeding 2.4 million, boasts sports grounds and aspiring athletes. Yet, the indifference of the Hyderabad Municipal Corporation and the Department of Sports and Youth Affairs has left these grounds in a state of neglect.\nNiaz Stadium, the sole stadium serving Hyderabad and its neighbouring areas in Sindh, remains in disrepair. Despite efforts from the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and local municipal authorities, the stadium's infrastructure, including spectator seating and player facilities, remains dilapidated.\nTragically, the deteriorating conditions of these grounds force young enthusiasts and children to resort to playing on unsafe streets and roads, often resulting in accidents and injuries.\nMoreover, many of these neglected grounds have become havens for criminal activities, including gambling and drug trafficking. Additionally, the presence of stray dogs further deters people from utilizing these sports facilities.\nDust and debris swirl incessantly throughout the day across various sports grounds such as Mahboob Ground Unit Number Five, Amin Rajput Ground Unit Number Four, Zilpak Ground in Site Area, Municipal Ground Hussainabad, Board Stadium Latifabad, Pakka Qila Ground, and Bagh-e-Mustafa Ground Latifabad, among others. The walking tracks, boundary walls, and iron fences in these areas have suffered significant damage. Reports indicate that boundary walls, like those of Amin Rajput Ground and Mehboob Ground Latifabad, exhibit cracks due to constant exposure to airborne dust and dirt. Similarly, the condition of Zeal-Pak Ground in the Sindh Industrial and Trading Estate (SITE) area is dire.\nDespite assurances from the current government of the People's Party, the state of Hussainabad Municipal Ground, named after Shaheed Benazir Bhutto, remains lamentable. \nDespite laying the foundation stone and promising timely completion, successive government terms have failed to realize this commitment. \nAfter initial efforts to clear the ground of encroachments and install iron grills, neglect and contractor abandonment have resulted in the ground reverting to a sandy wasteland. The costly iron grills are now falling apart, and the ground continues to be misused for parking tractor trolleys filled with sand and gravel.\nIn 2009, renovation efforts led by Haq-Parast municipal representatives saw the rejuvenation of the scout ground in Latifabad Unit No. 9, including the construction of a jogging track and boundary wall. However, subsequent neglect has left the ground desolate, necessitating the construction of a new boundary wall.\nMoreover, sports facilities such as the basketball court in Latifabad Unit No. 6 Nursery Park and the one at Board Stadium suffer from dilapidation. The hockey astroturf ground within the Board Stadium faces destruction due to institutional neglect.\nThe Pakka Qila ground, once host to numerous national, provincial, and district-level football tournaments, now lies unused due to its uneven surface and accumulated sand. \nAdditionally, sewage discharge has resumed on the football ground along GTC Road within the Cantonment Board limits, rendering it unusable for cricket matches despite its popularity among local youth.\n"

However, since population is also considered an important factor for fund allocation, it should be considered one of the criteria for selecting areas for PSDP projects.\nEarlier, the NEC was informed that the selection of underdeveloped areas/districts in the country was based on criteria determined by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS).\nIt was observed that the highly underdeveloped districts of Balochistan and K-P, including the newly merged areas of the erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), had not been included in the list of twenty least developed districts, while some relatively less underdeveloped districts had been included.\nThe most deprived districts of Balochistan as well as the newly merged areas of K-P needed special attention, particularly in education, health, and infrastructure.\nIt was suggested to revisit the criteria for selecting the least developed districts for PSDP-funded projects. Furthermore, it was noted that provinces are also responsible for uplifting their underdeveloped districts.\nTherefore, there was a proposal to share information regarding provincial annual development program (ADP) allocations and expenditures for these districts with the NEC.\nThe NEC was informed that many areas of Sindh were greatly affected by the 2022 floods, which needed special attention for rehabilitation.\nIt was suggested to explore financing options from the International Fund for Climate Change for development projects, for which feasibility studies were required.\nThe federal government had allocated funds in the PSDP for water-related development projects in light of the National Water Policy, but such allocations were missing in the ADPs of provinces.\nThere was a dire need for provinces to adhere to the National Water Policy and allocate sufficient funds in their ADPs for this purpose.\nThe formulation process of the PSDP began with the issuance of the PSDP Call Circular (PCC) to ministries/divisions/provinces in January each year, subsequent to the issuance of the Finance Division's Budget Call Circular.\nThe PSDP Call Circular contained necessary guidelines, criteria, and formulas for inviting project-wise budgetary proposals for inclusion in the next financial year's PSDP.\n"

            "Text": "A nine-judge larger bench of the Supreme Court has raised concerns regarding the unusually lengthy judgment in the case of the late Zulfikar Ali Bhutto four decades ago. The bench, led by Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa, solicited evidence from lawyers to demonstrate potential bias among the judges involved.\nThis hearing pertains to a presidential reference against the Supreme Court's decision leading to the execution of former prime minister Bhutto in 1979. Initiated by then-president Asif Zardari twelve years ago, the reference remains under scrutiny.\nChief Justice Isa queried whether any previous criminal case had yielded a 935-page judgment, while Justice Jamal Mandokhel suggested that the extensive detail might indicate disagreement among the judges who authored it.\nJustice Mansoor Ali Shah, also on the bench, emphasized the necessity of presenting evidence from the court record to substantiate claims of judicial pressure or biased decision-making.\nLate Bhutto was convicted in the murder case of Muhammad Khan Kasuri by the Lahore High Court (LHC), over a year after the toppling of his government by military dictator Gen Ziaul Haq. Later Bhutto\u2019s appeal against his conviction was rejected by the Supreme Court through a 4-3 split verdict.\nBhutto\u2019s Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) always contended that the party founder and the country\u2019s first elected prime minister was falsely convicted and hanged. During the PPP government from 2008-13, the then president sent a reference to the apex court to review the case and acquit Bhutto.\nDuring the hearing, the chief justice remarked that when decision of the Bhutto case was reserved, two important developments took place: the then chief justice became the acting president, and that he praised Ziaul Haq for his efforts to enforce Islamic system in the country.\nAmicus curie Khalid Javed Khan told the court that had the judiciary been independent at that time, Bhutto would not have been hanged. At that time, he pointed out, there were ad hoc judges in the Supreme Court and thousands of people were put in jails, even some people were hanged.\nAlso sitting on the bench, Justice Sardar Tariq Masood asked how the court could examine bias without invalidating a judicial decision. He also wondered how could the court move forward without overturning those decisions and whether the court should set aside judgments of the trial court and in the revisions.\n"

It is not my assertion, but that of the individual herself, levelling accusations against the PML-N leadership,\u201d he elaborated.\nAlso read: Vawda sees coalition govt lasting not more than 18 months\nOn Monday, the former minister had strongly criticised Maryam Nawaz for adopting a disrespectful attitude towards a prominent women leader of PML-N, Uzma Kardar, during the provincial assembly session.\nVawda addressed Maryam Nawaz as \u201cBuzdar 2\u201d, saying: \u201cInstead of learning a lesson from the political fall of Mian Sahib and fearing Allah, \u2018Buzdar 2\u2019 is showing arrogance and contempt.

The ASF's mobile post, situated on the cargo side of the airport, became a focal point of contention. ASF Quick Response Force personnel were stationed there when CAA officers arrived, alleging a complaint about unauthorised fires in the restricted area.\nThe ASF personnel denied the complaint, but the CAA staff observed traces of black smoke in the cabin. A disagreement ensued when CAA staff attempted to enter the cabin to document the evidence.\nASF commandos prohibited their entry, citing the presence of government weapons inside. \nTensions escalated, leading to a physical altercation between the two agencies' personnel.\nUpon receiving information, additional ASF and CAA officials reached the scene to bring the situation under control. Following a complaint by CAA, ASF initially suggested an inquiry at the headquarters level. Subsequently, a joint inquiry team was formed to investigate the incident.\nThe inquiry team has initiated the process by recording statements from officials of both institutions.

        "Details": {
            "Text": "The investigation and detection of cases lodged by the Rawalpindi district police in January this year is touching at its lowest ebb as the investigation wing failed to submit challans in a good number of heinous cases to the courts on time.\nAccording to the law, the police are bound to submit the challan within 14 days, but investigation officers usually take six months to one year to submit a complete challan, thus \u2018facilitating\u2019 the accused involved in cases of serious nature.\nThe performance of investigation teams of 33 police stations across the district has turned out to be very disappointing and poor. Despite repeated announcements and tall claims of police top brass that the police performance improved last month, the investigation police have miserably failed to present the challans of cases in the courts on time.\nThe IOs even couldn\u2019t arrest a record number of accused in heinous cases. The district police registered a total of 4,531 cases in Jan and presented 1,903 final challans in the courts. 70 per cent of challans submitted in the courts were related to the cases of kite flying, profiteering, gambling, liquor consumption, and petty brawls.\nHowever, the investigation police failed to submit challans in heinous cases of murder, robbery, kidnapping, kidnapping of women, and drug trafficking in the courts. Police nominated 6,718 people in a total of 4,531 cases and arrested only 2,606 accused. Interestingly, the female SSP Investigation terms this performance excellent.\nOut of these listed cases, the police failed to trace two cases, and quashed 28 cases as fake, while 54 arrested accused were acquitted and released. The Sadiqabad police registered 475 cases in a month, the Taxila police 427, the New Town police 331, and the Bani police lodged 281 FIRs. The women's police station has yet to register a single case in January.\nThe situation is so alarming that the accused involved in heinous cases have started fleeing after being granted bail.\nSenior investigation officers are of the view that the police teams are continuously failing to arrest the accused and the prevailing investigation system will continue at the cost of police performance until the police are depoliticised and the investigation system is separated from the police.\nThey further say after increasing of strength, the investigation wing should be spared of arresting political workers, monitoring politicians and going after them. The authorities need to come up with a clear investigation system soon and otherwise, the police investigation will collapse.\nRawalpindi District Bar Association president Intizar Mehdi Shah says the 14-day period for presenting a challan to the court is too short and suggests the law be amended to 30 days. He also called for abolishing the challan system with several witnesses and de novo hearings immediately to avoid delays in judgments of cases.\nRetired District and Sessions Judge Shaukat Ali Sajid argues that less number of accused in a case always benefits the complainant, but up to six nominations in a case spoils the case.\nSenior criminal lawyer Sabtain Bukhari also suggests increasing the period of submission of challan from 14 days to a month and strict departmental action against the investigator for failing to meet the 30-day deadline. The case should be also taken from the IO as punishment, he suggested.\nAdvocate Sabtain also suggested introducing the forensic lab system at the divisional level for speedy investigation of cases.\n"

He highlighted that the initiative will help domestic workers, who represent a large portion of the informal economy, and are deprived of their fundamental rights. He noted that these domestic workers face numerous challenges, including low wages, poor working conditions, harassment, and various forms of abuse. He appreciated the efforts and commitments of EFP in promoting decent work for all and stated that the code will provide the basis for legislation on domestic workers in Sindh, according to a press release.\n\nEFP\u2019s Secretary-General, Syed Nazar Ali shed light on the salient features of the code of conduct, which has been developed with the support of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and in consultation with all stakeholders, to foster decent working conditions for domestic workers. The code serves as a voluntary tool and offers guidance to employers of domestic workers on the terms of employment to uphold equitable practices and nurture positive working relationships.\n\nRead\u00a0Moot seeks better laws for domestic workers\nCountry Director of ILO Pakistan Office, Geir Tonstol emphasised that implementing the Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and other ILO Conventions like Convention 189 will pave the way to promoting decent work for domestic workers. He acknowledged the national laws for domestic workers, underscoring the link between the laws and their implementation. Tonstol expressed hope that this code of conduct would serve as a guideline to initiate discussions and lead to the formulation of a law for domestic workers in Sindh. He reiterated the ILO\u2019s technical support to its tripartite constituents in promoting decent work for all in Pakistan, including domestic workers.\n\nEFP Vice President, Feroz Alam highlighted the organisation\u2019s efforts and reiterated the vital role of domestic workers in our lives, caring for our children and managing household responsibilities. He stressed the importance of respecting domestic workers and ensuring they have favourable working conditions, particularly considering their significance as a source of employment, especially for those with limited education, notably women. He advocated for the regulation of their employment and working conditions, asserting that implementing a code of conduct would foster behavioural changes and acknowledgment of domestic workers.\n\nSecretary-General of the Pakistan Workers Federation, Waqar Memon echoed similar sentiments, regarding the initiative as a positive step toward recognising and safeguarding the rights of domestic workers. He underscored the necessity of enacting laws to protect the rights of domestic workers in Sindh, emphasising the importance of legal frameworks to ensure their fair treatment and well-being.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 27th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

Addressing the Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), she highlighted Bulgaria\u2019s offerings in food processing, agriculture, Information Technology (IT), and new technologies.\nPresident Kashif Anwar and Senior Vice President Zafar Mahmood Chaudhry of LCCI welcomed Gancheva, underscoring the importance of strengthening bilateral trade relations. Executive Committee Members including Raja Hassan Akhter, Mian Attiqur Rehman, Ahmed Elahi, and Mohammad Tauqeer Malik also participated in the discussion.\nGancheva noted the need to enhance trade figures between Pakistan and Bulgaria, pointing out Bulgaria\u2019s export of wheat and import of textile items from Pakistan, reflecting broader trends within the European Union. She highlighted Bulgaria\u2019s EU membership since 2007, emphasising its favourable taxation system and access to a market of 1.3 billion customers.\nBulgaria boasts strengths in Information Technology, automotive, mechanical engineering, electronics, mechatronics, and robotics, offering low operational costs and robust manufacturing capabilities. The ambassador reiterated Bulgaria\u2019s participation in the GSP Plus arrangements and shared information about upcoming international exhibitions in Bulgaria. She stressed the need to explore more opportunities to diversify trade and partnerships.\nThe LCCI president acknowledged Bulgaria\u2019s support for Pakistan\u2019s GSP Plus status, facilitating increased exports to the EU. He highlighted Bulgaria\u2019s strategic location as a gateway for Pakistani products to enter the EU market, stressing the importance of strengthening trade ties.\nAnwar stressed the need to capitalise on the immense opportunities for trade expansion, aiming for bilateral trade to reach at least $1 billion in the near future. He said that the volume of Bulgaria\u2019s total global trade is around $108 billion with Pakistan only having a share of a mere $80 million. He underscored the need to bridge the gap between the actual potential and current trade figures. He said that there is a considerable scope for Bulgaria to enhance its imports of citrus fruits, mangoes, value-added textiles, sports goods, leather products, furniture, marble among other goods from Pakistan. Identifying key areas for collaboration, he said Pakistan and Bulgaria could enhance economic cooperation through joint ventures in sectors like IT, food processing, automotive, tourism, and agriculture technology.\nThe LCCI president also briefed the Bulgarian envoy about Pakistan\u2019s Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) and efforts to expedite investment in five key areas including, defence, agriculture, minerals, ITT and energy. He also explained that the government is making an effort to improve the business climate in Punjab through streamlined facilitation for investors.\nAnwar highlighted the importance of connecting the private sectors of both countries through exchanges of delegations, participation in trade fairs, and collaborative ventures, fostering a mutually beneficial partnership between Pakistan and Bulgaria.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 27th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

            "Text": "Pakistan\u2019s demand for solar energy is rising as both residences and businesses increasingly recognise solar power as a reliable and cost-efficient source of electricity.\nAccording to official figures, Pakistan imported $1.11 billion worth of solar products from January to September 2023, equivalent to an estimated 4GW of modules. This coincides with the Private Power and Infrastructure Board (PPIB) releasing framework guidelines in September 2023 to expedite power purchase agreements for solar projects and integrate solar onto public building roofs.\nIn light of these developments, Trina Solar, a global leader in smart PV technology and energy storage solutions, anticipates substantial growth in the Pakistani market. This optimistic outlook is fuelled by reforms in solar initiatives, fluctuating fuel prices, and rapid advancements in solar technology. The company\u2019s foresight is supported not only by market dynamics but also by a strategic focus on reducing solar project Levelised Cost of Energy.\nThe introduction of high-power modules, driven by technological breakthroughs aligns with the Pakistani market\u2019s preference for high-power output modules.\nTrina Solar has undertaken projects across Pakistan in various market segments, including residential, commercial, and industrial, and utility scale.\n\nRead\u00a0Kakar advocates solar innovation\nTalking with a group of journalists on Monday, Trina Solar Asia Pacific Head, Dave Wang emphasises the company\u2019s commitment to empowering diverse entities across Pakistan, fostering both economic prosperity and environmental stewardship. \u201cOur mission \u2018Solar Energy for All\u2019 propels our commitment to delivering industry-leading modules, enabling our customers to achieve \u2018grid parity\u2019, making it more economical to generate electricity from solar modules than solely from conventional grids.\u201d\nWang underscores the significant impact on households and businesses, saying that reducing the cost of electricity makes a substantial difference, especially given the recent surge in electricity prices over the last 18 months, driven by high fuel prices and general inflation. \u201cAdditionally, residences and businesses in areas experiencing prolonged power blackouts can now tap into an alternative source of electricity rather than relying solely on the grid,\u201d he said.\nTo illustrate the financial benefits, Wang provides an example of a residential household with a monthly electricity consumption of 500 units, resulting in a monthly bill of approximately Rs20,000. \u201cIf the homeowner invests in a 5kW system generating 6200 units at a cost of Rs900,000, the potential savings will be of Rs341,000 annually, in this scenario, the modules would essentially cover their own costs within 2-3 years\u201d.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 27th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

            "Text": "\u00a0\nMaryam Nawaz scripted history on Monday as she was sworn in as Punjab's first woman chief minister, breaking through the glass ceiling in the political territory traditionally dominated by male politicians.\nThe 2024 general elections marked Maryam Nawaz's electoral debut. Previously appointed as the senior vice president of the party in January 2023 by PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif, she was entrusted with the task of restructuring the party.\nMaryam was elected as MNA from constituency NA-119 and MPA from PP-159 in constituency NA-123.Following the party's directive, she chose to retain the PP-159 seat, paving the way for her elevation to the position of chief minister of Punjab.\nHowever, this was not the Sharif scion\u2019s inaugural venture into Pakistan's political landscape. Actively engaged in the party's election campaign leading up to the 2013 elections, she also led the PML-N\u2019s social media wing during and after the polls.\nIn 2014, she assumed the role of chairperson of the Prime Minister\u2019s Youth Programme, later contested in the Lahore High Court (LHC) and subsequently resigned. Despite holding no elected office, she was seen distributing laptops to students on behalf of the Punjab government.In 2016, during the former premier and her father Nawaz Sharif's open-heart surgery, Maryam took control of the media narrative, providing timely updates on her father's condition through her Twitter account.Maryam faced scrutiny for her control over the government\u2019s messaging, especially when leaked audio clips revealed her instructing then-information minister Pervaiz Rasheed on advertisements for certain TV channels.\nShe admitted the authenticity of the clip, clarifying that she was referring to party ads.Maryam Nawaz\u2019s electoral prowess was put to the test in September 2017 during the NA-120 by-elections, where she led the campaign for her ailing mother, Kulsoom Nawaz, securing victory with a considerably reduced margin.\nThis marked a pivotal moment for Maryam as she emerged as the heir to Nawaz Sharif\u2019s political legacy.Debates among analysts revolved around whether the by-election victory truly signalled a triumph for the embattled PML-N.\nThis constituency had long been a stronghold for the party and the Sharif family, spanning nearly three decades.Political observers noted a positive shift in a party known for its conservative social ethos and a scarcity of women in prominent party and cabinet roles. However, they point out that her otherwise positive rise is still tinged with familial ties in a political landscape steeped in dynastic traditions.\nAcknowledging the challenges she faced, Maryam conceded, \"The journey was more difficult than I had imagined.\" During an interview with Voice of America, she highlighted the heightened criticism faced by women in the limelight, especially in leadership positions, compared to their male counterparts.\"If a woman has formed ideals, principles, ideologies, convictions, values, and wants to carve a niche for herself, it will always be viewed with a little suspicion,\" she remarked.\nDespite resistance from within the party\u2019s ranks, Maryam expressed being \"pleasantly surprised\" by the acceptance she found among the people of Pakistan.Regardless of whether \"the people\" embraced her, it was evident that her ascent came with a substantial cost \u2014 both on a personal level for Maryam and for the party.\n"

Judge Nasir has replaced Judge Muhammad Bashir as he is retiring in a few weeks.\n\nJudge Bashir was supposed to indict the ex-premier and former first lady on Jan 26 but the indictment was deferred to Jan 30. It was then scheduled for Feb 10 but was again deferred till Feb 27.\n\nDuring the hearing, Judge Rana read out the charge sheet against the two. Both Imran and Bushra denied the charges.\n\nThe court then summoned five National Accountability Bureau (NAB) witnesses at the next hearing on March 6.\n\nThe case of six others including Zulfikar Bukhari, Farhat Shehzadi, and Shehzad Akbar, was separated.\nThe lawyers of the accused had requested provision of the copy of the challan again.\n\nAt one point, the judge inquired that Imran, \u201cplease inform the court whether your teeth have been checked or not\u201d.\nThe PTI founder said that no dental check-up had been conducted yet. \u201cThe prison administration had said that the doctor will come on Sunday, while now the prison administration is saying that the doctor will come next Sunday.\u201d\n\nThe court granted both requests for provision of general physician and dentist for medical examination and dental check-up of the PTI founder.\n\nIn December, NAB had filed a corruption reference against Imran and seven others, including his wife, in connection with the Al-Qadir University Trust.\n\nThe case alleges that Imran and Bushra obtained billions of rupees and land worth hundreds of kanals for legalising Rs50 billion \u2013 at that time \u00a3190 million \u2013 that was identified and returned to the country by the UK during the previous PTI government.\n\nThe reference filed by NAB alleged that Imran, who is currently in jail, played a \u201cpivotal role in the illicit transfer of funds\u201d. It also claimed that despite being given multiple opportunities to justify and provide information, the accused deliberately, with mala fide intention, refused to give information on one pretext or another.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n"

It has allocated 19 women\u2019s seats and four minority seats to the PML-N, 12 women\u2019s seats and two minority seats to the PPPP, and four women\u2019s seats and one minority seat to the MQM-P. Other parties\u2014the JUI-F, the PML-Q, and the IPP\u2014have each received one seat.\nThe ECP has so far notified the allocation of a total of 38 reserved seats for women and seven for minorities. It has held back its decision on the remaining 22 women\u2019s seats and three minorities.\nAccording to some experts, whether the ECP decides to allocate the reserved seats to the SIC or not, the matter will ultimately end up in the Supreme Court.\n"

            "Text": "\u00a0\nSyed Murad Ali Shah made history in Sindh when he became the chief minister for the third consecutive term on Monday, an indication that the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) would continue the same governance policy that had been pursued for the past 15 years.\nShah is the first lawmaker to be elected as the chief minister three times in a row. Previously, Syed Qaim Ali Shah had also served as the provincial chief minister three times, but for two consecutive terms.\nSyed Murad Ali Shah is the son of former chief minister Syed Abdullah Shah, the first father-son duo in Sindh. The other similar examples were set by the Jam family of the Lasbela district of Balochistan and later by the Sharif family\u2014Hamza and Shehbaz Sharif, and now Maryam and Nawaz Sharif.\nSyed Murad Ali Shah started his political career in 2002, when he became a member of the provincial assembly (MPA) of Sindh from his home constituency in Sehwan. It was the same constituency that was represented by his late father, Abdullah Shah, from 1970 to 1993.\nHe played a pivotal role while sitting on the opposition benches during the Gen Musharraf tenure. He won the provincial assembly seat again in the 2008 and 2013 elections, becoming a minister in Syed Qaim Ali Shah\u2019s cabinet. In 2016, he replaced Syed Qaim Ali Shah as the chief minister.\nAfter the general elections in 2018, the PPP did not opt to shake up its Sindh set-up and continued with Shah in the top post in the province, which he held till the end of the government tenure in August 2023.\nBorn in Karachi in 1962, Shah received early education from St Patrick\u2019s High School, Karachi, then went to the prestigious DJ Science College, Karachi, in 1979. He completed his bachelor's degree in Civil Engineeringg from the NED University, Karachi, in 1985.\nLater, he did a Masters in Civil-Structural Engineering from Stanford University in California in 1987 and Engineering Economic Systems in 1993. Before joining politics, he worked both in the public and private sectors in Pakistan, the United Kingdom, Kuwait, and the United States from 1986 to 2002.\nIn Pakistan, he worked as an engineer for the Hyderabad Development Authority, the Water and Power Development Authority, the Port Qasim Authority, and the Karachi Fish Harbour Authority. Later, he changed his career and started working as an investment banker, first at Citibank Karachi, then at Citibank London, Gulf Investment Corporation Kuwait, and Bizpivot USA.\nWhy a third time?\nFor many in the PPP and outside, Shah is considered a heavyweight politician, currently holding the position of vice president in the party as well as taking a seat in its Central Executive Committee (CEC). Besides, he is also seen as a close confidant of the PPP\u2019s top leadership.\nSeveral party leaders, when approached by The Express Tribune, gave credit to Shah for the overwhelming performance of the PPP in the February 8 general elections. In the last assembly, PPP had 91 seats in the 168-strong house. Now, it has a resounding majority of 112 seats in the house.\n\u201cFor the first time in the history of the PPP, we have won the post of mayor of Karachi, along with the PPP\u2019s victories on many provincial and national assembly seats. So Murad Ali Shah deserves credit for the PPP government\u2019s performance,\u201d PPP Sindh President Nisar Khuhro told The Express Tribune.\n\u201cMurad Ali Shah always took up Sindh\u2019s case diligently with the federal government when it came to the distribution of financial and water resources. So, there was a party consensus on his name for the slot of chief minister,\u201d he added.\nIn fact, a few names did make the rounds on social media for the post of chief minister, such as Syed Nasir Hussain Shah, Sharjeel Inam Memon, and Faryal Talpur. However, the PPP leadership stayed firm behind Shah and got him elected for a record third term.\nShah\u2019s critics attribute his phenomenal rise in politics to his \u2018utmost obedience\u2019 to the party leadership. \u201cNo doubt Murad Ali Shah is competent, but I think he is more obedient to leadership than others,\u201d opined analyst and writer Prof Nawaz Khoso.\nHe does disagree [on certain matters] but blindly follows whatever orders are issued by the party leadership. The example of the Sindh government\u2019s land being sold out to builders at throwaway prices and appointments of blue-eyed boys in the civil and police bureaucracy to appease party leaders can be quoted here,\u201d Khoso added, while talking about his election.\n\u201cDuring the PPP term, Sindh witnessed massive bungling in government departments. Bad governance, poor infrastructure, ghost schools, a lack of medicines at government hospitals, as well as a deteriorating law and order situation, point to a bad performance. I don\u2019t know why people laud his performance.\u201d\nIt is also an interesting fact that since the PPP\u2019s return to power in Sindh in 1988, seven of its total of eight chief ministers belonged to the \u2018Syed\u2019 families: three times Syed Qaim Ali Shah, one time Syed Abdullah Shah, and three times Murad Ali Shah.\nThe only exception is Aftab Shaban Mirani, who replaced Syed Qaim Ali Shah months before the sacking of then prime minister Benazir Bhutto\u2019s first government in 1990. Syed Abdullah Shah was provincial chief executive from 1993 to 1996.\n"

            "Text": "Parents regularly taking their children out to play appreciate the benefits of physical activity and sports on the overall wellbeing of their little ones however, as dangerous stray animals start occupying every nook and corner of the city in the absence of animal shelters, locally known as Kanji Houses, concerned families will have no choice but to keep their children locked inside homes since letting them out could mean exposing them to the looming risk of a lethal dog bite.\nIntroduced during the British era, Kanji Houses were set up across various areas in Punjab for catching and sheltering stray animals roaming around the city however in recent times some shelter houses have been transformed into government offices or rest houses, while many others are under the control of land occupation mafias, resulting in a scenario where no place is available for keeping stray animals, who are freely lurking around in the cities, posing a threat to the safety of not only adults but also innocent children.\n\u201cThere is an abundance of stray donkeys in my area, and many a times they have attacked our children. But unfortunately, the corporation staff has not been able to catch them,\u201d shared Farid, a resident of Lahore.\nSimilarly, the residents of the Ghaziabad area of Lahore were also fed up with the presence of stray dogs. \u201cEvery third day somebody from my area is bitten by a stray dog,\u201d revealed a local from the area, who also claimed that the corporation staff failed to address the problem and refused to take the troublesome animals to a shelter house.\n\u201cKanji Houses were meant to catch stray animals in the city so that they could not harm anyone. It is a pity that today these places have been turned into government offices,\u201d lamented Allah Rakha, the administrator of the local cattle market, who further informed that due to a lack of space in Kanji House\u2019s, people like him had to travel outside the city for locating a lost animal.\nAccording to details obtained by the Express Tribune, Kanji Houses were established on more than 150 government owned plots across nine divisions, and 38 districts of Punjab for keeping stray animals and lost pets and livestock such as cows, buffalos, goats, cats, dogs and donkeys.\nThese stray animals were caught and kept in the Kanji House by the corporation staff, and were later handed over to its owner after they paid a fine. But nowadays, major districts of the province including Lahore, Multan, Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Rawalpindi, Sargodha and Sahiwal, have no functioning Kanji Houses, due to which the government has no place for keeping stray animals in these cities.\nHowever, Tanvir Ahmed, the record keeper of a state-run Kanji House, claimed that a couple of stray animals had been caught after a long time, and the problem of stray animals in the city was resolving.\nNevertheless, Tanvir\u2019s assertion appears dubious given the fact that the rate of catching stray animals has been consistently low over the past few years, but attacks on people by stray animals have been rising, with almost 1200 people injured across the province due to an attack by a stray animal. In this regard, former DG of the local government, Masood Mahmood Tamanna said, \u201cThe evacuation of stray animals from the urban population has already been done. Now, the few lost animals that are caught, are sent to the animal market, where they are named, numbered and tagged before being returned to the owner.\u201d\n"

The development came almost 10 days after the Feb 8 polls.\n\nThe party\u2019s candidates were forced to contest the elections as independents after the apex court upheld the election supervisor\u2019s decision, considering its intra-party polls \u201cunconstitutional\u201d and revoked its claim on the electoral symbol of \u2018bat\u2019.\n\nThe PTI-backed independent lawmakers, who just joined the SIC, clinched 93 seats in the lower house of parliament as well 84 and 116 in K-P and Punjab assemblies, respectively.\n\nAs per the Constitution, the reserved seats are allocated to the political parties on the basis of the number of their lawmakers elected on the general seats. For their allocation, the ECP had already received the priority list of candidates from the parties before the Feb 8 polls.\n\nThe situation this year is different from the previous elections as the largest group of lawmakers are independents, who cannot have the reserved seats.\n\nThere are a total of 346 reserved seats for women \u2013 60 in the NA and 66, 29, 26, and 11 in the provincial legislatures of Punjab, Sindh, K-P, and Balochistan.\n\nSimilarly, there are 10 reserved seats for minorities in the lower house. Besides, there are eight, nine and three reserved seats for minorities in the Punjab Sindh, and Balochistan assemblies.\n\nBased on the current election results, the PML-N is likely to bag 17 reserved seats for women in the NA, 33 in Punjab and one in Balochistan.\n\nBesides, it will also be allocated two reserved seats for minorities in the lower house and four in Punjab.\nThe PPP will fetch 10 reserved seats in the NA from Sindh as well as a reserved seat each for women and minorities from Punjab in the lower house.\n\nThe party will receive 19 reserved seats for women and six for minorities in the Sindh Assembly. In addition, it will bag two reserved seats for minorities in the Punjab Assembly as well.\n\nThe MQM-P will bag four women's seats in the NA. It will also fetch six seats for women and two for minorities in the Sindh Assembly.\n\nBased on these figures, if the PTI-backed members after their inclusion in the SIC, the party will be allocated 22 reserved seats for women in the NA, 20 in K-P, and 27 in Punjab, beside three seats for minorities.\n\nRaza\u2019s letter stated that 86 independent candidates of the National Assembly had joined the SIC, adding that 107 independents of Punjab Assembly, 90 of K-P Assembly and nine independent members of Sindh Assembly now garnered the support of the SIC.\n\nThe SIC requested the polls supervisory body to allocate reserved seats in the national and provincial assemblies seats on these criteria.\n\n"

In addition to the current provincial president, Syed Muhammad Ali Shah Bacha, other notable figures like Syed Zahir Ali Shah, Engineer Humayun Khan, and the provincial information secretary, Amjad Afridi, are part of the deliberations.\n\nThe ultimate approval of the selected names for the governorships, or any alternative candidates, rests with the central leadership of the PPP. This decision is expected to be finalized after the establishment of the new government.\n\nIt is worth noting that the incumbent governor of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Haji Ghulam Ali, assumed office in November 2022. Before him, Shah Farman of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) held the position, resigning after the conclusion of the Imran Khan-led government at the centre.\n\n"

They reached a consensus on splitting up the power pie, deciding on crucial positions including prime minister, president, governorships, and chairman Senate.\n\nUnder the power-sharing recipe, Shehbaz Sharif is set to assume the role of prime minister once again, while Asif Ali Zardari will reoccupy the presidential chair.\n\nIn addition, the PPP is slated to assume the roles of Senate chairman and Punjab governor, while the governors in both Sindh and Balochistan will belong to PML-N.\n\nThe agreement put the brakes on the days of political limbo, potentially resolving the deadlock in the wake of the Feb 8 elections that left the national assembly hanging in the balance.\n\nWhile negotiations unfolded for government formation, the PTI had formed an alliance with the Sunni Ittehad Council to secure the necessary numbers through reserved seats in the assemblies.\n\nIn a media talk outside Adiala Jail, PTI's Qaiser said Shehbaz had a 'minority stake' in the elections and the people never gave him the mandate for premiership.\n\n\u201cPML-N and PPP should show some grace and step aside from the government,\u201d he said while censuring PML-N\u2019s Ishaq Dar and his handling of the economy during his previous stints as finance minister.\n\n"

Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf has K-P, Balochistan, and Sindh are with Pakistan Peoples Party, and Pakistan Muslim Leage -Nawaz (PML-N) has Punjab.\nIronically, everyone's focus is on their provinces and the top national leadership is ignoring the federation, Vawda said. \"The expired and incompetent leaders are coming to us again, they are coming to ruin what remains of the country rather than to repair and build it.\"\nPolitics makes strange bedfellows, using this idiom as the basis of his argument, the former minister said the honeymoon period of the coalition government will be short, \"they will be unhappy with the budget, there will be some friction before the IMF deal and then there will be breakup.\"\nHe said political analysts have put the duration of the federal coalition government at two years. Some claim the coalition will be beyond two and a half years, but this is among the impossibilities, however, \"I believe the federal coalition government will last for a year and a half.\"\nHe said that there are many reasons for this early demise, \"the incoming government faces a debt repayment of $24 billion, but the reserves are of $2 billion.\"\nHe said the matters of the new government are unlikely to proceed smoothly, \"there are press conferences against the government daily and people are on the streets.\"\nThe new government will have a bumpy start owing to financial matters and public unrest, Vawda said adding it would be a miracle if it can manage these issues.\n"

            "Text": "Business leaders in Karachi highlighted the critical role of the Safe City project in revitalising business activity and restoring investor confidence in the city, which serves as the economic engine of Pakistan.\nThey argue that the implementation of a safe city initiative in Karachi holds the promise of transforming the city into a secure and business-friendly environment, akin to the success witnessed in global business hubs like Singapore. Renowned for its robust security measures and advanced surveillance technology, Singapore has become a magnet for foreign investments and multinational corporations, setting a precedent for the economic benefits of enhanced safety measures.\nSI Global Solutions CEO, Noman Said highlighted the potential transformative impact of the Safe City project on Karachi\u2019s business landscape, drawing parallels with Singapore\u2019s success. He stresses that improved surveillance and law enforcement capabilities are expected to reduce crime rates and create a safer environment for businesses and investors. This enhanced security is crucial for attracting foreign investment, which prioritises safety in decision-making.\nMoreover, Said points out that the project could elevate Karachi\u2019s status as a venue for international cricket events, such as the Pakistan Super League (PSL), thereby boosting sports tourism and enhancing the city\u2019s global reputation. Eminent industrialist Riaz Uddin criticised the Sindh government for its perceived reluctance in making Karachi a safe city, despite its status as Pakistan\u2019s economic hub. He underscored the dissatisfaction among Karachiites with the city\u2019s safety and liveability, compared to other cities like Islamabad and Lahore.\nLiaquat Ali, another business leader, underscored the exodus of residents from Karachi due to safety concerns, highlighting the urgent need for enhanced security measures.\nDespite these challenges, progress is underway, with the Karachi Safe City (KSC) project set to launch in the coming month. Divided into five phases, the project will encompass key areas of the city and involve the installation of state-of-the-art surveillance cameras monitored by control rooms.\nPakistan Stock Exchange Director and former chief of the CPLC Karachi, Ahmed Chinoy reiterated the importance of safety and security in instilling confidence among businessmen and citizens. He acknowledged the persistent challenge of street crimes in Karachi but underscored the necessity of the Safe City project in addressing these issues effectively.\nAn anonymous senior police officer underscored the need for advanced surveillance technology, including facial recognition and artificial intelligence, to combat street crimes effectively. He cited the success of similar projects in cities like London and Lahore, stressing the importance of scaling up surveillance infrastructure to meet the demands of Karachi\u2019s urban landscape.\nHe noted that Karachi currently has approximately 2,200 traditional cameras installed, but even with the installation of 10,000 cameras, it would not suffice for such a large city. Stressing the need for advanced surveillance technology, he advocated for the installation of cameras equipped with facial recognition and artificial intelligence capabilities. This, he explained, would enable swift detection of street criminals by cross-referencing their images with databases such as NADRA\u2019s, facilitating their immediate apprehension.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 22nd, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

These suggestions were made during the visit of a delegation of businessmen, led by Coordinator Pak-Afghan Joint Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PAJCCI) Ziaul Haq Sarhadi, to the office of Director General Transit Trade, Wajid Ali.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, Sarhadi said APTTA 2010 has several lacuna as a result of which 70% of transit trade has been shifted from Karachi port to Bandar Abbas in Iran. He demanded the revival of Goods in Transit to Afghanistan (GITA) service through lost cargo via train between Peshawar to Karachi and from Karachi to Chaman. For this purpose, he urged for SRO 121 to be repealed in order to allow GITA services through containers and lost cargo as well.\n\nSarhadi added that in October 2023, the Ministry of Commerce through issuing SRO 1380 imposed a ban on 14 items of Afghan transit trade, which in a larger context constitute around 212 items, besides enforcement of a 100% bank guarantee. He said the cargo goods were already covered under insurance guarantee and had been going safely to Afghanistan for the last 13 years. He demanded the revocation of a 100% bank guarantee and the revival of the old insurance guarantee system.\n\nRead\u00a0Businessmen urge opening of more Pak-Afghan borders\n\nHe added that hundreds of trucks are illegally bringing different items including petroleum production, and food items from Iran daily which needed to be stopped. The measures taken for imposition of restriction on Pak-Afghan transit trade are hurting commerce in the region, he opined.\n\nSarhadi also shared data on Pak-Afghan trade and mentioned a decline in volume during the last several years, a reduction to $1,400 million.\n\nBoth the countries, he continued, have set the target of increasing trade volume to $5 billion which in prevailing circumstances looks impossible.

            "Text": "The Pakistan Association of Automotive Parts and Accessories Manufacturers (PAAPAM) has sounded the alarm over the government\u2019s proposed increase in sales tax on automobiles from 18% to 25%, warning that such a move could drastically escalate car prices to as high as Rs4 million or above.\nSpeaking in unison, PAAPAM\u2019s leadership, including Chairman Abdul Rahman Aizaz, SCV Mumsahd Ali, and VC Taufique Sherwani, voiced grave concerns, citing that previous tax hikes, currency devaluation, and other economic factors have already led to a substantial decline in automobile sales, plummeting to just 30% of 2021-22 levels. This downturn has not only strained the automotive manufacturing sector and curtailed job opportunities but has also resulted in diminished tax revenue from the industry.\nHighlighting the prevailing challenges such as surging energy costs, a staggering currency devaluation of over 160% within six years, exorbitantly high financing rates, and a tax burden exceeding 40% on each vehicle sold, PAAPAM officials underscored that current sales have dwindled to a mere 100,000 cars and SUVs, significantly below the installed capacity of 500,000 vehicles.\nThey noted that the automotive sector has been on a downward trajectory for the past five years, and any further price hikes, particularly due to increased taxes, would only exacerbate the decline in sales. Highlighting the elasticity of automobile demand, they warned that higher prices resulting from a GST hike would likely dampen consumer sentiment and erode investor confidence in Pakistan\u2019s market, compounding the existing challenges of hyperinflation and economic slowdown.\n\nRead\u00a0Auto industry seeks growth via diversification\nExpressing surprise over the government\u2019s decision to leave taxes unchanged on imported used cars, PAAPAM leaders argued that this policy discrepancy provides negative protection to locally manufactured vehicles, allowing used cars to dominate the market at the expense of domestic production, highlighting the detrimental impact of this trend on foreign exchange reserves and government revenue.\nThey reiterated that the Economic Coordination Committee\u2019s decision to increase the GST to 25% on locally produced vehicles, of 1,400cc and above, will result both in a drop in volumes as well as revenues.\nThe association urged authorities to refrain from burdening the local automotive industry with further tax increases, explaining that raising the GST to 25% for small-sized sedans would render them unaffordable for the middle class and result in reduced tax collection due to decreased sales. They called for constructive dialogue with the government before implementing any additional taxes on automobiles, noting that a similar proposal had been rejected during previous discussions with industry stakeholders.\nMeanwhile, data from the Pakistan Automobile Manufacturing Association (PAMA) revealed a 12.33% decrease in the sale of motorbikes and three-wheelers during the first seven months of the current fiscal year (2023-24) compared to the same period last year. While certain brands experienced growth, overall sales declined, signalling ongoing challenges in the automotive market.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 22nd, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

            "Text": "The federal government has decided to hire a new head of Pakistan\u2019s Export-Import (Exim) bank amid a disclosure of discrepancy in the age of the incumbent president, which should have made him ineligible for the appointment four years ago.\nSources in the Ministry of Finance told The Express Tribune that a decision has been made to expedite the process for the appointment of the chief executive officer and the president of the Exim Bank of Pakistan. This decision was taken after it surfaced that the incumbent chief executive did not meet the eligibility criteria at the time of his appointment in December 2019, according to officials.\nIn July last year, the federal cabinet had extended the tenure of the chief executive of the Exim Bank for a period of six months or until a new appointment, whichever is later. But the Ministry of Finance was now considering stopping the president from attending the office, said the sources.\nThe advertisement for the appointment of the CEO of EXIM Bank had been published in newspapers in May 2019. The age limit was kept at 55, as shown in the advertisement.\nThe Ministry of Finance and the State Bank of Pakistan records showed that there was a clear discrepancy in the age record mentioned in two different passports. The president, Syed Irfran Bukhari, is a dual national, holding both Canadian and Pakistani nationalities, the Ministry of Finance confirmed to The Express Tribune.\nIn December 2019, the Ministry of Finance issued the notification for the appointment of Bukhari as the head of the bank, subject to clearance by the central bank.\nThe documents showed that the central bank highlighted the \u201cdiscrepancy\u201d in the age of the candidate in a letter sent to the Ministry of Finance in February 2020.\n\u201cWhile assessing the fitness and propriety of Irfan Bukhari for the subject position, a discrepancy in his date of birth has been noted. In the National Identity Card Overseas Pakistanis (NICOP), the date of birth is 08-05-1964, whereas in the Canadian passport and FPT Proforma, his date of birth is 08-05-1962,\u201d according to the SBP letter to the finance ministry.\nThe central bank clearly told the finance ministry that his age was above the eligibility criterion and \u201cin contradiction with the job advertisement wherein the maximum age requirement for the position is 55 years\u201d.\nThe central bank advised the ministry to reassess Bukhari\u2019s eligibility. However, despite these contradictions, the ministry secured an extension in Bukhari\u2019s tenure in July last year.\nWhen contacted, the Spokesperson for the Finance Ministry, Qamar Abbasi, confirmed that Bukhari was a dual national holding Pakistani and Canadian nationalities.\nThe spokesman said that at the time of the appointment, as per the record of the NICOP, the president was 54 years and 11 months old. Abbasi said that Bukhari was shortlisted on the basis of his date of birth as mentioned in NICOP, which was cross-verified from NADRA.\n\nRead\u00a0EXIM to become operational soon\nBut the documents suggested that Bukhari started the process of preparing documents to meet the age limit criteria after his selection.\nThe date of birth on his Canadian passport was May 8, 1962, which he obtained in August 2019. This made him ineligible for the post.\nHowever, the Pakistani passport was issued on January 13, 2020 \u2013 weeks after his notification from the Exim Bank president, and mentioned the date of birth as May 8, 1964.\nThe finance ministry spokesman said a committee comprising the additional secretary internal finance, additional secretary establishment, and additional finance secretary human resource had shortlisted the candidates.\nAbbasi said that a selection committee comprising the then finance minister, then Minister for Commerce, former Prime Minister\u2019s Advisor on Institutional Reforms & Austerity, then secretary finance, then secretary establishment, and the then additional secretary Finance Division had finalised his name.\nThe spokesman further said that as required for such appointments, the SBP assessed the proposed appointment on the basis of its prescribed Fit Proper Test and cleared it.\nBut the record showed that the central bank had highlighted the age discrepancy.\nPakistan has established the Exim bank as a Development Finance Institution and it is fully owned by the federal government. The Exim bank\u2019s mandate is to promote exports and to support the implementation of import-substitution projects.\nThe sources said that the Ministry of Finance at that time had sought clarification from Bukhari after the central bank objection. Four years ago, the president had assured that he would get the record corrected with Canadian authorities and with provincial authorities of Punjab, according to the sources. But subsequently there was no follow-up on the issue. The spokesman said that the federal cabinet had approved the reappointment of Bukhari on the recommendation of the Finance Division in July last year.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 22nd, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

The event was organised by Prime Event Management with support from the Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PPMA).\n\nRead\u00a0Pharma Bureau urges govt action amid drug shortages\nRehman highlighted the need for regulations that prevent the exploitation of patients while fostering a conducive environment for pharmaceutical companies to thrive. He also called for the prompt convening of the Punjab Assembly session to facilitate the formation of a new government, reaffirming the government\u2019s commitment to constitutional duties.\nReflecting on past governmental actions, the governor commended the organisers for a successful expo, highlighting the significance of local production of pharmaceutical raw materials in driving sectoral growth and promoting technology and exports.\nPPMA Chairman Mian Misbahur Rehman echoed the call for pharmaceutical pricing reforms, advocating for a transition towards a system aligned with WHO standards to ensure fair pricing and accessibility of medicines. Meanwhile, organiser Kamran Abbasi highlighted the expo\u2019s exclusive focus on pharmaceutical equipment and healthcare essentials, offering a comprehensive platform for industry stakeholders to explore cutting-edge solutions and forge partnerships.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 22nd, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

        },
        "Details": {
            "Text": "The caretaker government has decided to change the gas priority order by placing the process industry at the top along with domestic consumers. It has also changed the priority order of the fertiliser sector by placing it in the second category along with the power sector.\nEarlier, the fertiliser industry was placed in the third category. The export-oriented industry was placed in the second category in the old policy. However, the caretaker government has removed it from the second category and placed it in the fertiliser sector.\nIn the first category, the government had added domestic and commercial consumers, including tandoor and industry processing only. The power and fertiliser sectors have been placed in the second category, industry (captive power) in the third, cement in the fourth, and CNG in the fifth category.\nSources said that the issue was taken up before the prime minister. The Petroleum division had submitted a plan regarding the proposed revision in the gas priority order that was okayed. The issue was already taken up before the economic coordination committee (ECC) to change the gas priority order.\nThe members of the economic decision-making body had suggested amendments to the gas supply priority order with the objective of according top priority to the industry, which will help boost the industrialisation process in the country. Its members had argued that the merit order for gas supply had been distorted, as the domestic sector got first priority with no value addition. They underscored the need to amend the economic merit order by placing industries at the top, as they make value addition and bring revenue for the country.\nIt was pointed out that the government had already decided on the gas load management plan, wherein the provision of gas to domestic consumers would be ensured for eight hours a day during winter months. However, some policymakers warned against relegating residential consumers in the priority order cautioning against further reductions of gas supply.\nDomestic consumers are given preference in gas supply owing to the implementation of parliamentarians\u2019 schemes that are mainly undertaken for political considerations to win over voters. Such schemes are approved by each government to provide gas to villages, though the production of indigenous gas has not increased since the year 2000.\n\nRead\u00a0Gas price hike for fertiliser plants sought\nEarlier, parliamentarians had been focusing on electricity supply projects, but its network has now expanded to the maximum level. Pakistan\u2019s gas production is depleting by 9% every year, and the country has become dependent on imported gas for the past many years. With the execution of lawmakers\u2019 projects, the gas pipeline network is expanding, while on the other hand, prices are also going up. Gas prices are linked with a guaranteed rate of return on assets. Therefore, the initiation of new schemes promises more incentives to the public gas utilities on account of an increase in prices. There are 72% retail consumers of gas, whereas 28% are bulk consumers like the power sector, industry, captive plants, and CNG stations.\nIn 2005, bulk consumers accounted for 70% of the total, whereas domestic consumers comprised 30%. However, the ratio has reversed with domestic consumers rising and bulk consumers dropping drastically. \nThe reversal in the priority order has also led to an increase in gas losses and theft. In 2013, the average losses of gas utilities stood at 10%, which has now gone up to an average of 12%. Similarly, in the jurisdiction of Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC), Balochistan has contributed 40% to the overall gas losses.\nIndustry officials say that mismanagement in the priority order has made the country a net importer of LNG, which has significantly added to circular debt. Earlier, the power sector was a key contributor to the debt pile.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 22nd, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

            "Text": "In an apparent change of heart, the Jamiat Ulema Islam-Fazl (JUI-F), after playing hardball and signalling its intention to embrace the opposition benches, on Wednesday appeared to be swallowing its own words, eyeing a slice out of the power pie in the upcoming coalition setup crafted by the PML-N and the PPP.\nSeemingly singing a different tune, the party engaged in discussions with PML-N leaders to explore the possibility of hitching a ride on the PPP-PML-N agreement bandwagon to establish a coalition government at the Centre.\nAccording to reports, the party's delegation, led by Central Secretary General Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haideri, convened with Balochistan Awami Party's Mir Khalid Khan Magsi and Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani to delve into the prevailing political landscape, particularly in Balochistan.\nMeanwhile, inside sources revealed that during the meeting between PML-N leader Ishaq Dar and JUI-F's Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haideri, the latter extended an offer to form a coalition government in Balochistan. \u201cThe PML-N and the JUI-F can at least form a coalition government in Balochistan,\u201d sources quoted Haideri as saying.\nHowever, Dar conveyed that the PML-N had already solidified a power-sharing agreement with the PPP in the province. \"We wanted to go together, but Maulana, you are too late,\" Dar responded, expressing frustration over unsuccessful attempts to engage with the JUI-F.\nHe informed Haideri that an agreement with the PPP had been reached, leaving the final decision regarding the JUI-F's offer to the party leadership. The development follows Maulana Fazl's bombshell claims, asserting that the no-confidence motion against PTI founder Imran Khan in March 2022 was orchestrated by former army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa.\nThe claims put the JUI-F's former allies, PPP and PML-N, on the defensive, as they had consistently denied the PTI founder's allegations of engineered ouster. Following his refusal to accept the results of the February 8 elections, Maulana Fazl claimed that his party had been deliberately defeated in multiple constituencies through rigging and irregularities.\nIn an unexpected turn of events, he even held discussions with his arch-rivals from the PTI, contemplating joint protests against the alleged rigging in the elections. The JUI-F chief faced criticism from the PPP and PML-N for his claims, with both parties rejecting his allegations of rigging and the subsequent no-confidence motion.\n\u00a0\n'Baseless rumours'\nHowever, PML-N's Information Secretary Marriyum Aurangzeb refuted media reports about PML-N and JUI-F, dismissing them as baseless.\nShe emphasised the mutual respect and cooperation between the two parties and urged the media to refrain from speculating about their meetings.\nA subsequent official statement from the PML-N clarified that, considering the challenges faced by Balochistan, a strong democratic government is imperative.\nThe meeting participants, recognising the need for various political forces to unite in Balochistan, affirmed their commitment to cooperation, as outlined in the official declaration.\nPPP, PML-N forge coalition pact for Balochistan govt\nIn a related development, the PPP and the PML-N reached a consensus to establish a coalition government in Balochistan.\nA key PPP leader in Balochistan confirmed to The Express Tribune that the PPP is set to claim the position of chief minister, while the governor's role will be handed over to the PML-N.\nThe distribution of portfolios between the two major political entities is pending, with the leader providing no further details.\n\"CM from PPP and Governor from PML N\", he mentioned.\nThe next 24 hours are anticipated to be crucial as the nomination for the chief minister\u2019s position in Balochistan is expected to be announced. Chairman PPP Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari is slated to make the official announcement regarding the new CM from PPP.\nSeveral notable figures are being considered for the chief ministerial role, including Mir Sadiq Umrani, a member of the PPP central executive committee, Nawab Sanaullah Zehri \u2013 who is also considered an \u2018old jiyala\u2019 \u2013 the former chief minister of Balochistan, and Sarfaraz Bugti, the former caretaker interior minister.\nThe potential candidates are vigorously vying for the coveted position.\nMeanwhile, the former ruling party, the Balochistan Awami Party (BAP), is also expected to be part of the forthcoming coalition government in Balochistan.\nJam Kamal Khan, the former CM of Balochistan and a PML-N leader, recently met with Chairman Senate Sadiq Sanjrani, aiming to garner support from the BAP. Jam Kamal is considered a strong contender from the PML-N for the position of CM in Balochistan.\nThe PML-N has emerged as the second-largest parliamentary party in the Balochistan Assembly, boasting 13 lawmakers, while the PPP claims the top spot with 14 members in the house.\nSheikh Jaffar Khan Mandokhail, the PML-N Balochistan president, expressed the party's strong desire to secure the CM position in Balochistan, citing robust representation in the assembly.\nOn the other hand, the Jamiat ul Ulema-e-Islam (JUI) with 11 lawmakers is yet to make a decision regarding government formation.\nSources within the JUI-F revealed that the party plans to sit on the opposition benches following the directives and decision of its chief, Maulana Fazalur Rehman.\n"

Under Article 19, derogatory remarks against judiciary, armed forces and brotherly countries were not allowed, Solangi remarked.\n\nHe said that the companies earning billions of dollars from the social media platforms cannot shirk responsibility for disruptions in law and order incited through their platforms.\n\nThe minister said that social media giants \u2018X\u2019 (formerly Twitter), YouTube, Facebook and Instagram had been continuously used for propaganda, lies, defamation of government officials and harassment, and the companies owning these platforms would have to control this illegal activity.\n\n\u201cThe state of Pakistan will not in any way allow these platforms to spread baseless, false and fabricated propaganda in the country,\u201d he added.\n\nThe minister said if this baseless propaganda was not stopped by these social media platforms, the state would have to take strict measures under the law.\n\nHe said there were means of legal review against any decision of the judiciary and if anyone had a complaint, a review petition could be filed.\n\nThe minister stated categorically that no one would be allowed to take the law into their hands and disturb the peace and tranquility of the country. \u201cPakistan is a peaceful country with rule of law and lawlessness and anarchy will not be allowed to be spread in the country,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said all foreigners living in Pakistan should feel assured that they were safe and their security would be ensured by the Pakistan government.\n\nEarlier, chairing the cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar said the caretaker setup in a short span of time had left behind a useful strategy for the upcoming elected government that would ensure public welfare and protect national interests.\n\n\"The caretaker government always gave priority to national interests while taking policy decisions as it believed to work together for national stability and development,\" the prime minister said.\n\nHe said the government had improved the national economy, adding \"we are leaving country's economy in a better condition than before\". He appreciated and thanked his cabinet members and civil servants for their tireless efforts during short tenure of the government.\n\nAmong other agenda items, the cabinet, on the recommendation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, allowed Chief of Army Staff General Syed Asim Munir NI (M) to receive the \"Turkish Armed Forces Legion of Merit\" awarded by Turkiye in honor of his services regarding cooperation between the armed forces of Pakistan and Turkiye.\n\nOn the recommendation of ministry of finance, the cabinet also approved the extension of deputation period of Lubna Farooq Malik as Director General Financial Monitoring Unit (FMU) from June 9, 2023 to June 8, 2024.\n\nThe cabinet, on the recommendation of ministry of National Food Security and Research (MNFS&R), approved the signing of Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between MNFS&R Pakistan and Khalifa International Award for Date Palm and Agriculture Innovation.\n\n"

            "Text": "The Supreme Court on Thursday deplored \u201cunfortunate\u201d criticism aimed at it over a judgement ordering the release of a person accused of distributing supposedly proscribed religious literature.\n\nIn response to an escalating online campaign targeting Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa, the Supreme Court issued a clarification about a recent verdict involving a man accused of committing blasphemy.\n\nThe campaign gained momentum following the CJP\u2019s remarks in the blasphemy-related case that surfaced online.\nIn the judgment, CJP Isa underscored Holy Prophet Muhammad's (PBUH) duty to convey the message of the Almighty without enforcing belief in it.\n\nCiting verses from the Holy Quran, the chief justice emphasised Islam's fundamental tenets, notably the freedom of faith.\n\"Sadly, in matters of religion, tempers flare up, and the mandate of the Holy Quran is forsaken,\" the CJP noted, acknowledging the sensitivity surrounding religious issues.\n\nThe case involved the deletion of charges against a person accused of committing blasphemy, including Sections 7 and 9 of the Punjab Holy Quran (Printing and Recording) Act, 2011, as well as Sections 298-C and 295-B of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).\n\nThe top judge stressed the need for caution in religious matters. He regretfully noted that emotions often overrode facts in cases related to religious offences.\n\nThe court granted bail to the petitioner, Mubarak Ahmed Sani, upon providing a personal bond of Rs5,000.\n\nA statement released by the top court addressed concerns over the misreporting by the media.\n\n\"Misreporting of a Supreme Court decision on electronic, print and social media is creating a lot of misunderstandings and giving the impression that the Supreme Court has deviated from the Second Constitutional Amendment (definition of \u2018Muslim\u2019) and has called for the abolition of provisions on 'crimes against religion'. This perception is completely wrong,\u201d it read.\n\n\"In the case concerned, even if the allegations mentioned in the FIR are accepted as true, even then the provisions do not apply [to them]. In such cases, Section 5 of the Criminal Amendment Act, 1932 applies, under which publication of prohibited books can be punished with imprisonment for a maximum of six months,\u201d it elaborated.\n\n\"Since the petitioner/accused has already spent more than one year in prison, the Supreme Court, keeping in view Islamic injunctions, constitutional provisions and the requirements of law and justice, ordered the release of the petitioner/accused on bail.\u201d\n\nThe statement continued to outline CJP Isa's approach to judicial interpretation, stating that he tried to interpret all laws in accordance with Islamic rules, reasoning from the verses of the Holy Quran, Hadiths, decisions of the Caliphs, and the opinions of the jurists.\n\n\"If one believes that there has been a mistake in a judicial decision in the interpretation of an Islamic principle or a constitutional or legal provision, then it is the responsibility of the learned people to correct it. There are constitutional and legal avenues for [this purpose]. The chief justice and the Supreme Court have not stopped anyone before from a review, nor will they stop it now.\"\n\nThe statement also condemned \u201corganised campaign\u201d against the judiciary, asserting that criticism should carried out while pursuing legal avenues. It warned against violating the right to freedom of expression, emphasising the judiciary's role in protecting the rights of the people in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.\n\nThe controversy surrounding CJP Isa's observations escalated as several political parties in the country, including the PTI, JUI-F, and Jamaat-e-Islami joined the campaign.\n\nThese parties have actively called for CJP Isa to reconsider his verdict in the specific case, adding a political dimension to the already charged discourse on the matters of faith.\n\nMeanwhile, the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) strongly condemned the \u201cmalicious and slanderous campaign\u201d against the CJP.\n\n\u201cThe campaign designed to bring the Supreme Court into disrepute and make the Chief Justice of Pakistan vulnerable is based on deliberating attempting to distort a decision of the Supreme Court,\u201d the PBC said in a statement.\n\nMoreover, the law enforcement agencies apprehended Abdul Wasay, a resident of Rawalpindi\u2019s Pandora area, for launching a threatening campaign on the social media against CJP Isa.\n\nWasay, participating in a vile and threatening campaign against the chief justice on social media platform X, was involved in the top judge\u2019s character assassination as well.\n\nThe arrest of Wasay signalled the government's commitment to curbing illegal activities on the social media.\n\n"

            "Text": "In a statement recorded before an Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) committee, former Rawalpindi commissioner Liaquat Ali Chatha on Thursday expressed his regret over his earlier \u2018misleading\u2019 allegation that the recent elections were rigged, adding that he had made the claim at the behest of a political party, without explicitly naming the PTI.\n\nThe former Rawalpindi commissioner, who had resigned from his post last week while making serious allegations of election rigging, also issued a public apology.\n\nECP sources said Chatha appeared before the ECP investigation committee and recorded his statement in response to a notice sent to him by the body a day earlier.\n\nSources revealed that all the district returning officers (DROs) and returning officers (ROs) of Rawalpindi Division had categorically rejected the accusations of rigging in the elections levelled by the former commissioner. The inquiry committee collected written statements from all six DROs of Rawalpindi Division.\n\nDuring his fiery news conference last week, Chatha had raised serious concerns about election rigging. However, in his statement before the ECP committee, he attributed his actions to political pressure from the PTI leadership, without naming the party.\n\nHe admitted to orchestrating a news conference filled with drama and emotional rhetoric, including phrases related to suicide and hanging, under the guidance of the political party.\n\nChatha disclosed that at the time of the news conference, he was retiring on March 9 and concerned about his future as well as benefits, adding that after the 2018 elections, he had held many important positions in the Punjab government.\n\nHe revealed that during term as the Punjab secretary, he developed a close relationship with a senior official of a certain political party for future benefits.\n\nThis party official absconded because of his involvement in last year\u2019s May 9 violence. However, Chatha said he kept in touch with the party official and secretly helped him.\n\nThe former commissioner said on February 11, he secretly went to Lahore and met the party official, who asked him to work on a plan to prove that this year\u2019s general elections were rigged and in return promised him a higher position in the future.\n\nAt first, Chatha suggested that he should resign alleging that the elections were rigged.\n\nHowever, in view of the apprehension that it would not have much effect, an emotional and drama-filled news conference was decided.\n\nAccording to the political leader, the whole plan was organised under the full support and guidance of the top leadership of his party.\n\nChatha disclosed that the day of the news conference was scheduled on February 17 as per a deliberate plan, linking it with a protest staged by the political party.\n\nHe added that the name of Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa was deliberately included in the plan and the aim was to incite public hatred towards him.\n\nThe ex-Rawalpindi commissioner in his statement maintained that nobody, including the ECP, had instructed him to manipulate the election results.\n\nMore importantly, he continued that no RO was involved in any rigging process, refuting his earlier allegations.\n\u201cI am very ashamed of what I have done and seek forgiveness from the entire nation, especially all government employees because I have seriously damaged their reputation with false allegations,\u201d he added.\n\nIn a related development, the interim Punjab government has decided to prosecute the former Rawalpindi commissioner over charges of conspiracy against the state, punishable by one to 10 years in prison.\n\nAccording to the details, the additional IG legal has written a letter to the Punjab Home Department for taking strict action against Chatha under extraordinary provisions.\n\nSources said the additional IG legal has recommended taking action against Chatha under Section 153 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) for inciting hatred and dividing the society.\n\nIn addition, the official has also recommended framing charges against the former commissioner under Section 505 of the PPC for misusing his office, Section 178 of the Elections Act for interference in the voting process, and Section 186 of the PPC for taking action against government employees.\n\n"

He warned that degrading the relationship between the state and the people, would not benefit the country in anyway.\n\u201cThe Constitution entrusts the ownership of authority to the people, who exercise this authority through their elected representatives. By degrading this sacred relationship between the state and the people, it is futile to expect any good for us as a state,\u201d he said.\n\u201cHistory is witness whenever there was an attempt to run the state without the Constitution and democracy, the country was engulfed in crises. The situation we are in as a state today requires us to be very serious and smart,\u201d he added.\nKhan said that PTI founder Imran Khan was unjustly imprisoned in false, fabricated and fake cases, the PTI\u2019s electoral symbol of \u2018bat\u2019 was taken away, it was not allowed to run election campaign and every possible effort was made to throw it out of the election race by flouting the Constitution and the law.\nIn spite of all tactics, Khan continued, a clear and decisive public mandate was entrusted in the PTI. He warned that the move to forcibly change the election majority into a minority through manipulation of the results was a recipe for disaster.\n"

            "Text": "Founding chairman of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Imran Khan on Thursday announced from jail that he would write a letter to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), demanding it to halt the next loan to Pakistan unless there is a thorough probe into the alleged election rigging.\n\nNotwithstanding its public posturing against the intervention of foreign institutions and powers into the country\u2019s internal affairs, the former premier conveyed through his party\u2019s lawyers that he would write the letter to the IMF on Feb 22 and urge it to link the talks and loan with audit of poll rigging.\n\nShockingly, Imran\u2019s statement has come at a time when the country is embroiled in severe economic crisis and the upcoming government is already eying at a new IMF programme. The experts believe that writing such a letter was a terrible idea as it will not have any value but would lead to burning political capital and creating more rifts between PTI and powerful stakeholders.\n\n\u201cThe whole world saw that the peoples vote was stolen in Pakistan,\u201d Zafar said after meeting with Imran in jail, emphasizing that \u201cdemocracy cannot run on the mandate of theft\u201d. He elucidated, \u201cwhen lending institutions see that there is no democracy, they do not give loans.\u201d\n\nIn his media talk, Zafar, accompanied by incumbent PTI chairman Barrister Gohar, said that \u201cour letter will be addressed to the IMF, and if the IMF desires discussion, an audit of election rigging must precede any dialogue.\u201d He stressed, \u201cwhere rigging is proven, rectification must occur before the IMF engagement.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur agreement with the IMF is contingent upon an audit against rigging,\u201d he reiterated. In response to a question if he asked Imran to reconsider writing the letter to IMF as such a move could enhance economic crises, Zafar said that he instead agrees with the move, saying linking loan with audit was \u201ca necessary condition\u201d.\n\n\u201cImran Khan reportedly plans to write a letter to the IMF demanding it not fund Pakistan due to election rigging. Such a letter would be disregarded and have no value, but what a terrible idea. Pakistan badly needs a new loan. Not getting one could be catastrophic for the economy.\u201d Michael Kugelman, the director of the South Asia Institute at the Washington DC-based Wilson Centre, stated on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nRenowned political expert, Zaigham Khan said that Imran Khan has taken a dangerous decision by deciding to write the letter to IMF. It seems, the experts noted, PTI lawyers didn\u2019t do their homework either before advising Imran.\n\nReferring to IMF\u2019s Articles of Agreement, which is commonly known as IMF charter, Zaigham said that there isn\u2019t any clause pertaining to politics or good governance in the 123 pages of the charter, saying there no condition that a country could become IMF\u2019s member if there was democracy in it.\n\n\u201cHaving democracy in the country is not a condition in the IMF charter,\u201d Zaigham said, saying that is why 190 members of IMF include countries where there is democracy or dictator is ruling as well as the countries whose elections are tainted.\n\n\u201cThe IMF\u2019s new program is a matter of life and death for Pakistan,\u201d he said, saying it is the only thing that can stop Pakistan from default at the moment. Without IMF program, he said, neither friendly countries nor any global institutions would provide any financial support to Pakistan. He warned that such a situation could lead to similar situation that Sri Lanka faced a few months ago.\n\nZaigham recalled that PTI was repeating the same mistake that it made when it asked the then PTI finance ministers in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to not show budget surplus to IMF.\n\nIN August 2022, some leaked audio clips of purported telephonic conversations between PTI\u2019s ex-finance Shaukat Tarin and Punjab finance minister Mohsin Leghari and K-P\u2019s Taimur Jhagra surfaced where Tarin could be heard telling them to tell the then PML-N-led federal government that provinces could not post a budget surplus \u2014 an IMF demand \u2014 in the light of devastating floods.\n\n"

            "Text": "Castigating the military establishment for what he termed the \"most rigged elections\" in Pakistan\u2019s history, Maulana Fazlur Rehman has declared that his party will not \"lick boots\" just to secure membership in a nominal parliament. Fazl\u2019s party, the JUI-F, has, in the meanwhile, also announced a nationwide movement against alleged rigging in February 8 general elections.\n\nAddressing his party members and supporters after a meeting in Islamabad on Thursday, Fazl said he expected that the February 8 elections would be free and fair.\n\nHowever, he lamented, those hopes and the country\u2019s Constitution got trampled on\u2014on the election day. The JUI-F chief wondered what was the credibility of parliament in the wake of two consecutive controversial elections.\n\n\"If the establishment directly intervenes and chooses representatives from each constituency according to its own will, then they won't be representatives of the people. What kind of parliament would that be?\u201d he said, adding that the candidacy of every lawmaker in such a parliament will become dubious.\n\nHe predicted that in the coalition government that is likely to be formed in the center, the two major parties\u2014the PML-N and the PPP\u2014will keep blackmailing each other while \u201csomeone else\u201d will be pulling the strings behind the scenes.\nThe JUI-F chief said they are the flag-bearers of democracy and their elders are the founders of this Constitution. He said they want to safeguard the Constitution. However, he lamented that the Constitution has no significance now; it is just a piece of paper which holds no value.\n\nHe said even the parliament is not supreme as sovereignty rests with God. \u201cBut in Pakistan, we don\u2019t even witness supremacy of parliament \u201cas here our servants are our sovereigns.\u201d\n\nHe claimed that in the February 8 elections, the establishment broke all records of rigging in the 75-year history of the country. Addressing the military leaders, he said: \"Uniforms do not confer respect on a person; rather, it is the character within a uniform which inspires respect.\"\n\nFazl questioned the utility of joining a parliament which could not pass a legislation on its own and which only stamps its seal of approval on pieces of legislation imposed on it by the establishment.\n\nHe also questioned why his party should now continue electoral politics. \u201cIn the parliament, my power will depend on someone else but on the street, I will not need anyone else,\u201d he said.\n\nThe JUI-F chief said militancy in the country is one the rise but the establishment is engaged in \u201cother games\u201d. He said the establishment considered itself beyond criticism and gets offended when people point the finger at it.\n\n\u201cThey say we are defense forces and it is not justified to criticize us. I clarify that I do not criticize the country\u2019s defense forces as long as they remain defense forces. But when they become political forces they become liable to be criticized.\u201d\nFazl also criticized the mainstream political parties for their dual standards with regard to rigging.\n\nHe said the PML-N won almost a similar number of seats in both 2018 elections and 2024 elections. \u201cin 2018, it had claimed that the elections were rigged but now [when it is able to lead a government] it says the elections are fair.\u201d\nHe said the same was the case with the PTI as it also got almost the same number of seats in the 2018 and 2014 elections. \u201cHowever, now that the PTI is not able to form a government, it says the polls were unfair.\u201d\n\nFazl said only the JUI-F is the party which protested against rigging in 2018 polls and which also called these elections massively rigged.\n\nSeparately, the JU-F announced launching a movement against alleged rigging during the February 8 general elections.\u00a0 JUI-F leader Aslam Ghauri, in a statement, said in the initial phase of the movement, meetings will be held at party level.\nAccording to Ghauri, Maulana Fazlur Rehman will address these meetings and the first of such assemblies is set to take place on Thursday (today) in Islamabad. \"Rigging in these elections has put 2018's rigging to shame,\" he said. \"A mockery has been made of the public mandate\".\n\nPreviously on February 16, the JUI-F Sindh staged a protest demonstration outside the provincial office of the Election Commission of Pakistan in Karachi against alleged electoral fraud.\n\n"

            "Text": "The Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), guided by the principles outlined by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (UNFAO), has embarked on a monumental task \u2013 the organization of the 7th Agricultural Census in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) and its newly merged districts. This endeavor represents a significant step forward in integrating digital technology to streamline data collection processes across the agricultural, livestock, and agro-machinery sectors. Despite financial constraints, a substantial budget of Rs650 million has been allocated to ensure the success of this vital initiative, underscoring the government\u2019s commitment to evidence-based policymaking in the agricultural domain.\nAt a special meeting convened at the Benevolent Fund Building in Peshawar, chaired by senior PBS member Muhammad Sarwar Gondal, the strategic importance of the agricultural census was underscored. It was emphasized that this comprehensive effort would not only provide crucial insights for policymakers but also serve as a benchmark for addressing the food and fiber needs of Pakistan\u2019s burgeoning population, which currently stands at over 241 million.\nOne of the cornerstones of the census strategy is the adoption of a process re-engineering approach, drawing inspiration from the successful execution of the Covid census in 2019. This approach involves the development of large-scale agri holdings (NCH) and the implementation of innovative methodologies to ensure the accuracy and efficiency of data collection processes. \nMoreover, to facilitate seamless operations, 157 agricultural census support centers have been established in collaboration with provincial stakeholders, including the Board of Revenue, Agriculture Extension, Livestock, and the K-P Bureau of Statistics.\nRead:\u00a0PBS hailed for successful execution of census\nRecognizing the importance of widespread participation and awareness, extensive outreach efforts have been planned through various media channels, including print, electronic, and social media platforms. These efforts are aimed at engaging all segments of society and encouraging active involvement in this national endeavor.\nMuhammad Sarwar Gondal, in his address, reiterated the significance of the census in informing evidence-based policy formulation. \nHe emphasized the need for collaboration and cooperation from provincial stakeholders to ensure the successful execution of the census. Engagements with partner organizations and stakeholders are already underway to garner diverse perspectives and address potential challenges in data collection. \nA comprehensive methodology and field operation plan have been developed, incorporating newly developed sampling designs vetted by FAO. The integration of digital technologies, such as tablet-based data collection and SMS gateways, will not only enhance the efficiency of data gathering but also ensure the accuracy and reliability of the collected information.\nTo support field operations, various working groups have been constituted to manage complaints and provide necessary information. Additionally, divisional and district census coordinators have been deployed to provide technical guidance and operational management at the grassroots level. To facilitate training, 157 venues equipped with multimedia facilities have been identified to ensure standardized training for field personnel.\nThe 7th Agricultural Census represents a critical milestone in Pakistan\u2019s efforts to modernize its agricultural sector and inform evidence-based policymaking. The commitment of the PBS, in collaboration with provincial stakeholders, underscores the government\u2019s dedication to addressing the evolving needs of the agricultural sector. Through effective utilization of resources and widespread engagement, the census aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Pakistan\u2019s agricultural landscape, laying the foundation for informed policy interventions and sustainable development.\n"

            "Text": "The caretaker government of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa has issued directives to halt the Board of Governors (BoGs) of all Medical Teaching Institute (MTI) Hospitals from making significant decisions, including new appointments. \nA letter from the advisor to the chief minister emphasized that BoGs must seek prior approval from the Health Department for major decisions.\nThis move echoes a previous directive issued on May 24 last year, which imposed a ban on all new recruitments by the BoGs of MTI hospitals.\nThe backdrop to these decisions is the suspension of claims payment to public sector hospitals under the Sehat Card program by the State Life Insurance Company. \nThis suspension has had a profound impact on the revenue of public hospitals, including MTI hospitals in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. As a result, these hospitals have been facing financial constraints, struggling to procure essential medicines and provide free treatment to patients, particularly those covered under the Sehat Card program.\nThe insurance company\u2019s stance underscores the gravity of the situation, as they insisted on the release of funds by the provincial government to settle outstanding dues, which, back then, amounted to approximately Rs30 billion. The company had specifically requested Rs10 billion from the provincial government to clear these dues. Failure to address this issue could lead to dire consequences, including the inability to pay healthcare providers and difficulties in securing vital supplies.\nThese financial challenges have had a cascading effect on consultants and healthcare providers, impacting their ability to deliver essential care to patients. For instance, Hayatabad Medical Complex (HMC) was awaiting Rs900 million in claims, but payments had been halted by the insurance company. This financial strain had significantly hampered the capacity of healthcare facilities in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa to ensure the provision of quality healthcare services to the public, posing serious challenges to the healthcare system.\n"

            "Text": "The Islamabad High Court (IHC) Wednesday rejected Islamabad Deputy Commissioner (DC) Irfan Nawaz Memon\u2019s request to withdraw a show cause notice issued in a contempt of court case.\nMoreover, the court instructed him not to proceed to an Umrah in Saudi Arabia with his family until the matter was resolved.\nDuring the proceedings, the Islamabad DC maintained that he could not fathom being held in contempt of court and humbly placed himself at the mercy of the court. The court, presided over by Justice Babar Sattar, expressed dissatisfaction with Memon's absence during the previous hearing, issuing a show cause notice and setting a response deadline.\nJustice Sattar emphasised the gravity of the situation, questioning Memon's awareness of the court order and chastising him for causing a delay in concluding the case. The court noted that the 69 Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) orders issued by Memon over 970 days raised concerns about potential overreach.\nIn response, Memon offered an unconditional apology, acknowledging the missed hearing and expressing remorse. Justice Sattar, however, highlighted that MPO orders continued to be issued even after the show cause notice, prompting the court to intervene and curtail the power to issue such orders.\nRead:\u00a0IHC rejects DC Islamabad's unconditional apology in 3-MPO case\nThe legal counsel for the Islamabad DC Raja Rizwan Abbasi argued that the case did not meet the criteria for contempt of court under section 6. Abbasi emphasised the intelligence reports on which the MPO orders were based, stating that the district magistrate acted as the eyes and ears of the administration.\nHe contended that the issuance of MPO orders was a preventive measure based on genuine concerns about potential threats to public order.\nAbbasi further presented the District Intelligence Committee's role, which included representatives from intelligence agencies, police, and military units, suggesting that the MPO orders were a response to their input. He argued that the non-appearance of DC Islamabad should not be considered an obstacle to justice and called for the dismissal of the contempt of court case.\nThe court also ordered the submission of the composition and Terms of Reference (TORs) of the District Intelligence Committee for examination. The hearing was adjourned until March 1, with the decision expected to be pronounced at the next session. As the legal proceedings unfold, the fate of DC Islamabad and the implications of the contempt of court case remain uncertain.\nOn Tuesday, the IHC issued an arrest warrant for Islamabad DC Irfan Nawaz Memon over his non-appearance in the contempt of court case. The court ordered to place the DC's name in the Exit Control List (ECL), as well as the order to arrest him and produce him before the court.\nJustice Babar Sattar heard the contempt of court case against the Islamabad DC and SSP operations on violation of court order.\nSenior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Malik Jameel Zafar and Superintendent of Police (SP) Farooq Buttar appeared before the court. However, Deputy Commissioner Irfan Nawaz Memon did not appear before the court and submitted a plea for exemption from the court. Prosecutor Qaiser Imam also appeared before the court.\nThe matter regarding the power to issue MPO reached the court after the multiple MPO-based detentions of several PTI leaders under the crackdown against the former ruling party.\nThe IHC on September 7 restrained the Islamabad DC from exercising section 3-MPO powers until further notice.\n"

            "Text": "Stirring the political pot on the contentious Feb 8 general elections, PTI founder Imran Khan on Friday confirmed that he had penned a letter to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), urging the global lender to give the poll results a thorough once-over before cutting any new cheques for Islamabad.\nSpeaking to the media after attending a hearing on the \u00a3190 million reference at the Adiala Jail, Imran raised alarms about the potential consequences of obtaining a loan under the current circumstances.\n\"If the country gets a loan in such a situation, then who will return it?\" he questioned, expressing concerns that such a loan could lead to increase in poverty.\nThe former prime minister warned that without substantial investment in the country, the burden of loans would continue to rise, underscoring the need for political stability.\nHe alleged that the institutions were compromised to ensure the selection of PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif, causing harm to various organisations, including the National Accountability Bureau (NAB).\nAccusing the election process of being rigged in favour of Nawaz, Imran claimed that he had been unfairly subjected to allegations.\nHe pointed to the Rawalpindi commissioner, who had initially revealed poll rigging but later retracted, alleging that the former official was \"picked up and tortured\".\nImran added, \"A Vigo came and picked him up. Now his software has been updated.\"\nImran\u2019s announcement about the letter follows a statement by PTI Senator Ali Zafar the previous day, revealing the party founder's decision to write to the IMF, urging an audit of the Feb 8 elections before proceeding with talks for a new loan programme with Islamabad.\nDespite Imran's efforts, it remains uncertain whether the letter will yield the desired results, as the IMF, on Friday, expressed willingness to work with the new Pakistani government while ignoring his demand.\nRead Gohar warns of IMF programme risk sans Form-45-verified poll results\nEarlier in the day, shortly before Imran\u2019s statement, Zafar clarified that the country should continue to engage with the IMF.\nSenator Zafar said that the engagement with the IMF should continue to \"ensure financial discipline, good governance, and economic stability which is critical for the prosperity of the people of Pakistan\".\nHe said that Pakistan will always remained a top priority for the party.\nZafar stated that the PTI will endorse all the initiatives aligning with the \"benefit of the country and national interest\".\nFurther, the party leader maintained that the PTI remained steadfast in its \"struggle for democracy\" and \"will continue to raise its voice at all forums and expect the international community\u2019s support\".\nZafar, speaking to the media outside the Adiala jail later in the day, said the PTI founder maintained that the IMF programme should continue for the country.\nHe quoted Imran as saying that the party supremo said that the need was to better the economy.\n\"The PTI founder has said that there is a need for political and economic stability and we will raise our voice for democracy on every forum possible,\" Zafar said quoting Imran.\n\u2018National security jeopardised\u2019\nHowever, the party has faced backlash over the letter\u2019s timing as the country is embroiled in a severe economic crisis, and the upcoming government is already eying a new IMF programme.\nExperts believed that writing such a letter was a terrible idea as it would not have any value but would lead to burning political capital and creating more rifts between the PTI and the powerful stakeholders.\nPakistan Muslim League-Nawaz leader Ishaq Dar alleged that Imran had jeopardised national security by penning a letter to the IMF for personal gain.\nThe former finance minister dismissed the importance of the letter, stating that it carried no weight.\nHe said that if the PTI founder had penned anything contrary to the national interest of the country, it was worthy of condemnation.\nIn his media statement outside the Punjab Assembly, Dar expressed his views, asserting that crafting content for personal gain was disgraceful and that the letter from the PTI founder held no significance.\nMeanwhile, in defence of the decision, PTI leader Barrister Gohar Khan stated that letters to the IMF were not unprecedented, having been sent before and will be written again today.\nHe clarified that the current letter would not pose any threat to the country's economy, security, or democracy.\nAddressing the media outside the Adiala Jail, Gohar added that he had a meeting with Imran in jail. The hearing for Al-Qadir Trust case took place, with the charge frame set for Feb 27.\nHe criticised the court proceedings, alleging that the trial was illegal and unconstitutional. Barrister Gohar also claimed that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in the incumbent caretaker set-up failed in conducting fair elections.\nExpressing dissatisfaction with the media's restricted access to the court proceedings, he emphasised that the PTI's stance was against the alleged incorrectness of Form-47, insisting that Form-45 was accurate.\n"

The Supreme Court upheld the LHC verdict with a majority vote of 4 to 3 on February 6, 1979. The PPP founder was executed on April 4 of the same year.\n\nReferring to the LHC verdict, the statement referred to the \u201cunchallenged revelations\u201d made by former CJ Justice Nasim Hasan Shah\u2014who was among the judges who voted in favor of the LHC order\u2014who admitted that the LHC chief justice then had a personal enmity against ZAB.\n\n\u201cIt is plainly evident that the decision of the LHC was led by a chief justice whose hatred for Mr Bhutto was recognized by no less than Dr Justice Nasim Hasan Shah himself and the Supreme Court Judgment in the Bhutto Trial was a grave miscarriage of justice and thus in violation of basic Constitutional guarantees of a citizen to be dealt in accordance with the law.\u201d\n\nThe statement also stated that there is now no doubt that an elected prime minister of Pakistan was overthrown in a military coup and a farcical judicial trial was orchestrated for no other reason but to murder Bhutto and to perpetuate a dictatorship.\n\n\u201cAfter all, how else can one read the speech of 5.7.77 of General Ziaul Haq who pledged that \u2018I was obliged to step in to fill in the vacuum created by political leaders. I have accepted this challenge as a true soldier of Islam. My sole aim is to organize free and fair elections which will be held in October this year. Soon after the polls, power will be transferred to the elected representatives of the people\u2019\u201d.\n\nThe statement said it is never too late to right a wrong. In fact, it said, we will always be a prisoner to our crimes if we do not correct what we now know as plain miscarriage of justice.\n\n\u201cTherefore, it is humbly prayed that the Presidential Reference on the question as to whether the decision of the LHC as well as the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the murder trial against Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto meets the requirements of fundamental rights as guaranteed under Article 4, sub Articles (1) & (2)(a), Article 8, Article 9, Article 10A due process, Article 14, Article 25 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 must be answered in the negative.\u201d\n\nIt said Ahmed Reza Kasuri was a founder member of the PPP and was elected as an MNA on a PPP ticket in 1970. He, however, soon developed differences with Bhutto and joined the Tehreek-e-Istiqlal party.\n\n\u201cOn 11.11.1974, Mr Ahmed Reza Kasuri lodged FIR No. 402/1974 within hours of the murderous attack which led to the unfortunate death of his father late Nawab Ahmed Khan.\n\n\u201cIn the FIR, he expressed his suspicion that because he had remained the most virulent critic of the person and policies of ZAB the attack had been made on him due to political reasons.\n\n\u201cYet, in less than two years of lodging the FIR, in April 1976, Mr Ahmed Reza Kasuri rejoined the PPP.\n\n\u201cHe continued to remain a member of and attended the meetings of Tehrik-i-Fikr-i-Quaid-e-Awam, an organization meant for propagating the political philosophy of Bhutto until April 1977. Mr Ahmed Reza Kasuri even applied for the PPP ticket to contest the general elections of 1977 but was denied.\n\n\u00a0\u201cThe same Mr Ahmed Reza Kasuri who waxed eloquence on the person of Bhutto until a few months earlier, became the lead prosecution witness against Mr Bhutto as soon as General Ziaul Haq proclaimed Martial Law on 5.7.1977 and trial was entrusted in the hands of [LHC] Chief Justice Mushtaq Hussain.\u201d\n\nThe statement said Article 189 establishes that any decision of the SC achieves finality.\n\nHowever, the reference under Article 186, requires the SC to render an opinion after analyzing and evaluating the apex court\u2019s and the LHC judgments in the ZAB case on the touchstone of fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution.\n\n\u201cThe answering of questions in this reference will not affect the decision or the ratio decided in these judgments, but a plenary opinion thereon is a debt to our constitutional history which must be repaid\u201d\n\nFormer attorney general for Pakistan (AGP) Khalid Jawed Khan who is an amicus in this case said in view of the jurisdiction conferred on the SC under Article 186, the conviction and sentence passed against Bhutto may not be quashed, annulled or set aside.\n\nThe Supreme Court, however, may address the question of law and give opinion that in the light of the facts and prevailing circumstances and the personal enmity of the military dictator, the trial, conviction and sentence of Bhutto does not meet the constitutional requirements and due process of law.\n\nHe said the issue of wrongful convictions and miscarriage of justice has been addressed in many countries through enactment of specific legislation.\n\n"

            "Text": "Senate Standing Committee on Interior on Thursday unanimously passed a bill to amend the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 and the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 [The Criminal Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024].\nDuring the session, significant bills were discussed, reflecting the committee's commitment to legislative excellence and public welfare.\nFirstly, the committee unanimously passed the Criminal Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024, with a notable emphasis on safeguarding the dignity of the deceased.\nThe bill also proposed an increase in fines to Rs500,000, signaling a stern stance against violations of human rights in the country. This unanimous decision underscores the committee\u2019s dedication to upholding the sanctity of the law.\nIn a subsequent development, Senator Samina Mumtaz Zehri withdrew the Prevention and Control of Human Trafficking (Amendment) Bill, 2024. This decision came as the relevant Ordinance, which the amendment sought to address, had already been repealed in 2018.\nAnother significant legislative action was the passage of Senator Shahadat Awan's Criminal Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024. This bill introduced crucial amendments to sections 292, 293, and 294 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), along with subsequent amendments in the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). Despite concerns raised about potential misuse of proposed sentence enhancements, the bill was passed with necessary amendments, highlighting the committee's diligence in refining legislative proposals for optimal effectiveness.\nHowever, the committee deferred deliberations on the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Bill, 2024, which Senator Shahadat Awan had introduced. This bill focused on Sections 513 and 514 of the CrPC, indicating the committee's judicious approach to prioritizing legislative matters based on their urgency and significance.Additionally, the National Database and Registration Authority (Amendment) Bill, 2023, introduced by Senator Fawzia Arshad, underwent thorough scrutiny. The committee passed this bill with amendments, showcasing its commitment to enhancing administrative procedures and ensuring the efficacy of regulatory frameworks.\nBeyond legislative matters, the committee addressed pressing issues raised by Senator Danesh Kumar. Concerns about commuter difficulties at check posts along the Balochistan-Karachi route and the demolition of a Hindu Temple in Mithi District, Tharparkar, were thoroughly discussed.\nThe committee recommended the establishment of a joint check post to streamline security procedures and ensure a seamless experience for commuters. Furthermore, it advocated for fair treatment of encroachers, stressing equitable enforcement of the law irrespective of social or religious affiliations.\nThe Senate Standing Committee on Interior operates with a sense of duty and responsibility towards the nation.\n"

Sindh, at heart of the Indus River basin, was the worst-affected province, accounting for nearly 70% of total losses and damage.\nTo support the government\u2019s relief and recovery efforts after the floods, WFP leveraged its expertise in logistics, food and cash assistance, and resilience-building to respond to the immediate needs and to support recovery and rehabilitation of flood-affected people.\nDuring the flood response period, which ended in December, the WFP supported those hit the hardest by the floods. Besides, many households not only used the cash for their immediate needs, but also to rebuild their businesses and other livelihoods that were interrupted or destroyed by the deluge.\nThe statement said that the WFP supported more than 180,000 flood-affected people in seven districts of Sindh in 2023 through its multipurpose cash interventions funded from the \u20ac3 million contribution provided by the European Union\u2019s Humanitarian Aid Operations department.\nEU Humanitarian Aid head in Pakistan Tahini Thammannagoda said that assistance enabled the flood-affected families to secure food, healthcare, education, and shelter in Jamshoro, Matiari, Mirpurkhas, Nousheroferoz, Sanghar, Shaheed Benazirabad, and Umerkot districts.\n\u201cOver one and half years later, many people still struggle to cope with the losses caused by the devastating 2022 floods. Together with partners like WFP, the EU supported the most vulnerable people with emergency assistance at a critical time,\u201d Thammannagoda added in the statement.\n"

Tehran had granted this extension in a bid to avoid litigation in an international court.\n\nPakistan has decided to proceed with the construction of the IP gas pipeline within its borders to satisfy Tehran, despite the sanctions imposed by the US.\n\nIran claims to have already spent $2 billion to complete its part of the pipeline within its territory. In contrast, Pakistan has not even commenced construction.\n\nPreviously, constructing the 80- kilometre portion of the IP pipeline project was part of the LNG Gwadar Pipeline project, intended to connect the port with other parts of the country.\n\nIt was agreed that Pakistan could construct this portion if relations between Tehran and Washington normalised and Islamabad was granted a waiver.\n\n"

            "Text": "The Supreme Court (SC) Thursday ordered the Capital Development Authority (CDA) to return all three offices of the Islamabad Wildlife Board (IWMB) to the wildlife protection agency, declaring the sealing of the facilities inappropriate.\nThe dispute between the civic body and the federal capital\u2019s sole wildlife protection agency arose when CDA tried to forcibly seal IWMB\u2019s Public Information Centres within the jurisdiction of the Margalla Hills National Park (MHNP) sans prior notice.\nFollowing the brief tug-of-war, the IWMB moved the apex court, prompting a hearing by a three-member bench headed by Chief Justice Qazi Faiz Isa.\nThe court ordered CDA to return all three wildlife offices including those on Trail 5, and Trail 6.\nMoreover, the court asked for all the details, including photographs, of the CDA Rest House in Daman-e-Koh. The court observed that the CDA Rest House established in Daman-e-Koh should be for public use instead of the CDA chairman and officers. The court sought complete details of all the lands acquired by the CDA in the national park area.\nRead:\u00a0CDA seals IWMB information centres\nThe court issued notices to the attorney general and advocate general regarding the dispute over a private restaurant on military grassland.\nDeclaring the seizure of office items by CDA, the court also ordered the agency to return the equipment collected from the offices of the wildlife board.\n\u201cThere is a risk of fires in the national park. The wildlife board should re-install its equipment to deal with the threats,\u201d ruled the court.\nAt the onset of the hearing, the court was told that CDA vacated the sites without any notice. The conduct exhibited by the CDA was inappropriate.\nDuring the hearing, CDA's lawyer said that CDA should be allowed to share those buildings. The chief justice remarked that a thing has been invented and it is called a car. \u201cWhen needed, you can drive from the CDA office to Margalla Hills,\u201d Justice Isa observed.\nCounsel for CDA said the civic body has a rest house in the national park. The court declared that the rest house of CDA should be used for public purposes. An order was given to provide photographs of the rest house. The court declared that the details of all the properties owned by CDA in Margalla Hills should also be provided.\nCJP Qazi Faez Isa said Prophet Muhammad (may God bless him) has been called Rahmatulil Alameen (a blessing for all the universe). What does this mean? CDA counsel replied that it means he is a blessing to all the world.\nThe chief justice said that on the night of Miraj (ascension), all the prophets prayed behind the prophet Muhammed, why was this honour not given to any other prophet? It meant that after him, peace and blessings be upon him, we have to take guidance from the prophet. Allah gave the title Habibullah to our beloved prophet.\nJustice Isa further said now come to our Constitution. What is written in the very beginning?\nThe CDA lawyer said it is written in the beginning of the Constitution that the sovereignty belongs to Allah. The chief justice said MHNP also falls under its ambit.\nLater during the hearing, Umar Ejaz Gilani Advocate referred to a decision of CJP Qazi Faez Isa. He said we did not come here against CDA. We want the two organisations to work amicably together. We want none of the two blocks the other's way. The court adjourned further hearing till March 11.\n"

Precautionary steps such as placing a ban on swimming in the canals and distributaries passing through Sehwan under section 144, alongside heightened vigilance by the health department, were emphasised. \nRead:\u00a0Gold worth Rs12.5m stolen from Lal Qalandar\u2019s shrine\nNotably, the Pakistan Navy\u2019s assistance will be sought for potential rescue operations in case of drowning incidents.\nFurthermore, arrangements for free drinking water will be made, while heavy transport vehicles will be restricted from accessing the stretch of the Indus Highway between Jamshoro and Dadu, given the anticipated surge in public transport vehicles. \nHyderabad Electric Supply Company (HESCO) has been urged to minimise load shedding and ensure uninterrupted power supply during the event.\nOfficial proceedings during the Urs celebrations will encompass various activities including sports events, cattle shows, exhibitions, conferences, and an award ceremony.\nThe significance of security measures was underscored by the tragic incident on February 16, 2017, when a suicide bomber detonated explosives inside the shrine, claiming over 90 lives, including women and children. Since then, the government has prioritised the shrine\u2019s security, enhancing deployment, monitoring, and intelligence support to prevent such incidents.\n"

            "Text": "With the caretaker Chief Minister of Punjab set to call a farewell meeting of the provincial cabinet in the coming week, Punjab will finally have an elected government in place after more than a year - and it is expected that the Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) will be in the driving seat.\nThe PML-N\u2019s candidate for the province\u2019s top job is the party\u2019s Senior Vice President, Maryam Nawaz Sharif, who if gets the requisite votes for the Chief Ministerial slot will be the province\u2019s first ever female Chief Minister. However, it is pertinent to mention that Maryam has never held public office before and has been elected to the Punjab Assembly, and National Assembly, for the first time in her political career. Be that as it may, a breakdown of the elected Members of the Punjab \nAssembly shows that the PML-N has 138, and 16 independents have joined the ranks of the party since the election, which puts the party\u2019s total representation in the provincial legislature at 154. These numbers will translate into the PML-N getting 34 of the 66 reserved seats up for grabs. It is also expected that the PML-N will get the support of 10 Members of the Punjab Assembly of the Pakistan People\u2019s Party, 8 members of the Pakistan Muslim League Quaid (PML-Q) and 5 members of the Istehkam-e-Pakistan Party (IPP). \nRead:\u00a0Maryam vows \u2018new era\u2019 in Punjab\nAny party vying for the top job of the province needs the support of 186 members, which the PML-N currently, and by extension its Chief Minister candidate, seems to enjoy. \nNevertheless, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) backed independent candidates, who will form a more than 100 member strong opposition in the Punjab Assembly will prove to be a thorn in the side of the Chief Minister office hopeful. \nIn that context, the biggest challenge that the Sharif family\u2019s apparent successor faces, if she is chosen as the Chief Minister in the Punjab Assembly, would be to rebuild the PML-N\u2019s popularity in the province. While Maryam and political leaders considered close to her have refrained from making any policy statements before the provincial government is formed, The Express Tribune learnt from various well-placed sources that the Chief Ministerial candidate has held multiple meetings with the province\u2019s top bureaucrats in preparation for her new role. \nThe Express Tribune learnt that the focus of these meetings has been development works in the province and the law and order situation. Commenting on Maryam\u2019s maiden bid for the Chief Minister office given her lack of experience, Professor Dr Rasul Bakhsh Rais, who teaches political science at the Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), said that the Chief Ministerial candidate was in a precarious position due to the accusations of electoral rigging. \n\u201cThe accusations of rigging will follow her into office and will make life tough for the PML-N,\u201d predicted Dr Rais. \u201cIf the opposition was weak it would have been smooth sailing. However, the opposition has a significant number of seats and once they start their series of protests, the provincial government will find it hard to execute its agenda,\u201d added Dr Rais while talking to The Express Tribune.\n"

            "Text": "The caretaker IT minister states that they have laid out a roadmap to achieve a target of $15 billion in IT exports to bolster the country\u2019s economy. Several key measures have been introduced by the caretaker government to reach this export target.\nIn an interview with The Express Tribune, Caretaker IT Minister Dr Umar Saif said, \u201cNow, the roadmap is ready, and we hope that the upcoming government will continue these policies to achieve the export target.\u201d\nKey measures include introducing foreign currency retention accounts, establishing training programmes, and creating co-working spaces and a startup fund to foster innovation. Paypal has entered into a partnership with Payoneer in Pakistan to provide the facility of receiving funds for freelancers.\n\u201cA pilot project has been launched with 10,000 accounts, which will be fully launched in March,\u201d said Saif, adding that Pakistani freelancers will be able to receive funds but will not have the facility to send funds under this initiative.\nAmong the key initiatives disclosed by the caretaker IT minister is the introduction of foreign currency retention accounts tailored specifically for IT enterprises. This move is expected to streamline financial operations for tech companies, thereby fostering an environment conducive to growth and investment.\n\u201cDuring the caretaker government, IT companies have been allowed to retain 50% of funds in their accounts for spending,\u201d he said. \u201cDue to the 50% retention facility, the country has seen a record boost in IT exports during November to December 2023 and January 2024,\u201d said Saif.\nIf exports continue to rise at the current pace, the IT exports of Pakistan will cross $4 billion during the next 12 months.\nThe country has been facing a scarcity of qualified people in the IT sector, he said, adding that the caretaker government has launched a training programme for 200,000 graduates who are expected to bring $5 billion into Pakistan after enhancing their skills.\nAdditionally, the implementation of training programmes aimed at augmenting the IT workforce underscores Pakistan\u2019s commitment to nurturing local talent and meeting the demands of a rapidly evolving industry.\n\u201cWith the establishment of 10,000 e-Rozgar centres, the IT ministry hopes for an inflow of $10 billion into the country,\u201d he said, adding that, \u201cIf one freelancer earns $30 daily, the government hopes one million freelancers will be capable of bringing $10 billion into the country.\u201d\nIn a bid to cultivate innovation and entrepreneurship, the government is also rolling out co-working spaces and instituting a startup fund geared towards providing crucial capital for burgeoning ventures.\n\u201cWe have started a startup fund to mitigate the risks of those startups that wanted to raise money. The government of Pakistan will provide a 30% grant to the startups, and this initiative will raise investment in the country,\u201d explained the IT minister. He said that PC-1 of this scheme had been approved and the government will start receiving applications from March 15, 2024.\nFurthermore, measures to allocate spectrum for 5G networks signify a concerted effort to enhance connectivity and technological infrastructure. Saif highlighted the national fiberisation policy and telecom tribunal as crucial steps in building a robust telecom framework.\n\u201cThese moves aim to enhance domestic connectivity, attract foreign investment, and establish Pakistan as a digital hub,\u201d he said.\n\u201cInternet traffic of China has been connected with Pakistan, which will work as a digital corridor to connect with landlocked Central Asian states, bringing $200 million to $400 million in revenue for Pakistan,\u201d hoped the minister.\nAdditionally, the government\u2019s proactive approach extends to satellite services, with a policy to entice providers like Starlink. Saif said that the government had taken measures to boost exports, attract investment, and strengthen technology by incentivising handset manufacturers and positioning Pakistan as a digital gateway.\n\u201cWith these diverse initiatives, Pakistan is poised to seize digital age opportunities, driving sustainable economic growth and innovation,\u201d he said.\nThe IT ministry has also taken an initiative to enhance exports of handsets. \u201cWe asked the commerce ministry to allow 3%-8% RD allowance for handset manufacturers to enhance exports,\u201d said Saif, adding that, \u201cWe also wanted the approval of handset financing facility.\u201d\nHe added that all initiatives taken by the caretaker government are expected to bring in $15-$20 billion into the IT sector.\n"

            "Text": "Peshawar serves as the gateway to the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, facilitating the import and export of various products. The Torkham border acts as a pathway, enabling the expansion of trade between the two countries on a global scale.\nPakistan and Afghanistan share a border spanning over 2,600 kilometres. Following the implementation of border fencing, illegal movements of goods across the border have been curtailed to some extent.\nThere are 18 trading points along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, with key crossing points being Torkham and Chaman. Torkham, situated in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, and Chaman, located in Balochistan, are connected to Afghanistan\u2019s Jalalabad and Kandahar provinces respectively.\nAccording to a survey conducted by the Pakistan-Afghanistan Joint Chamber of Commerce, trade between the two countries amounted to $2.5 billion in 2010. However, this figure dropped to $1.6 billion before experiencing a slight increase to over $1.8 billion in 2022-23.\nPakistan\u2019s exports to Afghanistan comprise various categories, including cereals (25%), sugar and sugar confectionery (4%), edible vegetables, roots, and tubers (7%), fruits, nuts, and peels of melons and citrus fruits (15%), salt, sulphur, earth-stones (13%), animal or vegetable fats and oils (7%), plastics and articles thereof (5%), pharmaceutical products (13%), wood and articles of wood, wood charcoal (6%), and iron and steel (5%).\nKey potential imports from Afghanistan include figs, grapes, almonds, onions, cumin seeds, apples, beans, cotton, and, notably, rough gemstones.\nIn Peshawar, there are carpets, plastics, and other utensils labelled as Iranian products but manufactured in Pakistan. Additionally, goods such as oil, petrol, and others smuggled from Iran are sold at lower prices in Peshawar and surrounding areas.\nSpeaking to The Express Tribune, Shah Jahan Khan, an exporter in Torkham, highlighted the challenges faced by traders operating between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Despite bilateral trade and Afghanistan importing more goods from Pakistan, frequent border closures result in significant financial losses for businesses in both countries.\nSharing his views with The Express Tribune, Jamsheed Khan emphasised the necessity for joint efforts by Pakistan and Afghanistan to address the difficulties faced by traders. He proposed improved border management and bilateral trade discussions involving top officials to enhance economic conditions in both nations.\nFormer President of the Sarhad Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Zahid Shinwari expressed concerns to The Express Tribune about the decline in Pakistan-Afghanistan trade from $1.5 billion to $5 million. He noted competition from Iran and China, urging authorities to find solutions beneficial to traders in both countries.\nHe suggested that if the USA and Europe, as well as Iran, Saudi Arabia, India, and Nepal, can engage in trade, there\u2019s no reason why Pakistan and Afghanistan cannot do the same.\nPresident of the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Fawad Ishaq, urged the governments to ease trade conditions for merchants, highlighting the cultural and religious similarities between the two nations.\n\nRead\u00a0Businessmen urge opening of more Pak-Afghan borders\nHe mentioned an agreement among China, Pakistan, and the Afghan Taliban administration to extend the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to Afghanistan. However, little progress has been made thus far, highlighting the urgent need to accelerate work on the project.\n\u201cIn our bazaars and shops, Chinese and Iranian products are readily available,\u201d he remarked, pointing to Karhano market where both legally and illegally acquired goods from these countries are sold.\nHe added that recent operations in the border areas of Iran would also impact Pak-Iran trade, underscoring the need for Pakistan to improve trade relations with both Iran and Afghanistan. He called for collaborative efforts to resolve issues arising from the Torkham border closure, which were causing significant economic losses.\nZiaul Haq Sarhadi, Pakistan-Afghanistan Joint Coordinator for Trade, mentioned the decline in bilateral trade to $80-90 million from the previous $2.5 billion. He highlighted the impact of changing governments in both countries on trade dynamics and suggested addressing issues through mutual dialogue.\nHe added that before the political changes, the situation was favourable, but since the merger of tribal districts and the implementation of a policing system, truck drivers at the Torkham border have been demanding bribes at checkpoints, leading to dissatisfaction among them.\nHe noted that the Torkham border had been closed for over ten days, resulting in significant revenue losses, over Rs88 billion, for the governments of both Pakistan and Afghanistan.\nHe proposed a streamlined visa process for border drivers, suggesting that both the Pakistani and Afghan governments issue red passes to facilitate easier movement. He explained that it was a costly and time-consuming exercise to apply for a visa every time a driver has to make a trip to either country. He cited the Geneva Convention, highlighting the need to provide facilities to Afghans at sea ports and advocating for similar treatment at the Torkham border.\n\u201cMost of the market is dominated by Chinese and Iranian products,\u201d Sarhadi remarked, cautioning that if this trend continues, Pakistan may lose Afghanistan as a trading partner.\nHe underscored the importance of collaborative efforts between Pakistan and Afghanistan, especially in light of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and the incoming government in Pakistan, to improve border management and bilateral trade.\nAll stakeholders in conversation with The Express Tribune stressed the importance of cooperative measures, efficient border management, and a conducive trading environment to revitalise the Pakistan-Afghanistan trade relationship and mitigate financial losses.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 23rd, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

            "Text": "Interim Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar has approved new fiscal austerity measures, including a ban on creating new positions and major purchases. However, the impact of these measures may be limited, as the government spends more than its total net income just on interest payments.\nA complete ban on creating new posts under the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) and the current budget for the fiscal year 2023-24 has been approved by the government.\nThe caretaker PM approved the austerity measures almost four months before the end of the current fiscal year 2023-24, which is ending in June. Usually, the policy is approved at the start of the fiscal year, but the interim government approved it a week before the end of its term in office.\nAdditionally, the prime minister has banned the purchase of machinery and equipment from the current budget, except for medical purposes, according to the notification.\nHowever, certain development projects have been initiated in the name of capacity building but are used for meeting the personal needs of bureaucrats and politicians, according to sources. Funds allocated for these projects have been misused for buying food, furniture and other personal items for bureaucrats.\nMoreover, the PM has banned the purchase of all vehicles except for ambulances, buses for educational institutions, solid waste vehicles, tractors, fire-fighting vehicles, and motorbikes, according to the decision.\nSome caretaker cabinet ministers are reportedly using luxury vehicles above their entitlement of 1,800 cc cars, according to sources. They added that one such vehicle was provided by the Customs Department, and millions of rupees were spent by a collectorate of Customs.\nFor the current fiscal year, the National Assembly had approved a Rs14.4 trillion budget and a budget deficit of Rs7.5 trillion. However, this week, the finance ministry upwardly revised the budget deficit target to Rs8.5 trillion, primarily because of an increase in estimates of interest payments. As a result, the size of the budget would grow to Rs15.5 trillion.\nInterest expenses have now been estimated at Rs8.333 trillion, compared to the annual allocation of Rs7.3 trillion.\nDuring the first half of this fiscal year, the government spent Rs4.219 trillion on interest payments, a sum that was Rs219 billion more than the federal government\u2019s net income during this period.\nPast austerity policies have not helped achieve fiscal consolidation, often being relaxed after their approval.\nWhile approving the new austerity policy, the PM also constituted an Austerity Committee to relax these measures.\nThe austerity committee will ensure implementation of the measures while being empowered to relax the policy, as per a notification issued by the Ministry of Finance.\n\nRead\u00a0Rs462b K-P budget seeks to promote strict austerity\nThe finance minister will chair the Austerity Committee, with members including the secretaries of finance, planning, and interior, along with the special secretary of the Cabinet and an additional secretary of finance.\nThis month, PM Kakar approved three-month salaries as a reward for his staff serving in the office and house. Subsequently, the PM decided to restrict the benefits to grades 1 to 16. However, sources suggest that there was pressure on the PM to restore the reward for officers serving in the internal wing of the Prime Minister House.\nPakistan is facing serious fiscal challenges, and cosmetic austerity measures may not be able to address the issue. The country cannot emerge from the fiscal crisis until it restructures public debt and reduces interest rates. Tax reforms are also necessary, as efforts to restructure the FBR ended up in court due to mishandling.\nCabinet ministers have questioned the impact of the restructuring exercise on Pakistan\u2019s low tax-to-GDP ratio. The Ministry of Finance has stated that the government aims to reduce the fiscal deficit by expanding the tax net, rationalising subsidies, and promoting economic growth. However, rising debt servicing costs pose a significant challenge.\nThe ministry, on Thursday, also defended the caretaker government\u2019s borrowing during the past seven months, stating that it focused on fiscal consolidation measures, including revenue mobilisation and expenditure rationalisation.\nThe finance ministry stated that the interim government shifted its domestic borrowing to long-term debt securities to finance the fiscal deficit. However, this move occurred at a time when interest rates were at historic highs in Pakistan, highlighting inadequate debt management, as noted by independent analysts.\nThe ministry further indicated that significant borrowing continued from floating-rate securities among medium to long-term instruments, while fixed-rate instruments were borrowed at an average of 3% to 4% below the policy rate during the interim government\u2019s tenure.\nThe average time to maturity of domestic debt has increased to around three years by the end of January 2024, in line with targets mentioned in the Medium-Term Debt Management Strategy (MTDS) FY23-FY26.\nThe share of external debt in total public debt reduced from 38.3% at end-June 2023 to 36.7% at end-December 2023.\nNo expensive external borrowing was raised from commercial banks and international capital markets during the caretaker government, according to the finance ministry.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 23rd, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

However, this time around, we have to beat our own record,\u201d he added, referring to the development work the former Sindh chief minister had carried out in the province since taking over the office in 2016 when his predecessor Qaim Ali Shah had stepped down.\nHe pointed out that the people of Sindh had not only made the PPP successful in the elections, but also given the party a better mandate than in the past.\nHe went on to acknowledge that with increased expectations from the people, the PPP was committed to addressing the pressing issues faced by the province.\nAlso read: PPP, PML-N meet to fine-tune coalition in Balochistan\nThe PPP chairman noted that that the 2022 floods not only devastated several homes in Sindh, but 50% of educational institutions in the province were swept away as well.\nHe pledged to rebuild those educational institutions in the province.\n\u201cWe understand the hardships faced by our people, especially in the aftermath of the 2022 floods. We are determined to rebuild not only the homes but also the educational institutions that form the backbone of our society,\" Bilawal vowed.\nEarlier, rumours had surfaced that apart from Murad, the other strong contenders for the Sindh\u2019s coveted post of the chief minister were Faryal Talpur \u2013 sister of PPP Co-chairperson and former president Asif Ali Zardari; former provincial information minister Sharjeel Inam Memon; and ex-local government minister Syed Nasir Hussain Shah.\nHowever, sources said Faryal was not interested in the slot.\nThey added that the top PPP leadership was satisfied with Murad\u2019s performance.\nMurad replaced Qaim in July 2016 and remained one of the active chief ministers of Sindh.\nHe continued his second tenure after the general elections in 2018 till 2023, when the interim set-up took over for the polls.\nIn the recent elections, Murad secured victory from PS-77 Jamshoro-I against Roshan Ali of the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA).\nAwais emerged successful from PS-23, Sukkur\u2013II defeating Inayatullah of the GDA.\nAnthony bagged a reserved seat for minorities in the Sindh Assembly.\nThe announcement of key nominations marks a significant step in shaping the leadership of Sindh, and the newly appointed officials are expected to play a crucial role in addressing the challenges faced by the province.\nThe focus on rebuilding educational institutions underscores the party's commitment to restoring the foundations of learning and providing a brighter future for the people of Sindh.\nMeanwhile, Governor Tessori convened a provincial assembly session on Feb 24 at the Sindh Assembly Building during which newly elected members will take oath.\nThe outgoing Sindh Assembly Speaker Agha Siraj Durrani will preside over the session and take oath from the elected MPAs.\nAfter oath-taking of the newly elected members of the provincial legislature, schedule for election of the speaker and deputy speaker will be announced.

            "Text": "The newly elected representatives of the Punjab Assembly on Friday took the oath of office in their maiden session marred by uproar and protests.\nFollowing a bumpy start, the reports of a PTI-backed lawmaker's arrest cast a shadow over the proceedings.\nAs the session kicked off, members of the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) raised concerns about reserved seats in the house.\nThe party lawmakers argued that while seats for other parties had been announced, theirs remained pending, and demanded a halt to the oath-taking.\nThe ensuing chaos saw a verbal exchange and slogans echoing through the assembly. The PML-N members brandished placards featuring party supremo Nawaz Sharif's images, countering with chants of \"watch thieves\" from PTI-backed lawmakers.\nThe speaker had to adjourn the meeting for 45 minutes to restore order.\nWhen the proceedings resumed, the speaker administered the oath to the members, but the absence of PTI's nominated chief minister, Mian Aslam Iqbal, caused a delay.\nThe speaker waited for the absent members before proceeding with the oath for the rest.\nSecurity measures outside the assembly included prison vans and water cannons, anticipating possible arrests related to the May 9 incident.\nThe session, set to commence at 10am, faced a delay of more than two hours.\nThe proceedings gained momentum at around 2:30pm, as outgoing Punjab Assembly Speaker Sibtain Khan administered the oath to the newly elected members, extending congratulations and best wishes.\nPML-N\u2019s candidate for the Punjab chief minister, Maryam Nawaz, former federal minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, and PTI leader Aamir Dogar were among the attendees.\nIt marked Maryam's first election as a lawmaker.\nThe outgoing speaker administered oaths to 215 PML-N and allied party lawmakers, along with 98 SIC and PTI-backed lawmakers.\nSibtain also issued the schedule for the election of the new speaker and deputy speaker of the Punjab Assembly.\nThe election schedule for the new speaker and deputy speaker is set to take place on Feb 24 (today) through a secret ballot.\nNomination papers\u2019 submission and scrutiny were conducted until 5:30pm.\nPML-N's Malik Mohammad Ahmed and SIC's Ahmed Khan Picher submitted their nomination papers for the post of speaker.\nPML-N's Malik Zaheer Iqbal and Mohammad Moinuddin Riaz are contending for the deputy speaker\u2019s slot.\nFollowing scrutiny, their nomination papers were approved, as confirmed by Chaudhry Amir Habib, the secretary of the PA.\nThe session was called by Punjab Governor Balighur Rehman a day prior, following the partial notification from the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) regarding reserved seats for women and minorities.\nThe Punjab Assembly, boasting 371 seats, consisting of 297 general seats and 74 reserved seats (66 for women and eight for minorities), holds the distinction of being the largest elected house in the country.\nTo date, the ECP has issued notifications for 42 reserved seats for women and five for minorities.\nOn Feb 8, elections on 296 general seats were conducted, with the polling for one seat delayed due to a candidate's unfortunate demise.\nWorth noting is that the previous assembly was dissolved in Jan 2023, leaving the province without a legislature for over a year.\nFollowing the oath administration on Wednesday, Speaker Sibtain urged lawmakers to maintain a positive atmosphere, encouraging them to listen to each other patiently.\nMeanwhile, reports of Mian Aslam's arrest, a PTI-backed independent lawmaker nominated for the post of chief minister, stirred tension, leading the speaker to instruct the police to provide a status report on Aslam.\nWhile the PML-N lawmakers pressed for the oath administration, opposition members sought an adjournment due to the yet-to-be-allocated reserve seats. The session was briefly adjourned until after Friday prayers.\nAddressing the uneven playing field for some lawmakers, Speaker Sibtain pledged to address obstacles faced by the PTI-backed independents, vowing to ensure the representation of the people.\nHe said a level-playing field has been provided to some lawmakers while not to others, in reference to obstacles being faced by the PTI-backed independent candidates.\n\"Now that I have come to the assembly, I shall see who stops the representatives of the people from coming to the premises,\" Sibtain said on arrival at the assembly.\nHe added that he would seek information regarding those lawmakers who had been barred from entering the premises.\n\"Today in the assembly, there will be no other activity apart from administering oath to the nine designated lawmakers.\"\nThe PML-N nominated Maryam Nawaz as its candidate for the chief ministership.\nIf elected, Maryam would become the first-ever woman chief minister in the country\u2019s history.\nDespite challenges to the election results by PTI-backed independents in several Punjab constituencies, the PML-N asserts it has garnered sufficient seats to establish the government.\nTo achieve this in Punjab, the party needs backing from 186 MPAs.\nIn the Feb 8 elections, the PML-N secured 137 seats. On Friday, it was assigned 36 reserved seats for women and five for minorities, raising its total strength in the 397-seat house to 178.\nHowever, the party contends it enjoys support from over 190 MPAs.\n"

            "Text": "The country entered the government formation phase on Thursday, transitioning from the electoral period. Assembly sessions were called in Punjab and Sindh by their governors, and a summary was forwarded to the president to convene the National Assembly session next week.\n\nThe Punjab Assembly will convene on Friday (today), marking the first legislature session since the February 8 general elections. Subsequently, the Sindh Assembly session is scheduled for Saturday (tomorrow). During these inaugural sessions, the newly-elected members of the provincial assemblies (MPAs) will take their oath of office.\n\nPunjab Governor Baleeghur Rehman and Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori summoned the provincial assembly sessions after the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) allocated reserved seats for women and minorities to the respective parties based on their performance in the general seats.\n\nWhile the ECP is yet to allocate reserved seats in the National Assembly, as well as the provincial legislatures of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, the parliamentary affairs ministry forwarded a summary to President Arif Alvi, proposing the convening of the National Assembly between February 26-28.\n\nThe Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) holds a clear majority in the Sindh Assembly, while the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) asserts a comfortable majority in Punjab, aiming to form its own government. Both parties have forged an alliance to collectively establish the government at the Centre.\n\nConversely, a significant number of independent candidates backed by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) secured victory in the February 8 elections. To ensure their representation in the reserved seats, they aligned with the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC).\n\nIn a notification issued on Thursday, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) did not allocate any seats to the SIC. However, sources reveal that the SIC had submitted an application for reserved seat allocation, citing its legislative presence. The ECP is expected to announce its decision on Friday (today).\n\nThe Punjab Assembly would hold its inaugural session on Friday (today), in which the newly-elected provincial lawmakers (MPAs) would take oath, according to a notification issued by Governor Balighur Rehman on Thursday.\n\nIn Lahore, the Punjab Assembly will convene at 10am, marking the first legislature session since the general elections. Speaker Sibtain Khan will preside over the session and administer the oath to the new MPAs.\n\nDespite challenges to the election results by PTI-backed independents in several Punjab constituencies, the PML-N asserts it has garnered sufficient seats to establish the government. To achieve this in Punjab, the party would need backing from 186 MPAs.\n\nIn the February 8 elections, the PML-N secured 137 seats. On Friday, it was assigned 36 reserved seats for women and five for minorities, raising its total strength in the 397-seat house to 178. However, the party contends it enjoys support from over 190 MPAs.\n\nThe PML-N has nominated Maryam Nawaz as its candidate for the chief ministership. If the claim of the support of the 190 MPAs was true, then Maryam would easily become the first ever female chief minister in the country\u2019s history.\n\nHere, the PTI has 110 independents, but when it decided to join the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), 105 of the independents submitted affidavits with the ECP. The PPP secured 10 seats and got three reserved seats. The PML-Quaid got two reserved seats and the Istehkam-e-Pakistan (IPP) received one.\n\nThe PTI had nominated Mian Aslam Iqbal for the position of the chief minister. Earlier, the PTI had called a protest outside the assembly against alleged election rigging but in a late-night development, the party decided to attend the session, according some media reports.\n\nIn Sindh, Speaker Agha Siraj Durrani will chair the inaugural session. In the general elections, the PPP got 84 seats, followed by the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) 28 and the PTI-backed 11 independents and 7 others.\n\nBased on this party standing, according to an ECP notification, the PPP got 20 reserved seats for women and six seats reserved for minorities. The MQM got six women\u2019s seats and two minorities seats. One reserved seat for women had been allocated to the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA).\n\nThose notified as the MPAs on reserved seats for women in the Punjab Assembly are Zakia Khan, Ishrat Ashraf, Marriyum Aurangzeb, Azma Zahid Bokhari, Hina Parvez Butt, Salma Saadia Temur, Rahila Naeem, Bushra Anjum Butt, Sania Ashiq Jabeen, Salma Butt, Kanwal Pervez, Mehwish Sultana, Nausheen Adnan, Asma Ehtishamul Haq, Kausar Javed, Uzma Jabeen, Ambreen lsmail, Mumtaz Begum, Sunbal Malik Hussain, Rukhsana Kausar, Shazia Rizwan, Motiya Begum, Rabia Naseem Farooqi, Sonia Ashir, Uzma Kardar, Safia Saeed, Tahia Noon, Amina Hassan, Asma Naz, Tahira Mushtaq, Zaibunnisa Awan, Fatima Begum, Qudsia Batool, Riffat Abbasi, Atiya lftikhar, Rushda Lodhi, Shazia Abid, Neelam Jabbar, Nargis Faiz Malik, Tashfeen Safdar, Salma Saeed and Sarah Ahmad.\n\nSimilarly, the MPAs on the reserved seats for minorities in the Punjab Assembly are Falbous Christopher, Emmanuel Ather, Ramesh Singh Arora, Khalil Tahir and Shakeela Javed.\n\nThe winners on the women\u2019s seats in Sindh Assembly are Seema Khurram, Tanzila Um-e-Habiba, Rehana Laghari, Yasmeen Shah, Nuhzat Pathan, Syeda Marvi Faseeh, Sadia Javed, Farzana Hanif, Sajeela, Hina Dastagir, Rukhsana Perveen, Heer Soho, Nida Khuhro, Saima Agha, Rooma Sabahat, Arooba Rabbani, Khairunisa, Maleeha Manzoor, Shazia Umar, Shaheena, Sofia Saeed Shah, Sikandar Khatoon, Kiran Masood, Farah Sohail, Quratul Ain Khan, Bilqees Mukhtar, and Fozia Kausar.\n\n"

            "Text": "The outgoing provincial caretaker government\u2019s move to hand over control of the Board of Intermediate Education Karachi to the Commissioner Karachi is slowly turning into a nightmare, much to the detriment of students. \nPreviously, exam and registration fees were abolished for students attending government schools in Sindh to ensure free and compulsory education. However, ever since the Intermediate Board has come under the control of the Karachi Commissioner\u2019s Office, students that were exempt now have to pay fees, under the guise of late charges. \nIn this regard, the Board issued a notification towards the end of last month, as per which enrollment forms for 1st Year Intermediate Annual examinations for the current year would be entertained with a Rs 1,000 penalty. It is pertinent to mention that penalty fees or late charges are only incurred when a student has failed to submit the requisite forms according to the given timeline. However, as per various principals of government colleges and government higher secondary schools in Karachi, the Board has mandated them to collect penalty fees or late charges starting February 1st. \nA college principal, who spoke to The Express Tribune under the condition of anonymity, stated that this was the first time in over 8 years that the Board had mandated that government colleges charge their students Rs 1,000 in late fees. \u201cPreviously, every year the Board would give a date for submission of enrollments at least 3 times but this time around we have instructed to charge students a penalty fee,\u201d he informed. \nAnother principal, confirming the directives, said that previously the Board did not operate in such a manner.\n\nRead\u00a0First-year intermediate students to get 15pc grace marks, says notification\nIn light of these revelations, The Express Tribune spoke to the Board\u2019s acting Secretary, Haroon Rasheed. \u201cThe enrollment forms date has already been announced 3 times. Students who do not submit the forms on time are charged the late fees,\u201d he clarified. When asked as to why new candidates were being charged the late fees as well, Rasheed said that this was not new. \u201cLate fees were charged last year as well, we have a notification in this regard.\u201d \nApart from the penalty fees issue, the administrative control of the Board has also suffered ever since its reigns were handed over to the Commissioner Karachi. The Express Tribune was told by sources familiar with the matter that the Commissioner Karachi was handed responsibility of the Board in December of 2023, following the removal of the Chairman of the Board in November of 2023; since then the Commissioner Karachi has visited the Board only a handful of times. \nWhen The Express Tribune asked the Commissioner Karachi, Sohail Rajput, about his apparent inattentiveness to the affairs of the Board, he brushed off the matter. \u201cThis is the era of WhatsApp and Zoom. One does not need to physically visit an institute because it can be run through virtual meetings,\u201d claimed Rajput while talking to The Express Tribune.\n"

The letter sheds light on missing laptops, computer servers, and other equipment from the World Bank-funded programme, none of which were recorded in the official register. Moreover, five out of the 10 vehicles purchased for the project have mysteriously disappeared.\n\nRead\u00a0Release of World Bank funds demanded to expedite projects\nTwo of the missing vehicles were recovered from the residence of a female project coordinator. According to the letter, the contract for the programme was awarded to VTT Global firm after receiving bid documents on a previous date.\nThe letter exposes the stoppage of HR Manager Hameed Alwani\u2019s salary, contravening ECP orders. This punitive action was taken due to Alwani\u2019s outspoken opposition to the illicit award of contracts worth millions of rupees to a private company within the programme.\nThe revelations raise serious concerns about the transparency and integrity of the World Bank-funded initiative, prompting a call for a thorough investigation into these alleged irregularities.\n"

            "Text": "Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) Cyber Wing Deputy Director Mahmudul Hasan revealed that individuals visiting pornographic websites are often coerced into sharing blasphemous content online.\nHas made this shocking revelation while addressing the awareness session on \u2018Blasphemous Material: Misuse of Social Media\u2019 organised by the Students\u2019 Advisor of the University of Karachi at the Chinese Teachers\u2019 Memorial Auditorium. \nHasan emphasized that individuals found guilty under Pakistan\u2019s 295c Law, which carries a maximum punishment of the death penalty, face dire consequences in both this life and the hereafter. He noted that Pakistan ranks among the highest in the world for viewing pornographic websites and sharing child pornography. \nHasan explained that those visiting such sites are manipulated into sharing blasphemous content after becoming addicted to obscenity, thus serving as unwitting conduits for spreading offensive material in exchange for access to more explicit content.\nThe deputy director of the FIA Cyber Wing informed the audience that they had arrested 344 people aged between 15 and 35 years. Last year, seven people were sentenced to death for uploading and sharing insulting content, and the remaining 242 cases are in the final stages.\nMeanwhile, University of Karachi Vice Chancellor Professor Dr. Khalid Mahmood Iraqi reiterated the sanctity of reverence for the Holy Prophet Hazrat Muhammad (PBUH) and emphasised the necessity of halting the dissemination of blasphemous material under the guise of modernism. Dr Iraqi acknowledged that blasphemy laws are sometimes misused, leading to debates within the country.\nEarlier, PTA Islamabad Web Analytics Division Director Muhammad Farooq said in the last six months, Facebook has removed 14.8 million content based on bullying and harassment and 28.7 million content based on hate speech.\nFarooq stressed that, \u201cit is necessary to educate our youth to protect them from the negative use of social media.\u201d\nA member of the Islamic Ideological Council, and a KU faculty member Dr Umair Mehmood Siddiqui said that people who have been watching pornographic content for three or four years are found involved in following, spreading, and sharing insulting content, \u201cwhich is very alarming for our society.\u201d\nHe informed the audience that the United States hosts 60 per cent of porn websites, while Pakistan is number one in the search of porn sites on Google, which is very shameful and a serious concern for all of us.\nThe KU Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences Dean Professor Dr Shaista Tabsum emphasised promoting awareness for the positive use of social media and the internet in Pakistan and said that we all need to play our role in this regard.\nZiauddin University Karachi Human Rights Center Director Dr Muaz Shah shed light on the laws in Pakistan regarding misuse of social media and promotion of offensive content.

The current market value of a 1,000 square yard plot in KIA is between Rs150 million to Rs200 million.\nFollowing a civil case at the subordinate court over the ages, the KDA was ordered to allocate a plot to the petitioner in Surjani Town. However, due to criminal activities in the area, the petitioner requested the KDA for an alternative location.\nJustice Panhwar highlighted the city's overall crime situation, stating that Karachi, home to thousands of criminals, including target killers, poses challenges for its residents. The court ordered an inquiry into the missing documents from the civil case.\n"

            "Text": "The Pakistan People\u2019s Party (PPP) is all set to form another government in Sindh, after nearly sweeping the entire province electorally on day of the general election, which resulted in a thumping majority for the party. \nWith this huge win under its belt, the PPP\u2019s leadership now faces the seemingly tough task of which individuals from the party gets to head the province and who will accompany the individual as part of the provincial cabinet. In this regard, Senator Taj Haider, in an exclusive telephonic conversation with the Express Tribune, after attending the PPP\u2019s Central Executive Committee meeting held in Islamabad, informed that the party had not taken any decisions as of yet. \u201cPPP has not made any decision regarding who will be in government in Sindh. This decision will be taken after the ongoing consultation process regarding formation of government in the centre is complete,\u201d said the Senator. \nNevertheless, as per multiple sources within the PPP, who spoke with the Express Tribune under the condition of anonymity, influential people with the party are active in Sindh for the formation of a government in the province and are actively lobbying for the future Chief Minister of Sindh and his or her provincial cabinet. Moreover, the Express Tribune learnt that in this regard once particular lobby, which has successfully placed 7 out of 12 people in the top slot of the province is highly active and former chief minister Syed Murad Ali Shah\u2019s name is gaining prominence. \nAs far as the provincial cabinet is concerned, party insides informed that if Syed Murad Ali Shah becomes the Chief Minister again, there will be some old faces in his cabinet, like Sharjeel Inam Memon, Syed Sardar Shah, Mukesh Kumar Chawla, Azra Fazal Pechuho, and Sajid Jokhio. However, the Express Tribune was told that efforts will also be made to give a share to members of influential political families who joined the party prior to the general election, such as the Mehar Family of Shikarpur and the Mehar Sardars of Ghotki.\u00a0 \nIn this regard, senior political analyst, Qazi Asif, was of the view that those who joined PPP recently will definitely demand inclusion in the provincial cabinet but might be subjected to constitutional restrictions. \u201cAccording to the 18th amendment to the country\u2019s constitution, the provincial government cannot have more than 11 per cent of the total members of the assembly as ministers. This means that Sindh\u2019s cabinet can have a maximum of 18 ministers,\u201d explained Asif. \nSources within the PPP are aware of the constitutional bar; nevertheless informed the Express Tribune that the Chief Minister had the power to appoint assistants and special assistants apart from ministers, so other aspirants would likely be adjusted in such positions. \nBe that as it may, some political observers feel that the PPP\u2019s priority should not be to keep political families and Members of the Sindh Assembly happy because the people have voted for it to solve their problems and thus welfare of the people should be its first priority.\nIn this regard, Sohail Sangi, opined that the incoming PPP government will have to pay special attention to ministries such as transport and public health this time. \u201cIt is crucial to solve the problems of drinking water and sewage and public health in the province, therefore, the PPP has to give more importance to these ministers. Similarly, the transport ministry will also need special attention because transport is one of the major problems in many cities of Sindh including Karachi,\u201d asserted Sangi while talking to The Express Tribune.\n"

This decision was given on a petition against the increasing stray dog population in the city and the inadequate supply of dog-bite vaccines to hospitals.\nA bench headed by SHC Chief Justice Aqeel Ahmad Abbasi took up the petition, which focused on controlling the increasing number of stray dogs and the insufficient availability of vaccines. The Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) lawyer informed the court that the orders had been executed, and a comprehensive report had been submitted.\nThe project director of the Anti-Rabies Program appeared before the court, elaborating on the measures taken. The court questioned the steps to be implemented and those already in implementation stage. The project director explained that anti-rabies vaccinations were being administered to stray dogs across the province.\nChief Justice Abbasi remarked on the visible presence of at least 50 dogs in the SHC premises. He emphasised the lack of observable actions to address the issue. The project director responded, stating that legislative measures had been undertaken, and three centres were established for sterilisation and vaccination in South, East, and Malir districts.\nChief Justice Abbasi pointed out the need for practical steps, questioning whether any efforts were made to catch stray dogs in the SHC premises. The project director assured that teams had been dispatched to South, Central, and Gulshan-e-Maymar for action against stray dogs, citing a shortage of funds.\nThe chief justice directed his inquiry to the public prosecutor, questioning the delay in fund release. The court ordered the restoration of helpline 1093, dedicated to action against dogs, and urged the Sindh government to promptly release funds for addressing the stray dog issue. The court also ordered the continuation of efforts to control the stray dog population.\n"

        },
        "Details": {
            "Text": "The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet on Wednesday approved an increase in gas prices for residential and industrial consumers to recover an additional Rs242 billion but could not finalise rates due to the competing interests of cabinet members.\nThe ECC also approved the imposition of 25% sales tax on all categories of SUVs and CUVs having value of over Rs4 million, excluding taxes. The decision will give Rs4.5 billion in additional revenue to the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).\nThe matter of gas price increase is likely to land in the federal cabinet on Thursday and the Petroleum Division is in the process of working out new rates for the residential consumers and captive power plants in light of the discussions held in the ECC meeting.\nFebruary 15 is the last date to meet the International Monetary Fund (IMF) condition of increasing gas prices and to honour the commitment to raise rates for the in-house gas plants of industries.\nThere was uncertainty about the new gas rates for Fauji Fertiliser Bin Qasim Limited (FFBQ) plant, which was availing Rs10 billion in subsidies. The finance ministry wanted to withdraw it.\nThe industry minister again opposed the increase in gas prices for the in-house power plants owned by industrialists by Rs750 per million British thermal units (mmbtu), or 34%. But he agreed to a nominal increase in rates.\nThe energy minister sought to increase rates in line with the commitments given to the IMF.\nECC Chairman and Finance Minister Dr Shamshad Akhtar stated in the meeting that gas prices should be rationalised for the fertiliser plants that were availing the subsidy being paid by bulk, power, industrial, cement and compressed natural gas (CNG) consumers.\nThe subsidy of Rs39 billion on feed and fuel gas for Engro Fertilisers was withdrawn and the ECC approved a new rate of Rs1,597 per mmbtu.\nIn a statement, the Ministry of Finance stated that a summary of the Petroleum Division titled \u201cNatural gas sale pricing FY 2023-24, effective February 1, 2024\u201d, was deliberated upon at length.\n\u201cAfter discussion, the ECC decided that the revision of sale price and tariff should be consistent with revenue requirements of Sui companies,\u201d the ministry said.\nThe ECC was informed that the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) determined Rs205 billion in revenue requirement for Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) and Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC). After including taxes, consumers would be forced to cough up an additional Rs242 billion, said the sources.\nThe finance ministry stated that the ECC recommended a uniform gas price for fertiliser plants, a decision that should lead to the withdrawal of subsidies.\nEngro was paying mere Rs200 per mmbtu on feed gas, which will now go up to Rs1,597. The Petroleum Division had proposed Rs760 per mmbtu but the finance minister got it increased to Rs1,597.\nThe additional amount to be collected from Engro will be used to slightly lower the proposed increase in gas prices for residential consumers. The Petroleum Division had proposed a 5% to 67% increase in gas prices for residential consumers.\nNew rates will be tabled before the federal cabinet on Thursday after incorporating the impact of additional revenue from the Engro plant.\nRead Cabinet divided over 69% gas price hike amid IMF warning\nThe ECC directed the Competition Commission of Pakistan to investigate the undue increase in urea prices and fix responsibility. It also directed the Ministry of Industries to ensure the stability of urea prices.\nHowever, the fertiliser sector lobby was very strong and on Wednesday again approached the finance ministry, asking it to review a day earlier decision to withdraw the subsidies.\nUnder an agreement with the IMF, Pakistan is required to further increase gas prices by February 15. Secretary finance told the ECC a day earlier that without price increase, the IMF would not complete the next programme review, which was necessary for the release of last tranche of $1.2 billion.\nIt is the third increase in gas prices that the government has proposed in the past one year.\nThe Petroleum Division had proposed to put the maximum burden on the most vulnerable households with 67%, or Rs100, increase per unit for monthly consumption of 0.5 cubic hectometres (HM3).\nThere were heated arguments on the proposal of increasing gas prices for the industrialists in the range of 18% to 34%. The Petroleum Division proposed that the existing distinction between the export and non-export industries using gas for in-house electricity generation should be abolished.\nIt proposed that one unified price of Rs2,950 per mmbtu may be fixed for all types of industries. This will result in an increase of Rs750 per mmbtu, or 34%, for exporters and Rs450, or 18%, for the non-export sector using gas for captive power plants.\n\u201cThe textile sector cannot take an additional burden of Rs33 billion after the previous increase in gas prices put a burden of Rs110 billion,\u201d Industries Minister Gohar Ejaz told The Express Tribune after the meeting.\nHe said that due to the previous increase in prices, the textile sector badly suffered, which also impacted its exports.\nAn official of the Petroleum Division said that due to the stiff resistance by the industries ministry, the new increase in captive gas rates would be much less than the proposed Rs2,950 per mmbtu.\nPakistan has committed to the IMF that it will make gas prices uncompetitive for the captive power plants by increasing them to the level of imported LNG prices. The imported LNG prices stand at Rs3,750 per mmbtu.\nThe efficiency of industrial captive plants is very low compared to LNG-fired power plants, thus, the IMF and Petroleum Division want to divert gas from industries to the power generation sector.\nOnly five sectors \u2013 textile, carpets, leather, sports and surgical goods \u2013 were using subsidised gas in the name of the rest of the exporters. The exporters of petrochemicals, rice, steel, ceramics, cement and glass goods were not getting the benefit.\nAgritech and Fatima Fertiliser are currently getting RLNG from the SNGPL network. The proposed price for these plants will be Rs1,596 per mmbtu, which is the average prescribed price in case these plants are offered system gas on SNGPL.\nThese two plants are availing Rs9 billion in subsidy, which should be withdrawn instead of passed on to residential consumers.\nFor the CNG sector, the ECC approved increasing prices from Rs3,600 per mmbtu to Rs3,750 equivalent to the RLNG price being the fuel for the majority CNG producers.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 15th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

            "Text": "The government has come under fire for seeking permission from the regulator for recovering Rs81.5 billion from honest consumers paying bills regularly on account of capacity charges and losses caused by theft and leakages.\nInterveners called on the regulator to take strict action to fix the problem. The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) held a public hearing on Wednesday to review a petition in which power distribution companies (DISCOs) sought the recovery of Rs81.5 billion from consumers under quarterly adjustment for the second quarter of financial year 2023-24.\nIt was informed that DISCOs wanted to collect a total of Rs75,139 million on account of capacity charges and Rs10,818 million to recover transmission and distribution (T&D) losses under the monthly fuel charges adjustment (FCA).\n\u201cIs there any end to the capacity charges that are going to rise further in future after installation of more power projects,\u201d an intervener said during the hearing.\nCapacity payments go to the power plants which remain idle and do not produce any electricity but consumers are compelled to pay due to the agreements signed by different governments with power producers on a \u201ctake-or-pay\u201d basis.\nThe hearing was told that electricity consumption had decreased by 12-13% in the second quarter of FY24.\nRegarding efforts to reduce circular debt, the regulator said that it was not satisfied with the measures being taken in this regard. It also expressed displeasure over the absence of senior officials of DISCOs from the public hearing.\nNepra chairman stressed that they should be present to respond to the challenges being faced by the public.\n\u201cNeither the Central Power Purchasing Agency-Guarantee (CPPA-G) CEO turned up nor anyone came from the Power Division,\u201d a member Nepra remarked and asked, \u201cwhy has power consumption decreased in the country\u201d.\nThe member Nepra observed that rampant load-shedding was happening in the areas of electricity companies while consumers were forced to make capacity payments.\nRead Power tariff hike to dent trade, industry\n\u201cElectricity companies are not interested in providing new power connections,\u201d remarked Member Nepra Rafiq Shaikh.\nIt was noted that electricity connections that required consumption of 1,100 megawatts had been pending but DISCOs were claiming that power consumption had dropped.\nThe regulator announced that it would issue a decision after the scrutiny of data.\nAccording to the petition, DISCOs sought a total of Rs81,498 million on account of capacity charges and the impact of T&D losses on the monthly FCA.\nFaisalabad Electric Supply Company (Fesco) is looking to recover Rs9,446 million, Gujranwala Electric Power Company (Gepco) Rs2,663 million, Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (Hesco) Rs3,524 million, Islamabad Electric Supply Company (Iesco) Rs6,921 million, Lahore Electric Supply Company (Lesco) Rs15,105 million, Multan Electric Power Company (Mepco) Rs14,884 million, Peshawar Electric Supply Company (Pesco) Rs11,583 million, Quetta Electric Supply Company (Qesco) Rs10,983 million, Sukkur Electric Power Company (Sepco) Rs2,879 million and Tribal Electric Supply Company (Tesco) Rs3,510 million.\nAccording to the policy guidelines issued by the federal government for the application of uniform quarterly adjustments, the FY24 second quarter adjustment for DISCOs, to be determined by Nepra, will be applicable to the consumers of K-Electric as well.\nTo proceed further and arrive at a just and informed decision, Nepra conducted the hearing on Tuesday.\nPursuant to the notified tariff, DISCOs filed requests for adjustments on account of capacity charges, transmission charges, market operator fee, the impact of incremental units and T&D losses on FCA, and variable operation and maintenance charges for the second quarter of FY24, October-December 2023, in line with the notified mechanism.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 15th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

            "Text": "Global demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) is estimated to rise by more than 50% by 2040. This growth is fuelled by industrial coal-to-gas switching in China, as well as South Asia and South-east Asian countries using more LNG to support their economic growth, according to Shell\u2019s LNG Outlook 2024.\nGlobal trade in LNG reached 404 million tonnes in 2023, up from 397 million tonnes in 2022, with tight supplies of LNG constraining growth while maintaining prices and price volatility above historic averages. While demand for natural gas has already peaked in some regions, global demand continues to rise, with LNG demand expected to reach around 625-685 million tonnes a year in 2040, according to the latest industry estimates.\n\u201cChina is likely to dominate LNG demand growth this decade as its industry seeks to cut carbon emissions by switching from coal to gas,\u201d said Steve Hill, Executive Vice President for Shell Energy. \u201cWith China\u2019s coal-based steel sector accounting for more emissions than the total emissions of the UK, Germany and Turkey combined, gas has an essential role to play in tackling one of the world\u2019s biggest sources of carbon emissions and local air pollution.\u201d\nNotably, over the next decade, declining domestic gas production in parts of South Asia and South-east Asia could drive a surge in demand for LNG.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 15th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

            "Text": "The Federal Investigation Agency disclosed on Wednesday that a forensic report has established that officials of Dubai Islamic Bank (DIB) were involved in forging documents and depriving depositors of their money \u2013 in a disclosure that brings into question the credibility of the banking system.\nAdditional Director General of FIA, Mujahid Akbar Khan, briefed the Senate Standing Committee on Finance on the progress of a Rs410 million fraud that DIB bank\u2019s officials allegedly committed against a family, depriving them of their hard earnings. Senator Saleem Mandviwalla of the Pakistan People\u2019s Party (PPP) chaired the meeting.\n\u201cWe have received the forensic report, which established that the bank\u2019s staff forged the signatures and withdrew money from their accounts,\u201d said the additional director-general in testimony before the standing committee.\nAkbar said that the FIA has decided to register a First Investigation Report (FIR) against the staff of DIB, saying there was negligence on the part of the bank.\nThis is the second fraud with depositors to have surfaced in recent months and come to the level of the Senate Standing Committee after the banks\u2019 management found protecting their employees instead of taking action against them. Earlier, a similar fraud was reported in another bank.\nJustice must be done, and the FIA should investigate DIB officials, said Senator Farooq H Naeek, the former Law Minister and member of the committee.\nThe additional director-general further said that the FIA was now in possession of \u201cphysical evidence of the forgery and about the involvement of the three officials of the bank\u201d. He said that there was evidence of the issuance of fake cheque books, parallel banking, and encashment of fake cheques.\nAt least seven to 10 employees of the banks are involved in the fraud who issued nine fake cheque books to withdraw money from the accounts, Nazhat Butt, one of the affected depositors, told the standing committee.\nRead\u00a0Rs5bn embezzled, bank manager booked\nShe said that the bank\u2019s employees started unauthorised cash withdrawals in 2017 which continued for seven years \u2013 the period in which she was residing abroad. \u201cIn a single day, Rs10.3 million was illegally withdrawn from my account,\u201d said Butt.\nActing CEO of Dubai Islamic Bank, Syed Farhan Ali, told the committee that the bank found the concerned branch manager\u2019s behaviour suspicious in 2022 and subsequently fired him. He said that there were suspicious transactions valuing Rs20.5 million, and the amount was subsequently paid to the depositors.\nThe acting CEO did not deny the existence of the fraud but said that it was a complicated case. Ali said that the bank received the claim of Rs410 million in 2023, about a year and a half after making the Rs20.5 million payments.\nThe committee did not accept the CEO\u2019s view and said that the fraud began in 2017, and the bank took action in 2022, that too not to the satisfaction of the victims.\nThe Additional Director-General of FIA reported that certain documents related to the case were sent for forensic examination, and it was discovered that forgery had been committed through the use of fake signatures and cheques.\nThe Committee directed the acting CEO of Dubai Islamic Bank to cooperate fully with the FIA. Additionally, the Committee requested a fact-finding report on the issue to be presented in the next meeting on February 21, 2024.\nFahad Butt and his family, who were the victims of the alleged fraud, attended the committee meeting and provided evidence of the alleged wrongdoing.\nThe FIA is substantiating the victim\u2019s claim. If it is Dubai Islamic Bank, should we sell our sovereignty and let it swindle the depositors, questioned Senator Farooq Naeek.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 15th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

            "Text": "Feeling left out of the government race following the inconclusive vote on Feb 8 in which his party showed poorly, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Thursday accused former army chief General (retd) Qamar Javed Bajwa and ex-director general Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hameed of orchestrating the downfall of the PTI government led by Imran Khan in 2022.\n\nThe Maulana\u2019s allegations made during an interview with a private TV channel came a day after his party rejected the election results as \u201crigged\u201d and decided to sit on the opposition benches in parliament in \u201cprotest mode\u201d.\n\n\u201cI was opposed to the idea of tabling a no-confidence motion against Imran Khan,\u201d the Maulana said while referring to the events unfolded in 2022 as the country saw for the first time in its history the ouster of a prime minister through a no-confidence vote. Maulana Fazl was among top opposition leaders who spearheaded the efforts to oust the PTI founder under the banner of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM).\n\nComing on the heels of rapidly changing political landscape in the country and particularly at a time when the political parties who once were part of the PDM have been in the process of forming a new coalition at the Centre \u2013 a la PDM 2.0 -- the revelations would add to the controversy of removing an elected by the opposition with the help of the military establishment.\n\nMoreover, just before his retirement the former army chief prided himself in claiming that the armed forces had learnt from history and become apolitical, adding the \u201cpolitical quarantine of the armed forces\u201d will bode well for Pakistan in the long term.\n\n\u201cDespite some criticism and undue vilification of the armed forces through mass propaganda and meticulously crafted false narratives, the institutional resolve to remain apolitical will remain steadfast,\u201d Bajwa had said in an interview with the UAE-based publication, Gulf News, just a day before doffing his uniform.\n\nFor its part, the PTI accused the country\u2019s then-rulers of colluding with the US and hatching a regime change conspiracy to topple Imran\u2019s government and blamed the military, which was led by retired Gen Bajwa at the time, for letting the then-dispensation in Islamabad go ahead with the alleged conspiracy.\n\nIn the interview, the JUI-F chief, who described himself as \u201ca fighter and not a quitter\u201d, elaborated on the events of the no-confidence vote and said: \u201cThey (Gen Bajwa and Gen Faiz) were in contact with all political parties regarding the no-confidence motion and they told us the way of going about it.\u201d\n\nDirecting a fusillade of criticism at his former coalition partners, Fazl claimed that Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) spearheaded the no-confidence move against Imran, with Bajwa and Faiz providing directives to the political parties. \"I was not in favour of it, but I supported it because then the PDM (Pakistan Democratic Movement) would have said that I saved Imran Khan,\" he stated.\n\nHe emphasised his preference to proceed with the \u201cpower of the movement\u201d, noting that the PPP was spearheading the no-confidence motion. \u201cGen Faiz had come to me and he asked me to go ahead [with the no-confidence vote], but only within the system, but not out of the system. Though I refused it,\u201d he claimed.\n\nFazl further explained that he changed his stance once representatives from various parties approached him for a joint action. \u201cIf I had refused it again, they would say I am saving Imran.\u201d\nHe insisted that all political parties were convened in the presence of the two generals, who allegedly provided directions on the matter.\n\nThe JUI-F leader alleged that Lt Gen (retd) Faiz also supported the no-confidence motion, claiming, \"Gen Bajwa and Gen Faiz gave instructions about the no-confidence motion and PML-N and PPP sealed it. Gen Faiz said that we can do everything within the limits of the system and he had no objection to it\u201d.\n\nFazl's remarks have caught political analysts off guard, given his reputation as a staunch supporter of the establishment. Some speculate that his comments about Bajwa and Hameed stem from his sheer frustration over his recent defeat in general elections.\n\nDuring the interview, Fazl maintained that both the 2018 and 2024 elections were rigged. \"We have decided to protest against this vote theft. Now the decisions would be taken on the ground rather than in the assembly,\" he declared.\nRegarding discussions with PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif on government formation, the JUI-F chief disclosed his refusal to participate. \"I believe whatever happened during the 2024 elections, it benefitted PML-N. There are rumours that Nawaz Sharif was given the Lahore seat,\" he added.\n\nHe cautioned that if PML-N and other political parties proceed to form the government, they would be held accountable for the consequences. \"I don\u2019t see a [bright] future for the parliament, therefore, I invited PML-N to sit with us,\" he stressed.\n"

            "Text": "At least two people were killed and around a dozen injured during an exchange of fire between two rival political groups in the Hub city of Balochistan as police completely failed to bring the situation under control. \nA peaceful protest in PB-21 against alleged result changes in the general elections turned violent. Chaos erupted on the national highway near the Civic Center, resulting in the loss of two lives and injuries to around a dozen people in a gunfight between two groups.\nThe victims have been rushed to the hospital, casting a somber shadow over ongoing unrest. The incident happened when the supporters of Sardar Saleh Bhootani of the Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) and Ali Hassan Zehri of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) clashed near the Civic Center Hub, police sources said. \nThe protest, initially aimed at voicing grievances over election outcomes, quickly escalated into fatal clashes between two groups. Witnesses described scenes of pandemonium, highlighting the danger and despair that gripped the area.\nDespite efforts to maintain order, the situation worsened, emphasizing the high stakes of political dissent. Authorities are now working to restore calm and ensure citizen safety. \nAs the Hub mourns and hopes for peaceful resolution, the incident serves as a stark reminder of the fragility of civil discourse. In the face of tragedy, unity and determination emerge, signaling a collective desire for peace and reconciliation between Bhootani brothers and Zehris.\nIt may be mentioned here that multiple parties have announced protest demonstrations against the polls rigging across the province.\nA shutter-down strike was observed in Quetta and other parts of Balochistan against the alleged poll rigging in the province on Tuesday. Four nationalist political parties namely the Balochistan National Party (BNP), Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), National Party (NP), and Hazara Democratic Party (HDP) had given the call for a strike against what they claimed was record poll rigging during the recently held general elections.\n\u201cOur protest will continue till fair and transparent elections,\u201d Ghulam Nabi Marri, one of the central leaders of BNP had said. He warned of intensifying protests against the provincial and federal governments for what he claimed worst election rigging.\nAll markets, shops and business centers remained closed in Quetta and various cities of Balochistan on the eve of shutter-down strike called by the four mainstream political parties of the province.\nMultiple political parties organized protest demonstrations outside returning officers\u2019 offices in various district headquarters of Balochistan. Candidates and party representatives urged the Election Commission of Pakistan to oversee the recounting and re-conducting of several constituencies across the province.\n\u201cWe want justice,\u201d Abdul Qahar Wadan of the PkMAP demanded. He alleged the worst poll rigging in Balochistan.\n"

Despite these water sources, citizens continue to face water shortages throughout the year, underscoring the necessity for coordinated efforts during routine maintenance to mitigate disruptions in the water supply system.\nThe water supply department of the CDA said it is working on several projects to meet the shortage of water in Islamabad so that the citizens do not face any kind of difficulties during summer.\n"

Cluster centres consisting of two to three union councils in the city and two to three wards in Cantt have been formed. A total of 27 cluster centres have been set up and each cluster centre has an independent in-charge.\nEach cluster centre will have teams of 12 to 15 women and men workers who will work from 8am to 5pm.\nAll those areas, from where dengue patients had appeared in the last five years, have been declared as sensitive and separate in-charges have been appointed in all these areas.\nThere will also be third-party survey teams, comprising three organisations, for the campaign. These teams will conduct a third-party survey of each cleared area. If dengue larvae are found during surveys, actions will be taken against the teams.\nNew spray pumps, modern sprays and protective kits have been ordered in large numbers for the new anti-dengue campaign. From March 1, the weeding of grass, weed and hemp will also be started in vacant plots and graveyards to prevent the spread of dengue. The Rawalpindi Metropolitan Corporation (RMC) will be responsible for cleaning cemeteries and weeding grass and hemp.\n"

The court should issue an order whether it wanted to hear the petition or not, the lawyer said.\nJudge Shah Rukh remarked that whether Judge Muhammad Bashir's leave was approved on medical grounds or not, he would tell later, but he [the judge] would hear arguments on bail on Feb 19. The judge further argued that four other courts were also at his disposal.\nThe lawyer said that it didn\u2019t matter whether they [the judge] had four courts or six, the court should hear his client\u2019s plea. Fawad Chaudhry said that as general elections were over, what was stopping the court to retain him in jail.\nTo which, the judge remarked that the question should be asked by those who had kept Fawad in jail. He further remarked that he had signed the order sheet but couldn\u2019t write observations.\nFawad Chaudhary said the court had signed the order sheet without the accused, a practice that is a routine in [Pakistan].\nThe court later adjourned hearing of the case till Feb 19 and extended Fawad\u2019s judicial remand as of Feb 28.\nCourt reserves verdict\nA district and sessions court in Islamabad reserved its verdict pertaining to the production of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf founder, Imran Khan in the case against his alleged intimidation of a female judge. \nCivil judge Mureed Abbas heard the case in Islamabad in which Khalid Yousuf Chaudhary, the counsel for Khan, maintained that his client is currently in detention by the state. \nJudge Mureed Abbas said to the council that he had first filed a petition which stated that Khan had security concerns due to which he cannot be presented. \nThe lawyer argued that the concern about security persisted before the arrest, as there were serious risks then. \nThe court remarked that the court may decide on the earlier petition and summon the PTI founder. The lawyer said that it is the state\u2019s responsibility to present him now. The court reserved its order on the production request of founder PTI.\n"

            "Text": "Speakers at a moot on Tuesday underlined the need to continue with the rural support programmes to fight rural poverty in the country.\nThe Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad (ISSI) hosted its latest \u2018Thought Leaders Forum\u2019 (TLF) under the title, \u201cPoverty Alleviation and the Role of Rural Support Programme.\u201d\nNational Rural Support Programme (NRSP) Chairman Shoaib Sultan Khan shed light on poverty alleviation and the role of rural support programmes.\nHe emphasised that Pakistan's rural support programmes are among the oldest in the region, are widely acknowledged for their success and have served as a model and inspiration for similar initiatives in South Asia, including India. The pursuit of poverty eradication should be a shared political agenda, serving as a unifying force rather than a source of division within regions, Sohaib added.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a common goal that has the potential to foster collaboration and solidarity across diverse geographical areas, emphasising the collective responsibility to address and eliminate socio-economic disparities.\u201d\nThe NRSP chief further elucidated multiple factors that contribute to the success of such programmes including long-term political commitment, poverty eradication as a common political agenda, political support and ownership, sustained governmental support, institutional development, innovation and adaptation, and participation of women.\nHe brought attention to four essential elements of the success of a rural support program; (i) the willingness of the households to organise and enable their potential; (ii) a competent community leader with social mobilisation vision; (iii) professional, dedicated and committed support organisation; and (iv) availability and commitment of resources.\nDr Neelum Nigar, the Director of the Centre for Strategic Perspectives (CSP), said that under the TLF, ISSI acknowledges and pays tribute to individuals esteemed as authoritative voices in specific fields. These individuals have played a crucial role in shaping perspectives, influencing decisions, and driving innovation within their respective domains in Pakistan.\nISSI director-general Ambassador Sohail Mahmood noted that Pakistan has made significant strides in reducing absolute poverty, with rates dropping from 61.6% in 1998-99 to 21.5% in 2021-22. However, multidimensional poverty remains high at 39%, highlighting deprivation in health, education, and standard of living.\n"

            "Text": "The Prime Minister\u2019s Office has decided to withdraw the decision of giving three salaries in reward to the officers serving at PM\u2019s House and Office \u2013 in a move that would help save Rs30 million in addition to avoiding any public resentment.\n\nBut the low-paid employees serving against basic pay scales of 1 to 16 would still be entitled to the honorarium equal to their three monthly basic salaries, according to the government sources.\n\nPrime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar on Monday partially reversed his earlier decision of giving three salaries in reward for all the employees serving in grade 1 to 22 at the Prime Minister\u2019s Office and House.\n\nEarlier, it had been decided that all the officials (grade 1 to 16) and the officers (grade 17-22) would be given a departing gift by the prime minister in the shape of three salaries in rewards. When contacted, a senior functionary of the PM\u2019s Office stated that it has now been decided that the rewards would not be given to the officers serving in grade 17 to 22.\n\nHowever, all the employees serving in grade 1 to 16 would still be entitled to the honorarium. The low-paid employees are more vulnerable to the inflationary pressures and they do hope that every premier would honour their services at the time of departure by giving them monetary benefits, the senior functionary said.\n\nThere is a possibility that in the next few days, at least two of the three biggest largest political parties would form an alliance and make a government, which would end the term of Anwaarul Haq Kakar that began in August last year.\n\nThe senior functionary said that it was not unusual that every prime minister would give such benefits at the end of the term of the office. But he said that it has now been decided that the officers would be exempted from the honorarium.\n\nThe decision would help save Rs30 million of the exchequer \u2013 a sum not substantial in itself but carries significant symbolic value. The cost of giving honorariums is over Rs50.6 million, according to the officials.\n\nThe premier\u2019s fresh decision reflects the ground realities, suggesting a sensitivity to public sentiment on the matter.\n\nEarlier, on a proposal from his staff, the caretaker prime minister had approved giving three months\u2019 basic salary as honorarium for \u201ccompletion of the official tasks in the current financial year in a befitting manner\u201d.\n\nAfter the PM\u2019s decision, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet had also approved a supplementary grant by creating a room in the budget.\n\nIf the ECC's approved decision had been executed as planned, it would have incurred a cost of Rs80.63 million to the exchequer. At the time of the approval, the Ministry of Finance had expressed reservations about giving the honoraria. However, the majority of ECC members insisted that the cabinet body should recognise the prime minister\u2019s authority.\n\nThe ECC had approved Rs42 million for rewards for the public wing of the PM\u2019s Office and Rs38.63 million for the PM\u2019s House.\n\nPakistan faces a precarious fiscal situation, making it imperative to refrain from such rewards, especially to public servants who receive substantial salaries and can withstand challenges of high inflationary pressures.\nInflation has persisted in double digits for an extended duration, reaching over 28% in January.\n\nThe federal government\u2019s budget deficit widened more than 50% during the first half of this fiscal year, requiring a prudent fiscal management and leaving no room for any kind of rewards.\n\nCompared to the private sector, the low-paid employees are getting higher salaries and enjoying job security.\n\n"

However, simultaneously, the SC ensured the conviction of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam Nawaz before the elections.\n\nIn the lead-up to the 2024 general elections, a larger bench, presided over by CJP Isa, revisited its earlier decision on the disqualification of lawmakers under Article 62 (1) (f) of the Constitution. The ruling notably benefited PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif and Jahangir Khan Tareen.\n\nHowever, a different bench led by Chief Justice Isa deemed the intra-party elections of PTI illegal, leading to the party's loss of its election symbol just before the polls. The credibility of the elections came into question following the order on January 13\n\n'Symbol case crumbles'\n\nAccording to former additional attorney general Tariq Mahmood Khokhar, the PTI election symbol case crumbled on Feb 8 thanks to the people\u2019s verdict.\n\n\"It was an act of judicial raw power reminiscent of Muhammad Munir, Sheikh Anwaarul Haq and Irshad Hassan Khan. In the words of U.S Justice Antonin Scalia it constitutes \u201c\u2026 an affront to the principle of democratic rule\u2026 robs the People of the most important liberty: the freedom to govern themselves,\u201d he noted.\n\nHe pointed out that consequences include marred elections, an assault on democracy, constitutional ambivalence, a deeply fractured nation and loss of public legitimacy in constitutional institutions.\n\u201cThere cannot be many who fail to grasp the cause and effects,\" Tariq Khokhar added.\n\nShahbaz Khosa, the Additional Secretary of the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), also voiced dissatisfaction with the SC\u2019s involvement in the recent general elections, highlighting the deprivation of the PTI from its election symbol.\n\nHe also criticised the conduct of the SCBA over the past couple of years, asserting that both superior bars are safeguarding the interests of powerful circles.\n\nLegal experts argue that the SC now possesses a golden opportunity to rectify its previous mistake by safeguarding the mandate of a political party.\n\nThe focus of the discussion has shifted to whether the judiciary will offer relief to the PTI in election disputes, although election issues can only be contested in the election tribunals as per Article 225 of the Constitution.\n\nSeveral candidates supported by PTI have lodged appeals with the higher courts contesting the election outcomes declared by Returning Officers (ROs).\n\nIt is pertinent to note that the strained relationship between PTI and the apex court intensified after the court deemed intra-party elections as illegal.\n\nPTI also withdrew a contempt petition against the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and other entities, citing a lack of confidence in obtaining relief during the elections.\n\nAn important aspect revolves around the allocation of reserved seats to PTI. The majority of lawyers believe that PTI should be granted reserved seats, and questions arise about whether PTI-backed independent candidates can form a parliamentary party.\n\nA PTI lawyer disclosed that various options are under consideration to secure reserved seats. The decision on whether PTI will approach the SC to obtain reserved seats and bind their independent candidates from defection is still pending.\n\nWith the invalidation of intra-party elections, the question arises: who will assume the role of the party head and provide guidance on the applicability of Article 63-A of the constitution?\n\nA senior government official emphasised the need for clarity on the interpretation of Article 63-A to deter the defection of independent candidates who were backed by the PTI.\n\nArticle 63 A (2) of the Constitution says that a member of a house shall be deemed to be a member of a parliamentary party if he has been elected as a candidate or nominee of a political party which constitutes the parliamentary party in the house or, having been elected otherwise than as a candidate or nominee of a political party has become a member of such parliamentary party after such election by means of a declaration in writing.\n\nIn view of this provision, there is a need to get clarification about the party 'nominee' and candidate'.\nLawyers believe that awarding three convictions to Imran Khan sent the wrong message to the public.\nDespite these hurdles, the public voted for PTI-backed candidates.\n\nA political leader not affiliated with PTI suggested that female voters were displeased with the Iddat case decision and mostly voted for PTI-backed candidates.\n\n"

As a result of the campaign, thousands of Afghan citizens were compelled to leave the country.\n\nOn December 28, 2023, the FIA\u2019s Anti-Corruption Circle Islamabad apprehended a four-member gang of former NADRA employees involved in fraudulent activities related to issuance of identification cards to Afghans and foreigners by illicitly adding them to Pakistani family trees.\n\nThe illegal activities had taken place at the NADRA Mega Centre at Islamabad Blue Area, where the accused provided identity cards to foreign nationals during the years 2019 and 2020.\n\n"

            "Text": "As the political chessboard sees its pieces shifting and alliances forming in the aftermath of the Feb 8 vote, the PML-N\u2019s hand appeared stronger on Monday to pull off the task of stitching together a federal government \u2013 without splitting the baby as it holds extensive consultations with allies on nitty-gritty.\nFollowing the post-Feb 8 vote whirlwind, where no party emerged as a simple majority, the PML-N and PPP have been engaged in a strategic tango to form a central government with the support of their allies.\nThe PML-N, in particular, is burning the midnight oil to piece together a government in the Centre, Punjab, and Balochistan.\nMeanwhile, as political wheeling and dealing also reached a fever pitch, seven freshly elected members of the Punjab Assembly joined PML-N, meeting with the party's chief organizer, Maryam Nawaz.\nSohail Khan from PP-240 Bahawalnagar, Khurram Virk from PP-48 Sialkot, and Shehzada Gazin Abbasi from PP-249 Ahmed Pur Sharqia were among the MPAs making the strategic move.\nJoining the ranks were Khizar Mazarr from Rajanpur, Zulfiqar Ali Shah, Saqib Chadhar from Chiniot, and Rana Fayyas from Pasroor.\nDuring the meeting, Maryam hailed the decision of the independent candidates, saying it was a game-changer in providing facilities to the common people. Meanwhile, the independents expressed complete confidence in the prowess of PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif.\nSimultaneously, behind closed doors at the residence of PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif, political activities buzzed with intensity.\nIstehkam-e-Pakistan Party (IPP) president Abdul Aleem Khan and newly elected National Assembly member Awn Chaudhry arrived at the former prime minister\u2019s residence, according to party sources.\nThe two leaders delved into a detailed discussion on the current political landscape and government formation.\n'PM after consultations'\nMeanwhile, in a press conference at the party secretariat in Model Town, PML-N's Deputy Secretary General Attaullah Tarar hinted at the party's strength to pull off the task of creating a federal government.\nHowever, he said that the selection of their prime ministerial candidate would be announced only after reaching a thorough consensus with political allies.\nTarar revealed discussions with the PPP and MQM-P were underway for the Centre, coupled with efforts to rope in newly elected members into the party.\nTarar expressed confidence in the PML-N's ability to establish a government in Punjab as the party attained a simple majority in the province.\nThe PML-N leader underlined the importance of proper consensus among all political allies before announcing the candidate for the premiership. Tarar extended congratulations to all PML-N workers, elected members, and leaders for the anticipated government formation in Punjab.\nRegarding the election results, Tarar said there were certain elements that had prematurely celebrated success based on the initial 25 per cent result announcement. However, he pointed out that when final results were announced, these elements began alleging electoral malpractice and raised concerns about rigging.\nTarar admitted that prominent PML-N figures, including Rana Sanaullah, Mian Javed Latif, Sheikh Rohail Asghar, and Khawaja Saad Rafique, had lost their seats. He argued that if there had been rigging by the PML-N, these seats could not have been lost.\nDespite the losses, he said the party had gracefully accepted electoral results in areas where they faced defeat.\nMeanwhile, PML-N spokesperson Marriyum Aurangzeb dismissed premature claims about the party's PM candidate, asserting that senior leader Khawaja Muhammad Asif's statement was being taken out of context.\nmaintained that the final decision would only be made after due consultation with political allies, promising transparency in the process.\nThe PML-N, despite notable losses in seats held by prominent figures like Rana Sanaullah and Mian Javed Latif, remains undeterred, gracefully accepting defeat in areas where electoral results did not favour them.\nIt is pertinent to note that the PML-N and PPP, with 75 and 54 seats respectively, are engaged in constructive discussions.\nA recent meeting between Shehbaz Sharif and Asif Ali Zardari at Bilawal House in Lahore, though shrouded in mystery, is seen as a pivotal moment in shaping the political landscape.\n"

            "Text": "\u00a0\nThe Supreme Court has accepted an intra-court appeal (ICA) filed by the federal government against an apex court order that stated that the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) could not conduct misconduct proceedings against retired judges of superior courts.\nA five-member larger bench, led by Justice Aminuddin Khan, heard the ICA. The court decided to appoint amici curiae in the case and asked Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Awan to suggest names.\nCivil society activist Afiya Shehrbano Zai had filed a complaint against former chief justice of Pakistan (CJ) Mian Saqib Nisar under Article 209 of the Constitution, dealing with misconduct by superior court judges, over an alleged breach of the judges\u2019 code of conduct.\nHowever, a division bench of the Supreme Court, comprising Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Munib Akhtar, set aside the complaint on June 27, 2023, declaring that judges who retire or resign do not fall within the ambit of Article 209.\nLast month, on January 23, the federal government filed an appeal against the SC ruling. In its appeal, the government requested the court to set aside the verdict in the Afiya Shehrbano Zia case.\nThis development occurred against the backdrop of the resignation of Supreme Court judge Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi, who relinquished his post on January 10 as the SJC was about to conclude its misconduct proceedings against him.\nA day after his resignation, another senior SC judge, Ijazul Ahsan, resigned reportedly ahead of the filing of a similar reference against him.\nThe appeal argued that the SC\u2019s June 27 verdict failed to distinguish the consequences upon resignation of a judge under Article 206, retirement under Article 179, and removal under Article 209.\n\u201cThe judgment has rendered the functionality of the SJC redundant by making Article 209 inapplicable to a judge who has retired or resigned while inquiry proceedings were pending against him and/or a show-cause notice has been issued to him,\u201d it said.\nDuring Monday's hearing, the AGP noted that according to the Afiya Shehrbano case verdict, the Supreme Court can neither issue directives to the SJC nor regulate it.\nRead:\u00a0CJ says judges are undeterred by criticism\n\u201cThe federal government agrees with this part of the verdict that the Supreme Court cannot give directives to the SJC. However, an ongoing SJC inquiry cannot be concluded solely on the basis that the judge has retired or resigned.\n\u201cThis is not just an issue of judges' pensions but rather a matter of public trust, transparency, and accountability in the judiciary,\u201d he said.\nJustice Irfan Saadat Khan observed that there were some judges who might be directly affected by this appeal. \"Whether they should be issued notices or not,\" he questioned. \u201cShouldn\u2019t these judges be given the right to defense?\u201d\nJustice Mussarat Hilali asked whether this recent case is regarding the two SC judges who recently resigned or is it about the future.\nJustice Jamal Khan Mandokhail stated that the present case is not about any specific judge but relates to a principle. \u201cIf the SJC proves misconduct against a judge, what will be the legal consequences? Judges are not above the law, but they have certain constitutional protections.\u201d\nJustice Mandokhail noted that complaints full of baseless allegations are filed against judges. These complaints are followed by a social media campaign in which the same allegations are repeated, he said.\n"

The PTI staged a demonstration outside the ECP headquarters, the JUI blocked road links in the province, and Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) staged sit-ins in various parts of Karachi.\n\nThe JUI leaders and workers barricaded the highway that connects Sindh and Balochistan, claiming that the results of the polls on Feb 8 were rigged to benefit the PPP. They warned that the protests would continue if a fair vote recount was not conducted.\n\nThe JI organised sit-ins at eight significant junctions in Karachi, calling on the ECP to renounce the \u201cfake results\u201d of the general elections.\n\n"

He emphasised that Form 45 was duly checked and signed in both Mazhar\u2019s and Dr Akhtar Malik\u2019s cases.\nThe counsel urged for the dismissal of Dr Akhtar Malik\u2019s petition, who contested from PP-219 under the banner of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N).\nConversely, Muzaffar Hussain, the lawyer for the Election Commission, contended in court that resorting to the High Court was premature as an appeal was already pending with the election commission.\nHe further argued that the high court petition was inadmissible since the Returning Officers (ROs) had adhered to the legal procedure for releasing the results.\n"

            "Text": "Amidst the fervour of the general elections, Karachi, the metropolitan hub, found itself engulfed in chaos as heaps of garbage, overflowing sewerage, and deteriorating roads marred the cityscape, leaving citizens grappling with numerous challenges in commuting.\nDespite the administrative and civic agencies' ostensibly busy schedules during the election period, the reality on the ground painted a starkly different picture. Public transport services remained scant, exacerbating the difficulties faced by residents navigating through the urban sprawl.\nThe disruption in Karachi's routine affairs stemmed from the holiday observed on February 5, coinciding with the Election Day. Local representatives affiliated with various political parties were preoccupied with election campaigns, throwing their weight behind their respective candidates.\n\nRead\u00a0KMC approves 13 resolutions amid turmoil\nThe absence of essential services exacerbated the situation further. The staff of the Sindh Solid Waste Management Board failed to report for duty, resulting in the accumulation of thousands of tons of waste across the city. Similarly, the Water Corporation personnel were conspicuous by their absence, neglecting crucial cleaning tasks in affected areas. Many officers from these agencies were deployed for election duties or chose to extend their holidays, compounding the city's sanitation woes.\nThe breakdown of the sewerage system aggravated the situation, with multiple locations such as Gulshan-e-Iqbal, Korangi, MA Jinnah Road, Bahadurabad, Tariq Road, North Nazimabad, and PIB Colony bearing the brunt of neglect.\nFurthermore, the state of disrepair of city roads added to the citizens' woes. While some roads fall under the jurisdiction of local town administrations, others, including main thoroughfares, are the responsibility of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC).\nAs Karachi grapples with these pressing issues, it underscores the urgent need for concerted efforts from both administrative bodies and elected representatives to address the city's longstanding infrastructure and sanitation challenges, especially during critical periods like elections.\n"

            "Text": "Pakistan\u2019s total debt and liabilities have peaked at Rs81.2 trillion \u2013 a figure that grew at a faster pace of over 27% during the past year, posing emergent management challenges to the newly elected government.\nThe bulletin released by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Monday showed that the country\u2019s total debt and liabilities increased by another Rs17.4 trillion as of the end of December compared to the previous year.\nThe total debt and liabilities now stand at Rs81.2 trillion, including Rs4.6 trillion in liabilities. The government accumulated debt at a rate of 27.2%, averaging Rs48 billion per day since December 2022. This is one of the highest monthly increases in public debt, which includes five months of the caretaker government.\nManaging public debt and the growing cost of interest payments will be one of the paramount challenges for the newly elected government and may require tough decisions. However, a visibly weak coalition government may find such choices hard, particularly when there are ideological differences among potential coalition partners.\nThe Ministry of Finance\u2019s latest Fiscal Policy Statement 2024 also showed a sharp rise in the debt burden during the fiscal year 2022-23, which was the year when the Pakistan Democratic Movement ruled Pakistan.\nThe debt burden of every citizen jumped by 25.2% to Rs271,624 by the end of the previous fiscal year. In absolute terms, every person\u2019s debt burden increased by Rs54,500 within one year, according to the statement.\nThe SBP debt bulletin showed that the country paid Rs4.4 trillion in just interest costs during the first half of this fiscal year, which was Rs1.7 trillion or two-thirds higher than the same period of the last fiscal year.\nThe cost of servicing the debt cannot be diminished until the central bank reduces the key policy rate and the government negotiates with commercial banks for a reduction.\nHowever, the party manifestos of the PPP and the PML-N do not offer any solution to the growing debt burden, except betting on a reduction in interest rates to reduce the annual debt cost. But any such reduction would be offset by the new amount of debt that the government will have to take to remain afloat.\n\nRead\u00a0PDM economic management led to sharp rise in per capita debt\nThe gross public debt, which falls under the direct responsibility of the finance ministry, totalled Rs67.3 trillion by the end of December, according to SBP data. There was also an increase of Rs14.5 trillion or 27.4% in gross public debt in one year.\nIn the previous fiscal year, the federal budget deficit soared to a record Rs6.7 trillion, attributed to the expansionary and politically motivated fiscal policies of the PDM government. The surge in public debt exceeded the budget deficit, indicating the impact of currency devaluation.\nDuring their respective five-year terms, the PML-N added approximately Rs10 trillion, the PPP Rs8 trillion, and the PTI alone accumulated over Rs19 trillion in public debt.\nThe burden will persist until significant reforms are initiated, including reviews of provincial projects, winding up of ministries operating in areas now under provincial control, and addressing debt expenses.\nThe main reasons behind the surge in public debt remain lower-than-targeted tax collection, steep currency devaluation, higher interest rates, increased expenditures, losses by state-owned companies, and mismanagement of debt. Public Sector Enterprises\u2019 debt and liabilities reached Rs3.9 trillion by the end of December, surging by one-fifth and reflecting uncontrolled losses by these enterprises. No government has taken steps to reform state-owned enterprises.\nPolitical appointees fill the boards of these SOEs, including interim Finance Minister Dr Shamshad Akhtar, who sits on the boards of the Pakistan Stock Exchange and Sui Southern Gas Company Limited. The Auditor General Pakistan has framed an audit objection over the unknown amounts of board fees paid to the officers of the finance ministry sitting on 60 such boards.\nThe SBP data showed that the average exchange rate at the end of December was Rs281.9, depreciating by 264.4%, significantly impacting the government\u2019s external debt. The external debt also increased 26% to reach Rs33.6 trillion within a year, with a net increase of Rs7 trillion, primarily due to currency depreciation and foreign currency reserve building through borrowing.\nThe country\u2019s debt from the IMF grew by 30% to reach Rs2.14 trillion by the end of December, according to the SBP.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 13th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

            "Text": "Edible oil manufacturers have called for reducing the duty on Crude Palm Oil (CPO), abolishing section 8B of the Sales Tax Act, and enhancing taxes on commercial importers. The aim is to encourage farmers and others to boost industrial growth in the country.\nThey reported that over 3.2 million metric tonnes of palm oil are imported into the country. The edible oil sector sources raw materials from domestic and global sources, manufacturing 4.5 million metric tonnes of standardised and high-quality Banaspati and cooking oil to meet the national demand.\nWhile speaking to The Express Tribune, they noted that the edible oil sector\u2019s annual turnover exceeds Rs2,400 billion per annum. Manufacturers contribute up to Rs550 billion directly or indirectly to the national exchequer in terms of duties, taxes, and other levies. This sector ranks among the top five revenue spinners of the country, as announced by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and the Ministry of Finance. The oil palm industry is a pillar of the country\u2019s economy and plays a key role in meeting the ever-growing national demand.\nFederation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) President and former chairman of the Pakistan Vanaspati Manufacturers Association (PVMA), Atif Ikram Sheikh stressed the need for more economic and political stability in the country to promote industrialisation and bolster the national economy, benefiting all industrialists and the business community.\nDiscussing numerous issues in the edible oil industry, he reiterated his previous statement that section 8B of the Sales Tax Act 1990 should be abolished. He pointed out that the 10% differential, disfavouring and discouraging industrialists compared to commercial importers, should be eliminated, as it disrupts cash flow.\nHe further suggested that higher tariffs should be imposed on commercial importers than on industries to facilitate local industries. There should be a significant difference in tariffs between manufacturers and commercial importers, with manufacturers receiving lower rates.\nFinally, he called for reducing duty on Crude Palm Oil (CPO) since many refineries are closed due to the high duty on crude palm oil. He noted that in the past, there was less duty on the import of crude palm oil, resulting in better industrial growth.\n\nRead\u00a0Increase local production of edible oil: experts\nSpeaking about oil palm plantations in the country, he mentioned that both the local industry and the government are working on it. Previous attempts were made, and oil palm fruits also grew, but proper yield was not achieved due to certain weather conditions such as excessive rains.\nHe mentioned that the stakeholders have resumed their efforts, expressing hope that fresh fruit would yield abundant harvests in regions like Thatta and Sujawal, where weather conditions favour fruit cultivation.\n\u201cThe government is currently unable to offer direct assistance to the industry. However, it should consider increasing taxes on commercial importers to create more room for the local industry to grow and thrive. Currently, the industry pays an 18% sales tax and 2% income tax, while commercial importers pay the same sales tax and 3% income tax. The government should contemplate imposing a 20% to 22% sales tax and a 5% income tax on commercial importers, thereby discouraging them,\u201d remarked KK Group of Industries CEO Khalid Islam Sheikh.\nHe stressed that if the government formulates favourable and supportive policies, it would incentivise farmers to cultivate more sunflower, canola, and soybean instead of concentrating solely on wheat.\n\u201cApproximately 1.5 to 1.6 million metric tonnes of canola, sunflower, and soybean seeds are imported for oil extraction purposes. By increasing import duties on these seeds, the government can encourage growers to cultivate more of these crops for subsequent harvests and also supply seeds to the industry. Consequently, this policy would reduce the import bill for seeds,\u201d he added.\nWrapping up his remarks, he noted, \u201cDuring a two-month season, we solely rely on domestic cottonseed oil to meet a local demand of 200,000 to 250,000 metric tonnes. However, this oil is predominantly consumed by other industries.\u201d\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 13th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

In this regard, many issues have been resolved to address concerns of investors.\nWhile presiding over an awareness session, organised in collaboration with the PSX, Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) President Kashif Anwar said that companies should be listed at the stock market as it would provide them with a lot of benefits.\nHe voiced hope that liaison between the Lahore Chamber and PSX would prove to be very fruitful.\nAnwar called the bourse an important indicator to examine the health of economy. \u201cCurrently, Pakistan Stock Exchange is performing well,\u201d he said.\nHe added that the purpose of the awareness session was to inform LCCI members about the PSX, encourage them to get their companies listed on it and highlight issues of capital and liquidity.\nSpeaking on the occasion, PSX Director Ahmad Chinoy said that the PSX had taken various initiatives and people were being informed about its benefits through a door-to-door campaign.\n\nRead\u00a0Income taxation of SMEs\nHe stressed that they were spreading awareness about listing at the PSX, investment and other matters. \u201cThis is the best forum for investors. Listed companies make people shareholders at market value.

            "Text": "As political uncertainty deepened in the wake no clear majority for any political party in general elections, the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) plunged on Monday, giving up nearly 1,900 points as investors resorted to panic selling to avoid hefty losses.\nThe market slumped despite announcement of robust financial results and a 26% year-on-year (YoY) surge in remittances that amounted to $2.4 billion in January 2024.\nIn the morning, the trading day commenced on a relatively positive note, with the KSE-100 index touching the intra-day high at 62,634.37 points. However, it started falling rapidly from that point onwards owing to heightened selling pressure, primarily sparked by the growing political noise and the delay in circular debt management plan, where the International Monetary Fund\u2019s (IMF) approval was pending.\nAdditional factors that contributed to the downturn included Bloomberg\u2019s assessment of default risks, Moody\u2019s rating concerns in the face of political instability, policy uncertainty and high leveraged positions at the PSX.\nThe index reached its intra-day low at 60,647.67 points about an hour before close of trading. However, value hunters seized the opportunity to make selective purchases of attractive stocks, which helped to erase some prior losses.\nExploration and production (E&P), power, and cement sectors registered significant declines and the bourse closed the day slightly above the 61,000-point mark.\n\u201cStocks fell sharply on election deadlock and political turmoil after the announcement of general election results,\u201d said Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti.\n\u201cStrong financial results and upbeat data showing $2.4 billion in remittances, which surged 26% YoY in January 2024, supported the index to close above the day\u2019s low,\u201d he said, adding that caution by Bloomberg about default risk, Moody\u2019s rating concerns over political instability, policy uncertainty and high leveraged positions at the PSX played the role of catalysts in bearish close of the stock market.\nAt close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded a plunge of 1,878.43 points, or 2.98%, and settled at 61,065.32.\nTopline Securities, in its commentary, said that \u201ccontinuing last week\u2019s momentum, Pakistan equities commenced business on a negative note.\u201d\n\nRead\u00a0Election fever influences trading at PSX\n\u201cThe aforesaid selling spree can be attributed to further delay in the circular debt management plan where the IMF\u2019s nod is awaited and may likely be received this week, as informed by the Petroleum Division,\u201d it said.\nIn addition, uncertainty on the political front about the formation of a new government dampened market sentiment.\nResultantly, E&P, power and cement sectors contributed negatively to the KSE-100 index as Oil and Gas Development Company, Pakistan Petroleum, Mari Petroleum, Hub Power and Lucky Cement lost a total of 640 points, Topline added.\nArif Habib Limited (AHL), in its report, noted that only three stocks rose while 88 shares fell on the KSE-100 index. Oil and Gas Development Company (-7.5%), Pakistan Petroleum (-7.5%) and Mari Petroleum (-5.59%) were the biggest contributors to the decline.\nIt added that the MSCI would announce results of its February 2024 Index Review later in the day, which could be beneficial for Pakistan concerning passive flows at the end of the month.\nJS Global analyst Mohammed Waqar Iqbal stated that the market sentiment weakened owing to the lack of clarity on the political front. \u201cDelay in reforms, upcoming debt repayments and currency devaluation are the key concerns,\u201d he pointed out.\n\u201cGoing forward, we recommend investors to adopt a buy-on-dips strategy in banking and fertiliser sectors,\u201d the analyst added.\nOverall trading volumes increased to 349.97 million shares against Friday\u2019s tally of 258.1 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs12.7 billion.\nShares of 354 companies were traded. Of these, 35 stocks closed higher, 300 dropped and 19 remained unchanged.\nK-Electric was the volume leader with trading in 50.3 million shares, losing Rs0.44 to close at Rs4.21. It was followed by WordCall Telecom with 34.6 million shares, losing Rs0.07 to close at Rs1.21 and Oil and Gas Development Company with 14.9 million shares, losing Rs10.88 to close at Rs134.20.\nOn a day when many investors opted for heavy selling, foreign investors were net buyers of shares worth Rs808.5 million, according to the National Clearing Company of Pakistan Limited (NCCPL).\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 13th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

            "Text": "The Lahore High Court dismissed petitions challenging the election results of 18 national and provincial constituencies, deeming them inadmissible. Meanwhile, the high courts in Karachi and Peshawar have summoned the Election Commission to respond to similar challenges.\nCourts nationwide are inundated with electoral disputes as numerous candidates contest provisional results in hopes of altering outcomes. Most challengers are independents backed by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).\nMultiple petitions have been heard in high courts in Karachi, Lahore, and Peshawar, contesting discrepancies between Form 47, issued by returning officers (ROs), and the data on Form 45. Form 45 is the primary document containing candidate vote data per polling station, while Form 46 details ballot handling.\nForm 47 provides candidate vote breakdowns based on all Form 45s, offering unofficial results. Form 48 compiles total candidate votes in a constituency, while Form 49\u2014the Gazetted Form\u2014presents the official outcome.\nIn the Lahore High Court, Justice Ali Baqir Najafi presided over the petitions. Following arguments, the court reserved its ruling, later pronouncing the reserved judgment that the petitions were inadmissible and thus dismissed.\nAmong those contested were the electoral victories of prominent figures such as Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leaders Maryam Nawaz, Khawaja Asif, and Aun Chaudhry of Istehkam-e-Pakistan (IPP).\nIn its verdicts, the court directed petitioners to seek redressal from the Election Commission under the Election Act. The Election Commission would then determine whether to compile results with or without the applicant's presence, adhering to the Election Act.\nChallenges in the LHC included constituencies such as NA-117 with Aleem Khan, NA-119 with Maryam Nawaz, NA-126 with Malik Saiful Mulook Khokhar, NA-127 with Atta Tarar, NA-128 with Aun Chaudhry, NA-117 with Khawaja Asif, NA-80 with Shahid Usman, and NA-87 with Malik Shakir Bashir Awan.\nAdditionally, challenges extended to Punjab Assembly constituencies including PP-167 with Irfan Shafi Khokhar, PP-169 with Malik Khalid Khokhar, PP-46 with Faisal Ikram, PP-47 with Chaudhry Muhammad Mansha, and PP-53 with Rana Abdul Sattar.\nIn the Sindh High Court (SHC), a two-member bench, led by Chief Justice Aqeel Ahmad Abbasi, issued notices to the Election Commission and the Federation for February 13 (today) regarding all petitions contesting the results of 40 constituencies of the national and provincial assembly in Karachi.\nDuring proceedings, Barrister Farogh Naseem, representing the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), questioned the maintainability of the petitions. Barrister Salahuddin, counsel for the petitioners, emphasized their desire for returning officers (ROs) to tally Form 45 in the candidates' presence.\nChief Justice Abbasi inquired whether any applications had been submitted to the Election Commission, highlighting the Commission's authority, including the ability to order re-polling in entire constituencies. He cautioned against disrupting the electoral process at this stage.\nBarrister Salahuddin urged the bench to direct the Election Commission to halt notification issuance and consider their requests before making a decision. However, Barrister Naseem opposed such instructions, preferring to allow the Election Commission to carry out its duties.\nThe chief justice clarified to the Election Commission's counsel that the court wasn't issuing orders but warned against any attempt to be cunning. Notices were issued to the Election Commission and the Federation for February 13.\nSimilarly, the Peshawar High Court (PHC) issued notices to the Election Commission and summoned the returning officers of the relevant constituencies for February 15 regarding petitions filed by leaders of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf alleging result tampering.\nA two-member bench, comprising Justice Shakeel Ahmed and Justice Syed Arshad Ali, heard petitions from Sajid Nawaz, Taimoor Salim Jhagra, Mehmood Jan, Kamran Bangash, Arrab Jehandad, Mohammad Asim, Ali Zaman, Malik Shahab, and Syed Farin.\nAlso read: PML-N victories in Punjab challenged in LHC\nPetitioners' lawyers argued that Form 45s favored their clients, showing significant leads, but final results on Form 47s were altered. They sought to halt result issuance.\nJustice Shakeel Ahmed questioned the Election Commission\u2019s lawyer about Form 48 and Form 49 issuance. The lawyer confirmed Form 49 issuance for most Peshawar constituencies. Justice Arshad Ali noted that if Form 49 was issued, the court couldn't suspend it.\nJustice Ali clarified that the court couldn't instruct the Election Commission to recount votes. Shumail Butt, petitioner's counsel, clarified they weren't requesting a recount but urging result announcement per Form 45.\nLawyers of successful candidates argued against case hearings, while petitioners' lawyers requested an injunction on result declaration. Justice Ali highlighted the court's limited jurisdiction in such cases.\nThe court issued notices to the Election Commission and summoned ROs for February 15. During the hearing, a female officer presented a plea, leading to the court adjourning proceedings for simultaneous hearing of all petitions.\nMeanwhile, the Election Commission stopped the issuance of final results of NA-52, NA-53, NA-56, NA-57, NA-60, and NA-69, NA-87, NA-106, NA-126 and NA-127, besides Punjab Assembly\u2019s constituencies of PP-4, PP-6, PP-7, PP-12, PP-15, PP-17, PP-33, PP-43, PP-53, PP-121, PP-126, PP-128, PP-133 and PP-279.\nThe Election Commission also stopped the final result of two Balochistan Assembly constituencies, PB-14 and PB-44 Quetta. The Election Commission also ordered re-polling at 7 polling stations of NA-253 and PB-9 in Balochistan.\nThe Election Commission has formed two benches to hear the election related matters. It took up a complaint against IPP\u2019s Firdous Ashiq Awan regarding slapping an official. The lawyers for Awan sought the copy of the complaint. The bench accepted the plea and adjourned the matter.\nOn PTI-supported candidate Ayaz Amir's request pertaining to the results of NA-58 and NA-59 Chakwal the ECP bench issued notices to the RO concerned. The commission reserved its decision on a petition related to the snatching of the polling material in PS-19 Ghotki.\nThe case of 6 polling stations in NA-43 Tank, where no vote was cast, was also heard. The RO concerned said that the polling could not be held because of the deteriorating law and order situation.\nHe added that some polling staff could not reach the polling stations, while a presiding officer was injured in firing.\nSeparately, a petition was filed in the Supreme Court under Article 184(3) of the Constitution, requesting the apex court to declare the February 8 general elections null and void and order fresh elections under Judicial Supervision.\n"

            "Text": "The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) on Tuesday charted its own course for coalition-building at the Centre and in Punjab, hitching its wagon of independents to the Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen (MWM).\nThe party\u2019s founder and former prime minister Imran Khan also gave the green light to coalition with two parties, namely the MWM in the Centre and Punjab, and the Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa for reserved seats.\nPTI\u2019s Central Information Secretary Raoof Hasan announced the decision at a news conference in Islamabad.\n\u201cWe're heading towards government formation in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, doubling down on efforts for the Centre, and figuring out what to do about the Punjab government,\" Hasan said.\n\"These are his (Imran\u2019s) decisions, and we are going to implement them. We've already started working on them,\" he added.\nIn addition, he revealed that the incarcerated party leader has identified three parties - PML-N, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan, and PPP - but beyond them, he's given the party the nod to reach out to all other political parties.\nImran has instructed the party to sit down with parties and partner with them to form not just a coalition government but a democratic authority.\nMoreover, Amir Dogar was appointed as the party's chief whip in the National Assembly.\nThe party\u2019s central information secretary said that Imran's directive for intra-party elections to be held as soon as possible also landed on the table, adding that he was determined to hold it as he was responsible for it.\n\u201cAs per our estimates, around 180 seats were the PTI\u2019s in the NA but whatever has come after reducing them is before you. The first precondition according to him (Imran) is that a government be allowed to form in line with the mandate the nation has given and be allowed to continue because only this would make it possible to increase the confidence and investment of overseas Pakistanis.\u201d\nThe spokesperson asserted that approximately 65 seats had been \"absconded\" from the party, urging a swift restitution.\nRead Seen from abroad, Pakistan elections disappoint, add to instability\nImran emphasised a cautionary note for the \u201ccurrent power players\u201d, urging them to reflect on their actions, saying that the rightful winners of the election deserve the opportunity to assume governance and should be accorded that right.\nMeanwhile, in a media interaction at Adiala Jail, Imran Khan said that the PTI-backed candidates secured over 90 seats in the National Assembly, surpassing the PML-N with 75 seats.\nImran firmly ruled out the possibility of forming a coalition government with the PML-N, the PPP, and the MQM-P.\nHe accused the leaders of those parties of being \"the biggest money launderers\", directing his party leaders to engage in talks with other parties, excluding the three.\nImran announced that the PTI would challenge the election results.\n\"We will also approach the Supreme Court against the poll results,\" he added.\nThe former premier claimed to have gauged PTI's victory when PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif postponed his news conference, asserting that both Nawaz and his daughter, Maryam Nawaz, had suffered defeats in the elections.\nAddressing the question of the prime ministerial post, Imran clarified that no decision had been reached, and discussions would be undertaken.\nPTI demands Imran's release\nMeanwhile, the PTI also demanded that the public mandate must be respected as it was pre-requisite for survival and strength of the state and Imran should be released instantly as he was the only leader who could pull the country out of the prevailing quagmire of problems.\nThe PTI spokesperson made it clear that the elements, who were hell-bent on desecration and snatching the mandate of the people to impose the criminals, were enemies of the country because such attempts would further widen the fissure between the state and the people, which would further weaken the state.\nHe hinted that there was a possibility of talks with everyone to bring political and economic stability in the country provided the stolen mandate was returned to the real representatives and the rightful people of the country.\nHe stated that the people, especially the young generation, under the leadership of the PTI founding chairman, gave the PTI the right to represent them in an unequivocal manner, and ignoring it would be tantamount to enmity with the county.\nHe went on to say that the nation had given a clear and unwavering expression of Imran Khan's leadership with their power of votes and only he had the ability to bring Pakistan out of the current untold crises.\n"

            "Text": "In a political plot twist, PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday emerged as a leading contender to reclaim the reins of power, with his former coalition comrades \u2013 PPP, MQM, PML-Q, BAP, and IPP \u2013 once again rallying behind him.\nThe development came as his party chief, Nawaz Sharif, took a strategic backseat, nominating Shehbaz for the prime ministerial position and his daughter Maryam for the role of chief minister of Punjab.\nA powerhouse gathering at PML-Q chief Chaudhry Shujaat's Islamabad residence saw the heads of political parties, including Shehbaz Sharif, Asif Ali Zardari, Khalid Maqbool Saddique, Chaudhry Shujaat, and Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani (representing BAP), along with IPP President Aleem Khan, uniting for a joint press conference.\nThey declared unequivocal support for Shehbaz and pledged to tackle the country's issues jointly as a coalition government.\nWhile the power-sharing formula remained under wraps, the undertones of the press conference hinted at Asif Ali Zardari's prospects for the next presidency of the country.\nPPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, in an earlier announcement supporting the PML-N-led coalition, advocated for Zardari as the next president for the nation's betterment. The former foreign minister declared the party\u2019s intent to abstain from government portfolios, though it seemed this position would be limited to ministries and advisories.\nHowever, the conspicuous absence of three key players\u2014Nawaz Sharif, Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, and Maulana Fazlur Rehman\u2014from the press spectacle raised eyebrows. Nawaz Sharif, making a grand return after a four-year self-imposed exile, aimed for a record fourth term as prime minister, intending to steer Pakistan out of crises, per his party's narrative.\nA notable of absence of Bilawal, who held a separate press conference in Islamabad following his party's CEC meeting, also did not go without notice. Similarly, the JUI-F chief, who led the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) alliance that ousted the PTI government, was also missing.\nPML-N sources whisper that Nawaz Sharif's decision to step back from the PM race wasn't entirely voluntary, hinting at unspecified external factors that influenced his choice.\nThe emergence of PDM 2.0, with Shehbaz Sharif at its forefront, did not catch seasoned political observers off guard. The political grapevine had long predicted the scenario well before the elections.\nIt is an open secret that Shehbaz Sharif's cosy rapport with the current establishment positioned him as the anticipated PM successor, irrespective of voting patterns.\nRead more: PPP to support PML-N prime minister candidate, says Bilawal\nZardari holds out olive branch to PTI\nFormer president Asif Ali Zardari opened the press conference, announcing the joint decision of the parties to form a government to alleviate the crises facing Pakistan.\nAcknowledging the challenges of reconciliation, Zardari stressed the need to involve even PTI in crafting a shared economic agenda for the country.\nIn the same breath, he expressed the parties\u2019 support for Shehbaz Sharif in his endeavours for public service\nHe stated that the remarks made during the elections were intended for that specific stage, and now that the election phase is over, they will collaborate. He added that there were no ideological differences between them.\nMeanwhile, MQM convener Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui stated that his party\u2019s sole priority was Pakistan, and through constitutional cooperation, it aims to strengthen democracy.\nHe mentioned that they had supported Shehbaz Sharif in the past and pledged to continue supporting him in the future.\nAs for his part, Chairman Senator Sadiq Sanjrani, representing BAP, conveyed that his party president Khalid Magsi couldn't be present himself and instead asked him to attend. He, too, expressed support for Shehbaz.\nIPP President Aleem and PML-Q President Chaudhary Shujaat also announced their endorsement of Shehbaz.\nShehbaz Sharif echoed Zardari's perspective of moving forward and putting electoral differences aside, adding that the parliament would be formed soon, and their primary focus was on the challenges that lie ahead.\nHe highlighted that addressing economic stability, reducing debt, managing inflation, and fostering growth are among the critical challenges that they are determined to address on a war footing.\nThe former premier expressed that the purpose of the gathering was to declare acceptance of the split mandate. He extended gratitude to all the party leaders for their support.\nLive: Joint News Conference https://t.co/Iwng6Nnfc3\nReferring to the press conference held earlier in the day, he mentioned that if PTI-backed independent candidates, whom his party is actively courting to strengthen its position, have a majority in the house, they should proceed to form the government.\nIn such a scenario, Shehbaz assured that they would gladly and willingly take their place on the opposition benches and fulfil their role.\nRegarding a question about Maulana Fazlur Rehman\u2019s absence, with whom the PML-N leadership had not yet held their first post-election meeting, he explained that Maulana was occupied with other engagements.\nResponding to a question about his economic plan, given the historic inflation during his outgoing term and a rudderless approach to critical issues, Shehbaz Sharif proudly stated that their most significant achievement was steering the country away from bankruptcy.\nIn response to another question concerning PPP and their participation in the coalition government, the PML-N president mentioned the establishment of committees tasked with determining the rules of engagement.\nRegarding the allocation of power, he clarified that decisions on who receives what would be made through consensus.\nHe declared Maryam Nawaz as the party's choice for the coveted slot of CM Punjab. When asked if Zardari would be the next president, Shehbaz, in a lighter vein, remarked, \"We won't disappoint you.\"\nShehbaz extended another invitation to all for a charter for the economy and urged the promotion of a charter of democracy. He emphasised the need for everyone to set aside their differences for the betterment of the country.\nEarlier today, Shehbaz conducted a press conference in which he commended the chief election commissioner, the armed forces, and Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa along with his bench for their handling of the allegedly 'tainted' elections on February 8.\nThroughout his address, he reiterated PTI's accusations of \"35 punctures\" during the 2013 elections to challenge its credibility in claiming rigging in the 2024 elections.\nHe asserted that the 2018 elections were extensively rigged and despite their grievances, the party refrained from organising long marches or rallies and avoided causing damage to public or private property.\nHowever, in making this claim, Shehbaz seemed to overlook the protest rally they organised against the election results in Islamabad and the numerous rallies and marches conducted by his party and its coalition partners throughout PTI's four-year tenure.\nHe recalled that all elections were rife with allegations of rigging, and this occurrence was not exclusive to the recent elections.\nHe questioned the possibility of rigging in this election by pointing out the losses of PML-N stalwarts from Faisalabad, Gujranwala, and Abbottabad.\nHowever, he expressed regret over the media, which, on the first night of the elections, he started shaping an impression in favour of independent candidates and against political parties despite only receiving 10 per cent of the results.\nHe said that they accept and respect the majority of independent candidates and invite them to make their own government by showing the majority, and if they don\u2019t have the numbers then PML-N is the biggest party given that it has the support of other political parties that will form its government.\nWhen asked about why his party was poaching PTI-backed candidates and engaging in horse trading, he said what is anyone, if independent candidates out of their free will join their party.\nHe had a long opening speech in the presser mostly against Imran Khan and his government. He termed Imran Khan a narcissist and fascist for not sitting with them even on the most important national issues.\nDespite praising security agencies and ECP for holding free and fair elections, he did say that he heard stories that in K-P non-state actors wielding guns had taken over to ensure the victory of one party (PTI).\nShehbaz announced that they have a simple majority in Punjab while in the centre they have consolidated their number to 80.\nHe also dodged a question regarding a demand for a judicial commission to probe rigging to settle these allegations once and for all.\nWhen asked if PML-N losing to PTI was a rejection of its narrative, he in a cryptic manner blamed rigging for it, saying that PML-N\u2019s narrative lost its traction \u201cwhen we were deprived of our seats in 2018\u201d.\n"

            "Text": "The Supreme Court is expected to conclude its proceedings on a presidential reference seeking a review of the SC\u2019s 1979 verdict in the Zulfikar Ali Bhutto case by next Monday.\n\nA nine-member larger bench, led by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJ) Qazi Faez Isa, resumed hearing the reference on Wednesday and deliberated on various aspects of the Bhutto case for over six hours.\n\nThe Lahore High Court (LHC) had sentenced former prime minister Bhutto to death on March 18, 1978, for ordering the assassination of Ahmed Reza Kasuri, one of the founding members of the PPP.\nThe Supreme Court, with a majority vote of 4 to 3, upheld the LHC verdict on February 6, 1979. The PPP founder was executed on April 4 of the same year.\n\nDuring the PPP\u2019s last rule between 2008 and 2013, former president Asif Ali Zardari sent the reference to the apex court, requesting an opinion after analyzing the SC\u2019s and the LHC judgments in the ZAB case based on the fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution.\n\nDuring Wednesday's proceedings, one of the court\u2019s amici, former judge Manzoor Ahmed Malik, informed the court that the approver in the case, Masood Mahmood, had testified that Bhutto ordered him to murder Kasuri.\n\n\u201cThe statement of the second witness was ignored because it contradicted the claim made by the approver, Masood Mahmood,\u201d he said.\n\nCJ Isa asked for the pardon notification for the approver.\n\n\u201cMahmood also belongs to Kasur district. Did the person who ordered the murder not know that Masood and Ahmed Raza Kasuri both hail from the same area? Did the Supreme Court and the High Court assess this aspect?\u201d\n\nThe judge noted that people from the same area often develop differences and even enmity.\n\n\u201cHave investigations been conducted into this aspect to determine if someone else gave the order for Kasuri\u2019s murder and blamed the former prime minister for it? Why did the witness\u2019s conscience awaken after three years?\" he questioned.\n\nThe court ordered Attorney-General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Awan to provide details about relocating the approver to a foreign country.\n\nThe counsel for Bhutto\u2019s grandchildren, Fatima Bhutto and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Junior, noted that Justice Nasim Hasan Shah, one of the SC judges who had convicted Bhutto, later admitted that the judiciary was helpless during the martial law.\n\n\"This is a general statement. Will it apply to all of his decisions?\u201d Justice Yahya Afridi asked.\n\nJustice Sardar Tariq Masood asked, \"Will we reopen all cases from the martial law era?\" Many cases, including the Wali Khan case, have reached the Supreme Court since. If we open the floodgates once, there will be an inundation of cases,\u201d he said.\n\nThe CJ remarked that Justice Nasim Hasan Shah's statement is not related to the Bhutto case verdict. The court's duty is only to answer the questions raised in the presidential reference, he said.\n\nJustice Mansoor Ali Shah said there is a need to first clarify which legal question is raised in the reference, adding that the Supreme Court cannot make amendments to the presidential reference.\n\n\u201cThe legal question should be whether there was bias in the judges. Our response will then be based on that. Another legal question could be whether there was pressure on judges during the trial.\n\n\u201cThe court does not feel ashamed to rectify its mistake, but please provide the procedure. It is still not clear what legal question has been raised in the reference,\u201d he said.\n\nThe CJ remarked that some new questions have arisen during the hearing. \u201cCould the investigation be reopened? Could the LHC directly hear the trial? These are the questions that need to be examined.\u201d\nWhen court assistant Aitzaz Ahsan cited institutional bias as the reason, Justice Yahya Afridi responded that three judges of the Supreme Court had dissented from the decision to hang Bhutto, so the argument of institutional bias was not correct.\n\nJustice Jamal Khan Mandokhail added that two judges of the LHC had granted bail to Bhutto, and the judge who was removed by Bhutto and was reinstated by General Ziaul Haq had opposed Bhutto's hanging.\n\n"

            "Text": "PTI founder and deposed prime minister Imran Khan has approached the Islamabad High Court(IHC) against the sentences handed down to him in the cipher case and Toshakhana (gift repository) reference, seeking their suspension and his release on bail.\n\nSimilarly, his wife Bushra Bibi has filed a plea with the IHC against the punishment she received in the National Accountability Bureau\u2019s (NAB) Toshakhana reference. IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb have asked the parties to respond by Thursday (today).\n\nThe court further directed the petitioners\u2019 lawyers to present their arguments on the maintainability of the pleas for the suspension of the sentences. However, the question remains whether the sentences can be suspended.\n\nEarlier, the IHC had suspended Imran\u2019s three-year sentence, handed down by an additional district and sessions judge in a case related to non-disclosure of the gifts he had received during his term as the prime minister in his statements of assets and liability, and granted him bail.\n\nThen the PTI's lawyers had presented arguments on the trial court's decision as well as on the duration of the sentence. They had contended that the suspension of the three-year sentence until the final decision on the central appeal was necessary to fulfill the requirements of justice.\n\nThey had added that the suspension of the sentence was necessary because the period of three years would be considered a short-term punishment.\n\nIn response, the lawyer representing the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had argued that it was not a short-term punishment but the maximum one according to the law. The IHC then had issued an order to suspend the punishment.\n\nHowever, Imran was sentenced to 10 years in jail in the cipher case. The former premier and his wife Bushra Bibi were sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment in the Toshakhana reference. According to the NAB law, a 14-year jail term is the maximum sentence upon conviction.\n\nLegal experts believe that even 10 years of imprisonment in the cipher case cannot be considered a short-term punishment. Therefore, they say, the lawyers representing Imran and his wife have to present a strong case for the maintainability of various applications. They add that the legal issues in the decisions along with the judicial opinions should also be presented before the court.\n\nThe IHC CJ had received a plea against the appointment of a special court judge under the Official Secrets Act and challenging the jail trial but rejected it.\n\nThen, an IHC bench headed by Justice Aurangzeb annulled the proceedings of the special court on an intra-court appeal, and the matter was started again with the indictment.\n\nLater, Justice Aurangzeb once again declared the proceedings null and void after the statements of some witnesses were recorded during the jail trial.\n\nThe legal experts say that both these judges have already heard the cipher case so it has to be seen how the lawyers of the petitioners somehow acquire relief for their clients.\n\nApparently, there is no possibility of the suspension of punishment during Thursday\u2019s hearing because the court has sought replies from the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and NAB.\n\nIf for any reason NAB and the FIA seek more time for preparation, then the matter of suspension of the sentences will be postponed till the next hearing.\n\nFormer Islamabad advocate general Jahangir Jadoon explained that Section 426 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) was related to the suspension of the sentence. He added that suspension of Imran\u2019s sentence would depend on various factors.\n\nJadoon elaborated that if the appeal was delayed because of the prosecution, then the sentences could be suspended. He added that if the prosecution was not using delaying tactics in the appeal and the sentence was less than six months, the chances of its suspension would be less.\n\n"

The two-member bench, headed by Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, heard the pre-arrest bail petitions filed by the accused. \nDuring the proceedings, a prosecutor argued that the accused not only attacked Sanaullah's house, but also attacked police vehicles and personnel on May 9th 2023. He requested the court dismiss the interim bail granted to the accused, as strong evidence was available against them. \nHowever, the defence counsel submitted that the case was registered on May 9th, but the accused were nominated on May 12th. He further submitted that police did not have any evidence against his clients and pleaded with the court to confirm their interim bail. He also mentioned that the trial court had dismissed pre-arrest bail of his clients on February 20th.\n"

However, after failing to elicit a response from the officers of the department concerned, the mayor has ordered patchwork on these roads this week from his own funds.\nThe mayor had sought probe over three specific roads. One of these roads is a dual carriageway - Naseem Nagar Road in Qasimabad - with flourishing markets on its either sides. The other two roads connect thickly populated residential areas with a main road which connects Hyderabad with Jamshoro district. These roads became damaged some months after completion of the civil works.\nOn Mayor's prodding, a week later Deputy Commissioner Tariq Qureshi also asked the department's executive engineer (XEn) in Hyderabad to start an inquiry. Subsequently, Director General Monitoring Works and Services Department on December 4, 2023, asked the XEn for the inquiry on an urgent basis, giving reference of the mayor's correspondence.\n\nRead Road network awaits reconstruction\nHe asked the XEn to provide details like PC-I, administrative approval, work orders, technical sanctions, released bills and incumbency of the officers during whose stints those projects were executed. \"The requisite documents with attested photocopies were required by this office but you failed to submit the same,\" the DG wrote in another correspondence over two months later on February 9.\nOn February 21, the DC once again raised the same issue in writing with the XEn. \"The XEn has completely ignored all directions to conduct inquiry over the poor construction works on these roads,\" the mayor said in a statement on Wednesday.\nIn 2022, a wide green belt on Naseem Nagar road was razed so that the dual carriageway could be widened. With the belt, the road with dozens of commercial plazas and tens of housing schemes became shorn of its entire green cover. The mayor also started a tree plantation drive on this road on February 26.\n"

The CM also offered fateha at the Mazars of Begum Nusrat Bhutto, Shaheed Murtaza Bhutto and Shaheed Shahnawaz Bhutto.\nShah flew to Sehwan from Larkana where he visited his ancestral graveyard and offered fateha at the mazaars of his parents and the shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar.\nTalking to the media at the shrine of Qalandar, he said the people are being burdened with incessant inflation.

Under SIFC\u2019s initiative, investors are offered access to vast fertile land totalling 26 million hectares, provided at no cost. Investors retain possession as long as production continues, with only 30% of profits shared with the provincial government, he remarked.\nThe KCCI president highlighted Karachi\u2019s role as an economic hub and expressed gratitude to the UK-Pakistan Trade Mission and the International Trade Centre (ITC) for organising the inward trade mission. Sheikh reiterated the commitment to facilitating productive business interactions between UK and Pakistani businesses.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 29th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

            "Text": "As provinces refuse to bear the cost of subsidised liquefied natural gas (LNG) supply to two fertiliser plants, the caretaker government has put a burden of Rs17 billion on domestic consumers. The provinces want full recovery of LNG cost from the farmers.\nThe Petroleum Division was of the view that the continuation of re-gasified LNG supply at Rs1,239 per million British thermal units (mmbtu) from January to March 2024 involved estimated financial implication of Rs17 billion in terms of tariff differential with the notified RLNG price, which was $13 per mmbtu.\nThe decision made by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) on November 23, 2023 had been conveyed to the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra), which said that as per the existing guidelines, they could only allow the recovery of RLNG volumes diverted to the domestic sector. Therefore, the guidelines for recovery of RLNG differential on account of supply at Rs1,239 per mmbtu may be reviewed.\nThe Petroleum Division proposed in a recent meeting of the ECC that the supply of RLNG to Fatima Fertiliser and Agritech Ltd be continued at Rs1,239 per mmbtu from January to March 2024 and the price differential be treated as RLNG diversion to the domestic sector for recovery through Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited\u2019s (SNGPL) revenue requirement or through monthly RLNG pricing.\nThe ECC approved the proposal and an amount of Rs17 billion would be recovered from the domestic consumers.\nThe Petroleum Division informed policymakers that based on the directives of a meeting chaired by the prime minister and the apex committee of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), it had estimated the cost of urea production with the help of RLNG from January to March 2024 along with dispatches.\n\nRead\u00a0IHC takes stern action against violation LNG case\nTo finalise a mechanism for contribution by the provinces, a meeting, chaired by the petroleum secretary, was held with representatives of provinces on December 29, 2023.\nHowever, none of the provinces agreed to contribute to the cost differential. Rather, they emphasised that RLNG may be supplied to both urea plants at full cost and the feriliser produced may accordingly be sold at a price that could recover the entire cost.\nThe Petroleum Division recalled that the ECC, in its meeting held on November 23, 2023, while considering a summary, had approved the continuation of RLNG supply to both the fertiliser plants, which were connected to the SNGPL network, from November 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 at a rate of Rs1,239 per mmbtu determined by Ogra.\nThe meeting was told that the price differential between Ogra\u2019s notified price for RLNG and Rs1,239 per mmbtu would be included in the revenue requirement of SNGPL.\nIn addition, the prime minister chaired a meeting on December 11, 2023 to discuss matters pertaining to fertiliser production and supply. In the huddle, the chief secretaries of provincial governments were directed to contribute to the subsidy as per their share in gas dispatches to urea manufacturers from January to March 2024.\nIt was informed that the federal government contributed a subsidy of around Rs20 billion on RLNG supply to fertiliser plants. \u201cProvinces must contribute by sharing the burden of subsidy, as agriculture is a provincial subject.\u201d\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 29th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

            "Text": "The business community, distraught by the increasing cost of inputs, has appealed to the government to stop the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) from taking anti-people and anti-business decisions as businesses are on the verge of collapse, putting livelihoods of millions of people at risk.\nNow, there is no need to go on strike to protest the surging energy tariffs, because industries will eventually close down, which will also deal a blow to the country\u2019s exports, it warned.\nKarachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) President Iftikhar Ahmed Sheikh denounced Nepra\u2019s decision that allowed a tariff hike of Rs7.0562 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) as fuel charges adjustment for January 2024.\nIn a statement, he emphasised that it was highly unfair to allow an additional tariff of Rs7.0562 per kWh to be charged from all categories of consumers with the excuse of variation in fuel charges.\n\u201cAll the citizens and members of business community have already paid their bills for January 2024, therefore, Nepra has advised to collect the variation in fuel charges for January 2024 under a separate head in the bills of March 2024, which will not only affect the budget of almost all households but also terribly increase the cost for all types of manufacturing units,\u201d he said.\nSheikh pointed out that the circular debt had continued to surge and crossed Rs5.73 trillion only because efforts were hardly being made to control theft and line losses. \u201cThey are trying to avert further increase in circular debt by raising tariffs, which is an unwise move as the hefty bills will worsen the situation by encouraging many to steal electricity.\u201d\n\nRead\u00a0NEPRA orders inquiry into power rate hike demand\nTalking to The Express Tribune, Hyderabad Chamber of Small Traders and Small Industry President Muhammad Farooq Shaikhani said, \u201cThe intricate economic web woven by loans and the government\u2019s inclination towards seeking new loans for debt settlement is not a product of independent decision-making, rather it reflects the current state of affairs in Pakistan.\u201d\nFulminating against Nepra for a drastic increase in electricity tariff, he dubbed the authority a manipulated entity that burdened both traders and the public with billions of rupees in the name of fuel charges adjustment. Shaikhani pointed out that during winter, electricity consumption had already been reduced to half, with a mere 12,000 megawatts being utilised from the grid along with 10 to 12 hours of load-shedding.\nHe asked for urgently reviewing the contracts signed with independent power producers (IPPs) with a view to rescuing the national economy in the larger interest of the country.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 29th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

            "Text": "Pakistan\u2019s ambitious renewable energy plans need to be coupled with close attention to addressing the system\u2019s constraints to reduce the volume of unserved energy on the one hand and accommodate the intermittency of renewable energy on the other.\nThis was the consensus reached at a webinar titled \u201cEmerging trends in Pakistan\u2019s renewable energy sector: Charting the agenda for 2030 and beyond,\u201d organised by the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI).\nHighlighting the current challenges faced by the power sector and the milestones needed to achieve a stable and sustainable energy ecosystem, speakers underscored that the addition of renewable energy is non-negotiable in today\u2019s climate. However, this should be coupled with the modernisation of the grid.\nK-Electric\u2019s Chief Marketing and Communications Officer, Sadia Dada shared an overview of KE\u2019s Investment Plan, which had already been submitted to the regulator. She outlined the company\u2019s plans to expand the utility\u2019s transmission and distribution capacity, preparing it to accommodate approximately 1200 MW of renewable energy by FY2030 as envisioned under the utility\u2019s Power Acquisition Programme (PAP). She maintained that these programmes are being developed in alignment with national targets under the Indicative Generation Capacity Expansion Plan (IGCEP) and entail a long-term, optimal cost strategy plan for the expansive growth of power generation within a set of prevailing policies and technical and socio-economic considerations.\n\u201cIn the next seven years, we aim to reduce our reliance on imported fuels to 51% while increasing our dependence on green sources to 49%. We must look at our approach in a holistic manner because our priority is to maintain energy security for our customers. We\u2019ve seen that climate change is impacting countries which were previously relying heavily on renewable energy, making it difficult to maintain grid stability,\u201d she said. \u201cCities like Karachi also present a unique case study, where we see power demands peaking twice in a 24-hour period, which requires a case-specific approach.\u201d\nEnergy Consultant Dr Irfan Ahmed believes that renewable energy projects are front-loaded and require upfront heavy investments. He noted that Pakistan needed to be \u2018self-reliant\u2019 and would eventually have to opt for local manufacturing due to foreign exchange constraints. He maintained that Pakistan\u2019s electrical network is \u2018bumpy,\u2019 leading to frequent damage to electrical plants and revenue loss. Therefore, it is of paramount importance that non-operational plants are repaired locally and spare parts are produced for sustainable operations to avoid ongoing problems.\n\nRead\u00a0Call for holistic renewable energy transition\nDr Khalid Waleed, an SDPI Research Fellow, said that the country\u2019s transition to renewable energy should be gradual and orderly to prevent creating more problems for the energy ecosystem. He further emphasised the need to create a conducive environment and explore distribution generation models to effectively bridge the gap between load and generation centres. This requires national dialogues to shore up investor confidence in transmission and distribution projects, he added.\nRenewable Energy Expert Fozan Waheed discussed how sudden curtailments in wind power projects jeopardise the grid and make it prone to blackouts. Citing international examples, he mentioned that China invests up to $75 billion in their grid to ensure long-term energy security. He further stated that the sustainability and success of Pakistan\u2019s energy sector rely on learning from the best practices of leaders in the energy space and preparing a forward-looking strategy that addresses the country\u2019s specific needs.\nAmreli Steels Limited, Head of Energy & Sustainability, Abubakar Ismail remarked that more industries are embracing solar power with increasing interest in wind and biomass energy sources. However, current economic conditions pose significant challenges to investment across all sectors, including renewable energy. He added that fostering growth and development in the renewable energy sector requires economic and political stability. Open access policies and the implementation of the Competitive Trading Bilateral Contract Market (CTBCM) are crucial steps towards enhancing energy adoption in Pakistan, promoting competition, efficiency, and transparency in the energy market, ultimately benefiting consumers and producers.\nThe session concluded with a vote of thanks to all participants by Ubaidur Rehman Zia, the moderator of the session and Senior Research Associate & Head of the Energy Unit at SDPI.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 29th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

We will protest alongside you.\u201d\n\nFazl was among the newly elected members to take oath on Thursday during the inaugural session of the 16th National Assembly.\n\nHe said he considered parliament \u201cmore representative of establishment than the people\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe will sit in the opposition. We will not become part of the voting process for president, National Assembly speaker and prime minister,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking sarcastically, he said, \u201cIt is not an assembly but something else.\u201d\n\nHe said the JUI-F\u2019s policy dictated that they would not vote for anyone in the house, adding that the party would not participate in further proceedings of parliament.\n\nEarlier, the JUI-F chief warned of a potential \u201csystem collapse\u201d in the country, citing \u201cexcessive interference from the powers that be\u201d as the primary cause.\n\nMeanwhile, the ANP also decided to refrain from participating in the parliamentary elections.\n\n\nIn a statement on Thursday, ANP leader Asfandary Wali Khan maintained that their members would refrain from participating in the election process of any assembly as well as the Senate.\n\nHe emphasised his party\u2019s commitment to civilian supremacy, democracy, and strengthening of parliament in the country.\nHe expressed concern about the \u201cunprecedented use of money in the recent elections\u201d, stating that the ANP was not inclined to cast votes in the provincial assemblies and the Senate under the current circumstances.\n\nAsfandyar said the ANP was offered positions by the current majority parties, but they did not engage in politics focused on power and seats.\n\nHe reiterated the ANP's principled stance, advocating for the retrieval of the mandate from \u201cmandate thieves\u201d and its rightful allocation to \u201ctrue representatives\u201d.\n\nAsfandyar stated that further decisions regarding their role in parliament would be made through mutual consultation later.\nSeparately, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) on Thursday agreed to support the coalition government in electing the National Assembly speaker and deputy speaker, as well as the prime minister.\n\nThe MQM-P was expected to hold a final round of negotiations with the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) before taking its decision about joining the coalition government, according to party sources.\n\nAccording to sources, the PML-N is ready to give only one ministry to the MQM-P while it is demanding four ministries. They said the MQM-P also wanted to allow Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori to continue on the post, otherwise, according to some sources, the party would prefer to sit on the opposition benches.\n\nHowever, MQM-P\u2019s Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui said that the party had affirmed its support in exchange for the National Finance Commission Award to be fairly distributed in \u201cevery district and to every local body\u201d.\n\nThe development came during a meeting between the MQM-P leaders and members of a delegation, including Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, Aleem Khan, Sadiq Sanjrani, Yusuf Raza Gillani, Khursheed Shah and Khalid Magsi.\n\nSpeaking to the media outside the Parliament House, Sadiq said that his party, PPP, Istehkam-e-Pakistan Party and Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid met with MQM-P\u2019s Siddiqui.\n\n\u201cWe asked them for their vote for [the election of] NA speaker and deputy speaker, the prime minister and the president,\u201d he said.\n\nSadiq said that the MQM-P had assured the delegation of casting its vote in their favour for the NA speaker and deputy speaker, and the prime minister.\n\n\u201cWe will come to them again for the vote for [the election of] the president and the Senate chairman,\u201d he said.\nSadiq said that the PML-N would work on the MQM-P\u2019s demand for a constitutional amendment regarding the distribution of the NFC Award.\n\nMeanwhile, addressing media persons, Siddiqui said that they made this request \u201ckeeping in view the people\u2019s rights in the Constitution\u201d and they wanted \u201ca place for those rights in the Constitution\u201d.\n\n\u201cDemocracy is the only way forward in Pakistan,\u201d Siddiqui added, emphasising that the people should participate for democracy to take root in the country.\n\n\u201cThe party's focus is not on governorship or ministries, but on delivering benefits of democracy.\u201d\nSiddiqui clarified that decisions regarding cabinet positions had been finalised, but the party had not sought any specific roles.\n\nIn various media interviews, MQM-P Senior Deputy Convener Dr Farooq Sattar and newly elected National Assembly member (MNA) Mustafa Kamal both expressed their optimism about the ongoing coalition talks with the PML-N, hoping to reach consensus on all issues very soon.\n\n\u201cKamran Tessori is the MQM\u2019s choice for the governor\u2019s post,\u201d Sattar told a private TV channel in an interview.\nRegarding the ongoing discussions with the PML-N on forming the coalition, he expressed his optimism about reaching a consensus soon.\n\nDespite the challenges in joining the government, Sattar affirmed the MQM-P's dedication to political stability and national progress, pledging cooperation wherever necessary. He highlighted the PML-N's recognition of the MQM's pivotal role in parliamentary politics and its status as an important ally.\n\nKamal said, \u201cThe cabinet will come after that [the oath-taking by the elected members].\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cThe procedure is being processed and both the parties are moving in the right direction. There is no deadlock.\u201d\n\nHowever, sources maintained that the MQM-P was ready to cast its vote in the election of National Assembly speaker and prime minister.

            "Text": "Amid rigging allegations and uncertainty surrounding the political dispensation, the process of formation of the new federal government kicked off on Thursday when 302 out of the 336 newly elected lawmakers were sworn in at the inaugural session of the 16th National Assembly.\n\nThe maiden session witnessed the return of two major players of the political chessboard in parliament: PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif -- who re-entered the assembly hall after a gap of seven years -- and PTI lawmakers entering the NA under the banner of the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) after they had abandoned the lower house by resigning en masse in April 2022.\n\nThough PTI founding chairman and former premier Imran Khan is in jail, his party\u2019s lawmakers winning in the general elections made his presence felt by chanting slogans in his favour and wearing his lookalike face masks.\n\nAmid the ruckus, an Imran-lookalike mask was also thrown at Nawaz, when he was signing on the Roll of Members after being sworn in.\n\nPerhaps, the SIC lawmakers took the inspiration from Netflix\u2019s blockbuster Spanish crime series \u2018Money Heist\u2019, which featured lead characters wearing face masks designed by Spanish artist Salvador Dali.\n\nThe only other uncanny resemblance and uniqueness between Dali and Imran is that they are unapologetically themselves, even when they are wrong.\n\nAlthough, the maiden session was marred by ruckus and slogans in favour of Imran and Nawaz, outgoing NA Speaker Raja Pervez Ashraf announced that the elections for his successor and their deputy would take place on Friday (today).\n\nPML-N\u2019s Sardar Ayaz Sadiq and PTI-backed Amir Dogar submitted their nomination papers for the post of the speaker to the NA Secretariat.\n\nSimilarly, PPP\u2019s Syed Ghulam Mustafa Shah and PTI-SIC\u2019s Junaid Akbar submitted their papers for the post of the deputy speaker to the secretariat.\n\nLater, the assembly secretariat announced that the election for the slot of prime minister will take place on March 3 (Sunday), ending the guessing game as to when the country would have a new premier.\n\nEarlier, it was expected that the election for the post of the PM might take place coming Monday.\n\nSoon after the election, the premier will go to the Presidency to take oath of his office and then take charge of the PM Office.\n\nIronically, it seemed the PTI-SIC lawmakers started off the new parliamentary year where they had left it in April 2022: the slogan of \u201cChor (thieves), Corrupt and Ghaddar (traitors)\u201d.\n\nThe PTI lawmakers had resigned en masse in April 2022 after Imran was ousted from the post of the premier through a vote of no confidence and minutes before PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif replaced him.\n\nOnce again, as the irony would have it, Shehbaz is set to become the next premier.\n\nFrom the start till the end, the assembly hall kept echoing with slogans of \u201cDekho Dekho Kaun Aaya, Sher Aaya Sher Aaya (look who has come, the tiger has come)\u201d and \u201cKaun Bachaye Ga Pakistan, Imran Khan Imran Khan (who will save Pakistan, Imran Khan Imran Khan)\u201d.\n\nAt times, it was difficult to distinguish who was responding to which slogan line and it felt like Nawaz and Imran were both the \u2018tiger\u2019 and the \u2018saviour\u2019.\n\nThe SIC lawmakers also chanted the slogan of \u201cPrisoner No 804\u201d -- the number allotted to Imran after he was convicted in the Toshakhana (gift repository) case and sent to jail.\n\nNevertheless, the PTI under the guise of the SIC has returned to parliament.\n\nThere is an unspoken ban on mentioning Imran\u2019s name and displaying his photo or video. However, this was the first time that the PTI received the chance to mention his name and show his photos on television screens \u2013 perhaps a small reward for returning to parliament.\n\nDogar, who served as the PTI\u2019s chief whip in the previous stint, not just signed on the register for lawmakers\u2019 attendance on the Roll of Members in connection with Rule No 7 of the Rules and Procedure of National Assembly, 2007, but also chanted slogans in favour of Imran and his party while standing near the NA speaker\u2019s podium.\n\nAs the session began, the lawmakers on both sides of the aisle appeared to be fully charged as they shouted slogans against each other.\n\nThe PTI lawmakers, sitting on the opposition benches, came prepared and almost all of them had brought Imran\u2019s posters with them.\n\nThe lawmakers, sitting on the treasury benches, were seen short of posters or placards of Nawaz and other party leaders and had no other option but to keep chanting slogans as hard as they could.\n\nAs the bigwigs left the assembly hall, the members were busy signing the register and completing the formalities. A member, who arrived late, was sworn in separately.\n\nApart from Nawaz, the maiden session witnessed the presence of prime minister in-waiting Shehbaz, Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz, Ishaq Dar, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, and JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman among others.\n\nBarrister Gohar Ali Khan, Omar Ayub, Sardar Latif Khosa, Sher Afzal Marwat, Shandana Gulzar, Shehryar Afridi and other PTI leaders, who have now merged with the SIC, were also in attendance.\n\nThe NA speaker administered the oath to the newly elected members.\n\nAfter the oath was administered, the lawmakers signed on the register marking the lawmakers\u2019 attendance on the Role of Members as per Rule No 7 of the Rules and Procedure of National Assembly, 2007.\n\nThe Rule 7 reads: \u201cThere shall be a Roll of Members which shall be signed by every member after making the oath.\u201d\n\nDuring the session, the PTI-SIC\u2019s candidate for premiership, Omar Ayub, said the house was incomplete, adding that even the people nominated for the reserved seats could not arrive to take oath during the inaugural session.\n\nIn response to Ayub and Gohar\u2019s arguments that the SIC was deprived of the reserved seats, PML-N\u2019s Khawaja Asif said the SIC had not even submitted its list for the reserved seats to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) before the polls. He asked how could the SIC be granted the reserved seats then.\n\nSeeing the unruly behaviour of the lawmakers from both sides of the aisle, the speaker adjourned the session till 10am on Friday.\n\nOn Friday, as per the agenda issued by the NA Secretariat, oath will be administered to those who could not take it on Thursday.\n\nAfter that, the election for the new NA speaker will be held.\n\n"

            "Text": "A tumultuous atmosphere engulfed the inaugural sessions of the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) and Balochistan assemblies on Wednesday as newly-elected members braved chaotic scenes to take their oaths of office.\nDisorder reigned the K-P Assembly as each provincial assembly member (MPA) brought along dozens of guests, leading to the breach of a gate and broken windowpanes amid feeble security attempts.\nThe session, chaired by K-P Speaker Mushtaq Ghani and starting nearly two hours behind schedule, witnessed the swearing-in of 116 MPAs amid a rowdy assembly.\nThe inaugural session in K-P, overseen by Speaker Mushtaq Ghani, commenced almost two hours behind schedule. Speaker Ghani then proceeded to administer the oath to 116 MPAs.\nConversely, in the Balochistan Assembly, the responsibility of administering oaths to 57 MPAs fell upon the newly-elected representative, Zamarak Achakzai of the Awami National Party (ANP).\nIn the K-P Assembly, a woman legislator from the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) stumbled.\nSobia Shahid of the PML-N entered the assembly hall carrying a wristwatch, where she made jest of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) MPAs, alluding to the conviction of the party founder in the Toshakhana case.\nAs Shahid approached the speaker\u2019s podium, brandishing the wristwatch in her hand, PTI supporters hurled a water pot (Lota), empty bottles, and shoes at her.\nNevertheless, she seized the water pot and positioned it on the leader of the house's chair, proceeding to occupy the opposition leader's seat herself.\nMeanwhile, PTI workers in the assembly gallery vociferously chanted slogans. The session, initially slated for an 11 am commencement, kicked off at 1.30 pm.\nRead:\u00a0Gandapur terms \u2018K-P uplift\u2019 PTI\u2019s priority\n\u00a0\nSpeaker Ghani called for silence in the hall and initiated the proceedings of the inaugural session.\nAt the outset of the session, prayers were offered for the late father of Ali Amin Gandapur, the PTI nominee for the post of provincial chief minister, and the martyrs, who lost lives in the war against terrorism. Later, he administered the oath to 116 newly elected members of the assembly.\nPreviously, a large number of guests and PTI workers entered the assembly hall, accompanying the newly-elected MPAs. The volume was so significant that all the security arrangements designated for the inaugural session faltered.\nOutside the assembly hall, security personnel had sealed all the doors to deter any rush. Consequently, dozens of MPAs had to endure a prolonged wait to enter the building.\nPTI workers accessed the assembly hall by breaking the windowpanes of the kitchen. Notably, even two sons of Speaker Ghani used that route.\nThe newly-elected MPAs, who took oath on Wednesday, included 115 elected on the general seats and five on the reserved seats. The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has not yet been notified of the results of the Shangla and Torghar seats.\nFollowing the oath-taking, Speaker Mushtaq Ahmed Ghani extended congratulations to the new members and adjourned the meeting until Thursday morning.\nThe assembly would now proceed to elect a new speaker and deputy speaker before the chief minister's election.\nThe PTI had nominated Gandapur as its candidate for the position of chief minister. Hasham Inamullah Khan of the PML-N had been proposed for the role of chief minister by other parties, anticipated to form the opposition.\nDr Abad of the PML-N has been selected as the nominee for the position of opposition leader.\nThe opposition parties have unanimously decided to nominate Ehsanullah Miankhel, for the post of speaker, and Arbab Waqas of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf-Parliamentarians (PTI-P) for the post of deputy speaker.\n\u00a0\nBalochistan\nIn Quetta, 57 newly-elected Balochistan MPAs were administered the oath of office. Speaker Jan Muhammad Jamali did not attend the inaugural session and in his place, Achakzai chaired the proceedings and administered the oath.\nThe session took place under stringent security measures, with all roads leading to the Balochistan Assembly closed to traffic.\nAt the outset of the session, lawmakers offered Fateha for those who lost their lives in the Khanozai and Killa Saifullah bombings preceding the general elections.\nMost of the MPAs from the PPP and the PML-N were present in the house, including Nawab Sanaullah Zehri, Mir Sadiq Umrani, Mir Zahoor Buledi, Asfandyar Khan Kakar and others. The visitors\u2019 gallery was also jam-packed with guests and supporters of the new MPAs.\nThose who were sworn in on Wednesday, included National Party (NP) chief Dr Malik Baloch, Aslam Raisani of the Jamiat ul Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F), Abdul Majeed Badini of the Jamaat e Islami (JI) and Maulana Hidayatur Rehman, the chief of the Haq Do Tehreek, Gwadar.\nThe session was adjourned until Thursday, for the election of the speaker and the deputy speaker.\nPPP has nominated Ghazala Gola for the post of deputy speaker, whereas, the PML-N is likely to nominate Captain (retd) Khaliq Achakzai for the speakership.\nMeanwhile, a four-party alliance, consisting of the NP, Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M), Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), and the Hazara Democratic Party (HDP) staged protest demonstrations in the city against the alleged poll rigging.\n"

The criteria included evaluating the doctor\u2019s approach towards patients, the healthcare facility\u2019s environment, availability of essential utilities, comfortable waiting areas, medication supply and laboratory facilities. The prolonged delays and patient complaints about treatment methods prompted the fines.\nFinally, the three hospitals were issued formal licences after they completed the health indicators set by the PHC. These hospitals were operating without the PHC\u2019s issued licence. On the other hand, the Rawalpindi Institute of Cardiology (RIC) has been issued a formal licence by the Commission.\nAs part of its broader initiative, the PHC has initiated a crackdown on unlicensed medical facilities, including quacks and private laboratories setting up clinics without proper permits. To further reinforce its stance, the Commission has suspended medical treatment using health cards at hospitals lacking licences, whether government or private.\nRead:\u00a0Hospitals set for fast 75% fund release\nThe PHC\u2019s vigilance extends beyond hospitals, with a focus on quacks in streets and bazaars, particularly those linked to dangerous diseases. The Commission is actively addressing citizen complaints lodged on the web portals of the prime minister and the Punjab chief minister, indicating a commitment to public well-being.\nMoreover, the PHC has begun imposing fines and sealing unregistered medical treatment centres that have not met health indicators.\nTaking a stringent approach, legal actions, including imprisonment and fines, are being pursued against medical professionals found negligent in patient care or causing complications leading to deaths. Private laboratories are not exempt from scrutiny, as legal actions have been initiated against those failing to register with the PHC.\nField experts from the Commission conduct thorough inspections before granting registration to government and private hospitals, medical centres, laboratories, and clinics, imposing substantial fines for non-compliance with health indicators.\nThis comprehensive approach reflects the PHC\u2019s dedication to ensuring the highest standards of healthcare for the citizens of Rawalpindi.\n"

            "Text": "Residents of Islamabad\u2019s NA-54 constituency are expressing scepticism about the past performance of candidates competing in the February 8 general elections, saying political bigwigs had always put the provision of basic facilities on the back burner and broke electoral promises.\nThey are of the view that the elections are usually contested on tall claims of paving roads and streets, providing better education and health facilities, offering jobs, and executing other development works.\nA survey conducted by The Express Tribune in the constituency exposes the performance of political heavyweights like former federal ministers Ghulam Sarwar Khan and Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan.\nBoth politicians are face to face in NA-54 \u2013 the territorial jurisdiction of which starts from the Margalla Hills to the Attock\u2019s Kala Chitta Pahar, and the banks of Swan River to the areas of Chakri and Adiala.\nAccording to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), the total number of registered voters in this constituency is 466,344, of which 241,350 are male voters and 224,994 are female voters. As many as 39 candidates are contesting the elections from NA-54, 30 candidates from PP-12, and 28 candidates will come face-to-face in the PP-13 constituency.\nAccording to locals, the close contest will take place between Ghulam Sarwar Khan of Istehkam-e-Pakistan Party (IPP) and independent candidate Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan. Sarwar quit the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI), while Nisar parted ways with the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and is now contesting the elections as an independent candidate for the second time. Both aspirants are seen seeking public votes based on their past performance in their respective electrical campaigns.\nOn the other hand, the main contest for the provincial seat (PP-12) is expected between Mohsin Ayub of the PML-N, Ammar Siddiq Khan of the IPP, and Saad Ali Khan of the PTI. In PP-13, the PML-N-backed Malik Umar Farooq will step into the electoral battlefield to face the PTI\u2019s Fahad Masood.\nRead:\u00a0PML-N vies for 4th win in NA-121\nLocals have complained of a lack of basic facilities in the constituency. Azhar Hussain Qazi describes the pathetic condition of Primary School Paswal located in the native village of Ghulam Sarwar. He says the students are taking classes despite the school\u2019s building having been declared dangerous by the building department. Some students told this reporter that they are forced to study in the open air amid cold weather.\nLocal people say that despite enjoying several ministries, Sarwar could not change the condition of the primary school and Basic Health Center of Pind Noushhari. They further say that both the candidates were also unable to fix encroachment problems at Chowk Sarai Kala Taxila. Usman Aziz says traffic jams, drainage and lack of a permanent place for vendors in Taxila Chowk are acute problems in the last ten years.\nTauqeer Riaz says that the 500-bed Wah General Hospital built at the cost of billions of rupees during the tenure of Nisar Ali Khan even lacks doctors and laboratory tests.\nThe voters in the constituency are of the view that the real change is still a distant dream as candidates seek to vote in the name of changing the fate of the constituency by solving the people\u2019s problems, but break promises always.\n"

        "Details": {
            "Text": "Despite the government introducing laws every now and then, aimed at the elimination of child abuse and forced labor from society, the lack of implementation of crucial bills like the Prevention of Trafficking in Persons Act, 2018 has prevented the imposition of strict penalties against those found guilty.\nFor instance, just a couple of months ago, Noor Sadia, a nine year old child maid was found in a tortured state by the Child Protection and Welfare Bureau Punjab from a house located in the People\u2019s Colony area of Faisalabad, where her mother, Zahida Bibi had left her for work six months ago.\nWhen a video recording an instance of violence against the child was sent to the Child Protection Bureau by an eyewitness, a case was registered against the accused which included specific sections of the Protection of Children Act, 2004 and the Pakistan Penal Code. However, Section 4 of the Prevention of Trafficking in Persons Act (TIP) 2018 was not included, even though the case involved child trafficking and forced child labor. This allowed the perpetrators to escape any serious charges.\n\u201cSection 4 of the TIP Act should have been considered while investigating the Noor Sadia case. Excluding the provisions of the act implies that the process of prosecution will be lenient and the accused will be benefited,\u201d worried Syed Kausar Abbas, leader of the Sustainable Social Development Organization.\n\u201cAlmost 50 per cent of the children who are rescued from abusive work environments, are trafficked from other cities or forced into labor by their families. Therefore, the TIP Act must be applied so that strict penalties are issued against perpetrators and child abuse cases can be controlled,\u201d asserted Sarah Ahmed, Chairperson of the Child Protection and Welfare Bureau, who was of the opinion that there was a need to create awareness on the applications of the TIP clause to child abuse cases. \nAccording to data obtained by The Express Tribune from the Punjab Labour and Human Resources Department, 2,516 cases have so far been registered under the Child Abuse and Trafficking in Persons Act, 2018 from March 2022 to October 2023, with the highest number of 635 First Information Reports (FIR\u2019s) registered during September 2023, when 318 children were rescued.\nSpeaking to Express Tribune, Sadia Sohail Rana, former Member of the Punjab Assembly said, \u201cTrafficking is a global issue but the tragedy in our country is that even when the relevant laws exist, implementing them is a challenge. All political parties should make this matter a part of their manifestos, and whichever party forms the next government, it should ensure its implementation.\u201d\n"

            "Text": "Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar has given the green light to appoint Irteza Qureshi as the new regular managing director of Pak Arab Refinery Limited (Parco).\nHe is currently working as the deputy managing director (DMD). According to sources, eight potential candidates had been shortlisted during the first phase for the slot of Parco MD.\nTwo candidates were from the Engro Group, one from contractor company Schlumberger, two from Parco, one from K-Electric and one from Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC).\nIn the final phase, the government shortlisted three candidates, who included SSGC MD, Schlumberger CEO and Parco DMD Irteza Qureshi.\nSources pointed out that the candidate from the contracting company could not be hired due to the conflict of interests whereas the SSGC MD had been allowed by the company\u2019s board to continue his services.\nConsequently, one candidate was left with a professional background, who had earlier been working in the country\u2019s largest oil and gas explorer \u2013 Oil and Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL) \u2013 and is currently working in Parco.\nSources said that the Petroleum Division had submitted a summary to the prime minister, who gave the nod for appointing the Parco DMD as the new MD. He also gave directives to table a case before the cabinet for formal approval.\nLater, a summary was sent to the cabinet, which is expected to accord its approval next week.\nRead\u00a0Mafia pilfering oil from PARCO line roams free\nThe board of directors of Parco, a joint venture between Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), had earlier approved the hiring of Qureshi as the DMD, who took charge in early September 2021.\nHaving served as the chief financial officer (CFO) in OGDCL, Qureshi, a UK-qualified chartered accountant, brings diverse experience in both private and public sectors as well as multinational organisations within and outside of Pakistan.\nHis tenure at OGDCL saw significant achievements, including value creation, enhanced governance and financial control.\nAs the CFO, he played a pivotal role in implementing major HR reforms, achieved operational efficiencies and focused on diversification, resulting in substantial savings, estimated at Rs150 billion over a period of 10 years due to measures like \u201cpensionable employment cessation\u201d and salary capping.\nOGDCL experienced a considerable reduction in procurement costs and benefited from lowered service rates by up to 50%, leading to significant savings in the company\u2019s finances.\nParco, established in 1974, is likely to benefit from Qureshi\u2019s expertise for future growth and success of the company.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 3rd, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

            "Text": "In a move met with strong resistance, the caretaker government\u2019s decision to significantly raise petroleum product prices has sparked serious concerns among business leaders. The move, denounced by various industry representatives, is anticipated to escalate inflation, posing further challenges to industrial production in the country.\nThe recent hike in petrol and high-speed diesel (HSD) prices by Rs13.55 and Rs2.75 per litre, respectively, has set petroleum product rates at Rs272.89 and Rs278.96 per litre.\nKarachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), President, Iftikhar Ahmed Sheikh, expressed dismay, stating that while an increase of Rs5 to Rs9 per litre was expected due to rising international prices, the unjustifiable spike of Rs13.55 per litre would disproportionately impact all segments of society. Sheikh warned that this move would exacerbate hardships for the general public and significantly affect industrial production, as the cost of doing business would inevitably rise.\nRead\u00a0CCI approves amendments to petroleum policy 2012\nThe KCCI president criticised the government for maintaining the maximum permissible limit of Rs60 per litre in petroleum levy, suggesting that reducing this levy could have mitigated the impact on the public. He denounced the caretaker government\u2019s consistent pattern of making harsh decisions, including raising petrol, gas, and electricity prices, as unacceptable.\nSpeaking to The Express Tribune, President of the Hyderabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (HCCI), Adeel Siddiqui warned that the petrol price hike would negatively impact the national economy, leading to increased charges for freight transportation services and electricity. He expressed concern for SMEs on the brink of collapse due to escalating utility bills and water shortages.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 3rd, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

            "Text": "The persistent inefficiencies in power distribution companies, coupled with governance issues, have been identified as the primary drivers behind a staggering addition of Rs396 billion to Pakistan\u2019s circular debt during the financial year 2022-23. According to the Industry Report 2022-23 released by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), substantial losses and a decline in the recovery of electricity bills have exacerbated the circular debt crisis.\nNepra has recommended a forensic audit to enforce accountability within the staff, fostering transparency and efficiency in the distribution network. The report highlights that most Distribution Companies (DISCOs) failed to meet Transmission and Distribution (T&D) loss targets, significantly burdening the circular debt.\nEntities such as Peshawar Electric Supply Company (PESCO), Tribal Electric Supply Company (TESCO), and Sukkur Electric Power Company (SEPCO) have reported notable losses, contributing a substantial Rs160.49 billion to the circular debt. PESCO alone has added Rs77.35 billion to the debt, showcasing the severity of the issue.\nIn detail, PESCO contributed Rs77.3 billion, Lahore Electric Supply Company (LESCO) Rs21.9 billion, Multan Electric Power Company (MEPCO) Rs7.9 billion, Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (HESCO) Rs15 billion, SEPCO Rs20.38 billion, and Quetta Electric Supply Company (QESCO) Rs21.21 billion.\nCircular Debt Reaches Alarming Levels\nAs of June 30, 2023, the circular debt has surged to a staggering Rs2.309 trillion from Rs2.252 trillion in FY2021-22, posing a significant challenge. The power regulator has underlined the need for the government to address this by ensuring timely subsidy payments and exploring innovative solutions to minimise losses.\nThe recovery rate in FY2022-23 stood at 92.4%, resulting in an additional Rs236 billion added to the circular debt. Nepra suggests that the government, as the owner of DISCOs, should consider outsourcing recovery tasks and focus on addressing inefficiencies to curb the accumulation of circular debt.\nMounting Receivables\nReceivables for DISCOs rose to approximately Rs1,727,104 million in FY2022-23, prompting concerns about potential billing manipulation. Nepra recommends the establishment of committees with independent professionals to ensure accurate receivables, stressing the need for transparent billing and collection practices.\nRead\u00a0Minister defends DISCOs overbilling\nNepra strongly condemns load-shedding based on Aggregate Technical and Commercial (AT&C) losses and urges DISCOs to focus on resolving inefficiencies rather than resorting to arbitrary reductions. A forensic audit is recommended to ensure accountability, transparency, and efficiency in the distribution network.\nImpact on Grid Integration\nDISCOs\u2019 failure to provide new connections as per the Pakistan Standards for Distribution Rights 2005 has led to a substantial backlog of connections. Nepra stresses that accountability measures, including penalties for negligence and rewards for exemplary performance, are necessary to address this issue.\nIn FY2022-23, 163 fatalities were reported in DISCOs, prompting comprehensive investigations, fines, compensation to bereaved families, and directives for safety improvements. Nepra underscored the essential need for grounding poles/structures and a focus on safety to prevent accidents.\nTo address challenges in DISCOs, Nepra recommends involving the private sector. Governance issues and inefficiencies contribute to the circular debt, necessitating concerted efforts to improve DISCOs\u2019 performance.\nAMI Initiatives\nThe authority has sanctioned a five-year investment plan of Rs375 billion for Islamabad Electric Supply Company (IESCO), LESCO, and Faisalabad Electric Supply Company (FESCO). Encouraging the installation of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) was encouraged as it is considered crucial for real-time monitoring and efficiency improvement.\nBalancing Energy Charges\nThe report highlights the need to balance energy charges and capacity charges to reduce the impact on consumers. Retiring outdated generation capacity and considering new capacity induction after thorough analysis are deemed essential for cost reduction.\nThe State of Industry Report underscores the imperative for reforms and comprehensive strategies required to address the challenges in the electricity sector, ensuring sustainable growth in Pakistan.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 3rd, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

        "Summary": {
            "Text": "Energy ministry proposed settling the debt without increasing tariff and without having any impact on budget"
        },
        "Details": {
            "Text": "The Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) on Friday directed the authorities concerned to urgently secure the International Monetary Fund\u2019s (IMF) approval for the clearance of Rs1.27 trillion energy sector unpaid debt aimed at avoiding any further increase in electricity and gas tariffs to retire the debt.\nIf the cost of circular debt is passed on to the consumers, the electricity tariff will go up by Rs24 per unit, hitting Rs66 per unit. Similarly, gas tariff may also go up by Rs5,800 per metric million British thermal unit (mmbtu) for all consumers, which is more than double the existing rates.\nThe energy ministry has proposed settling the debt without increasing the tariff and without having any impact on the budget.\nThe instructions to immediately secure the approval of the IMF were given to the finance and energy ministries during the 9th meeting of the SIFC, which was also the last meeting of the civil-military body before the general elections.\nThe finance ministry has already shared the plan with the IMF and now it needs to pursue the lender to give its stamp of approval soon.\nThe total energy sector circular debt stands at Rs5.725 trillion as of Nov 2023. This includes Rs2.7 trillion power sector debt and over Rs3 trillion gas sector debt. The energy ministry has proposed to retire Rs1.268 trillion out of this, or 22% of the stock.\nThe SIFC was apprised that the proposed Rs1.27 trillion circular debt retirement plan had neither any financial impact on the budget nor would it burden the consumers of gas and electricity in the shape of higher prices to recover the debt.\nIn the past, the power sector circular debt was either settled through budget or the consumers were forced to pay for the cost of inefficiencies of the energy sector. The electricity consumers are still paying Rs3.23 per unit to pay interest on the power sector circular debt \u2013a situation that may also arise in the gas sector if the issue was not taken head on, according to a cabinet member.\nA senior government functionary said that considering the existing inflationary pressures, the circular debt could no more be passed on to the consumers in the shape of price increase.\nThe IMF has in the past been criticised for making the electricity prices unaffordable for the majority of the consumers under its failed strategy to retire the debt through price increase. If this debt is not cleaned now, it may become a major stumbling block at the time of the next programme talks.\nThe petroleum sector circular debt is a new phenomenon, which has now become an impediment to Pakistan after rapid depletion of indigenous resources by 7% annually. The debt and inadequate revenue requirement determination and subsidised gas prices has now put the entire petroleum sector at stake after the power sector.\nCompared to only 17% increase in the power sector circular debt, the gas sector\u2019s unpaid debt has doubled to over Rs3 trillion in less than three and half years, becoming yet another new threat to economic stability of Pakistan.\nIn June 2020, the gas sector debt was Rs1.5 trillion, which by November 2023 increased by another Rs1.5 trillion.\nThe Rs5.7 trillion energy sector circular debt includes Rs1.2 trillion late payment surcharges, mainly in the gas sector. Out of the Rs3 trillion gas sector debt, 70% is owed to exploration and production firms.\nRead:\u00a0SIFC steps in to end differences over gas price hike\nThe details showed one-third of the gas sector debt, or Rs1.1 trillion is only owed to the Oil and Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL), followed by Rs788 billion to the Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) and Rs793 billion to the Pakistan State Oil (PSO). The plan proposes settlement of debt of only the public sector firms.\nMany companies in the exploration and production sectors are not recording the late payment surcharges as receivables to avoid tax exposures.\nThe energy ministry is seeking Rs745 billion supplementary grant for only two days, which under the plan would go back to the coffers of the Q Block in the shape of dividend payments against the government\u2019s shares in these companies.\nThe net impact on budget of the Rs1.27 trillion circular debt plan will come to Rs902 billion. Out of the Rs902 billion, the lion\u2019s share of Rs556 billion, or 62%, will go to one firm \u2013 the OGDCL.\nOf the debt settlement plan of Rs1.27 trillion, it is proposed to retire a little over Rs1 trillion of the gas sector circular debt, involving companies listed at the stock market and leaving a major impact on their share prices. The remaining over Rs255 billion will be spent on curtailing the power sector circular debt of Rs2.7 trillion.\nThe IMF\u2019s endorsement and implementation of the plan is very critical before the caretaker government hands over control to the next elected government. There is no guarantee that the next elected government would implement the plan. Such attempts have twice been made in the past but each time the finance ministry scuttled it.\nEnergy ministry officials said that the grant of Rs745 billion was needed for only two days to trigger the entire process. The actual funds that would go back to the kitty in the shape of dividends and taxes would be Rs748 billion, they claimed in the plan submitted to the SIFC.\nOnce implemented, the gas sector debt will come down from over Rs3 trillion to Rs2 trillion. The power sector circular debt will drop to Rs2.5 trillion.\nThe energy ministryhas proposed a seven-tier plan to settle the circular debt in a manner that greases the system but has no impact on the budget.\nAn amount of Rs556 billion will go to OGDCL. The second highest amount will be given to the Government Holdings Private Limited (GHPL), which will receive Rs168 billion, followed by Rs146 billion for the National Power Parks Management Company (NPPMC) and Rs29 billion for the PSO. The Pakistan Development Fund Limited (PDFL) will get Rs82.7 billion.\nAs per the plan, the Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) will disburse Rs386 billion to exploration and production (E&P) companies. An amount of Rs126 billion will go to the PPL, Rs10 billion to the GHPL and Rs250 billion to the OGDCL on account of the SNGPL\u2019s payables.\nThe Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) will disburse Rs259 billion to E&P companies and out of which Rs112 billion will go to the GHPL and Rs147 billion to the OGDCL. The OGDCL\u2019s private shareholders will receive Rs59.5 billion and the PPL\u2019s private shareholders will get Rs23.8 billion.\nThe Central Power Purchase Agency (CPPA) will get Rs146 billion, including Rs100 billion of the supplementary grant.\nThe government fully owns the NPPMC and the GHPL. But its shareholding in the PPL was 75%, besides 85% in the OGDCL and 25% in the PSO. The OGDCL is expected to announce Rs467 billion in dividends, of which Rs397 billion will be the government\u2019s share.\nWithout settlement of the past debt, the finance ministry would not be able to receive its future dividends, therefore, it is the time that the ministry and the IMF should act to clear the mess and save the consumers from further price hike, according to the energy ministry officials.\nThe PPL is projected to give Rs126 billion in dividends and Rs98 billion is expected to land in the government\u2019s coffers. The GHPL will give Rs168 billion in dividends, the NPPMC Rs40 billion and the PDFL Rs28.7 billion. The PSO has been kept out of the dividend cycle.\n"

            "Text": "A court on Saturday sentenced former premier Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, to seven years imprisonment in an \u201cun-Islamic\u201d marriage case \u2013 meaning it found that they had tied the knot while the former first lady was going through her period of Iddat.\nSenior civil judge Qudratullah, while announcing a reserved verdict, also imposed a Rs500,000 fine each on the PTI founding chairman and his wife.\nThe written order read that the two would be imprisoned for a further four months if they failed to pay the fines.\nThis was the third conviction handed down to the deposed premier over the last five days.\nEarlier this week, the PTI founding chairman and his wife were sentenced to 14-year imprisonment in the Toshakhana (gift repository) case.\nSimilarly, Imran and PTI leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi were handed down a jail term of 10 years in the cipher case this week as well.\nThe hearing of the \u201cillegal\u201d marriage case, which was filed by Bushra\u2019s first husband, Khawar Maneka, was conducted within the premises of Rawalpindi\u2019s Adiala Jail.\nManeka alleged that Bushra had violated the Islamic practice of observing the mandatory pause, or Iddat, before marrying Imran.\nIddat is a mandatory waiting period that a Muslim woman must observe on account of the death of her husband or dissolution of the marriage.\nFurther, Maneka accused his ex-wife and Imran of having an adulterous relationship before their marriage.\nThe order read that Imran and Bushra were found guilty under Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) Section 496 (marriage ceremony fraudulently gone through without lawful marriage).\nEarlier during the hearing, Maneka\u2019s lawyer Rizwan Abbasi said in his final arguments that Bushra was divorced on Nov 14, 2017.\nHe continued that despite the long cross-examination of the witnesses, the accused could not deny the allegations and that was why the first marriage of Bushra and Imran took place on Jan 1, 2018.\nAbbasi pointed out that after the completion if the Iddat period in Feb 2018, the oral marriage took place again.\nHe maintained that his client Maneka had been defrauded and deprived of his right to Rujuh (resumption of conjugal relationship) because of his former wife\u2019s re-marriage.\nRead US says Imran's sentence 'matter for Pakistani courts'\nImran\u2019s lawyer Salman Akram Raja said in his final arguments that the divorce took place in April 2017 and there was evidence of it.\nHe added that they wanted to present the third party witness in the case.\nHe contended that there had been no fraud as the Supreme Court had decided that the minimum duration of Iddat could be 39 days.\nHe added that from Nov 14, 2023 to Jan 1, 2024, the period came to 48 days.\nThe lawyer pointed out that Maneka had suddenly filed his complaint five years and 11 months after his ex-wife\u2019s re-marriage.\nHe noted that Bushra in her statement to the court had said that her ex-husband divorced her orally in April 2017 and the document that he had presented in Nov 2017 was forged.\nThe lawyer further pointed out that Bushra in her statement observed that Maneka had remained in custody till Nov 14, 2023, after which he filed the complaint.\nThe court then announced its verdict.\nAccording to the country\u2019s superior judiciary, the union of husband and wife without observing the period of Iddat was an irregular marriage that might have consequences under Islamic law but it could not be declared as void.\nManeka filed the complaint under sections 34 (common intention), 496, and 496-B (fornication) of the PPC.\nLast month, the civil judge, Qudratullah, indicted the couple in the illegal marriage case.\nLater in January, the IHC stopped the proceedings against the couple and restrained the prosecution from producing the evidence in the case.\nHowever on Jan 31, the IHC observed that it could not intervene in the trial process once the suspects had been indicted. However, it dropped the charge of Section 496-B from the case as it was not framed by the trial court.\n"

            "Text": "In this era of the internet, politics and social media are intertwined and inseparable. Reason: political powwow happens on social media platforms like TikTok, WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and X \u2013 formerly Twitter \u2013 among others.\nIn the past, political parties and candidates used to rely more on posters, banners, door-to-door campaigns, corner meetings and rallies. However, in the internet-driven polls and amid security challenges coupled with sky-rocketing inflation, they are relying more on digital election campaigns, knowing that ignoring the social media platforms means they do not exist for voters, to say the least.\nExperts believe political parties have shifted to digital playgrounds as they enable them to not only hear the public pulse but allow them to stay in touch with them. However, they added, it would be too early to entirely rule out the old-school methods such as food and transport, among other things, to persuade voters to come to polling stations.\n\u201cInformation via social media platforms influences voters, especially, the young voters in urban and semi urban areas,\u201d Raza Ahmad Rumi, a policy analyst and journalist, said.\n\u201cHowever,\u201d he added, \u201cthere are many limitations when it comes to electoral politics.\u201d First, Rumi maintained, elections in Pakistan, rural areas in particular, entail the influence of clan, tribe or familial ties and many voters use their right within the context of social networks they are part of.\nSecond, he incorporated, even if digital campaigns influence a voter in one particular direction, it is not certain that they would actually go out and vote. \u201cThe real challenge for parties and candidates ultimately is to mobilize the voter and bring them to polling stations,\u201d Rumi said, saying, \u201cThis entails old-school methods of incentives such as transport, food and, in some cases, some measure of patronage.\u201d\nRumi said that the digital campaigns are now a reality worldwide and Pakistan is no exception given the high penetration of mobile telephones in our society, saying the country has seen the effects of digital communications over the past decade.\nThe analyst said that the political parties, especially the PTI, are making full use of the social media platforms to influence voters and create an impression of their victory. \u201cFor the PTI,\u201d Rumi said, \u201cthis is even more important given the legal and administrative crackdown on the party in recent months.\u201d\nRead: Elections 2024: Parties race to woo key youth voters\nRenowned political expert Majid Nizami said that the digital election campaigns are definitely effective but they haven\u2019t fully captured the market yet. Digital election campaigns started in 2018 but the usage and reliance of digital media has increased to manifold in 2024 elections, Nizami said, adding that the trend of physical or on-ground campaign has decreased. He listed two main reasons for that: the current restive political situation; and political parties\u2019 decision to shift to digital election campaigns.\nWhatsApp, Facebook, X (Twitter), YouTube and other social media platforms are playing a crucial role in making up peoples\u2019 mind, Nizami said, saying PTI was effectively utilising all social media platforms. He added that social media platforms were helping PTI to stay connected with its voters and supporters. Conversely, he added, the voters also remain aware of the happenings and able to comment on the developments.\n\u201cI think, all these apps will play an important role in the digital election campaign till the Election Day,\u201d Nizami said.\nPerhaps, he incorporated, it is being said that internet would be shut down to counter this important role during election days. The reason behind such theories is that a massive change has been witnessed because of these social media platforms and because of the change, people have shifted to alternate media.\nTo a question if digital voting campaigns can really change a voter\u2019s mind, Nizami was of the view that digital election campaigns wouldn\u2019t be able to change majority\u2019s mind right now but its impact has already started. \u201cIn 2029, we may see that these digital election campaigns have a huge impact on elections,\u201d Nizami said, saying it\u2019s at an early phase right now but can slowly and gradually increase over the years.\n"

            "Text": "The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has demanded the immediate resignation of Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja, accusing him of dereliction of his constitutional and legal duties and playing the role of a facilitator in what it termed as 'poll fraud.'\nThe PTI further insisted that not only should CEC Raja step down, but the members of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) should also tender their resignations.\nIt alleged that they colluded to strip PTI-backed candidates of the mandate bestowed upon them by the people in the February 8 general elections, marred by widespread reports of vote rigging.\nIn a statement, PTI spokesperson Raoof Hasan demanded CEC and ECP members\u2019 resignation amid widespread reports of vote rigging during the recently concluded polls.\nAccording to the PTI, the party was cruising with a lead of 170 National Assembly seats before the alleged rigging swung the pendulum in favour of the PML-N.\nParty chairman Barrister Gohar Khan stated that the party intended to use legal avenues to highlight this rigging and get back its stolen mandate.\nThis is not the first time PTI has demanded resignation from CEC as PTI founding chairman Imran Khan has demanded Raja\u2019s resignation on several occasions in the past as well on the allegation that he had joined hands with the PML-N. Imran had even shown mistrust in CEC after his party\u2019s resounding victory on 15 seats in the by-elections held in 20 constituencies of Punjab in 2022.\nOn Sunday, the PTI spokesperson demanded the immediate resignation of CEC and members of the election watchdog, \u201cwho worked as main facilitators in the daylight robbery on public mandate.\u201d\nHasan said that the CEC and ECP members did not have any right and moral justification to say any more on their position since \u201cthey completely failed in performing their constitutional and legal duties\u201d.\nRead\u00a0COG lauds ECP, other institutions for holding polls\nHe added that they even did not have any regard or respect for the Constitution and law.\nHe further stated that the CEC and ECP members \u201copened the door to violating the constitution, flouting the law, tarnishing democracy, and desecrating the public mandate.\u201d\nIn addition, the spokesperson said that imposing PDM-2 on the nation again through daylight robbery on public mandate is unacceptable and intolerable.\nWhile demanding the immediate resignation of CEC, and ECP members, he said that neither people nor PTI would accept any malicious plot come what may. Hasan strongly rejected the ongoing malicious attempts and \u201cshameful drama to tamper with the results to convert PTI\u2019s overwhelming majority into the minority to impose the people-rejected PDM-2 on the nation once again.\u201d\nIn a strongly worded statement, Hasan vehemently denounced the reprehensible plot to deprive people of their true and genuine representatives, saying efforts were afoot to allegedly steal the public mandate and re-imposed \u201cthe gang of criminals on the nation.\u201d\nHe made it clear that the people of the country would not accept any such nefarious plan and they would safeguard and protect their mandate come what may.\nHe stated that PTI, being the largest and most popular party in the country, with representation in all four provinces and a decisive public mandate, had the basic constitutional, democratic, moral and political right to form a government.\nHe recalled that the \u201crejected and incompetent PDM group\u201d was responsible for Pakistan\u2019s prevailing economic and administrative disaster. He went on to say that inflation-weary people of the country rejected PTI opponents by taking revenge through their power of vote three days ago by inflicting crushing drubbing on them.\n"

The petitioner requested the court to set aside the Form-47 and direct the RO to conduct the consolidation process in his presence.\nAnother PTI-backed candidate, Shahzad Farooq, challenged Maryam Nawaz's victory in NA-119, claiming that he and his polling agents had been forcibly removed from the RO's office at a time when the results were in his favour. He requested the court to provide copies of Form-45 and allow him to participate in the consolidation process, further requesting for orders to prevent the RO from announcing the final result.\nThe PTI-backed contestants, including Rihana Dar, argued that they and their agents were forcibly removed from ROs' offices as the results favoured them. They implored the court to set aside the Form-47 prepared in their absence and direct the ROs to conduct the consolidation process in their presence.\nA day earlier, Justice Ali Baqar Najafi of the LHC had restrained further proceedings regarding the election results of NA-128, suspending the operation of Form-47 prepared by the RO in the absence of the PTI-backed candidate Salman Akram Raja or his agent.\n"

            "Text": "Pakistan\u2019s Rs38.8 trillion domestic and Rs24.1 trillion external debt mountain is a \u201cboiling frog\u201d phenomenon for the economy as higher deficits and ballooning debt servicing costs are unsustainable.\nA boiling frog situation is one in which people fail to act on a potential problem that grows over time, causing it to become more severe until it eventually bubbles over.\nA frog thrown in boiling water might jump out, but if the water comes to boil slowly, it\u2019s too late by the time it notices it\u2019s been cooked. The age-old metaphor could easily apply to Pakistan\u2019s debt situation.\nNet interest payments on debt already exceed the government\u2019s total tax revenues, a recipe for a \u201cdisorderly\u201d default and subsequently an economic meltdown.\nGovernments have two ways to generate revenues \u2013 taxation and borrowing. Year-on-year Pakistan has continuously failed in its tax collection and has, unfortunately, excelled in its capacity to borrow to no-end, thus falling into a non-ending debt trap.\nPersistent fiscal imbalances lead to non-existent fiscal space for state building, further pushing the state into weakening trajectories. State building and fiscal capacity can only occur if the focus is on generating revenues through efficient tax collection over borrowing.\nAn ineffective tax policy and inefficient tax bureaucracy has kept Pakistan\u2019s tax-to GDP ratio around 9% over the last several decades. Pakistan needs to increase revenue collection at all levels to improve the ratio to 20-25%.\nMyopic revenue-thirsty governments have dodged tax reforms and embraced reckless borrowing, bringing the economy down to its knees.\nThe state\u2019s focus should be on its ability to collect the maximum amount of tax revenue with the minimum amount of harm to the economy so as to achieve sustainable and robust economic growth. Resorting to excessive borrowing gives you the opposite results.\nIf Pakistan has to overcome the twin inter-related malaises of fiscal deficit and debt burden, then there is no other option but to dismantle the existing outdated and anti-growth tax system. A two-pronged tax reform agenda is the need of the hour:\nOne \u2013 replace/restructure the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) with a national tax agency (NTA). Two \u2013 a total rationalisation of the tax system.\nRead:\u00a0Debt repayment\nReplacing/restructuring the FBR with NTA is to ensure effective enforcement of tax laws both at federal and provincial levels. The country\u2019s taxation system is complex and involves multiple agencies, which make the overall system inefficient.\nThe NTA with the mandate to impose a simple and harmonised tax code should be established to replace/restructure the FBR and all other federal tax authorities in the country.\nIt will be responsible for collecting taxes at the federal level with an active role of the National Tax Council (NTC). Provincial tax authorities will be similarly structured and streamlined to provide ease and simplicity to taxpayers.\nThe NTA will report to parliament through the minister of finance and the appointment of its chairman and members shall be through a public hearing by a joint committee of the National Assembly and the Senate.\nIt will not assume the role of a legislator and policymaker which under the constitution is the sole prerogative of the people of Pakistan through their elected representatives (Towards flat, low-rate, broad and predictable taxes \u2013 Bukhari and Haq, Prime 2020).\nA total rationalisation of the tax system is to maximise tax revenues through voluntary compliance.\nPakistan, a country of 241 million inhabitants, has an extremely narrow tax base; currently at 10 million individuals, out of which 5 million are tax return filers and only 3 million actually pay any tax.\nExorbitant and punitive tax rates encourage tax evasion, avoidance and not to report taxable income. They also encourage taxpayers to seek exemptions, concessions, exclusions, credits, amnesties and write-offs.\nThe key to a good tax policy is a flat, low-rate, broad-based and predictable tax system. People in like circumstances should have similar tax burdens. The perception of fairness is the key to voluntary compliance but the relatively effortless implementation shouldn\u2019t fool you. It will have massive beneficial consequences.\nTo broaden the tax base, from 10 million to 20 million individuals, the country should put in place a 10% flat-rate tax on all (unadjustable) gross incomes regardless of the source.\nAll individuals should be facilitated to file a simple income tax return, without a wealth tax statement and those earning below the taxable limit should be paid income support in the form of negative tax. A single-page return form should be available in English, Urdu and all regional languages that can even be submitted through a simple mobile app.\nHistorically, our elite are in favour of tax reform as long as it maintains their privileges. For a tax reform to be considered truly revolutionary, there needs to be a strong political will to resist the lobbies and bureaucracy that have helped sustain the current morass.\nThere is now consensus amongst all that unless and until we get out of this \u201cboiling frog\u201d situation, our economic miseries will not end and may eventually lead to a devastating end.\nThe writer is an economist and philanthropist based in Belgium\n\u00a0\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 12th, 2024.\n"

He further noted that loyalists of incarcerated PTI leaders emerged as successful candidates in the general elections, yet this aspect of the caretaker government's neutrality was not being duly appreciated.\nIn response to a query, the PM highlighted that despite numerous threats preceding the February 8 election day and two terrorist attacks in Balochistan, all stakeholders deserved commendation for the significant achievement of ensuring the peaceful conduct of the polls.\nHe also brushed aside any notion of threats to the integrity of the country stemming from certain protests and agitations held by specific parties, stating that it was \u201cabsurd\u201d to draw parallels with the situation in Dhaka during 1971.\n\u201cSuch comparisons are merely rhetoric. Pakistan is a stable and responsible nation. The peaceful exercise of protest is a democratic right of the people,\u201d he emphasized but hastened to add that no government could permit a situation that leads to chaos or anarchy.\nResponding to a query, he maintained that over 60 million voters had exercised their constitutional right to elect their favourite candidates under \u2018a pressure-free environment\u2019.\nKakar explained that the delay in announcing the official results was attributed to the specific procedures involved in compiling results from the 92,000 polling stations and credited the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for conducting the massive exercise in a smooth manner.\nAlso read: GDA rejects poll results, announces vacating Sindh Assembly seats\nHe said that the official results were announced within 36 hours while during the 2018 elections, it took almost 66 hours. There might be irregularities but the relevant forums were available to address those grievances.\nIn Sweden, the similar exercise almost took 10 to 11 days while in Indonesia, almost a month was consumed to furnish results, he added.\nTo another question, the prime minister said that mobile phone services were suspended on the polling day due to security threats as the government could not compromise on the security of people.\nOn the other hand, the broadband internet services were available on that day, enabling the people to get connected, he said and rebuffed allegations that the move was aimed at managing the social media.\nHe said there were other occasions throughout the year, when the mobile services had been suspended to avert security threats.\nThe elections in Pakistan were held in a free and fair manner and there was no institutional mechanism to favour any group, he stressed.\nResponding to a query about the prospects of forming a commission to investigate the polls allegations, he maintained that it would be up to the upcoming elected government to make assessments over such demands and decide, but he would not speculate about it.\nRead more: JI's Hafiz Naeem forfeits PS-129 Sindh Assembly seat\nAbout the security threats, he said that there were credible reports of terrorist attacks in the country prior to the election date which could not be divulged in the public domain. A leader of the banned Daesh was neutralized during an operation in Qilla Saifullah who was involved in terrorist attacks in Balochistan.\nThe caretaker prime minister also agreed with the President\u2019s views over the need of introduction of electronic voting machines (EVMs) and said that according to his personal view, the political parties should hold threadbare discussions in the next parliament over the issue and legislate if required so that the new electoral system could be more acceptable to all.\nHe expressed the optimism that after the current transitional period was over and the new government was formed, there would be a positive wave hitting the markets and businesses, adding that economic challenges would still await the next government.\nThe prime minister also hailed the entry of new voters and said that they would make positive contributions to the democratic process in the future.\nTo a question, he said that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had no issue with the privatization process of the caretaker government.\nExpressing his disapproval of the incidents of political confrontation in the recent years, he said that all political parties and society should move beyond such negative trends leading to animosity and tiffs.\n\u201cWe should get rid of this vicious circle of confrontation by changing attitudes. Political differences should not lead to rifts within the society,\u201d he added.\nHe also wished speedy recovery to Mohsin Dawar, a candidate in North Waziristan and said that violent way of protest and agitation should not be taken to a point of anarchy and chaos.\nAbout formation of the new government, the prime minister said that they were eager to hand over reigns of the government to the elected representatives of the people.\nThe speaker of the National Assembly would initiate the required process and he thought that the exercise could take eight to nine days depending upon the outcome of the negotiations of the political parties.\nAPP\nCaretaker Prime Minister Anwaar ul Haq Kakar Addresses Press Conference - 12-02-2204@anwaar_kakar pic.twitter.com/60H7oTDCsW\n"

Both the JI and the GDA experienced significant setbacks, winning only a fraction of the seats they had secured in the 2018 elections. This context adds another layer to their accusations of rigging.\nRehman, the JI Karachi Ameer, told a news conference that he would not avail the PS-129, Karachi seat because the available Form 45 records showed that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) backed independent candidate had actually bagged the majority of votes in the constituency.\n\u201cThe Jamaat-e-Islami has been demanding transparency and fairness in the poll results and it will not seek a single seat or vote that is not cast for it,\u201d he said, adding that this seat was a slap on the face of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).\nDetailing the reasons behind his decision, he said that after a total count of the votes as per Form 45, it emerged that the he (Rehman) bagged 30,464 votes, while the PTI-backed independent received more votes than him. The ECP had declared Rehman the winner with over 26,000 votes.\n\u201cJamaat-e-Islami believes in honesty and high moral values, so he would not avail the seat in favour of the PTI-backed independent candidate,\u201d he said, adding that he did not want to be a part of a \u201cnefarious game\u201d run by the ECP. \u201cIs this called an election,\u201d he posed a question.\nThe JI leader said that Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo Nawaz Sharif, Pakistan Peoples Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and all those who were delivering victory speeches on the basis of rigged and fake mandate should be ashamed.\nThe GDA, meanwhile, which held a meeting in Karachi, with its head Pir Pagara Pir Sibghatullah Shah in the chair, called a protest sit-in on the Hyderabad Bypass on Feb 16, and invited other parties to join their protest against the election rigging.\nAlso read: JI's Hafiz Naeem forfeits PS-129 Sindh Assembly seat\n\u201cWe reject these elections because these were an anti-state election,\u201d Pir Pagara told reporters. \u201cI call this election an anti-state election because [Zulfikar Ali] Bhutto had 60 seats and Mujibur Rahman had 107 seats [in the 1970 elections] and it is in front of everyone when the majority opinion was not accepted.\u201d\nPir Pagara said that a friend had advised him to disband the GDA and contest the election from the platform of his party, the Pakistan Muslim League-Functional (PML-F), by forming an alliance with the PPP Co-chairman Asif Zardari and get his national and provincial assembly seats.\n\u201cBut I said that the GDA can't be abolished, then a reply came that the result will be zero. Zero was written in front of the GDA and 15 was written in front of MQM.\n\u201cThis is not the work of ROs (returning officers). If the entire province was to be handed over to Zardari, then what was the need for an election,\u201d he charged.\n\u201cWe are not anti-state people. We are because of this country. My father (late Pir Pagara Pir Shah Mardan Shah) always supported the army. He always advised us to go with the army but when you don't get respect and justice, we have the right to protest,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe will protest peacefully against this bogus election. We are given two seats in charity? We will return these two seats, Zardari may need them,\u201d he added.\nOn the occasion, GDA leader Safdar Abbasi announced: \u201cOur two assembly members will not take oath.\u201d\nAbbasi said that the alliance would hold a sit-in at the Hyderabad Bypass on Friday. \u201cWe will expand the scope of our protest and contact other parties as well. There will be a protest outside the Sindh Assembly on the day of its maiden session.\u201d\nPir Pagara said that the GDA\u2019s protest would be peaceful and within the ambit of the law and no one would stop any ambulance or family cars during the protest.\n"

Gandapur asserted PTI\u2019s determination to form the government in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.\nHe condemned attempts to alter Form 47s and manipulate the results of winning PTI candidates, labeling such actions as high treason. Gandapur highlighted the gravity of the situation, emphasizing that those responsible for electoral misconduct would be held accountable in due time.\nBackground\nIndependent candidates continued to consolidate their lead in the General Elections 2024 over mainstream political parties, completing the century of victors in the National Assembly for the first time ever, according to the results announced by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) till Saturday.\nBarring a few, independents, backed by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), have crossed the 300 mark, when the number of winners in the provincial assembly were added. They clean-swept the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, and won a sizeable chunk in Punjab, according to the ECP Form-47 results.\nThe PTI could not contest the elections on Thursday because it was denied its electoral symbol of \u2018bat\u2019 due to its controversial intra-party elections. Instead, the party fielded its candidates as independent with different electoral symbols.\nRead:\u00a0Gandapur may be next K-P CM\nBy Saturday, the ECP issued the Form-47 results of 255 National Assembly constituencies. Election could not be held on one National Assembly and three provincial assembly seats because of the death of the candidates. The ECP had also ordered re-polling at one National and two provincial constituencies.\nThe 100 PTI-backed independents are followed by 73 seats of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), 54 of the Pakistan Peoples Party Parliamentarians (PPPP), 17 of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), three each of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI) and PML-Quaid, two of the Istehkam-e-Pakistan Party (IPP) and one each of the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA), PML-Zia, Majlis-e-Wahdat-e-Muslimeen Pakistan (MWMP).\nProvincial assemblies\nAccording to the results, out of 295 Punjab Assembly contests, both the PTI-backed independents and the PML-N won 137 seats each; followed by the PPPP, 10; PML-Q, 7; and the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan, IPP, and PML-Z one seat each.\nIn Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, the PTI-backed independents swept the election, winning 37 National Assembly seats out of 44 and 86 out of 115 provincial assembly contests. In the National Assembly contests, the PTI-backed independents are followed by two seats each of the JUI-F and the PML-N. One seat each went to the MWMP, the PPP and a non-PTI independent.\nThe independents routed opponents in Chitral, Swat, Upper Dir, Lower Dir, Malakand, Buner, Battagram, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Swabi, Mardan, Charsadda, Nowshera, Khyber, Mohmand, Kohat, Hangu, Orakzai, Karak, Bannu, Lakki Marwat, South Waziristan, and Tank.\n\u00a0\n"

The LWMC, with an an nual budget of Rs15 billion, is now under scrutiny as foreign entities seek to take over its operations, potentially doubling the expenditure to over Rs28 billion. With ample resources and manpower, the LWMC has the capability to tackle the city\u2019s sanitation challenges through effective business strategies and sanitation initiatives.\nThe impending decision poses a significant test for the newly appointed Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif, who must weigh the options between maintaining operations within a constrained budget or outsourcing to foreign firms at a significantly higher cost. Responsibilities for cleaning, garbage collection, and disposal in Lahore city fall under LWMC\u2019s purview. Previously, during the PML-N regime in 2003-2004, these tasks were managed by the Metropolitan Corporation with an annual budget of Rs2.5 billion. However, contracts awarded to foreign companies resulted in escalating costs, reaching over 15 billion rupees.\nDespite the LWMC\u2019s efforts, which included taking loans from the Punjab government to sustain operations, the company\u2019s debt has surpassed Rs100 billion. Plans to impose garbage taxes for revenue generation were stalled by the Punjab government\u2019s lack of approval. While LWMC has made strides in improving sanitation independently after\u00a0terminating contracts\nwith foreign companies, challenges persist. The company now primarily handles garbage collection across the city, with secondary collection outsourced. Although the sanitation system has shown signs of improvement, further enhancements are warranted.\nC i t i z e n s , i n c l u d i n g Muhammad Naseem, Muhammad Akbar, and Farhan Mehmood, acknowledge the city\u2019s sanitation improvements but advocate for continued efforts to execute LWMC\u2019s business plan effectively. CEO Sahib Din Babar affirmed the commitment to Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif\u2019s vision of transforming Lahore into a model city for cleanliness. He highlighted LWMC\u2019s success in enhancing cleaning operations and reducing expenses since terminating contracts with foreign firms.\n"

This is not a research institute, this initiative is related to the integrity of Pakistan.\u201d\n\nSadia said, \u201cCalling other countries and institutions to interfere in internal affairs is a very wrong move. This is a new tradition being introduced \u2026 the work of the country should be done within the country.\u201d\n\nSenator Sadia also raised the issue of shortage of passports, saying that for the first time, there was a shortage of passports in the country.\n\n\u201cIt is like deliberately insulting the people,\u201d she said, adding that the people were asked to apply on Fast Track.\n\nShe demanded calling the director general passport and seeking an answer from him.\n\nAddressing the meeting, Senator Kamran Murtaza said that the situation in Balochistan was worse due to the rains while the higher-ups were involved in manipulation.\n\n\u201cThe provincial nor the federal government were paying attention to Balochistan,\u201d he said, demanding that the people's problems should be solved.\n\n\u201cAttention should be paid to Balochistan.\u201d\n\nSenator Tahir Bizenjo said that heavy rains had occurred in Balochistan due to which Gwadar was completely submerged.\nLike the Election Commission, Bizenjo said, the situation of PDMA and NDMA was also bad, accusing them of stealing the money that would come for the relief of the people.\n\nHe demanded that the aid that comes should go to the deserving people.\n\nPTI Senator Aoun Abbas Bipi said that as the farewell session of the Senate was going on, production orders of Senator Ejaz Chaudhry should have been issued.\n\n\u201cMany PTI women are in jails, no one talks about them,\u201d he said. \u201cOur Senator Shibli Faraz has not come to this house for several months. No one asked why they are not coming or where they are.\u201d\n\nSenator Bahramand Tangi asked about NADRA and WAPDA that domestic institutions had more employees and less revenue.\n\n\u201cInstitutions are running in losses. How long will we continue like this?\u201d\n\nCaretaker Information Minister Murtaza Solangi said the ministry did not give any response.\n\nThe deputy chairman said, \u201cSolangi Sahib, you have not given any answer today, but still thank you for your visit.\u201d\n\nSenator Dinesh Kumar raised the issue of shortage of medicine at the National Institute for Rehabilitation of Handicapped.\n\n\u201cThe institution does not have medicine for the poor. What a joke! Whenever it comes to the poor, it becomes a joke,\u201d Kumar said, adding that there was a shortage of medicines at hospitals in Islamabad.\n\nHe asked what the bureaucracy and the Ministry of Health were doing.\n\nSenator Murtaza said that the prices of life-saving medicines had been increased.\n\n\u201cIt is now being said that the incoming minister will give an answer, he will say, ask the caretakers.\u201d\n\n"

The consultative session is expected to see additional names being scrutinised for potential inclusion in the cabinet list.\n\nThe cabinet formation is likely to take place in two phases. Initially, independent members and individuals affiliated with the PML-Q will take their place in the cabinet.\n\nThe subsequent phase will witness the inclusion of members from the IPP and other allied parties.\n\nMeanwhile, amid the political intrigue, the PML-N has reportedly locked in the names of some key figures for the cabinet.\n"

            "Text": "A former interior minister of the incumbent caretaker government, becoming a Balochistan chief minister, despite the constitutional bar on him on contesting elections, does away with any doubt that Pakistan is effectively a banana republic, Justice (retd) Wajihuddin Ahmed said.\nOther experts even from the PML-N concurred with the view that there was an unambiguous bar in the Constitution of Pakistan on members of the caretaker government from contesting general elections, terming Sarfraz Bugti\u2019s instance as another unfortunate example of mockery of law by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).\nAn ECP official on the other hand refuted any illegality in this regard stating that his organisation was of the sound view that there was no ban on those members of the caretaker cabinet, neither the PM nor the CM, who had resigned even a minute before the elections.\nThe newly elected 25th Balochistan CM, Bugti, served as an interior minister from Aug 2023 to Dec 2023 and resigned some seven weeks before the general elections after remaining in the second most powerful office after the PM for over four months.\nEven then there were murmurs that Bugti, given his role in tackling Imran Khan\u2019s party, had won the blessings of the powerful quarters, and had been promised a powerful position in Balochistan.\nThen some section of the media reported that as the election schedule had not been announced, his resignation would qualify him to contest the elections.\nArticle 224 subsection 1(B) places an unequivocal ban on members of the caretaker cabinet, PM and CM included and their immediate family members, from contesting the following elections.\nThis article does not draw any distinction between serving members of the cabinet or otherwise.\nJustice (retd) Ahmed said it was unfortunate on the part of the ECP that they allowed Bugti to contest the elections despite him having served as an interior minister.\nHe said Bugti was part of the caretaker government, and when he resigned was irrelevant. \u201cEven if his stay there was a brief stint, he became a part of the caretaker government and by that definition, he is ineligible to even contest elections let alone becoming a CM.\u201d\nHe also objected to former Punjab CM Mohsin Naqvi being given a coveted slot on the Pakistan Cricket Board. He said that this was the second time a caretaker Punjab CM was bestowed with this lucrative position.\nHe, however, clarified that nowhere in the Constitution was there any bar on being given such a position but this was against the spirit of the Constitution.\nIncidentally, both the caretaker CMs played a very controversial role during the respective elections.\nFormer ECP secretary Kanwar Dilshad concurred with the view of the Justice (retd) Ahmed, stating that this was a blatant violation of Article 224 of the Constitution.\nHe said the ECP had taken a different view on it and the matter would end up in the superior court.\nHe in fact said that some well-reputed NGO should take up this matter before the SC to right this wrong. He said that if this practice was not nipped in the bud now, it would be the beginning of unfortunate events.\nHe said that if one was to subscribe to the ECP\u2019s view, then that would mean that even the caretaker PM could contest elections, if he resigned a minute before filing his nomination papers.\nFormer Punjab CM and senior political analyst Hasan Askari said that in his opinion, \u201cthis is illegal and against the will of the Constitution\u201d.\nHe said the ECP and Bugti in their view might exploit an ambiguity in the law but he said that in his opinion, Bugti, once chose to become part of the caretaker government, lost the right to contest these elections. The ECP having allowed this was no surprise, as here many major illegalities were committed by the caretaker governments and no one took cognisance of it just because of the backing of the establishment.\nHe also objected to the caretaker Punjab CM being giving a position on the PCB, saying that it was against the spirit of the Constitution and akin to luring him into functioning favourably for one party.\nAn official of the ECP, however, questioned the view point of the experts, asking that as the Constitution explicitly states that only the caretaker members could not contest elections, how that could be applied to someone who resigned.\nHe said the ECP was of the view that even if the caretaker PM resigned before the elections, he too was entitled to contest the elections.\nHe said that if this was such a glaring irregularity, Bugti\u2019s opponent should have taken this up before the ECP and then the court.\n"

            "Text": "Ahead of the vote for the country\u2019s next prime minister, the PTI staged nationwide protests on Saturday against alleged rigging in the February 8 general elections. During the demonstrations, clashes with police resulted in the rounding up of some activists of the former ruling party.\nIn Punjab\u2019s provincial capital, hundreds of PTI supporters, including members of the Insaf Lawyers Forum (ILF), gathered at GPO Chowk near the Lahore High Court (LHC) building, staging a vocal demonstration.\nHowever, law enforcement personnel resorted to wielding batons to disperse agitated PTI adherents, detaining several leaders and activists, including Mian Shehzad Farooq, Hafiz Zeeshan, and Supreme Court Bar Association former secretary Aftab Bajwa.\nAmid fervent chants, PTI loyalists praised former prime minister Imran Khan while casting doubt on the integrity of the elections and alleging manipulation. The demonstrators demanded justice and the release of both the PTI founder and fellow party members.\nAccording to reports, a police contingent was deployed near the court before the protest started, and arrests were made once protestors gathered there. Police action resulted in dispersing the remaining protestors.\nElsewhere in the city, PTI loyalists poured onto the streets to voice their discontent with the purported electoral irregularities. A protest procession led by PTI provincial lawmaker Ali Imtiaz Waraich meandered from Cavalry Ground, while similar demonstrations took place in Shahdara and outside the Lahore Commissioner's Office.\nHundreds of PTI supporters also gathered at Rawalpindi\u2019s Liaquat Bagh before marching to Islamabad.\nUpon reaching the federal capital, PTI leader Sher Afzal Marwat addressed party activists, stating that the PTI would continue protesting until Imran Khan is released from jail and the seats stolen through rigging are restored to the party.\nAlso read: PTI decries speaker polls sans reserved seats\nHe urged the Supreme Court to take notice of the violation of Pakistanis\u2019 fundamental rights under the judiciary\u2019s watch.\n\u201cImran Khan, Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Parvez Elahi, Bushra Bibi, Yasmin Rashid, Sanam Javed, and other PTI leaders have been unjustly jailed by the fascist regime imposed on us for the past two years,\u201d he said.\nMarwat stated that Imran\u2019s only fault was that he said \u201cabsolutely not\u201d to the United States and strived for the \u201chaqeeqi azaadi\u201d\u2014true freedom\u2014of the people of Pakistan.\n\u201cWe will continue our struggle and protest in the courts, parliament, and on the streets until Imran is released and our mandate is recovered,\u201d the PTI leader said.\nThe PTI also held a protest demonstration outside the Karachi Press Club against alleged electoral fraud. PTI leaders, including Firdous Shamim Naqvi, Attaullah Khan, Aftab Jahangir, Alamgir Khan, Jamal Siddiqui, Fozia Zeeshan, and Saifur Rahman, addressed the protesters.\nThey called upon authorities to take notice of the alleged rigging and ensure that the mandate is respected.\nThey claimed that the elections were stolen from the party across the country, including Karachi. They alleged that defeated candidates were installed using Form 47. Despite this, they said, prominent politicians faced defeat at the hands of PTI workers.\n\"We will continue our protest to obtain our mandate. We will fight the legal and political battle. We will send our successful candidates to the assembly with our mandate.\n\u201cWe demand the Chief Justice of Pakistan to ensure the respect of the vote. Investigate the rigging and return our stolen mandate. We will not compromise on our demands at any cost,\" Naqvi said.\nA spokesperson for PTI also vehemently criticized law enforcement and governmental apparatuses for impeding the constitutional prerogative of conducting peaceful protests.\n\"In response to the clarion call of our leader, Imran Khan, the citizens of Pakistan have taken to the streets en masse to reclaim their allegedly pilfered mandate.\n\u201cThe administration, having secured power through a spurious mandate, exhibits trepidation by resorting to unconstitutional measures to stifle peaceful dissent,\" said a statement issued by PTI\u2019s central media department.\nThe spokesperson contended that the populace would not countenance the imposition of deceitful actors on the nation based on fraudulent electoral forms.\n\"The trajectory of Pakistan's future is intertwined with democracy, thus the citizenry should be accorded their constitutional entitlement to shape the course of governance.\n\"The PTI remains resolute in its nonviolent crusade within the contours of constitutional and legal frameworks to reclaim the purportedly usurped mandate,\" the spokesperson said.\n"

        },
        "Details": {
            "Text": "The Islamabad High Court has declared the capital's Deputy Commissioner (DC), Irfan Nawaz Memon, Superintendent of Police (SSP) Operations Jameel Zafar, and Station House Officer (SHO) Naseer Manzoor guilty in a contempt matter regarding the issuance of detention orders of the PTI workers in violation of the court orders.\n\"In view of the principle of proportionality and the settled principle of fairness that higher the authority the greater his responsibility, this court holds that (i) Respondent No 1, DC Irfan Nawaz Memon, is guilty of contempt of court and shall be punished with six months simple imprisonment and Rs100,000 in fine, (ii) Respondent No 2, SSP Malik Jameel Zafar, is guilty of contempt of court and shall be punished with four months simple imprisonment and Rs100,000 in fine, and (iii) Respondent No 4, SHO Nasir Manzoor, is guilty of contempt of court and shall be punished with two months of simple imprisonment and Rs100,000 in fine.\nRespondent Nos 1, 2 and 4 will serve their sentence at Adiala Jail,\" a written order authored by Justice Babar Sattar says.\nThe judgement notes that the respondents have a right to appeal this verdict before a division bench of this court within 30 days pursuant to Section 19 of the Ordinance.\n\"As the sentence awarded constitutes a short sentence and the convicted respondents being public servants do not pose a flight risk, the sentence awarded shall stay suspended for a period of 30 days to enable the respondents to avail their remedy of appeal.\nIn suspending this sentence this court has also taken account the fact that Respondent Nos 1, 2 and 4 occupy public offices and their sudden removal therefrom could adversely affect public convenience.\n\u201cThe suspension of this sentence would enable the government to respond to this verdict without causing inconvenience to the citizens. If the right of appeal is not availed or if the sentence is not suspended in appeal, Respondents No 1, 2 and 4 will be taken into custody upon expiry of the 30-day period.\"\nThe court also directed prime minister of Pakistan to investigate whether DCs across Pakistan who continued to issue detention orders under MPO in breach of the law and Constitution and judicial orders were acting in an organised manner on the basis of illegal orders, and if so, take appropriate remedial action to ensure that the authority of the state to be exercised through chosen representatives of people, continues to be exercised according to the Constitution and the law.\"\nThe judgment said representative democracy was a salient feature of \u201cour Constitution\u201d, adding that executive authority was vested in the elected representatives of the people. Article 2A of the Constitution provides that \u201cthe state shall exercise its authority through the chosen representative of the people\u201d.\n\"A civil bureaucracy, that Respondents No 1, 2 and 4 belong to, can only exercise such authority as vested in it by law. The Constitution and the law envisage that public officials, as representatives of the executive arm of the state, will exercise state authority as a trust to uphold and enforce the law in the interest of citizens of Pakistan.\"\nIt said that it cannot be countenanced that public officials would wield the law as a weapon to oppress their fellow citizens and deny them their fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution.\n\"It can also not be conceived that public officials serving as part of the executive branch of the state would wield their powers to undermine and frustrate decisions rendered by the judicial branch of the state.\n\u201cBased on the material before this Court, as discussed above at length, this Court is of the prima facie view that the synchronized issuance of detention orders by Deputy Commissioner Islamabad and those in other parts of the country was part of a deliberate policy measure executed by public officials in control of the executive branch of the state from May 2023 onward, with the object of establishing for the consumption of all and sundry that only state organ capable of allowing citizens access to their fundamental rights was the executive itself.\n\u201cSuch policy and actions taken in its pursuit threaten the concept of separation of powers, which is a salient feature of the Constitution. They also threaten the existence of the Judiciary as an independent pillar of the state conferred with the responsibility of adjudicating grievances between the citizens and the state. If such policy of deliberate and calculated disregard for fundamental rights of citizens and rendering dysfunctional the machinery for enforcement of fundamental rights in the form of an independent Judiciary is allowed to persevere, there can be no rule of law in Pakistan. Further, the very existence and utility of the Constitution would come into question. This Court therefore feels that there is need to investigate whether there was an organized policy to use detention orders issued under the MPO to scuttle the fundamental rights of citizens and undermine the Judiciary.\n\"Such investigation, to be meaningful, must be undertaken and overseen by the head of the executive branch of the state.\"\nThe judgement noted that between May 9, 2023 and Nov 2, 2023, DC Memon issued some 69 detention orders in exercise of power under Section 3 of the MPO.\nThe cumulative period of detention that he ordered those who were on the receiving end exceeded 1,000 days. Over two dozen petitions were filed before Islamabad High Court challenging these orders.\nThese cases were marked before seven out of the eight judges comprising the IHC.\nExcept for two cases, where detention orders were issued out of concern for sectarian violence, not one order detaining political workers on grounds of incitement of violence sustained judicial scrutiny.\n\"The court said that respondents were also advised that rendering an unconditional apology would amount to admission that the conduct in question that caused the initiation of show cause proceedings was indeed contemptuous. However, in the event that they sought to justify their conduct and defend themselves they would be afforded complete opportunity to do so in accordance with their rights guaranteed under Article 10A of the Constitution. None of the respondents filed any apology. They chose to justify and defend their actions by producing affidavits and relying on the record summarized above to justify their actions of soliciting and/or issuing detention orders under MPO.\"\nThe court also said that in Pakistan, like other constitutional states, public authority flows from the Constitution and Constitution alone.\n\"There is no other source of authority. The feature distinguishing legal authority from brute force is legitimacy. In a polity functioning under the Constitution, the concept of de facto power is akin to the concept of brute force.\n\"It is devoid of legitimacy. The only power that is clothed with legality and legitimacy is that which flows from the law and the Constitution and is thus de jure. The existence and exercise of de facto power in a state administered under a Constitution is the manifestation of weak constitutionalism and speaks to the need to reduce the gap between the law and its implementation.\n\"The courts of law established under the Constitution and exercising authority vested by law, can never recognize or legitimize de facto power (referred to as ground realities in the vernacular). Doing so would delegitimize the courts themselves.\"\nThe judgement said that a DC or police officer has no authority other than that vested by law and no jurisdiction to exercise it except as mandated by law.\n\"The actions of public officials are protected by law in so far as they are backed by it. Their source of authority over fellow citizens is the authority of law, not personal authority that be exercised at whim or on the basis of an illegal command.\n\u201cPublic officials are responsible and accountable for their actions just as private citizens, if not more. The doctrine of agency underlying personal liability is fully applicable to the actions of public office holders\"\nThe judgement also notes that the counsel for DC emphasised repeatedly that the District Intelligence Committee comprised heavyweights, such as respondents No 1 and 2, representatives of IB, ISI, MI, Rangers, Special Branch and the 111-Brigade.\n\"The only noteworthy aspect of the composition of the District Intelligence Committee (DIC), unfortunately, is the poverty of the opinion rendered by it based on conjectural reports issued by the Special Branch and IB, which any reasonable mind with no security and intelligence training would be able to identify as utterly lacking of substance.\n\u201cWhat is also interesting is that while the DIC, Rawalpindi, with composition similar to that of DIC Islamabad, advised DC Rawalpindi that Shehryar Afridi was no longer a threat to public order and safety, the very next day DIC Islamabad came to the opposite conclusion ie that Shehryar Afridi had become a threat to public order and safety in Islamabad, some 30km away from Rawalpindi where he was no longer a threat to public order.\n\u201cThe DIC Islamabad was constituted by Chief Commissioner Islamabad by notification dated 10.05.2018. Such committee is neither created under a statute nor is vested with any authority by law.\n\"The DIC is merely a means to coordinate action between different agencies that have their own legal mandate in Islamabad. Clause (xx) of the DIC\u2019s Terms of Reference (TOR) provides that \u2018the committee members shall perform functions and duties within their respective organizational mandate\u2019.\n\u201cThe DIC\u2019s opinion therefore doesn\u2019t feature even as a fig leaf to justify the illegal and contumacious conduct of respondents No 1, 2 and 4 in soliciting and issuing detention order dated 08-08-2023.\"\nThe judgement said that even otherwise, Article 243 of the Constitution clearly provides that the federal government shall have control and command of the armed forces.\n\"Our system of governance, established under the Constitution, is that of representative democracy. The Armed Forces are a subset of the Executive, as a subordinate of the elected civilian government, which act in aid of civil power under Article 245 of the Constitution when asked to do so by the Federal Government. The emphasis of the learned counsel for Respondent No 1 on the inclusion of military officers within the DIC that supported the issuance of detention order dated 08.08.2023, as if that is some magic wand that will miraculously get the respondents off the hook, is misconceived to put it politely. Neither the DIC nor any members of the DIC, whether serving in the Armed Forces or in intelligence agencies, had any authority over respondents No 1, 2 and 4. Neither the reports issued by the Special Branch or by Intelligence Bureau nor the opinion of DIC was binding on respondent No 1.\n\u201cIn their capacity as the Deputy Commissioner and Senior Superintendent of Police (Operations), Respondents No 1 and 2, respectively, were neither assets nor stooges of security agencies.\n\"They cannot hide behind members of intelligence or security agencies when found liable for dereliction of the duty, illegal conduct and obstruction of justice.\"\nThe judgment said that it was not the intelligence operatives or even ministers, who had authority to generate requests for issuance of detention orders that respondents No 2 and 4 did, adding that and securities agencies had no power to issue the detention orders that respondent No 1 issued.\n"

The rainfall disrupted the daily life in various parts of the country, especially in Sindh and Balochistan, and caused great inconvenience to the travellers. The rain also compelled the people to remain indoors to stay warm.\nAt least three children were killed and another sustained injuries as the roof of a house collapsed due to rains in Kharan district of Balochistan. In Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, an eight-month-old girl was among five people killed in rain related incidents.\nSo far, Gwadar has been the worst-affected, where incessant rain in several areas caused havoc, damaging houses. The Balochistan government and other rescue organisations, including Edhi Foundation, along with security personnel, started relief activities.\nTeams of the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA), in coordination with the National Highway Authority (NHA), were also operationalised on highways to keep the roads open. The army, navy and the Frontier Corps were engaged in a relief operation in Gwadar, Jiwani, and Subandar areas.\nLight to heavy rains also pummelled different parts of Karachi, which disrupted the flight schedule. There was high alert in the province because of the rain. Hyderabad city also received light to moderate rainfall with the downpour sporadically continuing throughout the day.\nUpcountry areas\nIn the federal capital, the rain of moderate to heavy intensity started at midnight and continued till Friday evening. Mercury also dropped in Punjab amid intermittent drizzle. Weather was cold in Lahore and Multan. The rain also cleared smog conditions in Lahore.\nFurther north, the famous skiing resort of Malam Jabba was snow blanketed after receiving heavy snowfall that attracted tourists and adventure sports lovers in droves. Besides Kalam, Madian and Bahrain, the upper Swat also received moderate to heavy snowfall.\nVarious roads were closed due to severe snowfall in the vicinity of Lowari Tunnel, Kalam and Malam Jabba. The work of rescuing the passengers has been started. The work of removing snow from the roads was started by the army last night.\nIn Punjab, the PDMA has forecast heavy snowfall and rain in Muree and Galiyat over the next few days. PDMA Punjab Director General Imran Qureshi urged the local administration to ensure safety measures to mitigate any potential risks.\nHe appealed to tourists to cooperate with the administration during this time. Tourists should carefully plan their journeys, taking into account the anticipated heavy snow in Murree and severe weather conditions, said Qureshi.\nAccording to the PMD, light to heavy rainfall and snowfall with windstorm, thunderstorms and isolated hailstorm were expected in most parts of the country on Saturday (today).\n"

            "Text": "Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) candidate Sarfraz Ahmed Bugti on Friday emerged triumphant in the race for the Balochistan chief minister, securing an uncontested victory as no other contender submitted nomination papers for the coveted position.\nThe official announcement of Bugti's nomination as CM is scheduled for 11am today during the provincial assembly session. The swearing-in ceremony for the newly elected chief executive of Balochistan will be held on Saturday evening at the Governor House in Quetta.\nBugti, the former caretaker interior minister and ex-provincial information minister, presented four nomination papers for the chief ministership in Balochistan to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) office.\nAfter submitting his nomination papers for the Balochistan CM\u2019s position, Bugti held out an olive branch to disgruntled Baloch leaders, emphasising decisive action against those who were taking the law into their own hands.\n\"My party, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), believes in dialogue and reconciliation,\" Bugti told The Express Tribune.\nHe vowed to ensure writ of the government.\nHaving resigned as the caretaker interior minister in December last year, the politician joined the ranks of the PPP.\nProposed by the PPP, Bugti garnered support from leaders such as Nawab Sanaullah Khan Zehri and Sardar Sarfaraz Chakar Domki of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N).\nBased on the preliminary results of the 2024 nationwide elections, the PML-N secured the top position by winning 11 Balochistan Assembly seats, equivalent to the seats won by the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F).\nMeanwhile, the PPP secured victories on 10 seats.\nPost-election, the PML-N and PPP forged an alliance, pledging mutual support in forming governments at the national and provincial levels.\nIn the wake of the alliance and securing a majority in Sindh, the PPP announced its intention to establish its government in Balochistan.\nThe PML-N, along with the Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) and the Awami National Party (ANP), emerged as major coalition partners in the province.\nOn Friday evening, Balochistan Assembly Speaker Captain (retd) Khaliq Achakzai told media persons that Bugti was the new CM of Balochistan.\nBacking Bugti on extending an olive branch to the disgruntled Baloch leaders, Achakzai said that no issue could be addressed without talks and the same formula would be applied in Balochistan. He hinted at action against those who were playing with the lives of innocent people.\nIn response to a question, Bugti, who was present, stated that merit would be ensured in all government departments and that nobody would be allowed to violate the merit.\nHe vowed that nobody would be allowed to sell government jobs.\n\"Those who are involved in selling jobs will be put behind bars,\" he warned.\nBugti said it was the worst precedent that jobs were being sold in Balochistan.\n\"I will stop this filthy process,\" he assured.\nThe PPP and PML-N have decided to form a coalition government in Balochistan.\nThe slot of the CM has been given to the PPP, whereas, the slot of the governor of Balochistan and speaker have been given to the PML-N.\n"

            "Text": "\u00a0\nPashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP)\u2019s leader Mahmood Khan Achakzai came to the newly-elected National Assembly on Friday with a purpose, as he not only demanded that Constitution should be respected, but also the supremacy of parliament be taken as the red line by all.\nIn his no-hold-barred speech, the PkMAP leader not only showed the courage to point out establishment\u2019s role in politics and demanded that the interference should now stop. While admitting that the people have given mandate to jailed PTI leader Imran Khan, the veteran politician demanded that he should be released forthwith.\nReferring to a line in oath, which states that the oath-taker would continue to abide by the Constitution and defend it, Achakzai said that everyone knows that the establishment continued to play with the Constitution, asking: \u201cHow could we defend the Constitution\u201d.\nAchakzai regretted that some people wanted to turn the house, representing the people of Pakistan, into a cattle market. Currently, Achakzai said that the politics had reached to a point where the one who was sold or the one, who was buying a politician, were considered loyals, but the one who refuses to become part of this sell and purchase was declared a traitor. \u201cTo hell with such approach,\u201d he said.\nCalling PPP a democratic party, recalling PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif used to raise the slogan of \u2018Vote Ko Izzat Do [respect the vote] and stressing that Imran Khan had come in parliament via vote, Achakzai suggested that a resolution should be passed that \u201cthe establishment and security institutions will have no role in the politics of Pakistan.\u201d It\u2019s not a bad thing to suggest, he said, adding that all these parties admit that and were not oblivious to such interference.\nIn his speech, Achakzai said that the house should also pass a resolution that parliament will be the real source of Pakistan\u2019s internal and external policies. \u201cOnly it [parliament] will make polices and no general will come in it,\u201d he said amid desk thumping.\nEmphasising the importance of having an army and intelligence agencies, Achakzai said that they themselves should show grace and truly disassociate themselves from politics, otherwise, people\u2019s power would be utilised to push them back to garrisons.\nAchakzai said that all the politicians from Jati Umra \u2013 the Sharifs brothers\u2019 residence in Lahore \u2013 to the incarcerated PTI chairman would salute all the judges, politicians and political workers, who respected the Constitution, adding that all those who disrespected it were \u201cMurdabad\u201d [down with violators].\nAddressing the newly-elected National Assembly Speaker, Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, Achakzai said that parliament was attacked this time around as well, recalling that democratic and non-democratic forces had been fighting since Pakistan came into being.\nHe, however, lauded thousands of Punjabi, Sindhi, Pashtun and other political workers, who, while defying all odds, turn the tables on \u201cyours and the generals\u2019 plans\u201d about the recently-concluded general elections.\n\u201cOtherwise, you all had already distributed all the key offices among yourselves,\u201d he said, questioning: \u201cIf it all was inherited from one\u2019s father.\u201d He said: \u201cBravo those workers, regardless of their political affiliation,\u201d adding that they swept away the system like a flood.\nRecalling how judges were sent packing for opposing martial laws, he demanded that parliament should pass a resolution that all those judges, who opposed martial laws, should be declared \u201cheroes of the Constitution\u201d.\nHe demanded that their families should be given financial support, while those who supported martial laws should be stripped off of all the perks and privileges. This, he said, was the way forward to save and run Pakistan.\nHe demanded that all the common citizens, who sacrificed their lives for democracy should be declared \u201cheroes and martyrs of democracy\u201d regardless of their ethnicity or faith. He demanded that all the three major political parties \u2013 PMLN, PPPP and PTI \u2013 should say it on oath that parliament would be the real source of power and no general or spy agency would be allowed to interfere in politics.\nHe alleged that the men in uniform, who took bribes from anyone, should be sacked. \u201cJudges, generals and all of us should repent for what we have done to Pakistan. The generals should continue working within their constitutional framework. \u201cThe people have high hopes from parliament.\u201d\n"

A day later, on Jan 31, an accountability court sentenced the former PM and his wife to 14 years in prison in the gift repository case.\nOn Monday, the IHC bench will also consider the bail applications of the accused individuals, seeking suspension of the sentences handed down by the trial courts just a week before the Feb 8 general elections.\n\nAdditionally, a division bench consisting of Justice Farooq and Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri will hear on Monday, Feb 26, the post-arrest bail applications of the PTI founder and his wife in the \u00a3190m corruption case.\n\nMeanwhile, an anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Lahore extended until March 1 the interim bail granted to Imran in seven different cases of vandalism registered after the May 9, 2023 riots.\n\nDuring the proceedings, ATC Judge Arshad Javed expressed his annoyance with the Adiala Jail authorities, who failed to ensure the former premier's appearance in court through video link or WhatsApp call.\n\nImran has been detained at the prison facility in Rawalpindi since September last year.\n\nThe court remarked during the hearing that the Adiala Jail superintendent had committed contempt of court. However, the judge noted that if action was taken against the superintendent, the decision on the accused's bail might be delayed.\n\nDeputy Prosecutor Abdul Jabbar Dogar did not object to deciding the bail applications on merit. He took the position that the presence of the accused in the courtroom was not crucial.\n\n\u201cEveryone knows that the founder of PTI is in Adiala Jail. It is better to complete arguments on bail in his absence.\u201d\nThe PTI founder's lawyer, Barrister Salman Safdar, agreed with the proposal to present arguments on the bail extension.\nThe ATC later decided to proceed with the court proceedings in the absence of the accused and extended his interim bail until March 1.\n\n"

It was closed after every two hours until 6pm to restore the two-way traffic.\n\nThe first closure of the highway in Bhasha took place from 8am to 10am.\n\nIt was opened for traffic from 10am to 11pm.\n\nThe second time the main artery was shut down in Bhasha was from 12pm to 2pm while it was reopened for traffic from 2pm to 3pm.\n\nThe restoration work later continued on the highway from 3pm to 5pm.\n\nThe highway was completely opened for traffic from 6pm onwards.\n\nThousands of passengers, who were stuck on both sides since two days, said the work of removing the debris in Bhasha was very slow.\n\nThese passengers included elderly people, children, and women who were unable to continue towards their destinations and spent the two days in extremely harsh weather conditions without the facilities of food or accommodation.\n\nMaking matter worse, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) on Friday issued an advisory to all provincial authorities expecting thunderstorms forecasted across the country.\n\nAccording to the NDMA technical team and Met department, a westerly wave is expected to enter the region from February 25 to February 27.\n\nThe forecast indicates potential rain, wind, thunderstorms, and snowfall over hilly areas in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan, Galiyat region, and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).\n\nThe advisory warns possible disruptions in roadways in various areas including Murree, Naran, Kaghan, Dir, Swat, Kohistan, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Shangla, Astore, Hunza, Skardu, Neelum valley, Bagh, Poonch, and Haveli during this period.\n\nThe advisory highlights the risk of landslides, mudslides, rain spells, and snowfall, leading to potential road blockages in the upper area of K-P, Galiyat region, AJK, and G-B.\n\nThe combination of snowfall and rain is expected to result in a significant drop in temperatures.\n\nIn Balochistan and southern Punjab, heavy rainfall is expected that might trigger flash flooding in the nullahs there. The advisory alerts about the potential for landslides and mudslides, leading to road blockages because of isolated rain spells.\n\nThe NDMA has urged all provincial disaster management authorities, Gilgit-Baltistan Disaster Management Authority, State Disaster Management Authority, the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) administration, National Highway Authority, National Highways and Motorway Police, Frontier Works Organisation, Rescue 1122, dam authorities, line departments, ministries, and federal agencies to undertake necessary measures in line with their respective mandates.\n\n"

The ECP adjourned the hearing till Feb 27.\nSimilarly, the bench took up Yasmin Rashid\u2019s plea against rigging in the NA-130 Lahore constituency. The bench sought a report from the returning officer and adjourned the hearing till Feb 27.\nEarlier this week, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) suspended the victory notifications of the PML-N candidates from the three Islamabad NA constituencies. A two-member division bench comprising Justice Mian Gul Hassan Aurangzeb and Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir suspended the notification of the success of Anjum Aqeel Khan from NA-46, Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhary from NA 47, Raja Khurram Shahzad Nawaz from NA-48.\nDuring the hearing of intra-court appeals filed by Aamir Mughal, Shoaib Shaheen Advocate and Ali Bukhari against the election results, Shoaib Shaheen Advocate said that he received around 380 Forms 45 that night.\nThe complainant further informed the court that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) then issued an order to the RO to stop the final consolidation and sought a report within three days, but it has not been submitted yet.\nThe court then suspended the notification of the victory of the candidates of the three constituencies. The court\u2019s decision followed intra-court appeals filed against the election results.\n"

This is the same location where the IT University was being constructed, said Justice Musarrat Hilali during the proceeding.\nResponding to the court\u2019s queries, the CDA lawyer stated that the contract with the company was terminated after consultation.

It is commendable that an international university is expanding its presence in Pakistan. While we're not singling out anyone, many people were given land free of cost for educational institutions in Pakistan. We are keen on encouraging foreign investment, and it is a good thing that an outsider is establishing a university.\nJustice Musarrat Hilali pointed out that earlier access to the land was denied because it was under consideration by someone else, and now foreign investment interest has emerged.\nThe court\u2019s ruling highlighted that the lease of Rs483.960 million was signed between the International Company and CDA for 41.2 acres of land on Islamabad Curry Road. The company was obligated to make the remaining payment of Rs170 million. The court specified that the land allocated should strictly be used for university purposes only.\n"

            "Text": "The outstanding dues of power projects of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) have alarmingly increased to a record Rs493 billion or $1.8 billion as of last month, showing an increase of over three-fourths in a span of just seven months.\nThe massive surge in the dues of the Chinese energy projects during the time of the caretaker government may become a serious issue for Pakistan in managing its economic relations with Beijing.\nSources told The Express Tribune that as of end January, Pakistan owed around Rs493 billion to Chinese power generation and transmission projects. The amount is Rs214 billion or 77% higher than June last year, according to the sources.\nThe major reason behind the surge in the dues was the failure of the Power Division to settle at least 90% of the monthly claims filed by these power generation and transmission projects. The sources said that for the month of June, the power plants had submitted Rs110 billion worth of claims. But the Power Division settled less than Rs60 billion or about 53% of the monthly claims.\nLast month, China linked the approval of a $600 million new foreign commercial loan with the prior settlement of the debt that Pakistan owes to the Chinese power plants. It was rare on the part of any country to link a foreign commercial loan with any prior action, indicating resentment in the Chinese camps.\nPakistan had requested the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and the Bank of China for a total loan of $600 million. Each bank had been approached for $300 million in financing. Pakistan\u2019s authorities had hoped that they would get the loans in December.\nUnder the Energy Framework Agreement of the CPEC, Pakistan had committed to setting up a revolving fund and depositing an amount equal to 21% of the invoices generated for power payments. The 21% is the sum that the Pakistani authorities fail to collect, adding to the vicious power sector circular debt. The arrangement had been sought to protect Chinese firms from circular debt.\nBut instead of setting up a fund, Pakistan in October 2022 opened a Pakistan Energy Revolving Account (PERA) at the State Bank of Pakistan with Rs48 billion in annual allocations with a condition to withdraw a maximum of Rs4 billion per month. As a result, the Chinese IPPs\u2019 debt is now hovering around Rs400 billion.\nThe sources said that the government has again allowed settling only Rs4 billion of the Chinese energy debt in February, indicating that it does not see any urgency to solve the dispute. The Rs4 billion monthly allocations are not sufficient to settle the monthly inflow, leaving the stock unsettled.\n\nRead\u00a0Third party inclusion to boost CPEC benefits\nThe report showed that out of Rs493 billion, Pakistan owed Rs97 billion to the imported-coal fired Sahiwal power plant \u2013 the highest obligation to any Chinese energy project that also represents one-fifth of the Chinese outstanding energy dues.\nIslamabad also owed over Rs82 billion to the coal-fired Hub power project, Rs80 billion to the coal-fired Port Qasim power plant, and Rs79 billion to the Thar Coal project.\nThe Chinese government, through Pakistan\u2019s embassy in Beijing and its own embassy in Islamabad, has multiple times raised this issue at all forums.\nDue to huge outstanding liabilities, Chinese insurance company M/s Sinosure is also not providing any fresh lending to power sector projects in Pakistan. The Chinese government had also raised this issue with the last Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) government.\nOverdue payments to the Chinese Independent Power Producers (IPPs) are causing huge concern among Chinese businesses. Former Special Assistant to PM on Foreign Affairs, Tariq Fatemi, had written to the planning ministry a few months ago.\nChina, in the past, had also raised the issue of Pakistan\u2019s overall public debt unsustainability and its implications for obtaining $6 billion to $7 billion new loans for the Mainline-I railways project of the CPEC.\nThe details showed that the receivables of Engro PowerGen plant increased to Rs57 billion by the end of January. The country also owed Rs32 billion to the sponsors of the Matiari-Lahore Transmission Line project. Likewise, Karot power project receivables have surged to Rs23 billion by the end of last month.\nThe payables to Thar coal energy limited and ThalNova have increased over Rs7 billion. The UEP power plant receivables have crossed Rs5 billion. The receivables of the rest of the energy projects of the CPEC ranged from Rs2 billion to Rs4.5 billion.\nThis month the International Monetary Fund did not approve the Rs1.27 trillion circular debt reduction plan. The IMF objected to the government\u2019s proposal on the grounds that it carried serious fiscal risks, as it also rejected the proposal of issuing Rs745 billion additional supplementary grant.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 24th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

            "Text": "The Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) has categorically denied engaging in any power-sharing negotiations at the moment, asserting that it has initially sought positions from the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) regarding the implementation of their three-point agenda.\nThe party states that if the PML-N provides a satisfactory response, they may contemplate joining the government; otherwise, they are prepared to sit on the opposition benches.\nA MQM-P delegation, led by Dr Farooq Sattar, Mustafa Kamal and Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, held talks with PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif, who is also a prime ministerial candidate for the majority party.\nMedia reports suggest that the discussions revolved around a power-sharing formula encompassing the governorship of Sindh, legal matters, Karachi\u2019s development and allocation of funds.\nSpeculation was rife that MQM sought Kamran Tessori\u2019s continuation as the governor of Sindh as part of the proposed power-sharing arrangement.\nThe meeting was mainly attended by PML-N leader Ishaq Dar, Azam Nazir Tarar, Rana Mahud, Rana Sanaullah and Ata Tarar. The meeting concluded without reaching a consensus, leading to expectations of another round later in the day, though both sides remained tight-lipped until the filing of this report.\nAccording to an official statement, Shehbaz Sharif acknowledged MQM's role during the no-confidence motion against PTI founder and former prime minister Imran Kha and in averting default. The statement emphasised the leaders' commitment to working together for the nation's prosperity, prioritising national interest over personal concerns.\nMQM Convener Khalid Maqbool Saddique vehemently rejected the impression of his party seeking federal ministries from PML-N. He clarified that the delegation met the nominated prime minister to gauge his stance on their three-point agenda, centred around devolving power and funds to the grassroots level.\nHe said that they were not yearning for any ministries, even during Shehbaz Sharif\u2018s last stint, they asked him to keep their ministries with him, as for them their principles were more important than any ministries.\nHe said that, however, then PML-N needed them to keep its government intact now this was not the case. They have the numbers, and can even function without their support.\nHe said that they would not join the government without assurance of implementation of their agenda.\nResponding to queries about the number of ministries MQM would expect, he stated they would seek ministries based on a share.\nRegarding the demand for governorship, he emphasised the need to understand PML-N's position before entering negotiations for such a position.\nWhen queried about PPP's backing for PML-N at the centre, which meant that the latter might incline towards PPP in the event of a disagreement between the two parties, he said that destiny appears to have steered them away from the power centre.\nThe MQM delegation also convened with PML-Q chief Chaudhary Shujaat and other leaders of his party at his residence in Lahore, where the two sides deliberated on the prevailing political scenario and the process of government formation.\nOn the other hand, PML-Q leader Chaudhary Salik Hussain also met with the nominated prime minister at his residence. Much like MQM, PML-Q was also seeking ministerial positions in the incoming government of Shehbaz Sharif.\nAlthough PML-Q, unlike MQM, has an even thinner presence in the National Assembly and numerically contributes little to the discussion from its end, in contrast to MQM, which boasts 17 elected members in the house.\nThough PML-Q unlike MQM with even a thinner presence in the National Assembly, numerically bring nothing to the table from its end as opposed to MQM which has 17 elected members in the house.\nShehbaz was also called on by IPP President Aleem Khan, whose party too failed to grab any respectable share in the NA despite a large number of PTI defectors taken to be electables sent to its party by the establishment.\nIPP too only managed to get three seats, which includes the two controversial victories of Aleem Khan himself and Awn Chaudhry.\nSeparately, a delegation of the Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) led by its President Khalid Hussain Magsi met with Shehbaz.\nThe delegation included Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani and Senator Kauda Babar.\nIssues related to the country's situation and political cooperation were discussed in the meeting.\nThe delegation congratulated Shehbaz on being nominated as the prime minister.\nShehbaz appreciated the support of BAP during the 16-month coalition government.\nThe leaders agreed to promote unity and political cooperation to counter future economic threats to the country, noting that political stability was essential to deal with economic risks.\n"

Other parties\u2014Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI), the PML-Quaid, and the Istehkam-e-Pakistan Party (IPP) \u2014 were allocated one seat each.\nThe allocation has been made from the reserved quota for Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan.\nThe ECP withheld the allocation of 12 seats for women from Punjab and 10 seats from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), besides three seats reserved for minorities, which would be announced later.\nAfter the Feb 8 elections, the largest group of the newly elected lawmakers in the National Assembly belonged to the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) backed independents. However, as per the law, independents could not be allocated any of the reserved seats.\nIn order to be eligible for the reserved seats, the PTI decided that their lawmakers would join the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC).\nAs per their strength in the National Assembly, the SIC could claim 22 women\u2019s seats and three minorities\u2019, however, the ECP\u2019s decision on the SIC request remains pending.\nThe National Assembly has 60 reserved seats for women \u2013 32 from Punjab, 14 Sindh, 10 K-P and four Balochistan \u2013 and 10 reserved seats for minorities.\nOf these, the ECP notified the allocation of 20 seats of Punjab, 14 of Sindh, four of Balochistan and seven minorities.\nIn Punjab, the PML-N got 17 women\u2019s seats, besides one seat each went to the PPP, PML-Quaid, and the IPP. From Sindh\u2019s quota, the PPP got 10 and the MQM got four. From Balochistan\u2019s share, two seats went to the PML-N and one each to the PPP and the JUI.\nFrom the reserved seats for minorities, the PML-N got four, the PPP two and the MQM one. They are PML-N\u2019s Kesho Mal, Dr Darshan, Nelson Azim and Isfandiar Bhandara; PPP\u2019s Ramesh Lal and Naveed Aamir, and the MQM\u2019s Mahan Manjiani.\nProminent lawmakers on women\u2019s seats include Tahira Aurangzeb, Maryam Aurangzeb, Shaista Pervez, Nuzhat Sadiq, Masrat Asif Khawaja, Seema Mohiuddin, Shiza Khawaja, Tasmina Khurshid, Wajiha Qamar, Zeb Jafar, Kiran Imran, Anusha Rehman, Zahra Wadood Fatemi, Asia Naz Tanoli and Saba Sadiq of the PML-N, besides PPP's Hina Rabbani Khar, IPP's Munnaza Hasan, and PML-Q\u2019s Farrukh Khan.\nWith the allocation of the reserved seats, the PML-N is the largest party in the National Assembly with 107 lawmakers. However, in case the ECP allocated the remaining seats to the SIC, it would become the largest party in the lower house of parliament with 113 lawmakers.\nThe PPP remains in the third place with 68 seats, and the MQM, with 22 seats, is in the fourth place. There are nine PTI-backed independents, who did not join any political party. The JUI\u2019s strength is seven, followed by the PML-Q\u2019s five, and the IPP\u2019s four seats.\nBesides, the Balochistan Awami Party (BAP), the National Party (NP), Majlis-e-Wahdatul Muslimeen (MWM), the PML-Zia, Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) and the Balochistan National Party (BNP) have one seat each.\nMeanwhile, the ECP notified the success of independent candidate Iqbal Khan from NA-27, independent candidate Shahid Ahmed from NA-38, Maulana Misbahuddin of the JUI from NA-40, and Dawar Khan Kundi from NA-43.\nThe ECP also issued notification of six successful candidates of the Balochistan Assembly and one independent candidate Mahmood Qadir Khan, from PP-289 Dera Ghazi Khan. The ECP suspended the notification of independent candidate Arqam Khan from PP-68 Gujranwala.\n"

            "Text": "Although the state institutions are unwilling to address the grievances of its candidates, there are also apparently flaws in the legal strategy of the PTI in dealing with the issue of alleged election rigging.\nThe choice of lawyers is always significant to acquire relief in any constitutional matter.\nUsually political parties and leaders hire lawyers with good reputation among judges.\nIdeally, judges should not have a personal liking or disliking, but it is a fact that some lawyers are able to receive a better right to audience from the bench on account of their reputation.\nNow PTI leader Sher Afzal Marwat has filed a constitutional petition through Advocate Riaz Hanif Rahi seeking a probe into the allegations of polls rigging through the formation of a judicial commission.\nAdvocate Rahi had challenged the appointment of incumbent CJP Qazi Faez Isa as the chief justice of the Balochistan High Court during the tenure of former top judge Saqib Nisar.\nThe plea was scheduled before a bench but later rejected as there were serious concerns raised by lawyers about the listing of this matter in an open court.\nLater during the tenure of ex-CJP Umar Ata Bandial, Rahi had moved a contempt petition against Justice Isa and two high court CJs over the violation of the apex court larger bench\u2019s July 26, 2023 order wherein the notification for the audio leaks commission was suspended.\nSoon after filing the contempt petition, Rahi remained absent. Subsequently, he withdrew his contempt petition. The then CJP Bandial had also urged him to show patience in the prevailing political situation.\nIn the backdrop of this background, senior lawyers are wondering about engaging the services of Rahi for this matter.\nThey are questioning whether or not Rahi's engagement was deliberate to achieve some motive.\nInterestingly, a senior PTI leader did not confirm that Marwat had filed the petition after consulting with the party.\nIt has been learnt that PTI candidates Salman Akram Raja and Shoaib Shaheen are preparing a constitutional petition on the subject.\nBoth are claiming that they won the elections from their respective constituencies as per Form 45, which was in their possession. This petition is likely to be filed next week.\nShaheen has already written a letter to CJP Isa on the subject.\nAnother PTI candidate Shaukat Basra also tried to raise this issue before a bench led by CJP Isa. Subsequently, he held a news conference, questioning the role of the judiciary in the elections.\nPTI supporters are disappointed with CJP Isa's role in the polls process, especially after the SC\u2019s January 13 order wherein the party\u2019s internal elections were declared illegal and it was deprived of its popular electoral symbol of the \u2018 cricket bat\u2019.\nLater, the PTI -- disheartened by the decision -- decided to withdraw its contempt petition over the violation of the court\u2019s order for providing a level playing field to the party in the run-up to the elections.\nThroughout the electoral process, the SC led by CJP Isa did not question the executive authorities for ensuring free and fair polls. Now, the PTI is struggling to acquire reserved seats as its candidates contested the elections independently.\nCJP Isa had discussed the PTI's 2014 marathon sit-in in the Faizabad Dharna case judgment issued in February 2019.\nFollowing this judgment, the PTI challenged the case\u2019s verdict, while the party-led government filed a presidential reference against the judge, accusing him of financial misconduct.\nWhile the Supreme Judicial Council was holding proceedings on the misconduct complaint, PTI supporters were running a malicious campaign against Justice Isa and his family members, apparently at the behest of the \u2018powerful circles\u2019, according to some analysts.\nDuring the term of former CJP Gulzar Ahmed, Justice Isa had taken notice of PTI founding chairman and former premier Imran Khan\u2019s participation in a lawyers\u2019 convention organised by the party\u2019s legal wing in Islamabad.\nHowever, the apex court ruled in February 2021 that Justice Isa should not hear cases involving Imran, who was the prime minister back then.\nIt has become clear from Justice Isa's observations that he has serious concerns about last year\u2019s May 9 riots.\nThe SC under CJP Isa did not entertain senior lawyer and politician Chaudhry Aitzaz Ahsan's plea in connection with the alleged enforced disappearance of PTI leaders, as well as Imran\u2019s letter about their harassment.\nPresently, there is a cordial relationship between the state institutions.\nCJP Isa has so far not made any observation about the Election Commission of Pakistan\u2019s (ECP) conduct during the polls.\n"

The coalition affirmed that the protest, against alleged election rigging, will be peaceful. However, they warn that any attempt to interfere with the protest will be resisted.\nA 10-member advisory committee comprising members from all five political parties will be formed which will strategise the future course of action.\nSadruddin Shah Rashidi, Chief Coordinator of GDA Sindh, revealed these plans during a press conference on Friday. He was accompanied by Maulana Rashid Mahmood Soomro of JUI-F Sindh, Hafiz Naeemur Rahman of Jamaat-e-Islami Karachi, and Haleem Adil Shaikh of the PTI Sindh.\nIn a consultative meeting held earlier, suggestions against the alleged election rigging were discussed, leading to the decision to form a 10-member committee representing the five allies. The committee will chart the future roadmap, with the understanding that the peaceful protest will persist until they claim the allegedly stolen public mandate.\nWhile speaking at the press conference, Rashidi emphasised that their protest movement is directed against the perceived electoral malpractice. He mentioned that Pir Pagara, the head of GDA and PML-Functional, would step forward when needed.\nDr Safdar Ali Abbasi highlighted that his party was protesting against the fraudulent election across Sindh. He mentioned successful sit-ins in Jamshoro and Moro, stressing that the people had rejected the results of the alleged bogus election. \nThe joint protest in front of the Sindh Assembly on February 24 at 11am is a united announcement from all five parties, signifying a peaceful struggle. Dr Safdar Abbasi stated that the coalition leaders would convene for a meeting after the protest to discuss the future plan.\nResponding to a question, he confirmed that Jamaat-e-Islami, PTI members, and GDA would not take the oath on the following day. Hafiz Naeemur Rahman of Jamaat-e-Islami also expressed solidarity, stating that their members would be sworn in later.\nHaleem Adil Shaikh of the PTI joined the discourse, claiming a robbery of the mandate in all divisions of Sindh. He alleged rigging in Karachi, Hyderabad, and voiced concerns over the local government election. \nAccording to Shaikh, the PTI has 22 MNA seats in Sindh in reality. He accused the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) of treason against the Constitution, emphasising their commitment to stand by the opposition.\nIn a closing statement, Allama Rashid Mahmood Soomro warned against blocking the peaceful protest, holding those responsible for any consequences. He recalled the presence of Maryam Nawaz and Bilawal Bhutto in the Islamabad protest, asserting that if a protest could happen there, it could also take place outside the Sindh Assembly.\n"

The party also announced a protest demo outside the provincial assembly on the occasion of its inaugural session. \nAddressing the rally ANP\u2019s Central General Secretary, Mian Iftikhar Hussain, said that some elements wanted to get the desired results in Punjab and when they failed, they made Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) the scapegoat.\n\u201cIn pursuit of desired outcomes in K-P, ANP was marginalized,\u201d he stated, highlighting unprecedented levels of election rigging. \u201cOur ideology, rooted in non-violence, remains incompatible with such forces,\u201d he continued, emphasizing his party\u2019s commitment to parliamentary supremacy and the rule of law.\nProtests against electoral rigging are underway across all four provinces today, as a selected group has been imposed on the country under the guise of general elections,\u201d he remarked.\n\u201cLet me make it clear: nobody trusts the Election Commission of Pakistan anymore because of these failed elections,\u201d he asserted, noting that ANP was among the parties that had lost faith in the ECP. \nAddressing the rally, ANP Provincial President Aimal Wali Khan urged the Chief Justice to intervene and establish a judicial commission to investigate these irregularities and allegations of rigging. \n\u201cWe will take legal action alongside those who were coerced into paying for desired outcomes,\u201d he declared, denouncing the notion that the establishment could dictate the nation\u2019s future. \n\u201cAccording to the constitution, they are our guardians, not rulers, and they must cease meddling in politics and democracy, focusing instead on protecting the country\u2019s borders,\u201d he remarked.\n\u201cWe are grateful that we stand apart from the establishment, and those who sought to keep us out of parliament inadvertently propelled us back to our original roots,\u201d he remarked. \u201cFor the past century, ANP\u2019s political approach has evolved, yet its fundamental questions remain unchanged,\u201d he noted.\n\u201cHistory bears witness to the denial of ANP\u2019s rights since its inception, despite Bacha Khan\u2019s efforts that compelled the British government to grant Pakhtuns the right to vote,\u201d he added. \u201cWithin a week of Pakistan\u2019s creation, the tragic Babra massacre in Charsadda claimed the lives of 600 innocent and unarmed Pakhtuns,\u201d he lamented.\nWhen the first true general elections were held in Pakistan, East Pakistan broke off because of the stolen mandate, he maintained, adding that in order to ensure the supremacy of a big province, a bloodbath took place in Bengal.\n"

There will be no revenge,\u201d he argued.\n\u201cOur focus will be on the development of the province and there will be no space for revenge,\u201d he noted, saying that he would also advise his party workers and friends to forget about the past.\n\u201cThe PTI government will not tolerate any obstacle in the way of development in this province. We will work day and night for the development and uplift of this province and my team will also follow me,\u201d he observed, adding that the first priority would always be solving the problems faced by the general public.\nEarlier, Gandapur had warned police officers and returning officers repeatedly for their involvement in poll rigging as well as raiding the houses of PTI workers and harassing the women and children during these raids. \nHe said that strict action would be taken against those ROs who were involved in \u2018poll management\u2019.\n"

Caretaker Health Minister Dr Amir Muhammad Jogaizai, Pediatric Neurology President Dr Shahnaz Ibrahim, Organising Committee Chairman Dr Habibullah Babar, Dr Jamal Raza, Dr Attaullah Bizenjo and Dr Tipu Sultan besides others were present. \nAddressing the conference, the governor said that if the medicines provided by the government did not reach the patients, no meaningful change would come after spending billions of rupees from the federal and provincial budgets in various sectors. \n\u201cIf doctors and teachers do not attend health and educational institutions, who is responsible for it,\u201d he questioned. \u201cTo change these unfavourable conditions, we have to speak the truth, as time demands that we all sit together to find a lasting solution.\u201d\nHe said that today\u2019s prestigious conference and holding a conference on a sensitive but very important topic regarding children\u2019s health, especially neurology was a commendable act, the purpose of which was to define a healthy society.\n\u201cIt is a fact that the bright future of a country or nation is conditioned by mentally and physically healthy people,\u201d he said, inviting experts from different fields of life, especially neurologists, to help in devising a comprehensive strategy at the national level.\nHe said, \u201cWe are sure that such conscious efforts will yield positive results.\u201d \nThe governor said that Balochistan, which was relatively a backward province, had the highest maternal and child mortality rate even today as due to the small but dispersed population of the province, it was a big challenge to bring basic health facilities to the doorsteps of the people.\nHe said that it was also a sad aspect of society that children were seen in various shops, hotels, garages and rubbish heaps. \n\u201cIn a house where there is severe poverty and the parents are also not educated, in such a situation, parents cannot do anything for the education and treatment of their children,\u201d he said.\nHe said that even in this advanced age of science and technology, thousands of people in Balochistan died every year from curable diseases like malaria, jaundice, polio and TB.\n\u201cI am proud that today I am present among dedicated doctors who are working day and night to solve physical ailments as well as mental health problems,\u201d he noted.\n"

The day began with a book launch session titled \u2018Lahore cinema: Between realism and fable\u2019 that was hosted by Nasreen Rehman, a screenwriter, historian and translator. The guest, Professor Iftikhar Dadi, talked about his book covering the origin, peak, crisis and different phases of the Pakistan film industry. He said Lahore was a centre of film production in the 1920s, which produced super hit films.\n\u201cThe relationship between Lahore and Bombay with respect to the industry continued and films on similar subjects were produced in Pakistan and India in the 1950s and 60s. The film Anar Kali was produced in Lahore in 1958, while the super hit Mughal-e-Azam was produced in Bombay in 1960. The music, production style and stories revolved around similar subjects,\u201d he added.\nProfessor Dadi eulogised the role of film producers and musicians of the era, especially Riaz Shahid, Saadat Hassan Manto and Khawaja Khursheed Anwar. \nIn another session, poet Michael Cirelli from the United States and his wife Dr Sara Zaidi discussed their initiative in Pakistan to promote local poets. \nIn a thought-provoking session, \u2018Writing the other\u2019, literary giants Mohsin Hamid, Monica Ali, Jose Luis Peixoto and HM Naqvi delved into the art of infusing emotions into characters. \nAs an autobiography unveiling of Salman Farooqui took centre stage, former WAPDA chairman Shakeel Durrani and columnist Rashid Amjad shared insights into the writer\u2019s private and social life, discussing his impact on art and society. Amjad hailed him as a metaphor for resilience.\nThe exploration of digital frontiers continued with a panel comprising of Roshaneh Zafar, Momina Aijazuddin and Sadaffe Abid offering a glimpse into a future where technology intersects with social impact. The session moderated by Professor Taimur Rahman resonated as a call for innovation in the battle against poverty.\nThe intellectual kaleidoscope turned with sessions like a discussion on \u2018The widening war\u2019 in the Middle East, and a captivating journey through the artistic milestones of Shakir Ali, Zahoorul Akhlaq and Imran Qureshi.\nMeanwhile, musical performances continued on the lawns. Traditional food and bookstalls were also set up.\n"

Pakistan\u2019s dollar bond prices jumped in the range of 1-6% after the two major political parties reached an agreement on forming the next government, he said.\nMeanwhile, the current account returned to the red zone in January 2024 with a deficit of $269 million, which took 7MFY24 deficit to $1.1 billion. The $700 million current account gap was broadly led by a higher trade deficit that went up $600 million month-on-month (MoM).\nMoreover, power generation during January 2024 decreased 2% year-on-year (YoY) while generation cost surged 23%. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) reported a 0.5% WoW decrease in foreign currency reserves, which had remained around $8 billion for the past three months.\nIn T-bills\u2019 auction, cut-off yields increased in the range of 33 to 126 basis points for papers of different maturities, the JS analyst added.\nArif Habib Limited (AHL) reported that the market remained buoyant, taking the index beyond 62,000 points from 59,000 last week.\nInvestor sentiment got a boost as the winning political parties reached agreement to form a coalition government.\nOn the economic front, the current account shifted to a deficit of $269 million in January 2024 from a surplus of $404 million in December 2023. Meanwhile, returns on National Saving Schemes decreased in the range of 40 to 160 basis points.\nPower generation in the country climbed 7.6% MoM in January 2024 while the Roshan Digital Account saw inflows of $142 million in the same month, settling at $7.3 billion.\nSector-wise, positive contribution to the market came from exploration and production (623 points), banks (513 points), technology and communication (355 points), fertiliser (255 points) and power (254 points).\nForeign buying continued during the week under review, which came in at $2.9 million compared to net buying of $5.2 million last week, AHL added.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 25th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

The abrupt implementation of this regime has adversely affected the supply and demand of trucks, increased transportation costs and is consequently propelling inflation to exorbitant levels.\nNumerous business leaders have shared their views with The Express Tribune, highlighting that the previously-attempted ALR in 2019 had disastrous consequences. This included frequent disruptions in the supply chain in all trades and industries, particularly agri-based commodities, fertilisers, edible oil, cement, coal, steel and general consumer goods.\nThey pointed out that transporters who will be worst affected will be the small owners of 10-wheelers and 14-wheelers, constituting about 60% of the trucking fleet of Pakistan \u2013 mostly family owned. The total trucking fleet in the country is about 350,000 as the number of goods transport vehicles available for moving within the country is already less than the current requirement. It was cautioned that implementing the ALR in its current form is bound to create an overall shortage in local food and consumer goods supply. Without logical amendments made in this regime, the resulting national food security issues will impact the economy. Leaders suggested that both the documents including the national transport policy and NHSO-2000 need to be revised.\nThe leaders emphasised that if the rules and regulations in the ALR are amended to be harmonised with the current commercial requirements, and an inland waterway transport system is also developed simultaneously, along with improvements in Pakistan Railways\u2019 freight capacity, this could lead to substantial reductions in freight costs. Ultimately, this would facilitate the desired recovery of the national economy.\nIt was added that the sudden imposition of this regime may hinder efforts of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) as Pakistan\u2019s exports will become even more uncompetitive than they already are. Moreover, this regime will scale up transportation costs, at a time when such costs need to be driven down for economic betterment. They strongly recommended and called for getting this ALR deferred and subsequently implementing it in a properly planned and phased manner.\n\nRead\u00a0Fertiliser sector seeks delay in axle load regime\nNotably, around 350,000 units of various axle trucks are operating in the country with a majority of them being three axle (10 wheelers) and six axle (22 wheelers). Before the implementation of the ALR, a trailer used to carry from 55 tonnes to 80 tonnes of cargo, while a high-wall truck could transport up to 30 tonnes of goods. However, after implementation of the ALR, they are lifting 39 tonnes and 17 tonnes respectively.\nSome users had to get a stay order from the court of law for Karachi only as there is no highway within the port city where goods vehicles can carry 55 tonnes and 30 tonnes. However, vehicles travelling to the northern side are required to follow the ALR of 39 tonnes and 17 tonnes respectively.\nThey criticised the authority for imposing this ALR, citing concerns about highway conditions which are being broken. Business leaders added that users (import and export industry, heavy goods transporters etc) of highways can pay maintenance costs of the highways, but it is not good to import a large number of vehicles, tyres and ample fuel in order to fulfil the demands, while implementing the ALR.\n\u201cOnce again, the imbroglio of ALR under NHSO-2000 has taken centre stage. It goes without saying that the issue must be resolved and sanity must prevail on the highways. There are concerns of cost, vehicle and sustainability. And, therein lie the burning issues and therein lie resentment and bitterness,\u201d said Muhammad Najib Balagamwala, Chairman of Seatrade Group of Companies.\nHe noted that the prime distinctiveness at present is that there is a perennial shortage of road efficient trucks, which has resulted in excessive freight cost per trip.\nHe underscored the inflationary impact of added cost which is burdensome for the end-user. In addition to these, he noted the factor of delays in discharge from the port.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 25th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

        },
        "Details": {
            "Text": "The government has notified amendments to the Refinery Policy 2023 that guarantees a 10% tariff protection for seven years to the existing oil refineries eager to upgrade their plants to enhance petrol and diesel production with Euro 5 fuel specifications.\nThe new policy is expected to draw an investment of up to $6 billion in the expansion of oil refineries. Tariff collection will go into an escrow account while the refineries will be able to withdraw up to 27.5% of funds for plant upgrades.\nWith the expansion of production facilities, the refineries will double their diesel production capacity, thus lessening reliance on imports.\nThe refineries qualifying for tariff protection can withdraw up to 24.5% of total project cost from the joint escrow account on the import of used plant, machinery and equipment (PME) for upgrading their plants.\nHowever, the refineries desiring to import new PME will be able to draw a maximum of 27.5% of total project cost from the joint escrow account.\nPakistan Refinery Limited (PRL) has already signed an agreement with the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) and awarded contracts for capacity expansion from 50,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 100,000 bpd.\nHowever, other refineries raised observations pertaining to spending from the escrow account and force majeure clauses.\nThe caretaker government, after negotiating with the refineries, has amended the policy. The amended oil refining policy was notified on February 23, 2024 following its approval by the cabinet on February 15, as recommended by the Cabinet Committee on Energy in its meeting on February 6.\nThe policy was initially notified on August 17, 2023 but it has now been amended after taking into consideration concerns of the refineries over some of the clauses, which would have left the proposed upgrading projects unviable.\nThe amendments were made after intense and prolonged consultations among the government, refineries, and independent financial and legal advisory firms.\nWhen contacted, Oil Companies Advisory Council (OCAC) Chairman and Attock Refinery Limited Chief Executive Adil Khattak said the new refinery policy would enable oil refineries to undertake major upgrade projects to not only comply with Euro 5 fuel specifications but also increase production of deficit products, such as petrol and diesel by 99% and 47% respectively.\nIt will also result in slashing furnace oil output by 78% which, because of drastically reduced demand in recent years, often causes storage constraints, forcing the refineries to reduce capacity utilisation.\nThe upgrading of refineries will attract investment of $5-6 billion, lead to the production of cleaner, environmentally friendly fuels and major savings in foreign exchange.\n\nRead\u00a0Refineries warn of shutdown, seek incentives\nKhattak emphasised that the modernisation of refineries would surely be termed the most important achievement of the caretaker government and voiced hope that the policy would be implemented in true letter and spirit.\nThe policymaking process, which took more than four years mainly due to changes in governments and bureaucracy, was initiated by Nadeem Babar in his capacity as special adviser to the then prime minister. Final credit for taking on board all stakeholders after due diligence and independent professional input goes to outgoing Energy Minister Muhammad Ali.\nKhattak pointed out that the role of Ogra and the Directorate General Oil had been pivotal in formulating the policy and would also remain critical in successful execution of the policy.\nAccording to the 2023 refinery policy, there will be a minimum customs duty or regulatory duty of 10% on imported motor gasoline (petrol) and diesel for seven years from the date of notification of amendments to the policy.\nAny customs duty exceeding 10% and reflected in the ex-refinery price will be channeled into the inland freight equalisation margin (IFEM) pool.\nThe refineries ineligible for incentives must deposit the same in the IFEM pool. Any customs duty on crude oil will be reimbursed to the refineries through IFEM.\nRefineries will enjoy a 10% tariff protection, or deemed duty, applicable to ex-refinery prices of motor gasoline and diesel for seven years from the date of signing of the project upgrade agreement and opening the joint escrow account with Ogra within 60 days of the notification of amendments to the policy.\nHowever, the refineries must deposit 2.5% of deemed duty on diesel and 10% on motor gasoline (incremental incentive) in the escrow account held jointly by Ogra and the respective refinery in the National Bank of Pakistan for utilisation on upgrading projects.\nUntil the opening of the escrow account, the incremental incentive will be deposited in the IFEM pool. The prevailing 7.5% deemed duty on diesel for sustainability will continue after the seven-year incentive period for 20 years or until deregulation, whichever is earlier.\nFor an existing refinery to qualify for the fiscal incentives outlined in the policy, it must within 60 days, after the notification of amendments, execute a legally binding upgrade agreement with Ogra.\nThe agreement will specify the output and outcome of the committed upgrade, including the maximum production of Euro 5-compliant motor spirit and high-speed diesel and a reasonable reduction in furnace oil output, as outlined in the Front-end Engineering Design (FEED) of the upgrade project, along with proposed milestones and tentative timelines including a feasibility study, FEED, financial close, engineering, procurement and construction contract and commissioning.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 25th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

        },
        "Details": {
            "Text": "The unexpected victory of PTI-backed independent candidates in the February 8 general elections has left political parties, the establishment as well as the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in a quandary.\nThe ECP was supposed to issue complete poll results within 14 days after the general elections.\nYet it has not yet been able to decide if it should allot reserved seats to the independent candidates entering the National Assembly under the banner of the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC). The polls oversight authority has already allotted reserved seats to all other parties.\nAccording to a notification, the ECP has given the PML-N 19 women\u2019s seats and four minority seats.\nThe PPPP has got 12 women\u2019s seats and two minority seats and the MQM-P has been allocated four women\u2019s seats and one minority seat. Other parties\u2014the JUI-F, the PML-Q and the IPP\u2014have received one seat each.\nThe ECP has so far notified allocation of a total of 38 reserved seats for women and seven for minorities. It has held back its decision on the remaining 22 women\u2019s seats and three minorities.\nExperts also appear to be divided on the question as to whether the PTI backed candidates should be allocated the reserved seats now that they have joined the SIC.\nTalking to The Express Tribune, Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (PILDAT) President Ahmed Bilal Mehboob said reserved seats should be allotted to the SIC and, if not, then they should be distributed among other parties.\nMehboob said narrow technicalities such as the requirement of submitting a priority list of candidates for reserved seats prior to election should be dispensed with as a whole new parliamentary party has emerged in the assemblies after such a large number of independent members joined SIC.\nIn all probability, the PILDAT chief said, the matter will eventually be decided by the Supreme Court no matter which way the ECP decides.\n\u201cIf the ECP decides against allocating reserved seats to the SIC then the seats which otherwise would have gone to the SIC will be distributed among the remaining parties in each house.\u201d\nThough, Mehboob said, there is no specific deadline for the ECP to declare allocation of remaining reserved seats, the ECP was supposed to declare all final results within 14 days of the election\u2013which has not happened.\nRenowned constitutional expert Hafiz Ehsaan Ahmad Khokhar stated that a significant change in the distribution of reserved seats occurred during the General Musharraf administration.\nThis is evident in Articles 51,106, and 224 of the 1973 Constitution, as well as in Section 104 of the Election Act, 2017, and Rules 92, 93, and 94 of the Election Rules of 2017, which address the process of allocating reserved seats to women and non-Muslims.\nAccording to the legal expert, within three days of the names of the returned candidates being published in the official gazette, the returning independent candidates, whether in the National Assembly or a provincial assembly, have to lawfully join a party that already has a parliamentary presence in the relevant assembly.\nLater, his or her name is added to the total number of general seats won by the political party for the purposes of reserved seats under Article 51 of the Constitution.\nThe legal expert clarified that the returned candidates are only permitted to join a political party that already has parliamentary representation in the National Assembly or a provincial legislature.\nThese independent candidates are not permitted, under Article 51 read with Section 104 of the Election Act, to join political parties that do not have any seat in the relevant assembly.\nEven if they so choose, there is no legal or constitutional provision that would bind ECP to assign reserved seats to such a political party.\nThe constitutional expert\u00a0said the ECP cannot allocate reserved seats to any other party as it is legally bound to give seats as per the strength of the party concerned in the house, which it already has.\nHe asserted that a political party must adhere to the election schedule set forth by the ECP in accordance with Sections 57 and 58 of the Election Act 2017 in order to win reserved seats, as well as regular seats.\n\u201cTherefore, under Section 104 of the Election Act read with Rule 92, 93, and 94 of the Election Rules, no party is allowed to file a new list of priority lists for women and non-Muslim reserved seats,\u201d he said.\nAdditionally, Ehsaan said, after the time for filing nomination papers has passed, a political party\u2019s list cannot be changed or altered in any way, including in terms of priority or by adding or eliminating individuals.\nIn light of Article 51 of the Constitution, a political party may, under the Election Act, 2017 add or increase the number of names through a new list in continuation of the previously filed, provided that the list it had previously submitted prior to the election has been depleted as it won more seats than expected in the relevant assembly or because of the participation or inclusion of independents.\nAs per the constitutional expert, if a political party neglects to submit a list to the ECP by the deadline specified in the election programme and does not have parliamentary representation, then the Election Act, 2017 prohibits submission of a new list at a later time to allocate reserved seats for women and non-Muslims. This is because the Election Act stipulates that the time for submitting the list has expired.\nEhsaan stated that there is a strong presumption that since this is the first time that a significant number of candidates for the National Assembly and provincial assemblies have been returned to office during the general election and have joined a political party which does not have any seat both in the NA as well as provincial assemblies before joining the independent candidates.\n\u201cConsequently, this legal disagreement will wind up in constitutional courts, where they will have to make the first determination about how to interpret Articles 51,106, and 224 of the 1973 Constitution, as well as in Section 104 of the Election Act 2017 and Rules 92, 93, and 94 of the Election Rules 2017.\u201d\nHe said if a political party fails to submit a list or does not have representation in assembly, then no new list for reserved seats can be submitted on the ground that the independent winning candidates have joined them inside assembly.\n"

            "Text": "Pakistan has met the International Monetary Fund (IMF) benchmarks for maintaining the status quo in the energy sector \u2013 in an outcome that may help to get the next loan tranche of $1.2 billion but does not stop the bleeding (debt) despite increase in electricity prices.\nThe Ministry of Energy officials said that the end-December targets related to containing the flow of circular debt below Rs385 billion, timely increase in the electricity prices under various heads, and slowing the increase in line losses have been met.\nThe IMF would review the implementation on these targets during the loan negotiations under the second review of the $3 billion bailout package.\nThe global lender has not yet finalised the dates for the next review talks and is waiting for the formation of the government.\nSources said that as against the condition to restrict the flow of the circular debt to Rs385 billion by end-December, the increase was Rs378 billion. This was slightly better than the IMF requirement, they added.\nStill, the total power sector circular debt has ballooned to Rs2.69 trillion by the end of the first half of this fiscal year. Pakistan has committed to the IMF that it would contain the circular debt at June 2023\u2019s level of Rs2.31 trillion by the end of this fiscal year.\nAny increase above the Rs2.310 trillion threshold would subsequently be settled against the budget subsidies or through price increase. The authorities hope that they will bring down the debt at the desired level by the close of the fiscal year.\nThe IMF\u2019s strategy has so far largely remained focused on fiscalization of the power sector losses through budget subsidies and electricity price increase.\nThe government has allocated Rs952 billion in the budget for subsidies and payment of the past debt. It has constantly been increasing the electricity prices, which has now forced the people to shift towards alternate sources, including solar panels.\nThe energy ministry officials said that in order to restrict the flow of the circular debt, the government was constantly making tariff adjustments on account of fuel price adjustment and quarterly adjustments.\nThe power distribution companies have asked for another increase of over Rs7 per unit on account of fuel price adjustment for January, raising alarm bells at various levels, including the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA).\nIt has recently been communicated to the IMF that the government was actively pursuing cost reduction reforms such as continuing negotiations with the remaining Independent Power Producers (IPPs) and introducing renewable energy in the system to reduce burden on the consumers.\nHowever, there has not been any concrete progress on this front, except expanding the scope of a committee set up for renegotiating the Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs).\nThe interim cabinet recently expanded the committee\u2019s scope to negotiate with all the IPPs but it did not begin any such negotiations with the Chinese power plants.\nChina has repeatedly refused to reopen these power purchase deals.\nThe last Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government had started negotiations with the IPPs to review the dollar indexation clause.A cap was placed to control the electricity prices rising with further depreciation of the rupee. The caretaker government brought hydel and gas-based IPPs under the scope of the committee.\nInstead of improving the power distribution companies\u2019 performance, the focus remained during the past few months on strictly following the regulatory calendar to avoid delays in filing petitions for increase in the prices.\nPakistan had also assured to settle both the guaranteed and unguaranteed debt of the power sector.\nThe IMF has been intimated that the government released Rs131 billion to the state-owned power plants out of the total requirement of settling their Rs310 billion debt in this fiscal year. The remaining amount will be released in the second half of this fiscal year.\nThe government has once again assured the IMF that it would convert the expensive Rs82 billion power sector debt into public debt and will issue the sovereign guarantees against the remaining Rs683 billion power sector debt parked in the holding company.\nHowever, there has not been any significant progress on handing over the control of the power distribution companies to the private sector.\nThe Cabinet Committee on Privatisation approved a plan as late as the first week of February to give two companies, Gujranwala and Hyderabad, to the private sector.\nThe IMF has also been informed about the progress on the anti-theft campaign. It has been claimed that as of early February, the campaign resulted in savings of Rs76.2 billion and there was also improvement in recovery rates and just for the month of Dec 2023, recovery improved by 5%.\nThe government has already promulgated an ordinance in December to make electricity theft a cognisable offense.\n"

            "Text": "Syed Owais Qadir Shah from the Pakistan Peoples Party Parliamentarians (PPPP) seized the position of speaker in the Sindh Assembly, while Anthony Naveed secured the role of deputy speaker with a resounding majority on Sunday.\nShah garnered 111 votes in his favour, surpassing the 36 votes obtained by Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) candidate Sofia Saeed. The voting took place in the presence of 157 members of the provincial assembly.\nSpeaker Agha Siraj Durrani, presiding over the election, administered the oath to Shah.\nSubsequently, Shah, now the newly elected Speaker, presided over the election for the Deputy Speaker. Anthony Naveed, making history as the first Christian community member to assume the role of Deputy Speaker in the Sindh Assembly, also secured 111 votes. His opponent, MQM-P's Rashid Khan, received 36 votes in the election.\nAddressing the house after his election, Shah thanked the party leaders for reposing trust in him. He also expressed gratitude to the people of Sindh and the people of his constituency for electing him to represent them in the assembly.\nEarlier, nine Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) lawmakers \u2013 originally Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI)-backed independents \u2013 and one Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) lawmaker took oath as members. However, three elected members of the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) did not attend the session.\nWith this, the total number of members, who had been sworn in as MPAs rises to 157. During the speaker and deputy speaker\u2019s election, however, 147 members cast their votes. The nine SIC members and the one JI\u2019s MPA did not participate in the polling process.\nSyed Awais Qadir Shah was elected from PS-23, Sukkur constituency in the February 8 general elections. His deputy, Anthony Naveed, came on the reserved seats for minorities on the PPPP\u2019s priority list. He belongs to Karachi, and had previously served as the chairman of a house standing committee.\n\nRead Sindh Assembly members to take oath today\nThe Sindh Assembly comprises 168 lawmakers \u2013 130 elected on general seats, 29 reserved seats for women, and nine reserved for non-Muslims. The PPPP commands an overwhelming majority of 114 followed by 36 of the MQM-P and 9 of the SIC.\nLater, the speaker adjourned the session until Monday (today), when the election of the provincial chief minister would take place.\nFrom the PPPP, Syed Murad Ali Shah filed the nomination papers. The MQM-P has finalised the name of Ali Khurshidi as its candidate for the chief minister's post.\nHailing from the Dadu district Murad Ali Shah, son of former chief minister Abdullah Shah, is seeking the third term as the chief minister. Previously he served as the chief minister from July 29, 2016, to May 28, 2018 and from August 18, 2018, till August 17, 2023.\nHis likely rival, Khurshidi, won the February 8 general election from Karachi's PS-119 constituency. Previously, he served as a member of the provincial legislature from 2018 to 2023. Given the results of the speaker\u2019s election, Murad Shah is in pole position in Monday\u2019s contest.\nMeanwhile, nine independent lawmakers, backed by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), and one from Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) were sworn in on Sunday in a Sindh Assembly session officiated by Speaker Agha Siraj Durrani. Three newly elected members of the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) were absent from the house on the second day.\nSpeaker Durrani administered the oath of office to the 10 MPAs, which included independents supported by PTI and JI member Muhammad Farooq. With the new swearing-ins, the total number of MPAs has risen to 157.\nThree MPAs of GDA and three of the PPP are yet to take their oaths including Nisar Khuhro and Jam Mehtab Dhar, who are also members of the Senate.\nMorover, the notification confirming the success of JI's Hafiz Naeemur Rahman, who secured a general seat in the Sindh Assembly, has not been issued. Similarly, the announcement of the successful candidates for two women and one minority reserved seats is still pending.\n"

It is his first term in the assembly.

Shah was accompanied by prominent PPP leaders, including Faryal Talpur, Syed Qaim Ali Shah, Sindh Assembly Speaker, and others.\n\"I have the honour to propose Asif Zardari's candidature for the highest constitutional position of the country,\" Shah told the media.

The foremost among them is the rehabilitation of the flood hit people in Sindh and Balochistan, he added. \nAccording to him, the supply of clean drinking water to the people in all parts of Sindh has also been given top priority by the PPP. Improving the law and order situation particularly in the dacoits infested districts of Sindh will also remain a focus of his government.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, March 3rd, 2024.\n"

            "Text": "Information Technology experts have underscored the pivotal role of female workforce participation in accelerating Pakistan\u2019s IT sector productivity and exports. With a significant share of the local population and exceptional talent in computer and technology fields, their inclusion is deemed essential for sector growth.\nJehan Ara, former president of the Pakistan Software Houses Association (P@SHA), highlighted the significance of women\u2019s inclusion in the workforce for fostering smarter and faster growth. Highlighting their unique perspectives, she noted their ability to address a significant segment of women users and consumers in businesses. She mentioned that IT companies have recognised this importance, leading to a notable increase in the ratio of women in the industry, rising from 12% to over 22% within the last five years.\nMaha Shahzad, Founder and CEO of Buscaro, underscored the increasing working opportunities for women in Pakistan, whether onsite or remotely. She highlighted the need for women to navigate challenges and barriers while balancing their careers and family responsibilities to achieve their goals. Shahzad expressed confidence in Pakistani women\u2019s ability to excel in various fields and roles, including founding startups and securing investments, despite prevalent issues, challenges, and cultural mindsets.\nDuring the Women Tech Quest 2024 event hosted by 10Pearls University, Zeeshan Aftab, Co-Founder and Managing Director of 10Pearls, reiterated the substantial contribution of female professionals in Pakistan\u2019s IT sector. He highlighted their robust skill sets in areas such as design, coding, and quality assurance, among others. Aftab urged IT companies to adopt flexible work cultures, including remote and hybrid models, to better accommodate women in the workforce and ensure a balanced approach to gender diversity.\n\nRead\u00a0Mushaal stresses empowering women\nIn conversation with The Express Tribune, Alpha Beta Core (ABC) Analyst Sarwat Khan said, \u201cOne in four roles in top-tier tech companies like GAFAM (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft) is held by women, with 44% of leadership roles filled by women at Apple. Pakistan ranks among the bottom two countries on the gender gap index, which assesses disparities in economics, politics, education, and health, just above Afghanistan.\nWhile Pakistan\u2019s IT sector shows strong growth in recent years, sustaining this growth becomes questionable if we neglect to include half the population in the IT industry. Despite many programmes, funding, and grants supporting women-led ventures, we are far behind the global ratio of women\u2019s inclusion in tech roles. It is increasingly important to create a pipeline of women in the tech workforce who can step into the next available senior roles.\nTo promote women\u2019s inclusion in tech roles, it is vital to build skills and create opportunities at each layer of the organisation rather than solely celebrating the advancement of a few women into senior roles.\u201d\nPublished in The Express Tribune, March 3rd, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

            "Text": "Omar Ayub, the prime ministerial candidate of the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), has described the upcoming PML-N-led government as a fascist regime, representing a continuation of the last Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) government.\nIn his speech on the floor of the National Assembly after the election of PML-N\u2019s Shehbaz Sharif as the 24th prime minister of the country on Sunday, Omar decried the ruling coalition for its alleged lack of ideology. \u201cThe only ideology of the upcoming government is financial corruption,\u201d he said.\nOmar, who received 92 votes against 201 votes cast for Shehbaz in the prime ministerial election, lamented that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) did not allocate reserved seats to the SIC.\nHe claimed this unconstitutional move made the entire process for the election of NA speaker, deputy speaker, and the prime minister illegal.\n\"We had raised the point under the Constitution that this house is out of order, but outgoing NA speaker Raja Pervez Ashraf overruled our objection.\"\nThe SIC\u2019s candidate claimed that the incoming government was formed based on the ECP\u2019s Form 47.\nHe said if election results were based on Form 45 then the SIC would have 180 lawmakers in the lower house.\nECP\u2019s Form 45 is also known as the \"Result of the Count\" form. It is filled out at the polling station level after the counting of votes is completed.\nForm 45 contains details such as the number of votes cast for each candidate and is signed by the presiding officer of the polling station. It serves as a record of the results at the polling station level.\nForm 47, on the other hand, is compiled at the constituency level and contains the consolidated results from all polling stations within that constituency.\nIt provides an overview of the election results for a particular constituency and is an important document for the tabulation of results at higher levels of the electoral process.\nOmar said: \u201cThe government lawmakers sitting here are beneficiaries of Form 47. However, the government that they are going to form is an ill-assorted group.\u201d\nThe politician who originally belongs to the PTI lamented that when he was given the floor of the house after the speech of the newly elected prime minister, the cameras of the state-owned television channels stopped their live broadcast of the assembly session.\n\u201cMy speech should also be live-broadcast,\u201d he said.\nThe SIC candidate said the faces of the lawmakers belonging to the PML-N and its allies were faces of defeated people. \u201cTheir faces show that they have stolen the elections. When a thief flees after snatching something there is fear on his face,\u201d he said.\nReferring to the PTI\u2019s protests against alleged rigging in the February 8 polls on Saturday, he said in the wake of the protest, 80 cases were registered only against the PTI workers in Lahore.\n\u201cAnd despite this highhandedness, they claim that they are democratic people.\u201d\nRead more: PML-N's Shehbaz Sharif elected prime minister for second time\nHe said the PTI was deprived of its election symbol and later it was also deprived of its success based on Form 45. \u201cHowever, despite all challenges, the party remained steadfast and will continue to do so until former PM Imran Khan is released from jail and elected as the country\u2019s prime minister,\u201d he said.\nThe ECP deprived the PTI of its election symbol weeks before the February 8 elections. The PTI candidates later contested the elections as independents and collectively won more seats than the biggest political party, the PML-N.\nThe PTI backed independents later joined the little-known SIC and applied for the allocation of reserved seats. However, the ECP reserved its decision on its petition.\nTalking with reference to the acts of vandalism that occurred across the country on May 9, 2023, after the arrest of Imran Khan, Omar said innocent people were also martyred on May 9 when authorities opened fire on peaceful protestors.\n\u201cWho is responsible for this? We demand a judicial inquiry into the events of May 9. Video footage should be presented to reveal the facts,\u201d he said.\nDuring Omar Ayub's speech, some members of the PML-N, including Atta Tarar, gathered around his desk and continued shouting slogans. They, however, returned to their seats at the request of former speaker Asad Qaiser.\nEarlier, the NA session convened to elect the new prime minister commenced amid ruckus as PTI-backed SIC and PML-N lawmakers chanted slogans against each other.\nThe speaker commenced the proceedings to elect the PM amid noisy protests by PTI-backed lawmakers carrying posters of incarcerated party founder Imran Khan and chanting slogans against the PML-N.\nThroughout the day, PTI-SIC members kept resorting to calling opponents \"chor\" (thief)\u2014a reference to corruption allegations that have been following Sharifs and others over the years.\nThe PMLN-led alliance on the other hand kept repeating the slogan of \"Ghari Chor\" \u2014 watch thief \u2014 in a reference to the Toshakhana case in which Imran Khan was convicted for misusing the state\u2019s gift repository by selling precious gifts including a watch gifted by Saudi royals in open market.\nSoon after the speaker declared Shehbaz as the new prime minister of the country, PTI-SIC lawmakers encircled the newly-elected PM\u2019s chair. The assembly was abuzz with slogans of 'sher' and 'chor'. Amid the sloganeering, PM Shehbaz began his maiden speech.\nShehbaz delivered the speech while standing beside his elder brother and three-time former PM Nawaz Sharif who was elected as an MNA but opted out of the race for the prime minister just days after the general elections.\nGohar\u2019s reservations\nLater, speaking to the media at Gate No 1 of the Parliament House, PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan expressed reservations about the proceedings of the National Assembly.\nHe said while Shehbaz Sharif was shown live on TV, Omar Ayub was not given coverage despite the fact that the NA deputy speaker did not censor any of Omar's words.\n\u201cIf such incidents happen again, it will become very difficult to function here. Despite all injustices, we are present in the Parliament House, but if this trend continues, it will be difficult for the parliament's proceedings and cooperation,\u201d he said.\nKhan lamented that the PTI leaders and workers were in jails, \u201cwhich should not have been the case under any circumstances.\u201d\nOn the occasion, Omar Ayub stated that according to Shehbaz Sharif, the country's debt has soared to $80 trillion. \u201cOur reserves and economy are in dire straits, and the country's economy has shrunk. No investor will come in this environment.\u201d\n"

            "Text": "While ASP Gulberg Shehrbano Naqvi received well-deserved accolades for her role in averting a tragedy fuelled by blasphemy allegations, the spotlight has seemed to inadvertently dim the heroic actions of other unsung figures who risked life and property.\nAmong the silent champions, a shopkeeper and two courageous salesmen played a crucial role in shielding the woman from an angry mob before the police could arrive.\nJohnson Tariq, the quick-thinking owner of a food point, took the bold move to secure the woman within his shop as the belligerent mob outside clamoured to chop her into pieces. Meanwhile, two salesmen formed a human chain, attempting to calm the approaching mob that sought to breach the shop, even risking arson.\nThe incident unfolded when a frenzy erupted outside a shop in Ichhra Bazaar, triggered by an allegation that a woman's shirt bore Quranic verses, leading to cries of \"blasphemy.\"\nAs per the details, the woman, wearing the shirt, was strolling through the bazaar with her husband when a man, noticing the Arabic calligraphy, began following the couple, eventually intercepting the woman near Pakistan Chowk, demanding she change her shirt.\nWhen she asked him to leave and do his own job, the man persisted and, at one point, even attempted to strip her of the shirt. In reaction, she shouted at him and cried out for help. The situation escalated, leading to a large crowd charging towards the woman upon hearing allegations of blasphemy.\nSeeking refuge in a nearby food point, the woman faced a volatile mob, with one suspect brandishing a knife, threatening harm.\nIn no time, the entire street was galvanised against the woman with tensions reaching crescendo over her refusal to remove the shirt and charges of blasphemy.\nSensing the escalating tension, she sought refuge in a nearby eatery. The unruly mob was spiralling out of control, unleashing vehement threats. A perpetrator emerged, brandishing a sharp-edged knife, menacingly vowing to dismember the victim, accusing her of affronting the religious sentiments of Muslims.\nWisely, Johnson Tariq, the shop owner, swiftly lowered the shutter and secured it from within. Despite the mob's menacing threats to set the shop ablaze, two salesmen valiantly stood guard outside.\nSimultaneously, the police arrived and intervened to bring the situation under control.\nPrior to ASP Shehrbano's arrival, an ASI from Ichra Police, followed by SHO Bilal Ahmad, had already secured the premises. SP Model Town Irtaza Komail, accompanied by police officials from nearby stations, had also arrived at the scene to support senior officers in managing the law-and-order situation.\nHowever, beneath the surface, a wave of discontent swelled among the police ranks. ASP Shehrbano received official accolades, while the efforts of the rank-and-file, particularly the shopkeeper and salesmen, went unnoticed.\nAllegations of discrimination against rankers by the PSP cadre dominated the department, echoing a longstanding norm where rankers undertook groundwork, only for PSP officers to claim credit and accolades.\nAccording to a low-ranking officer, the disparity was due to discriminatory practices against lower-ranking personnel by the predominant PSP cadre within the department.\nTraditionally, he lamented, the norm within the department involved rankers carrying out the groundwork, while the PSP members received nominations for awards and medals, often claiming credit for the work done by their subordinates.\nThe story behind registration of FIR\nThe drama continued at the police station, where the mob insisted on filing an FIR against the woman, claiming an offence despite the Arabic calligraphy. Local religious leaders demanded a public apology, captured in a video officially released in the presence of ASP Shehrbano and other officers.\nReluctant due to potential backlash, the police hesitated to take any action nor register a case, only doing so after intervention from top government authorities, particularly the newly elected government.\nIt is pertinent to note that PML-N leaders, including Khawaja Saad Rafique, have promised strict action against such incidents during their election campaigns.\nDuring its previous term, the PML-N had to endure the brunt of such elements, facing multiple attacks and humiliations as their leaders were accused of playing a role in a bill aimed at amending blasphemy laws.\nThe gravity of the issue was reportedly recognised within the military top brass, spurred by recent incidents, including a smear campaign on social media against a former chief of army staff and a TLP's long march to Islamabad over the blasphemy issue.\nThis occurred just ahead of the appointment of a new army chief and the change of DG ISI.\n"

            "Text": "The forecast may be cloudy for Sunday, but PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif is poised for a political sunrise, expected to assume the mantle of the country's next prime minister, just 24 days after the \u2018controversial\u2019 general elections.\nAt a time when the country is close to seeing the formation of a new federal government, rigging allegations have cast a shadow over the country\u2019s political landscape, leading to intensified tensions between former allies, the PML-N and the JUI-F.\nAttempts at finding common ground between the two have proven challenging, even with PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif's charm offensive failing to sway JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman to support his brother, Shehbaz Sharif. Instead, Maulana Fazlur Rehman has opted to skip the election altogether, embarking on a three-day visit to Karachi.\nMeanwhile, the PTI was protesting against the alleged rigging in the polls. Its candidate for the prime minister\u2019s slot, Omar Ayub Khan, submitted his nomination papers to the NA secretariat from the platform of the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) for the post.\nIn addition, he submitted an objection over Shehbaz\u2019s nomination papers to NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, claiming that the PML-N leader had lost the election in his constituency -- NA-123 (Lahore-VII) but was declared victorious after manipulation in Form-47.\nHe added that therefore, Shehbaz was \u2018ineligible\u2019 for the post of the premier. The NA speaker has approved the papers of both the candidates for the PM\u2019s slot.\nKnowing that the alliance of the PML-N, the PPP, the MQM-P and other parties has a clear numerical strength in the NA, the PTI while learning lessons from the past --especially after seeing the stunning results of the recent general elections despite being cornered -- has decided not to leave the battlefield empty and give a walkover to the other side.\nWhile lending legitimacy to the emerging government, this development simultaneously completes a full circle in the broader political context. After the 2018 general elections, Shehbaz said that his party was participating in parliamentary politics as a form of protest. In 2024, the PTI finds itself in the National Assembly, aligning with the SIC, citing similar reasons.\nAs far as the numbers are concerned, the newly-stitched ruling alliance has a clear majority to form the government in the Centre.\nCurrently, the votes of 169 out of the total 336 members of the NA are required to elect the premier and form the government.\nIt became evident during the elections for the speaker and his deputy a day earlier that the PMLN-led alliance had 199 votes -- 30 more than required -- to clinch the office of the prime minister. The PTI-SIC candidates received 90-plus votes.\nThe election for the post of the premier is scheduled to be held on Sunday (today) at 11am. The premier is elected by MNAs in accordance with the Second Schedule of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the National Assembly, 2007.\nAs per the NA rules, before the voting commences, the speaker shall direct that the bells be rung for five minutes to enable the members not present in the chamber to reach there.\nImmediately after the bells stop ringing, all the entrances in the lobby will be locked. The assembly staff posted at each entrance will not allow entry or exit through them until the voting has concluded.\nThen the speaker will read out to the House the names of the validly nominated candidates, who have not withdrawn in the order in which their nomination papers were received and proceed to hold the poll in accordance with the procedure set out in the Second Schedule.\nAfter that, the speaker will ask the members to pass in a single file through the entrance where the tellers will be posted to record their votes.\nOn reaching the desk of the tellers, each member will, in turn, call out the division number allotted to them under the rules.\nThe tellers will then mark off their number on the division list, simultaneously calling out the name of the member.\nIn order to ensure that their vote has been properly recorded, the member will not move off until they have clearly heard the teller call out their name.\nAfter a member has recorded their vote, they will not return to the chamber until the bells are rung.\nAt the end, when the speaker finds that all the members, who wished to participate in the polling process, have recorded their votes, he will announce that the voting has concluded.\nLater, the NA secretary will ensure the collection of the division list, count the recorded votes, and present the result to the speaker. The speaker will then order that the bells be rung for two minutes to enable the members to return to the chamber. After the bells stop ringing, the speaker will announce the result to the House.\nOnce the votes are tallied, if there is only one contesting candidate and they secure the votes of the majority of the total membership of the assembly, the speaker shall declare them to have been elected as the leader of the house or the prime minister.\nHowever, if there is only one contesting candidate and they fail to secure the votes of the majority of the total membership of the assembly, all proceedings will commence afresh. If there are two or more contesting candidates and none of them secures a majority in the first election, a second poll will be held between those who bagged the two highest numbers of votes in the first one.\nThe candidate, who secures a majority of votes of the members present and voting, will be declared to have been elected as the prime minister.\nHowever, if the number of votes secured by two or more candidates bagging the most is equal, another election will be held between them until one of them secures a majority.\n"

The forum also recommended the revised PC-1 titled \u2018Installation of Telemetry System for Real Time Discharge Monitoring\u2019 at 27 key sites on the Indus Basin Irrigation system, presented by the Ministry of Water Resources with a total cost of Rs23,834.707 million, to the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC) for consideration.\nThe Indus Basin Irrigation System is proposed to be financed through the PSDP. IRSA had sponsored Rs500 million through its resources. The project is under the ownership of the Indus River System Authority (IRSA), with execution responsibilities given to the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA).\nAfter two-year post completion period, IRSA will take over the operation and maintenance of this transformative venture. Currently, the Indus Basin Irrigation water management system operates on manual procedures.\nDecisions regarding water distribution rely on manual calculations at barrages and information obtained through traditional means like phone or fax.\nThe absence of automated monitoring system has led to a situation where gate positions are unknown, causing control issues for provincial irrigation departments and potential inter-provincial disputes.\nTo address these challenges, IRSA plans to install state-of-the-art telemetry equipment at 27 key locations. This equipment, proven effective in similar environmental conditions worldwide, will replace manual operation and provide real time data on water flow and gate positions.\nThe project aims to eliminate mistrust, harmonise provincial relationships, and ensure compliance with the Water Apportionment Accord of 1991.\nThe objectives of the project are multi-faceted ensuring online, accurate information on water availability and flow at key locations. The project includes the installation of cutting-edge equipment, the establishment of a data centre, and client workstations at key locations. This, in turn, will foster confidence, transparency, and equitable water sharing in line with government policies.\n"

Despite her name being logged in the entry register, she did not present herself at the FIA headquarters even after office hours concluded.\nThe FIA initiated inquiry number 4 of 2024 based on a complaint filed by the Section Officer Policy of the Ministry of Interior. Under Section 160 of the criminal procedure code, a summon was dispatched to her Lahore residence on February 2, stipulating her appearance at 11 am. The notice explicitly stated that failure to appear would be construed as a tacit admission of guilt.\nPrior to this, Aleema received a summons from the FIA\u2019s Cyber Crime Wing in Islamabad on February 3, yet she did not attend that inquiry either.\n"

For this purpose, they can be given incentives to promote a shift from iTFAs towards embracing alternatives.\u201d She added that it is a complex challenge to eradicate iTFAs, however it can be achieved by adopting efficient policies, and multifaceted approaches to engage all stakeholders.\nTehzeeb Bakers Consultant Saqib said there is no facility for the isomerisation of edible oils in Pakistan, which means that iTFAs control is only possible through controlled processing, and proper selection of raw materials that come from vegetable sources.\n\u201cMost of our food is unregulated street food. Since the TFAs are drivers of many serious diseases, food authorities must regulate street food,\u201d added Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), Food Safety Expert Dr Zafar.\nDuring his talk, SDPI Executive Director, Dr Abid Qaiyum Suleri emphasised that multisectoral dialogues are required for managing dynamic issues like the injurious impact of iTFAs on health. He said that the prime areas of focus in terms of food security are the availability, affordability, accessibility, and nourishment value of food items.\n\u201cWhile the West is grappling with the crisis of malnourishment leading to obesity, Pakistan tackles the challenges of a different public lifestyle owing to its economic situation and culture,\u201d he explained.\n"

            "Text": "The federal cabinet on Tuesday approved the restructuring of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) but directed its specialised panel to sort out differences between the ministries of finance and privatisation over financial implications of the bifurcation of the airline for the budget.\nThe cabinet gave the green light to invite interests from potential investors for selling 51% to 100% stake of PIA \u2013 Pakistan\u2019s third highest loss-making entity. Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar chaired the cabinet meeting.\nThe cabinet was apprised that the Supreme Court had barred the government in 2018 from taking further steps for PIA privatisation without its prior consent. The privatisation ministry has filed a petition to inform the court about the developments but it has not yet got a hearing date.\nAccording to the PM Office, the cabinet approved the restructuring of PIA. The Cabinet Committee on Privatisation (CCOP) was directed to resolve the issue related to payables of government-owned departments, said a press statement.\nThe privatisation ministry did not first take the matter to the CCOP and took it directly to the cabinet. The CCOP, like the Privatisation Commission board, is also chaired by Privatisation Minister Fawad Hasan Fawad, which leaves little room for an independent oversight.\nThe CCOP will meet on Wednesday to iron out differences between the finance ministry and the privatisation ministry.\nThe cabinet\u2019s approval was sought for setting up a new holding company and transferring Rs622 billion to the firm, selling 51% to 100% stake of PIA and shifting the employees of Precision Engineering Complex (PEC) to the holding company. Cabinet members appeared to be in agreement but due to objections from the Ministry of Finance it was decided to hand over the new structure\u2019s financial issues to the CCOP, according to a member of the cabinet.\nFinancial advisers have proposed a major incentive for the buyers by allowing the use of PIA\u2019s deferred tax assets for 10 years instead of six years. However, this requires an amendment to the Income Tax Ordinance, which the finance ministry has opposed.\nThe cabinet gave approval for a bridge financing of Rs10 billion, to be arranged from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).\nThe cabinet was informed that foreign investors could not buy more than 50% shares under the Civil Aviation Act and Air Service Agreements. So, the foreign investors would have to enter into an arrangement with local investors for acquiring majority shares.\nThe financial advisers have submitted the draft of restructuring, legal segregation and transaction structure. But they have failed to submit the valuation report.\nSources said that the finance ministry opposed the privatisation ministry\u2019s proposal to write off PIA\u2019s debt of Rs140 billion. It also expressed concerns that no firm timeline had been given for the airline\u2019s privatisation. The Ministry of Finance opposed the transfer of Rs622 billion worth of debt to the holding company and instead recommended to keep some part of it with the core PIA. It also refused to provide any liquidity support to PIA before and after its privatisation.\nIn a major objection, the finance ministry said that there should be clarity about the valuation of PIA before and after its segregation. It opposed the extension of the benefit of deferred tax assets from six years to 10 years, saying it could set a precedent for other loss-making entities.\nThe Ministry of Finance\u2019s main objection was that PIA\u2019s debt and liabilities settlement plan should be prepared in a systematic manner. It opposed the privatisation ministry\u2019s focus mainly on transferring Rs268 billion worth of commercial banks\u2019 debt to the federal government books.\nRead ECP asks govt to stop PIA privatisation\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Monday did not approve the PIA\u2019s debt restructuring plan and sought more details, particularly the treatment of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), CAA and Pakistan State Oil (PSO) debt.\nThe finance ministry highlighted that the privatisation ministry had not yet secured the concurrence of all private and public sector lenders, and service providers for the segregation of PIA into two entities.\nThe financial advisers\u2019 report revealed that as of September 2023, PIA\u2019s equity turned negative by a whopping Rs663 billion.\nIt has been proposed that negotiations should be held with potential investors to retain PIA employees for three years. There is still a need to update PIA liabilities till December 31 before its bifurcation.\nCore and non-core\nThe financial advisers recommended that the Precision Engineering Complex, Pakistan International Investment Limited owning Roosevelt Hotel and Scribe Hotel and certain real estate assets should be treated as non-core assets and should not be privatised.\nAll ancillary services including engineering, ground handling, cargo, flight kitchen and training, as core assets, should be retained in main PIA for privatisation. However, the advisers underlined that their treatment as core assets would depend on the investors\u2019 willingness to buy them.\nLiability plan\nThe financial advisers proposed that the liabilities of Rs622 billion as of September 2023 should be transferred to a new holding company along with assets. These transferable liabilities include Rs268 billion in commercial bank debt.\nHowever, the government would need no-objection certificates from these banks before filing the scheme of arrangement with the SECP.\nThe Rs173 billion debt due to be paid to the federal government and advances from subsidiaries should also be transferred to the holding company. Similarly, all liabilities of Rs144 billion of the CAA, PSO and National Insurance Corporation Limited should be transferred to the holding company.\nThe advisers proposed to transfer Rs38 billion in pension liabilities to the federal government. The Rs6 billion worth of real estate, Rs6 billion in overdue advances and Rs8 billion worth of subsidiary balances are also proposed to be transferred to the holding company. The financial advisers proposed that the liabilities of Rs203 billion, mainly of foreign banks, should be retained in PIA along with Rs141 billion in operating assets.\nThe breakdown of Rs203 billion worth of liabilities showed that all commercial debt of Rs16 billion owed to foreign commercial banks should be retained in PIA. Payables of Rs64 billion to creditors mainly lessors and fuel suppliers should also be retained in PIA and offered to the buyers.\nThe advisers proposed that the operational liabilities of 104 billion related to fleet, employees deferred liabilities and trade payables may be retained in PIA.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 7th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

            "Text": "The Cabinet Committee on Energy (CCOE) on Tuesday approved the new refinery policy where it enhanced the limit on withdrawing money from an escrow account from 25% to 27.5%.\nPakistan Refinery Limited (PRL) has already signed an agreement with the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) under the new refinery policy. However, other refineries refused to strike any deal with the regulator and raised several issues like the continuation of 7.5% deemed duty collection on diesel sales after upgrading their plants.\nOther issues of concern for the refineries included the tax exemption on incremental capital expenditure (capex) to be deposited in the escrow account, project time and cost overruns. At a meeting held on Tuesday, the CCOE raised the cap on the withdrawal of money from the escrow account from 25% to 27.5%. This money will be spent on upgrading the refineries.\nUnder the new policy, the refineries expect Pakistan to become self-reliant in the production of diesel. The oil industry emphasises that the energy sector is the backbone of any economy but unfortunately the core challenges being faced in the realm of economy stem from ill-planning and mismanagement.\n\u201cIt is, therefore, good to know that the oil refineries policy for upgrading the existing/brownfield refineries with some amendments has been approved by the Cabinet Committee on Energy,\u201d it said. The industry pointed out that the badly needed policy took more than four years in the making and final approval was delayed on one pretext or the other. The policy was finally notified on August 17, 2023 but it had some anomalies, which were not acceptable to the refineries. After intense and prolonged consultation among the government, refineries, independent financial and legal advisory firms, the policy was appropriately amended and approved by the CCOE in a meeting chaired by Minister of Energy Muhammad Ali on Tuesday.\nRead\u00a0Oil industry claims losses of billions\n\u201cThe last step needed now is its approval and ratification by the cabinet, which we hope will be done in the next few days,\u201d it said. The policy will enable oil refineries to undertake major upgrade projects to not only comply with environmentally friendly Euro V specifications but also increase the production of deficit products such as petrol and diesel by 99% and 47%, respectively.\nAs part of the policy, they will reduce the output of furnace oil by 78% as its demand has gone down drastically in recent years, which often results in storage constraints forcing refineries to reduce capacity utilisation.\nOil Companies Advisory Council (OCAC) Chairman and Attock Refinery Limited CEO M Adil Khattak, in a statement, said that refineries\u2019 upgrade projects would bring an investment of $5 billion to $6 billion and will not only result in cleaner, environmentally friendly fuels but also ensure major savings of foreign exchange.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 7th, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"

The first time was on December 17, the second on January 7, and the latest one on January 20. The suspensions coincided with the PTI\u2019s virtual events.\nThe interim government attributed the internet outages across the country to \u201ctechnical issues\u201d, stating that there was no assurance that such incidents would not recur in the future.\nOn January 24, the Sindh High Court restrained the relevant authorities from suspending internet services till the general elections.\nThe high court ordered the caretaker federal government and PTA to ensure uninterrupted internet services till the polling day.\nThe order came on a petition filed by human rights defender and lawyer Jibran Nasir, who is contesting the polls for PS-110 as an independent candidate, against the frequent \u201cunconstitutional\u201d internet outages in the country in recent days.\n"

Two simultaneous bomb explosions targeted election offices in the Pishin and Killa Saifullah districts of Balochistan, while three individuals tragically died in a premature grenade explosion in Karachi.\nAlso in Balochistan, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI-F) leader Hafiz Hamdullah narrowly escaped an assassination attempt in Chaman. Assailants opened indiscriminate fire on Hamdullah\u2019s vehicle, but his guards bravely returned fire, repelling the attackers and ensuring his safety.\nEarlier, tragedy struck as 12 people lost their lives and over a dozen were injured in a blast targeting the election campaign office of Maulana Abdul Wasey, the Balochistan Amir of the JUI-F.\n\u201cThe JUI F\u2019s office was targeted through an improvised explosive device (IED),\u201d Killa Saifullah Deputy Commissioner Yasir Khan Bazai confirmed.

Upon seeing the bomb, children in the street raised the alarm.\nMahesar explained that Farooq attempted to conceal the bomb, but its safety pin was inadvertently pulled out, causing it to explode in his hands. Tragically, Farooq, along with two other civilians identified as Rehan and Nasreen, lost their lives on the spot.\nBalochistan, in particular, has experienced a sudden spike in terrorist attacks leading up to the elections. Prior to the twin terrorist attacks in Pishin and Killa Saifullah and the shooting incident in Chaman on Wednesday, there were bombings in Sibi and other parts of the province targeting candidates.\nKhyber-Pakhtunkhwa has also been on high alert ahead of the polling, with a candidate being assassinated and at least 10 police officials martyred when terrorists stormed a police station in Dera Ismail Khan on February 5.\nIn response to these incidents, especially the bomb blasts in Balochistan, the authorities swiftly closed the country\u2019s borders with Afghanistan and Iran for one day. The Foreign Office (FO) declared that the closure aimed to ensure \"security during the general elections.\nDespite the surge in terrorist attacks, authorities were firm that elections would take place as per schedule on Thursday (today). Caretaker Interior Minister Dr Goher Ejaz expressed his commitment to ensure robust security for elections.\nSpeaking at a press conference in Islamabad, Ejaz outlined the government\u2019s comprehensive arrangements put in place for the elections. He highlighted the presence of trained commandos in Balochistan and the support of the armed forces for the electoral process.\n\u201cSecurity will be deployed in three tiers, with 7 to 8 law-enforcers stationed at each polling station,\u201d Ejaz said.

Some 1,500 closed circuit cameras had also been installed to monitor the polling stations.\nChief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja expressed concerns over the recent terrorist attacks during his discussions with the Balochistan chief secretary and the inspector general of police.

            "Text": "As temperatures continue to drop across areas in central Punjab, the cold and foggy weather has yet again spiraled into another seasonal fog fever epidemic however, this time around, soaring inflation coupled with ineffective prevention strategies and inadequate documenting of cases, will exaggerate the likelihood of infected meat being sold in markets.\nEven though a large number of cattle and calves fall prey to the fog fever every year in Punjab, no serious prevention or treatment plan has been devised to educate and help farmers in keeping their livestock healthy and forestalling the loss of millions of rupees in case of the animals\u2019 death.\nRana Mubashir Hasan, a cattle breeder from Lahore owns one cow and four calves, who are examined by a privately hired veterinary doctor. \u201cIt is a pity that the staff of government veterinary hospitals do not cooperate with us when we take our sick animals to them. Instead of properly treating the cattle, they casually scribble down laymen measures for precaution and are quick to demand a payment for every little checkup,\u201d said Hasan, who further revealed that even though his animals had luckily survived the epidemic, several cows and buffalo calves belonging to other farmers in his locality had succumbed to the disease.\nAccording to veterinary experts like Dr Jasar Aftab, owing to the inclement sunlight is unable to reach the green fodder of farm animals, as a result of which particles of toxic chemicals including dust accumulate on the feed, rendering it poisonous. \u201cWhen this fodder is given to cattle during the winter, it can lead to their immediate death. Therefore, farmers must be advised on the importance of always giving dry feed and fresh water to their animals in the cold weather,\u201d directed Dr Aftab.\nConcurring with Dr Aftab on the importance of educating farmers, Amir Hayat Bhandara, a progressive farm officer was of the opinion that farmers in Pakistan were not aware of the steps that were needed for preventing the disease and no reporting system was in place to document the number of affected animals. \u201cFor any farmer, his livestock is his most valuable asset, which he can sell whenever he needs instant cash. Therefore, a farmer will try his very best to safeguard this asset,\u201d he added.\nBhandara\u2019s emphasis on farmers\u2019 inclination towards protecting their wealth invested in their livestock is confirmed by sources from the Punjab Food Authority (PFA), which claim that a large number of sick animals are brought by farmers to private slaughterhouses, from where their meat is distributed to various sellers. \u201cUp to 18,000 kilograms of substandard, infected meat was found last year,\u201d said an official from PFA.\nAs per the revelations made by a focal person of the Punjab Agriculture and Meat Company (PAMCO), even though the Shahpur Kanjran Slaughter House has a testing facility for screening out animals with various diseases including fog fever, the majority of private slaughterhouses across the province have no such arrangement in place.\n\u201cA physical examination is mandatory for checking the animal\u2019s fever, age and health before slaughtering. In this process, it is also important to check that a pregnant or lactating female animal is not slaughtered. A sick or infected animal has wounds on its liver or changes in its color, in which case all the meat of the animal must be destroyed. However, we are unaware of the state of affairs at private slaughterhouses,\u201d confirmed the official.\n"
