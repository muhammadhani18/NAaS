            "Text": "KARACHI: Amid unprecedented 22 per cent interest rate and restrictions imposed by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to curb vehicle demand, consumers have increasingly been seeking used vehicles for auto financing over the past two to three years.\nA number of banks have ventured into the leasing and financing of used vehicles, including models up to nine years old. However, high monthly instalments continue to deter many consumers due to affordability issues. \nDealers and banking sources have noted that the availability of used vehicles on monthly instalments has kept auto financing afloat. Otherwise, they said, the demand for new vehicles would have been negligible due to a steep rise in their prices and the shrinking buying power of many consumers, exacerbated by soaring utility bills. \nAhmed Shamim, a private banker overseeing auto leasing, said it is challenging to share information regarding imported vehicles and their instalments following the revised prudential regulations by the SBP in September 2021, which also imposed a ban on financing imported vehicles.\nHe revealed that used cars are currently in high demand due to the revised SBP\u2019s prudential regulations and a financing cap of Rs3 million of aggregate exposure. \nHe shared that the price of used 1000cc vehicles from 2015 to 2020 models ranges from Rs1.6m to 1.9m, with monthly instalments at around Rs40,000-50,000. The price of a five-year-old 660cc model would be a maximum of Rs2.1m and that of an Alto AGS/Auto and 1,000cc around Rs2.2m, with monthly instalments of approximately Rs55,000, he added. \nOver the last six months, the Karachi Interbank Offered Rate (Kibor) has declined from 24.5 per cent to 21.70pc, aiding genuine consumers who need financing for either new or used vehicles. Banks have also reduced their profits and their fixed rates, which have proven beneficial. \nMr Shamim expressed the hope that Kibor may decline in the future, leading to revised instalments. \nHe noted that the salaried class earning between Rs150,000-Rs300,000 monthly applies for financing, while banks offer car financing of under Rs3m max (total aggregate exposure) as per central bank\u2019s prudential regulations.\nHe added that Suzuki Alto 660cc, both brand new and used, is currently in high demand for leasing and financing by banks. \nMr Shamim said there might be some chances of a cut in the interest rate in the future. However, he stressed the need for revising prudential regulations to extend the financing cap from Rs3m to at least Rs9m minimum to enhance exposure for an individual in auto financing. \nAs per prudential regulations, vehicles with less than 1,000cc (locally assembled) could be financed with a minimum 30pc equity instead of 15pc, while the tenure has also been revised to five years from seven years max. \nFor vehicles above 1,000cc, the tenure is three years instead of seven years max. These changes in tenure and the cap on the aggregate debt burden ratio have posed challenges for buyers. \nAuto financing has consequently plunged for the 21st month ending March 2024 to Rs239 billion, down by 1.4pc or Rs3.5bn month-on-month. According to data issued by the SBP, the total decline in the past 21 months stood at Rs128bn, from Rs368bn at the end of June 2022. \nAn authorised dealer of locally assembled vehicles confirmed that only second-hand vehicles are being financed, while financing requests from consumers for new vehicles have been negligible due to extremely high prices and a 22pc interest rate.\n\u201cMy showroom finances one to three new locally assembled vehicles every month,\u201d he said, citing high power, gas, and food bills as forcing consumers to first manage the amount for these necessities before looking for other requirements.\nCurrently, corporate buying accounts for over 60pc of the sale of new cars and other vehicles, with the rest of the share going to individual cash buying. \nThe dealer said as inflation shows signs of slowing down in the coming months, stagnant consumer income continues to hinder the purchase of new cars. \nMashood Ali Khan, a local auto part maker and exporter, believed that only a single-digit interest rate can revive auto financing in new vehicles. \nHe urges the government to lower taxes and duties on locally produced vehicles in the upcoming budget to help reduce prices and revive dwindling sales.\n"

            "Text": "KARACHI: Amid growing optimism about an improved economic outlook, several triggers helped the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) achieve another milestone by closing the outgoing week at an all-time high above the 72,000 level.\nRising hopes of an interest rate cut following a sharp slowdown in March inflation to 20.7pc, expectations of a further deceleration to 17pc in April, and the IMF\u2019s Executive Board meeting to approve the $1.1 billion last tranche next week kept investors in a bullish mindset throughout the outgoing week.\nAccording to Arif Habib Ltd (AHL), the bullish market sentiment was also fuelled by strong performances in certain scrips during the ongoing result season.\nFurthermore, the country achieved its highest monthly current account surplus in almost nine years, $619 million, in March. Also, foreign direct investment hit the highest level since June 2022, $258m, up 89pc over the preceding month. The rupee closed at Rs278.39 against the US dollar, depreciating by eight paise or 0.03pc week-on-week.\nAs a result, the benchmark KSE 100-share index closed at an unprecedented level of 72,742.75 points after gaining 1,833 points or 2.58pc week-on-week.\nAKD Securities Ltd said the positive momentum was largely driven by anticipation of investments from Saudi Arabia, the successful visit of Iran\u2019s president, and Pakistan\u2019s inclusion in the IMF\u2019s executive board agenda for its meeting on April 29. \nOther news flows included IT exports surging 37pc to record $306m in March, RDA inflows rising to $7.66bn, and GDP expected to grow 2.6pc in FY24.\nAHL said the sector-wise positive contributions came from fertiliser (562 points), cement (380 points), banks (348 points), exploration and production (201 points), and power (155 points). \nMeanwhile, the sectors that contributed negatively were tobacco (54 points), miscellaneous (48 points), OMCs (39 points), refinery (29 points), and chemical (19 points). Scrip-wise, positive contributors were Engro Fertilisers Ltd (332 points), United Bank Ltd (214 points), Lucky Cement (207 points), Mari Petroleum Company Ltd (164 points), and Hub Power Company Ltd (156 points). \nMeanwhile, scrip-wise negative contributions came from Pakistan Tobacco Company Ltd (55 points), Pakistan Services Ltd (49 points), Pakistan Oilfield Ltd (44 points), National Bank of Pakistan (29 points) and Meezan Bank Ltd (27 points).\nForeign buying continued at $3m compared to $33.9m last week. Major buying was witnessed in E&Ps ($1.9m) and commercial banks ($1.2m). On the local front, selling was reported by insurance ($13.1m), followed by NBFCs ($0.1m). \nThe average trading volume rose 32pc to 650m shares while the average value traded increased by 22pc to $94m week-on-week.\nIn a significant development, Shanghai Electric Power Company withdrew its offer to acquire up to 66.4pc of K-Electric Ltd.\nAKD Securities Ltd said the upcoming Monetary Policy Committee meeting on Monday would remain in the limelight next week. The start of monetary easing is poised to further support the ongoing bullish market trend, which is led by debt-heavy sectors. \nAdditionally, the disbursement of the third tranche of the IMF\u2019s SBA and initiation of talks for a new Extended Fund Facility would be closely monitored.\n"

After 2017, the solarisation process witnessed a sharp increase.\nIt said that the whole system was being reviewed and now there was a need to announce a new rate. Proposals and amendments were being considered to save the poor consumers from further burden. The government would protect investment carried out through 1.5 to 2 million net metering, it concluded.\nIt may be recalled that during a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Power on Feb 20, the then caretaker minister for power Muhammad Ali and the ministry officials had hinted at the government\u2019s plan of lower net metering tariff to owners of rooftop solar power, saying they were \u201crich, well-to-do and big homeowner\u201d urbanites capable of paying excessive power rates compared to small consumers living in five-marla or so houses.\nThis tariff currently stood at Rs22 per unit but would be revisited going forward, Mr Ali had said in response to a worried senator who had pointed out that citizens had invested in rooftop solar panels after previously encouraged by the government and suggested that many countries promoted cheaper solar electricity.\nHowever, the minister said there was a consideration that this tariff was on the higher side and should be brought down, adding that the country had surplus generation capacity.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: A case study by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has presented real-time crop assessments of the 2022 massive floods in Pakistan and strongly recommended developing spatial analysis capacity within government agencies to ensure better preparedness for mitigating damages of future water-related disasters.\nThe case study of the \u2018Pakistan 2022 Floods\u2019, released this week, observed that spatial mapping could also be used to assess the impact of crop disease, pest infestations, drought, and others and to inform policymakers and decision-makers about situations pertinent to the national food supply, export earnings, and crop insurance.\nThe study suggests spatial mapping can also provide estimations of crop health for a wider area and do so faster than ground estimations, which require large amounts of resources, such as labour and transport, and are difficult to implement after floods or other natural hazards.\nAmong its key recommendations to facilitate the use of technology to enhance crop monitoring, the study recommended increasing the number of geographic information system and remote sensing specialists in relevant government agencies such as crop reporting services and statistics offices and integrating spatial analysis into statistical reporting systems to improve their accuracy and timeliness.\nThe use of technology can also familiarise policymakers and enable them to interpret spatial analysis results to help them make more effective decisions and plan policy actions for early detection of crop damage, rapid field verifications, mobilisation of adequate financial and material resources, and effective communication with the affected population.\nThe study also suggests that early detection, rapid field verification, and timely resource mobilisation can mitigate damage and help policymakers plan for robust recoveries from crop damage. The experience of the 2022 floods highlights the importance of these preparations and the need for using visual presentations of spatial analysis to communicate with the public and affected communities.\nAccording to the ADB study, Using spatial analysis and a spectral mapping technique, the 2022 flood damage was assessed for four periods during June-September 2022 in Pakistan. The assessment conducted during the first half of September 2022 indicated that about 15 per cent of crop areas were modestly or severely damaged. The accuracy of the technique was verified by cross-checking with data gathered at the actual locations on the ground.\nThe study says that more than a year before the 2022 floods, the ADB started working with Pakistan government agencies and local consultants to provide them with spatial information technology skills and equipment so that they could conduct crop damage assessments.\nThe study reminds us that climate change is expected to increase the frequency and magnitude of floods and other extreme weather events in the future. Thus, the Government of Pakistan must be prepared to mitigate the damage. It is crucial to plan how to use real-time crop damage assessments such as spatial analysis to plan for immediate disaster assistance and recovery efforts.\nThe study indicated that the crop stress maps of the 2022 floods were shared with the national and provincial ministries and international organisations. Such reports were a novelty to them and were first received with scepticism and many questions.\nTheir responses indicated the importance of damage assessment per type of crop (rice, wheat, maise, pulses, and others), whereas the maps at the time were generic, and the intended audience needed a better understanding of the system.\nThe study says establishing a reliable crop stress reporting system will help government agencies prepare for future floods. For this purpose, in February 2023, the ADB project team started sharing monthly reports with relevant government agencies, which were asked to comment on the reports. Because agriculture policy is a provincial matter, monthly reports were developed for each province and shared with national and provincial government agencies.\n"

After ascertaining such information, the high courts should pass orders or directions to safeguard the judiciary\u2019s independence, protect it from future intrusions, and initiate appropriate proceedings against any officers or persons responsible.\nThe petition highlighted that it was high time that the observations and directions made by the Supreme Court in the Asghar Khan and Faizabad sit-in cases regarding effecting monitoring and regulation of intelligence agencies be implemented in letter and spirit.\nIt said the intelligence agencies cannot continue to operate in what practically amounts to a legal vacuum and grants them unchecked powers without any effective executive or legislative oversight or accountability.\nThe petition filed by the IBA asked the Supreme Court to declare that the rules and orders of the respective high courts should be periodically reevaluated by the full court of the respective high court so that all the justices can perform their functions in accordance with Article 194 of the Constitution.\nThe petition also urged the top court to issue directions, after consultation with all the justices of the Supreme Court, the IHC or any other high courts, regarding the mandatory duties of the justices of the high court to report and have reporting mechanisms in instances where the executive, including its operatives, seek to interfere, pressurise, harass or intimidate the justices of the high court or any of the judges of the subordinate judiciary under the supervision of the respective high courts and a mechanism for institutional response in such matters be devised.\nThe petition urged the Supreme Court to declare any interference by the executive in the affairs of judicial functions and against the independence of the judiciary illegal and unconstitutional.\n"

He asked Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa to fulfil his legal and constitutional obligations to rein in the \u201creign of tyranny\u201d or else leave the position instantly.\n\u201cThe CJP should perform his duty lawfully and should not act like a bystander and fix the long-delayed PTI\u2019s various petitions for hearing and ensure rule of law or else leave the office,\u201d he said.\nSenator Walid Iqbal said the US report was very important because it covered the entire period after the \u201cregime change\u201d, adding that it was a damning assessment on the performance of the PDM government, caretaker set-up and \u2018unseen power-wielders\u2019.\nHe said the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) was adopted by the newly established United Nations on Dec 10, 1948, which set some minimum standards covering human dignity, privacy, freedom and sanctity of four walls that were also included in Pakistan\u2019s constitution.\nHowever, he regretted, out of the 100 pages, 50 pages of the US report contained human rights violations, dignity and abuses with a special mention of PTI leaders and workers who were subjected to custodial torture.\nMr Iqbal said the report also mentioned instances wherein police without having warrants unlawfully raided the houses of PTI leaders and supporters stole precious items.\nAdvocate Niazi said the US report summarised the widespread and rampant human rights abuses and constitutional violation instances in the country, which substantiated all their submissions and contentions after the regime change.\nHe alleged that there was no rule of law and the Constitution was sacrificed, besides compromising judicial independence.\nHe said extrajudicial killings were rampant in the country and rights to privacy, dignity and information and freedom of expression were violated with impunity.\nMr Niazi lamented that the PTI was even denied the right to peaceful assembly because it was not a democracy, but a \u201cfascist regime\u201d, which did not have any regard and respect for the Constitution and law.\nHe revealed that around 700 MPOs (Maintenance of Public Order) were issued in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and 222 in Punjab against the PTI leaders and supporters, but only IHC\u2019s Justice Babar Sattar took a stand against such order.\n"

            "Text": "LAHORE: The Sir Ganga Ram Hospital seems to have halted its healthcare services as it has stopped conducting around 80pc of tests, provision of over 90pc medicines, including life-saving ones, and cut the number of surgeries by 50pc.\nAn official, privy to information, says two highly expensive machines, namely CT Scan and MRI, have been lying dumped in the stores for the last six months in the name of renovation under the revamp programme.\nTalking about the negligence of the institute\u2019s top hierarchy, he says, 25 expensive batteries of the CT Scan machine have reportedly been stolen and the management hushed the matter to avoid inquiries. The hospital authorities have taken the health secretary also on board and shelved the alleged theft case, the official says. Consequently, patients are forced to go to the private labs around the hospital for tests from where the admin and other staff of the hospital are allegedly getting shares.\n \n \n\nThe official source laments that routine tests, including those for the diagnosis of diseases like hepatitis B and C, liver, kidneys and heart etc, mandatory before every surgery in emergency wards, are also not being done.\n\nMissing facilities include vital tests, medicines and surgeries; patients suffering for last six months\n\n\u201cFor example, the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) test recommended for measuring the amount of ALP in the blood is not available. Abnormal levels of ALP maybe a sign of a wide range of health conditions, including liver disease, bone disorders and chronic kidney disease.\u201d\nThe other tests not being done include TG/HDL, CK-MB, calcium, MG, phosphorus, lipase, electrolytes, V/m, thyroid function, Vitamin D, HCG etc.\nOne of the major factors for the missing test facility is the shortage of kits and reagents as the institute has failed to pay liabilities to the agents/companies.\nIn some cases, the official says, some doctors arrange money on their own to purchase kits from the private market to help poor patients but this is done randomly for the needy and deserving patients.\nAbout the life-saving drugs, the official says, all kinds of medicines, even those prescribed to every second patient like panadol, are also not available in the hospital.\nFollowing the critical shortage of panadol tablets, the doctors are prescribing panadol syrup to patients with high-grade temperature and body pains.\nSimilarly, omeprazole (capsule), a life-saving drug, mandatory for treatment at every emergency unit and prescribed to every patient with abnormal sugar level, is not available in the official supply for the last many months and the critical patients are being treated with \u2018omeprazole sache\u2019, a funny way to conceal \u2018another criminal negligence crime\u2019, the official says.\nThe life-saving heparin injection is highly important for heart seizure as it helps decrease clotting ability of the blood and prevents harmful clots from forming in blood vessels. The official says that in medical settings, non-availability of this life-saving drug at the government teaching institute like the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital is not less than a crime.\nThere are reports that the doctors at the hospital have no option but to ask the admin to procure medicines through the local purchase (LP) system. Under this system, the medicines are purchased at many times high prices from an agent of choice, the official informs, alleging that the hospital management is getting hefty shares from the agents, making an enormous burden on the national exchequer.\n\u201cSame is the case with Profasi injection used to recommend for pregnant women at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. It is responsible for the normal development of eggs in a woman\u2019s ovary. The drug is also commonly used for diagnosis or treatment of infertility in women. The hospital is known as one of the largest public health facilities for gynae-related treatment in Punjab but this life-saving drug is also not available at the hospital for the last many months. The patients are forced either to buy from the private pharmacies outside the hospital or made available by the management through the LP, the official says.\nSpecialised Healthcare and Medical Education Minister Khawaja Salman Rafique paid five to six frequent visits to this mega teaching institute since he assumed office while health secretary Ali Jan also visited it multiple times.\nThe members of Punjab Assembly and other relevant authorities also visit the hospital to attend events or meetings but all the \u2018visiting dignitaries\u2019 have shut their eyes to the hospital issues they are kept in the dark by the hospital management, the officer alleges.\nSir Ganga Ram Hospital Medical Superintendent (MS) Prof Dr Moeenuddin declared the revamp as one of the leading factors behind the sorry state of affairs. He claimed things would improve next week, refusing to further comment on the patients\u2019 troubles on the pretext of his busy schedule.\n"

            "Text": "The one question repeatedly asked is: \u201cJust when was Lahore founded?\u201d It seems this has invited several versions. Normally the names of rulers are a benchmark. But then what existed before \u2018rulers\u2019 came?\nIn this piece we will not ignore the names of rulers, but we will run through events and processes to arrive at a reasonable conclusion. It might sound strange, but then the rise and fall of empires and rulers are primarily, repeat primarily, related to weather patterns that we are used to. Even the current Afghan wish to move eastwards has ancient historic roots. Ignore not the fact that most walled city Lahore inhabitants are Afghans.\nThe origin of Lahore primarily is related to the fall and emptying of Harappa. It is now an accepted fact that the monsoon rains and the resultant floods most likely made living there impossible. The move to higher grounds like Lahore, among others, was the result. Because of the River Ravi\u2019s constant \u2018meandering\u2019 the Lahore port of Khizr, the patron saint of sailors and fishermen, came about. Lahore was truly then founded, and grain markets sprang up. But humans, in very small numbers, existed on the mound of Lahore before that.\nThe rains and flooding had a massive positive, as well as negative, aspect too. This piece is about that phenomenon. Research into the socio-political result of weather over the last 5,000 years is becoming an important aspect of history. Scientists at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology at Pune have started to date historic events vis-\u00e0-vis the monsoons. They have factored in severe, medium, and light monsoons to crop outputs, and then, among other factors, tried to study invasions. The results are amazing.\nWhile this research is important, earlier research on \u2018The Chronology of Prehistoric India\u2019 by Possehl and Rissman, provides detailed radio-carbon analysis of sub-continental archaeological sites. The end of human habitation of Harappa coincides by 200 years to that of Lahore\u2019s founding. So, Lahore existed 200 years (approximately) before the last human left Harappa.  \nJust why did Harappa collapse? We must not forget that a few billion years ago the sub-continent broke away from Africa and joined Asia. The push northwards, because of the Earth\u2019s rotation, continues and will do so forever. For this reason, the mountains to the north of Pakistan increase in height by about two inches (approximately) every year. This movement and the Earth\u2019s rotation has a direct effect of river \u2018meandering\u2019, as well as flooding.\nAnother half of Africa is in the process of breaking away and heading towards the sub-continent. But that will take a few million years to happen. It is a frightening prospect. The Chicago research provides a date as to when humans managed to move into the sub-continent \u2013 it\u2019s called radiometric dating \u2013 and that stands at Alpha 899 or 103,800, which equals to approximately 19,800 BC. So, starting from Mehrgarh humans settled and grew crops and herded animals approximately 14,500 years ago. One research puts it at 15,000 BC. They then moved up the rivers and first settled in Mohenjo Daro and then Harappa.\nAll these ancient habitations were destroyed by flooding and river movement, with occasional dry spells. But river movements \u2013 meandering \u2013 and monsoons determined how and when and where humans lived. The raising of crops and animals and the ability to store them is what invited invaders. Invasions took place when others to the West faced starvation. So, the equation was set.\nMost of the 11 major invasions of the sub-continent over 22 centuries starting from 6th century BC ending with the Mughal invader Babar in the 16th century, all happened during a \u2018good monsoon\u2019 when crops were plentiful. Amazingly, the original lands of the invaders had suffered no rains, or even plagues. Local starvation seems to have forced the invaders towards the sub-continent.\nThe Indian study has found that Cyrus the Great, the founder of the Persian Achaemenid empire, and his successor Darius expanded their territory into the northwestern parts of the Indian subcontinent at a time marked by near-continuous good monsoon during the 6th century.\nScientists have known for years that the summer monsoon that delivers nearly 75 per cent of the annual rain on the sub-continent has played a key role in impacting societies and civilisations. Earlier research has indicated that the decline of the Indus Valley cities coincided with a weakening monsoon and more rains on the east, facilitating the rise of settlements along the Indo-Gangetic plains. In a way climate change has always been there.\n\u201cBut there has been very little research on the monsoon and the invasions the sub-continent has experienced,\u201d Dr. Naveen Gandhi, a specialist in ancient climate at the IITM who led the new study. Although weather scientists began to maintain rainfall records in the 19th century, signatures of the monsoon\u2019s historical behaviour are imprinted in tree rings and mineral deposits found in caves.\nDr. Gandhi and his colleagues used tree rings in Kerala to reconstruct the monsoon\u2019s behaviour from 1484 AD to 2003 AD and referred to mineral data from two caves in Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh, and caves in Iraq, Iran, and Uzbekistan to reconstruct a 10,000-year history of the monsoon.\n\u201cThe greater the width of tree rings, the more abundant the rainfall.\u201d The concentration of an oxygen isotope in the mineral deposits can also tell us about the historical performance of the monsoon. Their analysis combined with history textbook information has suggested that nine of 11 invasions on the continent occurred during phases of good monsoon.\nThe study shows that the arrival of the Huns in the 6th century AD, the Umayyad Caliphate in the 8th century AD, Mahmud of Ghazni in 1001 AD, Mohammad Ghori in 1175-85, and Bakhtiyar Khilji from 1197 to 1206 had all coincided with abundant rainfall. Many of these invasions also occurred during poor rainfall over central Asia.\nIf we study the movement of Afghans towards their eastern border we see a constant trickle towards Pakistan. The barren country forces them to move towards the east, where they tend to settle. Immigration is a deeply complex subject, and people only leave their land if starvation or a lack of opportunity faces the population.\nIn our times we see two major migration problems facing Lahore and Pakistan broadly. Lahore was inundated with Afghans during the Russian invasion. Today the old walled city has a 62 per cent majority population of Afghans. They worked as cheap labour, and our traders protected them.\nMany years ago, while discussing this with the late Prof. Saleem Kaul of Peshawar University\u2019s botany department, his opinion was that migration is always for human betterment. Today we see the Afghan migrants have opened their own shops and spread all over the city. One learns that they charge less for good and pay their taxes, unlike local traders. The same is the case in Karachi and Peshawar and other major cities.\nBut this has been the case over time, and by time one means centuries. So, we see human movement over time, let alone recent movement, is what we are because of humans moving to better places because of climate change. And yet we do not take this seriously.\n"

            "Text": "LAHORE: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf has begun to reorganise the party in Punjab by notifying a four-member Lahore district body.\nThe party has begun reorganisation of the party after poor performance in bringing out protest rallies in Lahore and other districts in the province. The party had constituted a 26-member committee to plan and organise public meetings in Punjab but all the leadership remained in hiding and did not participate in the protest planned on the call of party\u2019s founder chairman Imran Khan.\nPTI central Punjab general secretary Hammad Azhar, who had constituted the committee and himself became convener of the committee, also did not participate in any protest rally. He has been in self-imposed hiding and has got bail from the Peshawar High Court.\nIn the latest move, Mr Azhar has constituted a three-member committee of the district organisation of Lahore. Mr Asghar Gujjar has been appointed as Lahore district president, Shabbir Gujjar as senior vice-president, Abdul Karim as senior vice-president and Hafiz Zeeshan as general secretary.\nCongratulating the new office-bearers, Mr Azhar hoped that the new body would be able to organise and activate the party in Lahore.  \nARREST: The Punjab Police on Saturday raided the office of party MPA Farrukh Javed Moon and arrested his four employees and shifted them to some unidentified location.\nIn a statement on X on Saturday, Mr Azhar said Farrukh Moon had organised a rally on four-wheelers and two-wheelers carrying party flags and the very next day police raided his office.\n"

            "Text": "LAHORE: The Child Protection Welfare Bureau (CPWB) has proposed the Child Marriage Restraint Bill 2024-25 to the Punjab government. The bill suggests increasing the minimum age for girls to marry to 18 years.\nCPWB Chairperson Sarah Ahmad has written to Punjab Home Secretary Noorul Amin Mengal, emphasizing the urgent need to address the harmful practice of child marriage. She cited the Pakistan Demographic Health Survey 2017-18, which revealed that 18pc of women aged between 20 to 24 in Punjab were married off before the age of 18 and 2pc were married before the age of 15.\nAs a member provincial assembly (MPA) and CPWB chairperson, Sarah Ahmad is seeking the support of the home department for the crucial legislative initiative.\nThe Punjab Child Marriage Restraint Bill, 2024 is an updated version of the Child Marriage Restraint Act 1929. It has been crafted to protect the health, safety and well-being of young girls affected by child marriage in the province.\nThe bill aligns with the 18th Amendment and is contextualized to Punjab. It aims to protect the rights and well-being of children, especially girls, ensuring that they can live, survive, develop and thrive in a family environment free of discrimination and violence.\nMs Ahmad has requested the Punjab Child Marriage Restraint Bill, 2024 to be tabled in the Provincial Assembly at the earliest, setting a precedent to promote child welfare, rights equality and public health.\nThe bill, available with Dawn, states that a marriage can be solemnised and registered on the production of a computerized national identity card (CNIC). In case of a dispute regarding the age of any contracting party, the court will determine the age based on a birth certificate, educational certificates or any other pertinent document. In the absence of such documents, the age may be determined based on a medical examination report.\nThe bill also proposes rigorous punishments for an adult marrying a child, solemnising or registering a child marriage and for parents or guardians involved in a child marriage. An adult who contracts a child marriage could face rigorous imprisonment of up to two years and/or a fine of up to Rs20,00,000.\nPunjab Home Department Secretary Mr Mengal told Dawn that a meeting of the department was conducted about the submission of the draft law. He said the proposed Child Marriage Restraint Bill 2024-25 was submitted to Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz and Cabinet.\n"

Irfan Abbas has been arrested while his brother Imran managed his escape from the spot.  \nLocals, including the owner of a nearby medical store adjacent to DHQ hospital, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it seemed quite impossible for a storekeeper to embezzle huge quantities of medicines without the blessings of the hospital superintendent and other high-ups of the health department.\nREMOVED: The commissioner has removed a price control magistrate over poor performance and instructed nine other magistrates, including four assistant commissioners, to improve their work. \nHe was addressing a review meeting of price control magistrates in his conference room on Saturday.  \nIn addition to acting DC Mohsin Salahuddin, ADCG, deputy director food, officials of the market committee and other relevant officers, including deputy commissioners and assistant commissioners of Khushab, Mianwali, and Bhakkar, participated via video link.  \nThe commissioner directed to fill vacant positions of price magistrates. He also directed DCs to lower prices of ghee in collaboration with relevant officers and dealers.  \nHe issued instructions to monitor demand and prices of lentils across the division.  \nHe emphasised the need to further reduce the price of bread after consulting stakeholders to provide relief to the public.  \nHe said it was commendable that under the vision of Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, the prescribed price for roti and naan was being implemented across the division, but strict action should also be taken against those selling underweight bread.  \nHe stressed that the prescribed rates of roti and naan with weight should be prominently displayed at every tandoor and sale point. He said that price magistrates should spend at least two hours daily in markets and also establish their camp offices in busy markets so that the public feels that the government is actively working to protect their rights.  \nThe individual performance of each price control magistrate was reviewed in the session.  \nThe commissioner directed all DCs and ACs to convene an immediate meeting with revenue officers regarding the important initiatives of the Board of Revenue.  \nHe asked the DCs to submit reports to his office regarding approval pertaining to residential colonies in accordance with the timelines issued by the chief secretary.\n"

Owing to holes created by rats, the breach of 10-foot initially occurred between Stone 159-160 right at 4am on Saturday, later widened to 40 feet. Izhaar said the irrigation staff tried to control the breach but flow was high. Later, the machinery with excavators was called and rescue work started with support of labour force also.  \nAt last breach was fully plugged at 9am. He said the water inundated nearby 100 acres of fields. However, water damaged a few mud houses in a neighbouring locality.\n"

            "Text": "LAHORE: It proved a perfect series finale, having almost everything in it.\nAmid loud cheers from boisterous crowd at a jam-packed Gaddafi Stadium, Pakistan kept their cool to avoid what would have been an absolutely shocking series loss to a significantly under-strength New Zealand side. \nThough the two run-outs in the very last over \u2014 of tailenders Ben Sears and William O\u2019Rourke \u2014 bowled by an intelligent Mohammad Amir ended the game in an unexpected fashion, the Michael Bracewell-led tourists stretched Babar Azam and his men almost to the fullest before falling short by nine runs in the end.\nFirst it was opener Tim Seifert and then late-order batter Josh Clarkson who gave goosebumps to the home fans \u2014 who were duly expecting their team to at least square the five-match series \u2014 as the tourists looked to chase a tough-looking 179 on a tricky wicket that had something for everyone. \nWhile pacer Shaheen Shah Afridi, who earned both player-of-the-match as well as the player-of the-series award, looked tip-top during his 4-30 show, all other bowlers raised their game just when it was required.\nAfter conceding a four in the opening over of the innings, Shaheen went through Tom Blundell\u2019s defences with a beautiful delivery that moved very slightly away to disturb the timber.\nBut Seifert had other ideas as the right-handed opener kept playing belligerent strokes. He welcomed Mohammad Amir with a first-ball straight six in the fourth over and followed it up with two fours. The wicket-keeper/batter in the next over greeted Abbas Afridi in the same manner on his very first ball and backed it with a four, giving a clear message to the opposition that he means swift business.\nNew Zealand raced to 63-1 in the first six overs. Seifert completed a 29-ball fifty in the seventh over, his ninth in T20 Internationals, but was soon cleaned up excellently by leg-spinner Usama Mir on his very first delivery of the match as Pakistan took a sigh of relief. When dagerman Mark Chapman (12 off 12) was bowled by Usama while trying a sweep with New Zealand sitting nicely at 97-2 in the 11th over, it caused a mini collapse for New Zealand and gave Pakistan the conviction that they can do it. \nIn the very next over, the tourists received another jolt when Bracewell (23 off 21) was caught by Babar at short mid-wicket off Shadab and Cole McConchie (one) was trapped in front by left-arm spinner Imad Wasim on his very first ball of the 13th over to leave New Zealand at 103-5.\nThe 15th over bowled by Shaheen dented New Zealand further as the lanky pacer sent experienced James Neesham (16 off eight) and Zakary Foulkes (duck) back on back-to-back deliveries. Ish Sodhi became Shaheen\u2019s fourth victim in the 17th over as the leg-spinning all-rounder was trapped and New Zealand slipped further to 137-8.\nIt looked almost over for New Zealand. But there was one man left in the hut about whom not many in Pakistan and the rest of the cricketing world currently know \u2014 Clarkson. Batting at number seven, he from nowhere smashed an unbeaten 38 off 26 with the help of three fours and two sixes keeping thousands at the ground and millions across Pakistan at the edge of their seats.\nUsama\u2019s 2-21 off four overs was equally important for Pakistan to sneak through.\nEarlier after being put in to bat, Babar and Fakhar Zaman steered Pakistan to a solid-looking 178-5. \nSaim Ayub\u2019s struggles in the series continued as the left-handed opener tried to lift pacer William O\u2019Rourke in the second over of the innings but mistimed it and was caught at mid-off by New Zealand skipper Bracewell. Babar was then joined by Usman Khan.\nHaving got off the mark with a boundary over square leg in the first over bowled by Zakary Foulkes, Babar cracked some exquisite shots including a huge six off the same bowler in the third over. The Pakistan captain then struck fast bowler Ben Sears for three fours \u2014 including his signature flick through midwicket \u2014 in the very next over that fetched the hosts 16 runs.\nPakistan reached 51-1 in the powerplay as Babar and Usman gradually developed their partnership amid cheers from a near-capacity crowd.\nRight-handed Usman, who failed to impress after making T20I debut earlier in this series, finally made amends at least some while making a 29-ball 31.\nThe 28-year-old smashed a straight six off off-spinner Bracewell followed by a four through square leg in the eighth over that cost the tourists 15 runs. But the 28-year-old was magnificently caught by Bracewell at extra cover off veteran leg-spinner Ish Sodhi in the very next over. Usman added 73 with Babar off 44 balls. Fakhar Zaman came in to bat number four.\nBabar meanwhile continued with his impressive strokeplay and in the process completed his half-century, the batter\u2019s 34th in T20 Internationals.\nPakistan brought up their 100 in the 13th over bowled by Sodhi who in the same over was belted for a six by Babar.\nLeft-handed Fakhar, who made 43 off 33, took his time before starting to unleash strokes. \nBen Sears was smashed by Fakhar for a four in the 15th over but the paceman came back in the same over by penetrating a rock-solid strong defences of Babar with a superb yorker that crashed into the middle stump. The batter collected a 44-ball 69 studded with six fours and a couple of maximums.\nFakhar struck a couple of fours and a characteristic six over mid-wicket on a short-pitched ball by Sears in the 18th over which produced 19 runs. He was magnificently caught at the boundary in the final over of the innings \nWhile Iftikhar Ahmed (six) was undone by Neesham in the 19th over, Shadab\u2019s cameo (15 not out off five) made sure Pakistan get a fighting total in the end. \nFakhar was magnificently caught by Chapman at the boundary in the final over off Foulkes.\nScoreboard\nPAKISTAN:\nSaim Ayub c Bracewell b O\u2019Rourke    1\nBabar Azam b Sears  69\nUsman Khan c Bracewell b Sodhi  31\nFakhar Zaman c Chapman b Foulkes    43\nIftikhar Ahmed c Bracewell b Neesham    6\nShadab Khan not out 15\nImad Wasim not out  4\nEXTRAS (LB-1, NB-1, W-7)    9\nTOTAL (for five wickets, 20 overs)  178\nDID NOT BAT: Shaheen Shah Afridi, Usama Mir, Mohammad Amir, Abbas Afridi\nFALL OF WICKETS: 1-8 (Saim), 2-81 (Usman), 3-123 (Babar), 4-159 (Iftikhar), 5-171 (Fakhar)\nBOWLING: Foulkes 4-0-35-1 (3w, 1nb), O\u2019Rourke 4-0-25-1 (2w), Sears 4-0-46-1 (2w), Bracewell 3-0-28-0, Sodhi 4-0-30-1, Neesham 1-0-13-1\nNEW ZEALAND:\nT.

            "Text": "MADRID: Defending Mad\u00adrid Open champions Carlos Alcaraz and Aryna Sabalenka both triumphed in their opening clashes in the Spanish capital on Friday to reach the third round.\nAlcaraz returned after a month out to begin his double defence with a convincing 6-2, 6-1 win over Alexander Shevchenko, while Sabalenka survived a tense three-set tussle against the in-form Magda Linette.\nMen\u2019s world number three Alcaraz shone on home clay after a forearm problem led to his withdrawals from the Monte Carlo Masters and Barcelona Open.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been quite a tough month for me, with the uncertainty over when I\u2019d be back,\u201d said Alcaraz. \u201cThe priority today was to see how I felt, in a difficult match.\n\u201cThe feelings were very good, and I think I played at a very good level despite coming without rhythm... I am very happy and it\u2019s a pleasure to play here in Madrid again.\u201d\nWearing a protective sleeve on his right arm, two-time Grand Slam winner Alcaraz quickly dispelled any doubts after his time out by flying out of the blocks in the first set with a break.\nThe 20-year-old Spaniard was as exciting as ever, frequently on the attack, and secured a second break in the fifth game for a 4-1 lead.\nIndian Wells winner Alcaraz hit the net with a drop shot to let the Kazakhstani back in but broke again himself for a 5-2 advantage which he served out.\nAlcaraz pulled off two second set breaks for a 3-0 lead but again allowed his 23-year-old opponent to cut the deficit before striking back with a third break, which he consolidated for 5-1.\nThe 2022 and 2023 Madrid winner and second seed wrapped up his victory in little over an hour with another break when Shevchenko sent a forehand long.\nAlcaraz will face Thiago Seyboth Wild in the third round after the Brazilian surprised Lorenzo Musetti 6-4, 6-4.\nAndrey Rublev ended a four-match losing streak with a straightforward 6-1, 6-4 win over Facundo Bagnis.\n\u201cIt feels really great after a while to start with a win and I\u2019m happy with my performance,\u201d said Rublev, who lost his temper and obliterated his racquet after a first round exit in Barcelona.\nGerman fourth seed Alexander Zverev, the champion in 2018 and 2021, comfortably made the third round with a 6-3, 6-2 win over Borna Coric.\nIn the women\u2019s draw Sabalenka edged Linette 6-4, 3-6, 6-3.\nThe Australian Open winner has struggled since her triumph in Melbourne and her Polish opponent fought well in the two-hour nine minute contest.\nBig-hitter Sabalenka, ranked second in the world, edged the first set but struggled in the second as Linette broke to love and then consolidated for a 4-1 lead.\nThe 32-year-old then carved out three break points in the sixth game but although she could not take them, eventually steered the match to a deciding third set.\nTwo-time Grand Slam champion Sabalenka saved three break points to stay on serve and then found a net cord winner to break herself for a 5-3 lead.\nSabalenka, 25, wrapped up her narrow victory over the world number 48 by smashing down an ace and will face Robin Montgomery in the third round.\n\u201cI think in that second set she just put a little extra pressure on my serve, and I just didn\u2019t handle my emotions well,\u201d said Sabalenka.\n\u201cWe went to a third set, and I\u2019m just happy that I was able to close this match with a win.\u201d\nElena Rybakina eased past Lucia Bronzetti 6-4, 6-3.\nThe Kazakhstani, ranked fourth in the world and with a tour-leading three titles this season, continued her good form after triumphing in Stuttgart last week.\nRybakina faces Egyptian Mayar Sherif in the next round after she surprised Stuttgart runner-up Marta Kostyuk 6-2, 7-5.\nChinese fifth seed Zheng Qinwen retired with a thigh injury from her match against Yulia Putintseva, who had taken a 7-5, 2-0 lead.\nSixteen-year-old Mirra Andreeva, who made the fourth round in 2023, won the battle of teenagers to defeat Linda Noskova 4-6, 6-3, 6-3.\n"

Many alleged that the municipal staff concerned and police returned their seized pushcarts and valuables after taking bribes.\nThousands of families have been rendered homeless following a demolition drive along three major stormwater drains in the city and they have been running from pillar to post for years to get promised compensation but in vain.\nWhile the apex court\u2019s recent order is widely hailed in terms of encroachments that have been occupying spaces meant to be used by the public, it doesn\u2019t sit right with vendors.\n\u201cMy husband Ghulam used to put a stall of samosas outside Empress Market. Last time when an anti-encroachment drive took place, police seized his cart without any prior notice,\u201d Sakina Wali, 43, a housemaid, told Dawn.\n\u201cWe had to literally beg them to return it back to us. My husband was abused and humiliated by the staff concerned, and we had to pay them a hefty amount of Rs20,000 to get our cart back,\u201d she said.\nShe claimed that her husband had a permit to conduct business on the street.\nKausar Bibi, who used to put a stall of spices outside the same Empress Market had a similar story. She is the sole breadwinner of a family of six, that includes four children, and she never returned to the market, instead she started her business outside Meena Bazaar, Karimabad.\n\u201cI am scared because I don\u2019t think I can afford to shift again to somewhere else. If they can come for us once, they won\u2019t shy away from putting it all to waste again,\u201d she said, tinge of fear evident in her voice.\nLawyer and human rights activist Abira Ashfaq provided insight on the situation, emphasising that the government must adhere to legal procedures regarding encroachments.\nShe stressed the importance of examining the necessity for the space by authorities and highlighted the need for a sufficient notice period for individuals using the land to relocate, along with financial assistance provided by the government.\n\u201cThere are international guidelines about illegal land occupations. Instead of making irrational \u2018reckless\u2019 decisions, the authorities must take the sufferings of common people into account and understand that whether an occupation is legal or illegal, it requires a procedure and a notice period and financial compensation should be provided,\u201d Ms Ashfaq said.\nWelcoming the decision to remove barricades, lawyer and rights activist Jibran Nasir voiced apprehension that the SC directive may cause confusion among small business owners on the streets.\nAlso on Saturday, a three-judge SC bench headed by Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa issued its written order, directing the federal and all provincial governments to clear public roads and pavements of all encroachments within three days.\n\u201cPavements are for the use of the public; access thereto and use thereof cannot be prevented or restricted. Everyone, including the provincial and Federal governments, and all those under them must abide by the law and cannot encroach upon public roads and pavements nor can block them which may stop or restrict public use thereof\u201d, the order said, and added: \u201cCitizens must not be inconvenienced. Those paid out of the public exchequer serve the people, and not vice versa. The misplaced exceptionalism negates the Constitution and the rule of law.\u201d\n"

            "Text": "KARACHI: The Supreme Court has directed the provincial government and local administration to consider and decide within one month the claims of families who have been rendered homeless and not registered yet for compensation and rehabilitation after the demolition drive was carried out along three major drains in the city.   \nThe court issued the order after the victims\u2019 counsel had informed the judges that government officials concerned were not ready even to receive their applications/claims.   \nAs there are various complaints over non-registration of many affected families for compensation and rehabilitation by the authorities concerned, the apex court said that if any affected family had not been included yet, they might submit their claims to an additional commissioner of Karachi.   \nA three-judge bench of apex court headed by Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa said that such claims must be filed within a month and the official concerned would have to inform such families whether their claims were accepted or not.   \n\nSC issues written order in nullahs victims rehabilitation case\n\nIt also ordered that once this exercise was completed the Sindh government should allot plots and pay compensation to the affected families without further delay.   \nThe Supreme Court heard several cases related to encroachments on public spaces in the city on April 25 and the written order was released on Saturday.   \nAt the outset of the hearing, a lawyer for some of the families submitted that houses of his clients had also been demolished, but their names were not included in the list of affected families maintained by the government for compensation and rehabilitation.   \nThe counsel asserted that the families had been approaching the deputy commissioner office concerned as well as the commissioner of Karachi office, but the officials concerned were not ready even to receive their applications/claims.   \nWhen the bench inquired from the advocate general of Sindh, he submitted that besides providing financial support on account of rental support, the provincial government stood by its commitment to allot 80 square yard plots to the affected families as well as to provide construction cost while 6,932 affected families had been identified.   \nResponding to another question of the bench, he said that leases were granted to such families by the departments concerned.   \nThe provincial law officer further said that on April 8, an identical application seeking registration of affected families also came up for hearing, but it was erroneously mentioned in the last court order that such families may approach the focal person of the chief secretary of Sindh for redressal of their grievances instead of focal person of the commissioner of Karachi, who has been dealing with such cases since long.   \nThe bench in its order said, \u201cHowever, if any family whose house was demolished has not been included may submit their claim, with supporting documents and photographs, if any, to the commissioner\u2019s focal person, Ms. Zunaira Jalil, additional commissioner-II, Karachi\u201d.   \nIt also stated that since the matter needed to be finalised, all such claims should be filed within one month and those who submit claims must be informed of the decision whether their claims were accepted or rejected.   \nRs1m for each house \nThe AG said that the amount for construction purpose was fixed at Rs1 million for each house by the Sindh government which was sufficient compensation, but since it was objected to by some of the affectees the matter was referred to the Pakistan Engineering Council to calculate what would be appropriate amount, and the PEC\u2019s calculation was awaited.   \nThe apex court noted that last order passed on April 8, by this court stipulated compliance be made within two months on subject matter and such period had not expired as yet.   \n\u201cOnce the above exercise is completed the government should allot plots and pay compensation to the affectees immediately, and maintain proper record, without the need for an order from this court\u201d, it added.   \nThe demolition drive was carried out on the orders of the Supreme Court along Gujjar, Mehmoodabad and Orangi Town nullahs of the city in order to expand the drains.   \nIn 2021 the apex court ordered the provincial authorities for compensation and rehabilitation of the affected and displaced families.   \nThereafter, in August last year during the hearing of an application seeking contempt proceedings against Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah for not complying with the orders of the apex court, the provincial authorities forwarded proposals that the government would release amount to each of the affected families for purchase of land and construction according to market value of the land from where the affected families were dispossessed while about the cost of construction, the standards laid down by the PEC for construction of house measuring 80 square yards, would be followed.   \nA large number of the affected people, including women, are used to gather and stage protests outside the apex court building on almost every hearing against the government for failing to rehabilitate them despite the passage of around three years and several of them have also been complaining that their homes were also demolished, but they have yet to get any compensation on account of rental support or accommodation despite approaching the officials concerned.\n"

            "Text": "KARACH: Forty-three areas in 11 districts, including 34 in Karachi division alone, are at a high polio risk whereas more than 38,000 cases of refusals were reported in the province during the national immunisation days observed in February this year.\nThis was shared during a meeting of the provincial task force for the eradication of polio held at the CM House on Saturday.\nThe meeting, presided over by Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, was organised to discuss the challenges in the upcoming national immunisation campaign scheduled for Monday (April 29) in 25 districts.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBriefing on the latest polio situation in the country, Health Minister Dr Azra Pechuho said that two polio cases had been detected this year in Balochistan; one in Dera Bugti and the other in Chaman district.\n\nAnti-polio campaign to begin tomorrow;  over 38,000 cases of refusal reported in February\n\nIn Sindh, she said, environmental samples had been collected from all the districts and 43 areas of 11 districts were found to have poliovirus in their sewage.\nThese included 13 areas of Karachi East, three each of Central, Malir and Korangi, Hyderabad and Sukkur, six each of South and Keamari, and one each in Jamshoro, Jacobabad and Badin.\nThe chief minister was informed that a total of 38,743 cases of refusal were reported during the national immunisation days observed in February this year.\n \n \n\nThe meeting was informed that over 9.04 million children under the age of five were given polio vaccine at transit points over the last 15 months, starting from Jan 2023 to March 2024.\n\u201cA total of 275 transit posts were set up with 1.003 teams across Sindh. The department has also launched the Polio Ambassador Unitive Project in Karachi that is now being expanded across the province with 407 schools participating and 901 new Polio Ambassadors inducted this month,\u201d she said, adding that Polio Ambassadors were advocating for the cause of vaccination in their homes, communities and schools.\nOver 0.6m workers to participate in drive\nThe chief minister was informed that the National Immunisation Campaign would be launched on Monday in 25 districts of the province, during which 8m children below 5 years of age would receive oral polio vaccine (OPV).\nOver 600,000 frontline workers would participate in the drive. The anti-polio drive would be carried out in 201 union councils of Karachi in which 24,656 polio workers would perform their duties.\n\u201cEradication of polio is a collective responsibility. Therefore, the district administration, local bodies, civil society members and our partners must work together to save children from the crippling disease. All deputy commissioners and SSPs must ensure its success,\u201d the chief minister said during the meeting.\nIt was decided that the health department would share the list of the poliovirus-infected union councils with local bodies/towns and the district administrations to ensure proper cleanliness, efficient disposal of wastewater and provision of clean drinking water.\nMr Shah directed the staff to ensure that no parent was allowed to refuse administration of polio drops to his/her children and report the case to the administration for action.\nHe also directed the polio teams to administer polio drops to 126,553 children who were not available at their homes during the February 2024 campaign.\nThe CM directed IG Police to provide 3,833 policemen for security. He also directed him [IGP] to provide similar security to other teams to work in rural areas of the province.\nThe attendees included Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, Secretary to CM Raheem Shaikh, Home Secretary Iqbal Memon, IG Police Ghulam Nabi Memon, Commissioner Karachi Hassan Naqvi, EOC Coordinator Irshad Sodhar, DG Health Dr Waqar and Secretary School Education Zahid Abbasi.\n"

            "Text": "KARACHI: With an aim to explore strategies to enhance inclusivity, a diverse group of individuals, representing various faiths, aired their views regarding their representation in the media at a programme organised by the Karachi Chapter of the Pakistan-US Alumni Network (PUAN) with support of the US Mission in Pakistan held at the Holy Trinity Cathedral here on Saturday.\nThe programme was divided into two parts. The first part had individual speeches and the second a panel discussion. While speaking on the occasion, chairman of the Pakistan Khalsa Sikh Council, Sardar Amar Singh said that the media did not cover real issues faced by minorities. \u201cJust covering our festivals is not enough. What about what lies beneath the surface?\u201d He asked, while pointing out the missed stories about forced conversions, bandits in Ghotki and attacks on religious places of minorities.\nRepresenting the Parsi community and member of CM Sindh\u2019s Non-Muslim Welfare Committee Tushna Patel said that everyone deserves equal opportunity.\n\u201cPakistan has various faiths. Stereotyping and biases can fuel societal divides. By amplifying our voices, you can build bridges and develop a better understanding about our faiths while creating empathy, understanding and open-mindedness to create a just and inclusive world,\u201d she said.\nMPA Rooma Mushtaq, an advocate and another member of the CM Sindh\u2019s Non-Muslim Welfare Committee, said that she could assure the PPP government\u2019s support to minority religious groups.\nMNA Kheal Das Kohistani, representing the Hindu community, said that he was a Pakistani first. \u201cSo don\u2019t call me a \u2018minority\u2019, don\u2019t bracket me because I also experience the same issues you do such as electricity loadshedding and water scarcity,\u201d he said while also lamenting that there was no non-Muslim governor or president in Pakistan.\nHe also said that when prime minister of India Narendra Modi says anything targeting Muslims in his country, it has nothing to do with the Hindus in Pakistan. \u201cPlease don\u2019t blame us or make us suffer due to Modi\u2019s actions,\u201d he said.\nFormer Federal Minister for Law and Justice Barrister Shahida Jamil recalled the Quaid-i-Azam\u2019s August 11, 1947 speech to the first Constituent Assembly where he had said to all religious minorities that they were free to go to their temples. \u201cMuslims were looked down upon and discriminated against before partition, which led to the two-nation theory. Pakistan was to be a land where there was to be no discrimination,\u201d she said.\nThe Bishop of Karachi and Balochistan Diocese, Church of Pakistan, Rt Rev Fredrick John, said that medium was important. \u201cMost important is the medium of conversation to point out issues but pointing them out in the right way is also important. Many times I object to using the word \u2018minority\u2019. Words such as \u2018minority\u2019, \u2018majority\u2019, \u2018intolerance\u2019 and \u2018tolerance\u2019 create complexes. Such words must be avoided,\u201d he said.\nDuring the panel discussion, which followed, moderator Sadiya Samson asked her panellists different questions relating to the theme of diversity and issues of minorities.\nPresident of Pakistan Young Hindu Forum, Advocate Mukesh Kumar Karara said that the media misinterpreted forced conversion cases by making it look like the girl willingly came to court to convert to Islam.\n\u201cThere are a lot of crucial things that need to be highlighted but the media shows what the majority wants to see. And why don\u2019t Hindu boys want to convert? Why just our girls?\u201d He pointed out.\nFounding Member, Minority Rights March, Sijal Shafique said that there were also other religious minorities in Pakistan but somehow the media here only focused on Christians and Hindus.\nAnother founding member of the Minority Rights March, Bhevish Kumar said that in Pakistan there was a holiday for Christians on Christmas only because it also happens to be the birthday of the Father of the Nation.\nDeep Kiran Rajani, another minority group member, who is Senior Deputy Director of Human Resources with the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority, narrated an incident her little daughter faced in school sometime back. \u201cWe feel that we are Pakistanis as we were born here. We want to think for and work for Pakistan but sometimes this positivity is hurt by a negative attitude or person,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen my daughter was in class one, a classmate told her friends not to talk to her because she was not Muslim,\u201d she shared.\nWriter and content creator Shehzad Ghias Shaikh said that exclusion was built in Pakistani society. \u201cWe tell our children that this country was created because of the two-nation theory, because we could not live with Hindus, who looked down on us and treated us like untouchables. Then we tell our children to make friends with their Hindu class fellows,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ideas that most people have been raised on need to be challenged,\u201d he concluded.\n"

            "Text": "HYDERABAD: Activists of many nationalist and progressive parties on Saturday brought out a \u2018peace rally\u2019 over deteriorating law and order situation and increasing incidents of kidnapping for ransom in Sindh, as well as failure of security agencies in tracing out Priya Kumari and taking to task killers of journalist Jan Mohammad Mahar and other respectable citizens.\nThe rally started from the Old Campus locality and culminated outside the local press club.\nThe participating parties included Awami Tehreek (AT), Awami Workers Party (AWP), Sindh United Party (SUP), Awami Jamhoori Party (AJP), National Party (NP), Watan Dost Jamhoori Party (WDJP) and Communist Party of Pakistan (CPP).\nThe rally passed through Risala Road and Hyder Chowk before reaching its culminating point.\nThe participants were carrying flags of their respective parties and placards and banners inscribed with slogans against lawlessness. They raised slogans against \u2018dacoit Raj\u2019 on Sindh and kidnapping for ransom, which they lamented, had become order of the day in upper Sindh districts.\n\nBilawal urged to answer his own question about source of such supplies; feudal lords associated with PPP accused of patronising gangs\n\nAT president Lal Jarwar condemned Sindh government for \u201chanding over Sindh to dacoits\u201d. He claimed that influential feudal lords and tribal heads associated with the PPP were patronising dacoit gangs, which were kidnapping people and collecting ransom money to the tune of millions of rupees.\nAJP leader Syed Lal Shah alleged that after handing over Sindh to dacoits, Sindh\u2019s resources, including its lands, were being usurped. He recalled that PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had recently raised the question that \u201cwho is providing Nato\u2019s sophisticated weapons to dacoits?\u201d Mr Shah said people wanted answer to this question from Bilawal himself. He noted that this type of lawlessness had poisoned life of people in Sindh.\nNP\u2019s Sindh President Taj Marri said that dacoits had created \u2018a state within a state\u2019 and were challenging writ of the state. Despite this lawlessness, no effective operation was being launched against outlaws, he wondered, and claimed that waderas, jagirdars and administration were colluding with each other to let dacoits establish and perpetuate their rule.\nAWP leader Latif Leghari told the protesters that the situation where outlaws were using Nato weapons warranted a forceful operation against them. Besides, he added, an investigation should be conducted to ascertain source of such weapon supplies to outlaws and the culprits must be brought to justice.\n \n \n\nCPP Sindh General Secretary Comrade Iqbal demanded that Priya Kumari (who had gone missing in Aug 2021 while she was about seven-year-old and believed to have been kidnapped) should be traced out without further delay and reunited with her family. He stressed that all other men, women and children held hostage by dacoit gangs in Sindh must be recovered immediately.\nWDJP leader Arz Mohammad deplored that people like Prof Ajmal Sawand, journalist Jan Mohammad Mahar, schoolteacher Allah Rakhio Nandwani and activist Hidayat Lohar were murdered but none of their killers could be arrested.\nWriter and analyst Jami Chandio said that Sindh had once been regarded as \u2018the land of peace\u2019 but under a planned conspiracy its peace was destroyed. Sindhiani Tehreek President Umra Samoo, AT Secretary General Noor Katiar, Dr Badar Channa, Naimat Khuhro and Fahim Noonari also spoke at the rally.\nThey were of concerted view that PPP was ruling over Sindh for the last 16 years and pushed the province into primitive era. They added that the Irsa Act was amended \u201cto commit robbery on Sindh\u2019s water share\u201d.\nThe speakers demanded formation of a judicial commission headed by serving Supreme Court judge to expose facilitators of dacoits and identify those supplying Nato weapons to them.\n"

Hands off Rafah!\u201d said a sign at a pro-Palestinian encampment at George Washington University in the US capital.\nIsrael minister in crash\nThe Israeli army said Friday that a civilian was killed by anti-tank missiles fired towards \u201cthe area of Har Dov\u201d, which refers to the disputed Shebaa Farms border district.\nAlso on Friday, the Lebanese Islamist group Jamaa Islamiya said an Israeli strike in eastern Lebanon had killed two of its senior commanders.\nIn response to what it called a \u201ccowardly assassination\u201d, Hezbollah said it launched dozens of rockets at two military posts in northern Israel.\nIn the Red Sea, a tanker was damaged when it was targeted with multiple missiles off Yemen\u2019s coast on Friday.\nNear Tel Aviv, an 18-year-old woman was seriously wounded in a stabbing attack and the assailant was killed at the scene, according to paramedics and police.\nAfter addressing journalists at the scene, Israel\u2019s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir was involved in a car crash in which three people were lightly injured, police said.\n"

These victims were en route to European countries via Iran and Iraq.\nIn response, the government decided to reassess its security plan to ensure safe travel on national highways.\nAs part of the revised security plan, the provincial government decided to reinstate security checkpoints on the Quetta-Taftan, Quetta-Karachi, coastal highway, and other routes.\n\nDemand cancellation of new SOPs, removal of checkpoints\n\nAdditionally, SOPs were developed for bus owners operating coaches and buses to ensure passenger safety.\nThess SOPs included arranging at least two security guards in every coach and bus and maintaining a record of passengers with their national identity cards.\nAccording to the SOPs issued to the transporters running coaches and buses on the Quetta-Taftan section and coastal highway, they were instructed not to allow passengers who travel with passports and visas.\nThe checkpoints reinstated at various routes had been removed by previous governments following demands from coalition partners, political parties, and human rights organisations.\nThese groups argued that security forces, including Customs, Fro\u00adntier Corps, Levies, and Coast Guards humiliated passengers und\u00ader the pretext of security checks.\nRepresentatives of the All Quetta-Taftan, Dalbandin, Chagai, Mashkel, Saindak and Rakhsan Bus Transport Union Alliance termed the new SOPs one-sided. They stated that the authorities concerned did not consult with the transporters\u2019 union alliance, which they find unacceptable.\n\u201cThe SOPs imposed by the government for transporters are very strict and not feasible for the bus owners,\u201d said Lala Saeed Jan Lehri, a representative of the transporters\u2019 union alliance, spe\u00adaking at a press conference last week along with other transporters.\nHe emphasised that transporters had been operating buses and coaches on these routes for the last 40 years, with passengers travelling with passports and visas for various countries via Iran, Iraq, and Turkiye being their main source of income.\nHe also pointed out that buses were being checked at all checkpoints despite initial checks at the entry point in Taftan, causing difficulties for passenger transporters.\n\u201cChecks should be conducted at a checkpoint at the first entry point,\u201d Mr Lehri added.\nThe striking transporters\u2019 spokesman said that security on highways was the responsibility of the state and the government.\nHe warned that if the transporters\u2019 demands were not met within the next 48 hours, they would block all national highways, suspending all traffic until their demands are accepted.\nA spokesman for the Balochistan government said that steps had been taken by the authorities concerned to ensure the safety of passengers travelling on these routes in coaches and buses.\n\u201cWe already provide security to pilgrims travelling for ziarats to Iran and Iraq. They travel in a security convoy,\u201d he said.\n"

It\u2019s a specialised research network focused on conflict and human rights.\n\u201cEfforts were made to isolate us diplomatically by instructing other embassies not to engage with us, falsely portraying us as members of an exclusive elite group that doesn\u2019t represent Afghan women,\u201d she added.\n\nSharp Edge of Peace premiers at Canadian documentary festival\n\nMs Mosadiq believes \u201cignoring women always leads to disastrous consequences\u201d like the \u201crise of a gender-apartheid Taliban regime\u201d.\nLike her, the majority of educated Afghans believe that the agreement reached between the Americans and the Afghan Taliban led to a sharp-edged peace that harmed all, as depicted in the film. Afghan women were left in the clutches of a gender apartheid regime, and the nation was once again pushed into darkness.\n\u201cSharp Edge of Peace,\u201d produced and directed by Roya Sadat and her team, portrays the endeavours of four remarkable women leaders \u2014 Fatima Gailani, Fawzia Koofi, Habiba Sarabi, and Sharifa Zurmati.\nTogether, they courageously engage with the Afghan Taliban in Doha, advocating for the recognition of women\u2019s humanity.\n\u201cThe Taliban displayed minimal interest in women\u2019s arguments, largely due to their awareness of the imminent American withdrawal,\u201d explained Ms Mosadiq. \u201cAs anticipated by the Taliban, the Americans indeed packed up and departed.\u201d\nShe contends that the Americans mistakenly believed they had bestowed upon Afghan women the rights they deserved, and in their rush to withdraw, inflicted \u201cirreparable damage on Afghan women, their rights, and their ongoing struggles\u201d.\nThe documentary illustrates how Afghan women steadfastly refused to compromise their hard-fought gains for equality in exchange for a hastily brokered peace agreement. It contends that Afghan wars have transcended national boundaries for generations, and the Doha negotiations were no exception, with numerous stakeholders each pursuing their own agendas.\nIn this complex tapestry of interests, attaining peace necessitates the involvement of all parties at the negotiation table.\nThe film commences with a powerful scene portraying Ms Koofi, a former parliamentarian and advocate for women\u2019s rights, courageously recovering in a hospital bed following an assassination attempt in August 2020. She remains committed to advocating for Afghan women\u2019s rights and has established the Afghan Women Coalition for Change with the aim of making gender apartheid an internationally recognized crime against humanity.\nMs Gailani, now chair of Afgha\u00adnistan Future Thought Forum, said the Afghan negotiating team never expected US soldiers or Nato to stay forever and hoped for a smoother transition and political settlement.\nMs Sarabi, another negotiator, highlighted the resilience of Afghan women.\nThe 95-minute film had its premier at the Canadian film festival on April 27.\n"

The fact that news outfits close to the Indian government have this week highlighted the heart transplant a 19-year-old girl from Karachi underwent in a Chennai hospital could be signalling more than meets the eye.\nAccording to local reports, Ayesha Rashan underwent a full heart transplant after her heart pump developed a leak in a valve. The reports said that the procedure \u2014 over Rs3.5 million \u2014 was borne by the hospital and Chennai-based Aishwaryam Trust. \n\u201cShe (Rashan) is like (our) daughter. Every life matters,\u201d the doctors were quoted as saying. \nIn the middle of a divisive electoral campaign intensified by Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s targeting of Muslims, this apparent sign of bonhomie between the people of the two countries becomes that much more notable.\n\nKarachi girl undergoes procedure in Chennai\n\nAdd to this the comment by Defence Minister Khawaja Asif the other day that he hoped for betterment in bilateral ties with India after the neighbour comes out of its election phase commencing. \nIndian analysts believe that if Mr Modi returns to power he could go soft on divisive issues, and possibly pick up the threads connected with his close proximity to the Sharif family.\n\u201cOur relations with India could be improved after elections there,\u201d the defence minister said while speaking to reporters outside the Parliament House in Islamabad. He added that Pakistan and India ties had its \u201cown background\u201d.\nMeanwhile, reports spoke of how Dr K.R. Balakrishnan, Director of the Institute of Heart and Lung Transplant and Dr Suresh Rao, Co-Director of the Institute learned about the emergency and the financial assistance Ms Rashan needed.\nThey said the teen received the heart immediately as there were no competing claims. Otherwise, a foreigner can\u2019t get an organ. She received a heart from a 69-year-old, brain-dead patient from Delhi, reports said.\nExpressing her gratitude to the Indian government, Ms Rashan and her mother Sanobar highlighted a lack of required facilities in Pakistan.\n"

The minister was briefed on the wheat procurement process and the measures taken for its safe storage in warehouses.\n \n \n\nHe said the provincial cabinet has decided to purchase wheat from local farmers at the same rate as the Punjab government.\nThe decision will not only result in the procurement of quality wheat but yield significant financial benefits to the province\u2019s growers, he said.\nRegarding the welfare of KP\u2019s farmers, Mr Toru assured that their interests would be \u201csafeguarded at all costs\u201d.\nThe minister emphasised his government\u2019s commitment toward transparency, highlighting ongoing efforts to digitise the food department\u2019s administrative affairs to ensure accountability.\nHe said a five-member committee, comprising officials from the agriculture department, administration and NAB, has been constituted to oversee procurement, transportation and quality control process and prevent malpractice.\nManzoor Ali in Peshawar also contributed to this report\n"

            "Text": "\n\nTHE students who raised pro-Palestine slogans during the German ambassador\u2019s speech are being pushed out of the Asma Jahangir Conference.\u2014Murtaza Ali / White Star\n\n \n\u2022 Justice Mansoor asserts courts \u2018united\u2019 against interference\n\u2022 Pro-Palestine protesters disrupt German envoy\u2019s speech over Gaza policy\nLAHORE: Senior puisne judge Syed Mansoor Ali Shah on Satur\u00adday maintained that judiciary will stand united against any interference in its system as he called for a \u2018firewall\u2019 to protect the institution from undue interference.\nSpeaking as chief guest at the inaugural session of the 5th Asma Jahangir Conference, Justice Shah said there was a need to develop a \u2018firewall\u2019 around the judiciary to protect it from interference.\n\u201cThe judiciary will stand united against any interference that comes to our system and we take it seriously,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAll institutions in the country must realise that if there is no justice, they cannot survive,\u201d he said and added that an independent justice system was critical for all.\n\u201c\u2026there is no rocket science about it. Please, the justice system has to be strong, robust and independent for all institutions to develop, grow, and prosper. This is a simple message\u2026\u201d he said, without naming anyone.\nAt the outset, he paid tribute to Asma Jahangir, saying she was a formidable lawyer of Pakistan and an activist renowned for her unwavering commitment to human rights and courage in the face of opposition.\n\u2018Dark patches of history\u2019\nJustice Shah, who will be the next chief justice, said he did not come to the conference to defend the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court or take pride in some of the good things that had been done. \u201cI think there have been dark patches in the history of the judiciary and I am not proud of that.\u201d\nSharing his ideas to make the judiciary as imagined by the Constitution, he said the individualistic thoughts to run the institution needed to be forgotten. He said every institution needed to be run through a system not by individuals.\nJustice Shah stated that until \u201cwe transition from reliance on individuals to the system itself, this system would always be subject to the whims of individuals\u201d.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why there\u2019s no continuity in judicial institutions,\u201d he said and regretted that every chief justice \u201ctakes the institution the way he likes\u201d.\nHe said it was the first time when Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa surrendered his powers and implemented the practice and procedure law in the Supreme Court to establish a system. He said it was a misconception that judicial system was completely stagnant.\nHe pointed out that 4,000 judges worked daily and courts decided nearly 1.6 million cases in 2023. However, he said it was true that the judicial system was slow. Currently, 2.4m cases are pending in courts, he said, adding that 80 to 90 per cent of these cases were pending in the district judiciary.\nHe mentioned that Pakis\u00adtan, a country of 231 million people, had the lowest number of lawyers per capita in the world. He said there was one lawyer for 1,000 citizens in Pakistan; whereas, in the United Kingdom and Austra\u00adlia, there was one lawyer for 203 and 300 citizens, respectively.\nThe judge said he accepted the critique that according to a World Bank justice project, the judiciary ranked very low. \u201cBut we need to identify the steps we can take to improve our judiciary,\u201d he added.\nJudges\u2019 appointment\nHe said the judiciary\u2019s impo\u00adr\u00adtant aspect was the method and criteria for the appointments of judges. \u201cThe appointments of judges in district courts and high courts are a challenge for us,\u201d he admitted.\nHe said the present leadership of the Supreme Court was reviewing the entire process of judges\u2019 appointments, as it was needed to consider \u201cnot only a judge\u2019s work and character but also end nepotism\u201d.\nHe said accountability of district judges was essential, just like the Supreme Judicial Council, which hears complaints against the judges of superior courts. The SC judge said an incompetent judicial officer could not be allowed to stay in the institution till their retirement.\nJustice Shah said there was a need to move with the world which \u201chas adopted multiple alternative methods to provide justice\u201d.\n\u201cThere are other options available to resolve matters before resorting to traditional judicial proceedings,\u201d he said. In Pakistan, he said, alternate methods of justice, particularly Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR), were being worked on.\nJustice Shah said Pakistan also failed to establish designated \u201ccommercial courts\u201d, which were given preference in the world over any other co\u00ad\u00adu\u00ad\u00adrt. A commercial court \u201cboo\u00adsts the economy and looks after the business\u201d in a country, he said, adding that it was more important than a criminal court.\nGender representation\nThe senior judge also stressed the representation of women in the justice system, saying, \u201cOur gender representation is very poor.\u201d He said women were 50 per cent of the country\u2019s population but this proportion did not reflect in the justice system. He pointed out that there were 562 women judges in the country, including two in the Supreme Court. \u201cWe have to take a special step to bring women judges at district, the high court and Supreme Court level,\u201d he emphasised.\nPro-Palestine protest\nDuring the conference, some pro-Palestine protesters interrupted the German ambassador\u2019s speech. Moments after the envoy began his spee\u00ad\u00adch, a young protester shouted: \u201cExcuse me, Mr ambassador. I am shocked by the audacity that you are here to talk about civil rights while your country is brutally abusing the people speaking for the rights of the Palestinians.\u201d\nHis comments drew applause and cheer among the participants while chants of \u201cFree, Free Palestine\u201d and \u201cFrom the River to the Sea\u201d could also be heard.\nThe protest was also joined by some other students (the Progressive Students\u2019 Collective), chanting slogans in favour of Palestinian people. Responding to protesters, Alfred Grannas said: \u201cIf you want to shout, go out, there you can shout. Because shouting is not a discussion.\u201d\nA live stream of the event muted Amb Grannas\u2019 comments after that and then disabled the live stream for a few minutes. The PSC said the protesters were manhandled, a claim dismissed by the organisers.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD / LAHORE: The PTI on Saturday reiterated its readiness to hold talks with the \u201creal\u201d stakeholders, provided a \u201csuitable atmosphere\u201d is ensured where the party\u2019s public mandate is respected and cases against its workers and leaders are withdrawn.\nThe statement was made during an informal meeting atte\u00adnded by Leader of the Oppo\u00adsition in the Senate Shibli Faraz and reporters of electronic media at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House, Islamabad.\nWhen asked if the PTI was willing to hold negotiations with political parties, Mr Faraz said as a political party, PTI is always ready to hold talks. \u201cHowever, there should be an atmosphere conducive to negotiations, which must be conducted within the parameters of the Constitution. The current atmosphere is not suitable for negotiations,\u201d an insider quoted the PTI leader as saying.\nHe also said that negotiations will be held with those who have the real power. However, he did not mention whether the talks will be held with the establishment or political parties.\n\nPTI\u2019s \u2018real intentions\u2019 exposed: PML-N\n\nSimilar statements have been issued by PTI founding chairman Imran Khan and information secretary Raoof Hasan.\n \n \n\n\u201cIt is the stance of the PTI that it is ready for the negotiations if its mandate, as the largest political party, is accepted and illegal cases are withdrawn,\u201d said a PTI office-bearer.\nWhen asked if the PTI was willing to speak to political parties, he said the PTI had in the past held negotiations with political parties for the date of elections, but nothing was decided. \u201cSo negotiations can be held with political parties again, but they might not reach any conclusion as political parties don\u2019t have any status in the current situation,\u201d he said.\nHowever, a few days back, PTI leader Shehryar Afridi had said that negotiations can only be held with the establishment.\nPML-N response\nThe PTI statement drew criticism from the PML-N on Saturday, with its leader Khawaja Saad Rafique stating that the \u201ccat has come out of the bag\u201d.\nHe criticised the PTI\u2019s dual stance of wanting to engage in dialogue with the military while also confronting it.\nMr Rafique emphasised that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa should cooperate with the Centre by remaining within constitutional limits. He warned that if PTI leader and KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur continued his aggressive stance, it would be challenging to maintain governance and engage in conflict simultaneously.\nThe PML-N leader also stressed the importance of dialogue between political parties, stating, \u201cThere is no concept of vandalism in democratic politics.\u201d He linked the lack of communication with politicians to the vandalism events that occurred on May 9 last year.\nPML-N\u2019s senior leader Khurrum Dastgir said that as long as PTI continues to believe that only its votes are legitimate and others are not, it cannot sit with other political forces. \u201cPTI needs to engage in dialogue with politicians to strengthen democracy,\u201d he added.\n \n \n\nThe other day, PML-N parliamentary leader Senator Irfan Siddiqui, speaking in the upper house, had urged the PTI to hold talks to solve the crises facing the country. He noted that politicians faced ups and downs and governments came and went but they have to leave some traditions and legacy for future generations.\nTalking about reconciliation, he had said it was a two-way process. \u201cWe are ready to extend an olive branch to PTI and let us shake hands,\u201d he said and urged the party of ex-prime minister Imran Khan to \u201ccome forward for Pakistan and let us sit together\u201d.\nReferring to KP Chief Minister Gandapur\u2019s reported warning that he would \u201cattack\u201d Islamabad in protest, Mr Siddiqui had urged PTI to do away with such tone. If PTI can shake hands with its worst political enemies such as Mehmood Khan Achakzai and Maulana Fazlur Rehman, then why it cannot sit with the incumbent government in the interest of the country, he had asked.\nHowever, PTI\u2019s parliamentary leader Senator Ali Zafar had stressed that there was dire need of working together while keeping aside political differences or else matters of grave concern would be forgotten and ignored. He said parliament had lost its integrity and become a laughing stock for foreign countries because it was discharging its functions in total negation of the rules of business.\n"

Khan-Tank Road towards Dera Ismail Khan. While the gunmen left the judge\u2019s driver un\u00adharmed, they set fire to the judge\u2019s official vehicle before fleeing with Mr Marwat.\nGarah Mohabaat, loca\u00adt\u00aded at the border of Tank and Dera Ismail Khan districts, falls in the jurisdiction of the Hathla police station of the restive Kula\u00adchi tehsil of Dera Ismail Khan.\nWhile Mr Marwat is posted to the South Waziristan district, the sessions court functions from Tank due to security concerns.\nThe police reached the spot after the incident and launched a search for the kidnappers.\nAsmat Ullah Gandapur, SHO of the Manji Khel police station, told Dawn that Tank and Dera police reached the scene and cordoned off the area to ensure the safe recovery of the judge.\nMr Gandapur said the road where the abduction occurred passes from Bhagwal Adda to Loni, a dangerous area through Graha Mohabbat.\nResidents told Dawn that officers\u2019 movements on the Tank-Dera Road continue constantly because the officers posted in Tank and South Waziristan spend the night in Dera instead of Tank.\nPolice officials said Dera Ismail Khan police officials previously manned the spot, but they left after an attack.\nAfter the judge\u2019s kidnapping, Chief Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim convened an emergency meeting at the Peshawar High Court.\nOfficial sources said the meeting was attended by the two most senior judges of the PHC, Justices Ijaz Anwar and Syed Mohammad Attique Shah, Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Mohammad Abid Majeed, Additional Chief Secretary (P&D) Imtiaz Shah, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa IGP Akhter Hayat Khan.\nThe chief justice and other judges directed the IGP and other officers to take steps to ensure Mr Marwat\u2019s immediate recovery.\nThey said the provincial government was responsible for providing security to the judges. The officers were asked to share any developments with the PHC\u2019s registrar.\nMr Majeed and IGP Khan informed the meeting about the steps they had taken so far. They said they were in contact with the regional police officer of Dera Ismail Khan, commissioner D.I. Khan, district police officers in the region, and other security agencies.\nAccording to officials, Mr Majeed told the meeting that he had been monitoring the entire situation and would share any development with the court as soon as he received further information.\nThe Dera Ismail Khan district, the hometown of KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur, has witnessed an uptick in attacks on police and other law enforcement agencies over the past few months.\n \n \n\nLast week, 12 law enforcement personnel, including eight Pakistan Customs officials, were slain in two separate attacks in the district, while two members each of police and FC also lost their lives to the militant attacks.\nSimilarly, in February, a militant attack on the Daraban police station resulted in the death of more than 10 police officials and injuries to several others.\nIn December, 23 army personnel lost their lives and 30 others were injured in a suicide attack on a compound located next to the Daraban police station.\nAdam Khan Wazir in South Waziristan also contributed to this report\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: As Punjab keeps on delaying the local government (LG) elections, an apparently helpless Elec\u00adtion Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has once again taken up the matter with the provincial government.\nUnder Article 140-A of the Constitution and Section 219(4) of the Elections Act, the ECP is bound to hold elections within 120 days of the expiry of the term of the local government institutions.\nIn April 2019, the then PTI-led Punjab government dissolved the local government institutions, which were later restored by the Supreme Court and subsequently completed their term on Dec 31, 2021.\nThat means elections were supposed to take place some two years ago, but it could not be made possible as the provincial government kept on amending the LG law from time to time. The change of governments in the province made no difference and it is still unclear if the holding of local bodies elections would become a reality in near future.\n\nECP urges govt to remove EVM requirement\n\nA major obstacle in the way was an amendment made to the law back in 2022. Under Section 47(1) of the Punjab Local Government Act 2022, which remains intact to date, local government elections are to be held on electronic voting machines (EVMs), and voters will also have the facility of i-voting. However, Rule 35(4) of Local Government Election Rules has already been amended to allow voting as per the Elections Act 2017.\n \n \n\nIn July 2023, while refusing to use EVMs in the local government elections in Punjab, the ECP had asked the province to amend its laws and do away with provisions related to EVMs and i-voting.\nThe ECP in its latest communication has reminded the Punjab government of its commitment for making suitable amendment after the Feb 8 general elections.\n\u201cI am directed to refer to your letter No.PS/CS/26/2023 dated 05.10.2023 intimating therein that suitable amendment in Section-47(1) of the Punjab Local Government Act, 2022 regarding usage of EVM and i-voting and other amendments required in the Local Government Act will be placed before the elected government after general elections and till then, matter may be kept pending.\n\u201cThe matter was kept pending in the light of letter referred above. Since the general elections across the country have been concluded and the assembly and elected representatives are in place, therefore, suitable amend\u00adment(s) in the relevant provisions of law in the Punjab Local Government Act, 2022 and Rules framed thereunder may be made at the earliest to proceed further in the matter.\n\u201cIn this regard, it is to inform that Election Commission will convene a meeting with regard to the conduct of local government elections in the Punjab within a month to discuss and finalise the arrangements for the said elections,\u201d read the letter sent by the ECP to the chief secretary and secretary, Local Government Punjab, a copy of which is available with Dawn.\n"

She remained on TV screen till 2009 but quit showbiz due to marriage and tight job schedule.\nThe artist performed in about 100 Pashto and Urdu plays and played out lead characters mostly tragedy dramas, earning a widespread fame owing to her delivery of dialogues and serious facial expressions. She grabbed several awards for her quality performances on PTV.\n\u201cI want to do projects with PTV despite the changed landscape. I am determined to pursue my career once again provided that I could get projects with stress on quality contents. I don\u2019t want to work for social media,\u201d said Ms Alithe actress stated.\n\nNazia Ali optimistic to get attention of her fans\n\nActing was like oxygen for me and after quitting showbiz, I felt being caged as the actress within me wanted to break the shackles and rejoined my acting career after 15 years long break, the artist recalled. The decision to quit my acting career was tough but my family responsibilities and office work forced me to call it a day, years ago, she added.\nMs Nazia told this scribe that she even changed her contact numbers and glided into a complete hibernation but of late sliced out time for social media to watch clips of her old TV plays and it rekindled a spark in her to revisit her decision and rejoined her once favourite showbiz career.\n\u201cDuring all this time, I felt as if I was imprisoned in a cage and at times even sensed being chocked. Watching my old clips of TV plays on social media once again dragged me into my past and at last the nostalgia sparked a spirit within me to rethink comeback,\u201d she stated.\nThe artist said though much water had gone under the bridge yet she hoped that she would reclaim her fans\u2019 attention through the strength of mature drama role. She said that comedy role was not her forte and seasoned former producers including Masood Ahmad Shah, Ejaz Ahmad Niaz and Jahanzeb Suhail had made her perform well.\n\u201cPlaywrights like late Mohammad Azam and Noorul Bashar Naveed were my favourite writers. Script and storylines written by them were true reflection of our society. I still cherished their vision and mastery over TV play,\u201d the artist recalled.\n"

The participants also urged the young joy-seekers to desist from activities that go against the local culture.\nThey told Dawn that they were not opposed to \u201chealthy\u201d entertainment and would continue to welcome and respect all those from outside the region as guests.\nThe residents of Landi Kotal and adjoining localities complained about scanty rainfall in the last several months and said the region was hit by an acute shortage of drinking water because, firstly, the water table was depleting fast and, secondly, there was no proper strategy to conserve rainwater.\nThey, however, said last week\u2019s heavy rainfall had addressed the longstanding water issue for a good time.\nAzmat Ali, a Khugakhel resident, told Dawn that almost all natural wells, along with dug-up wells, were full to the brim after the recent heavy rains.\n\u201cThough the downpour destroyed many houses and brought misery to many residents, it certainly will help address the shortage of drinking water in the approaching summer season,\u201d he said.\nAnother resident, Sudhir Ahmad Afridi, advocated the construction of barani dams to conserve rainwater and utilise it when the need arises.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: A decision by the Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad (MCI) to set up a cattle market in Sector I-12 \u2013 a residential sector \u2013 has caused a stir among the plot owners, who are apprehensive about this proposal which could throw a spanner in the already-sluggish development work.\nIt is worth mentioning that the Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad announced an open auction for six cattle markets across the city, including the proposed site in Sector I-12. The newspaper advertisement sparked apprehension among the allottees waiting for possession of their plots for a long time. The development work underway for over two years includes the construction of streets and a sewage system.\nPeople who have bought plots in this sector are already frustrated with the CDA, particularly the slow pace of development work in this sector. Tahir Mahmood, who purchased a plot in this sector almost a decade ago, is also worried about the \u201charmful impacts\u201d of the proposed market. He said the establishment of a market could cause \u201cinfrastructure damage\u201d which would need \u201cexpensive repairs\u201d afterwards.\n\u201cWith tractors, bulldozers, and other heavy machinery involved in land balancing, roads construction, and installation of sewage system, we worry that the establishment of a cattle market will disrupt these efforts, leading to further delays in possession of our plots,\u201d he said, speaking on the behalf on allottees. \u201cI bought a residential plot in the sector to build a home for my family. However, my dream remains unfulfilled due to the slow-paced development work in this sector,\u201d he added.\n\nPlot owners say market will damage infrastructure, delay possession\n\nFahad Hameed echoed similar concerns. He said there was a \u201ccritical need\u201d for uninterrupted development in this sector to avoid further delays in the possession.\n\u201cWe have already faced significant setbacks due to a protracted development process,\u201d he said, adding that allottees still \u201chold onto the hope that the work will eventually be completed, allowing us to realise our dream of building homes for our families\u201d.\nKhumar Gul also expressed regarding the proposed cattle market. He said the potential damage to the \u201cfinished development work\u201d could compromise the existing infrastructure. He warned if their grievances remained unaddressed they would stage a demonstration to voice their opposition.\nAdditional Commissioner Rana Waqas Anwar, who is also the MCI administrator, claimed that the development work would not be affected because of the proposed market. He said that it would be ensured that the cattle market would be established in open areas, such as grounds. He said the CDA sanitation team would clean the sector after Eid. MCI Administrator Rana Waqas Anwar told Dawn that the proposed cattle market was a move to facilitate the residents ahead of Eid.\n\u201cIn the past, people used to establish small markets in all the sectors so it has been decided to establish six cattle markets and it will be ensured that no animal would be sold out of markets. We have finalised the arrangements for the sanitation team to clean the sector [after Eid],\u201d he said.\nReplying to a question, Rana Waqas said that the cattle market would be established in open places, such as grounds so that there would be no damage to the property or the ongoing development work.\n"

It was a bad day for motorists in the garrison city as they had to steer through puddles on roads and face traffic jams. \nThe Met Office said a strong westerly wave was affecting western and upper parts of the country and likely to persist in upper parts during the next two days. It warned that isolated/moderate to heavy rainfall may generate flash floods in nullahs/streams of Dir, Swat, Chitral, Mansehra, Kohistan and Kashmir from till April 29. \nLandslides in upper Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Murree, Galliyat, Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan may affect vulnerable locations during the period. Windstorm/hailstorm and lightning may affect human lives, standing crops, loose structures like electric poles, vehicles and solar panels, it added. \nIt said rain-windstorm/thunderstorm (with isolated hailstorm) was expected in KP, upper/central Punjab, Islamabad, Gilgit-Baltistan and Kashmir. Heavy falls are also likely at a few places in upper KP and Kashmir.\nOn Saturday, the Met Office recorded 10mm rain in Zero Point and Saidpur, 8mm at Bokra, 7mm at Golra and 3mm at the airport in Islamabad, and 5mm rain at Chaklala and Shamsabad and 4mm at Kutchery in Rawalpindi. The rain and wind brought down temperatures from 26 to 23 degrees Celsius.\nThe rain also worried farmers in the outskirts of the capital city and garrison city as hailstorm damaged the wheat crop. \nThe Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) has already imposed a rain emergency in the garrison city and deployed its teams in low-lying areas.\nWater accumulated in low-lying areas of the garrison city, however, the water level in Leh Nullah remained at 5 feet at Gawalmandi and 4.5 feet at Katarian Bridge. According to Wasa Managing Director Saleem Ashraf, teams had been deployed with water-sucking machines in low-lying areas. He said the teams cleared the roads and low-lying areas within a few hours after the rain, adding the water flow in Leh Nullah remained normal.\n"

Irfan Abbas has been arrested while his brother Imran managed his escape from the spot.  \nLocals, including the owner of a nearby medical store adjacent to DHQ hospital, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it seemed quite impossible for a storekeeper to embezzle huge quantities of medicines without the blessings of the hospital superintendent and other high-ups of the health department.\nREMOVED: The commissioner has removed a price control magistrate over poor performance and instructed nine other magistrates, including four assistant commissioners, to improve their work. \nHe was addressing a review meeting of price control magistrates in his conference room on Saturday.  \nIn addition to acting DC Mohsin Salahuddin, ADCG, deputy director food, officials of the market committee and other relevant officers, including deputy commissioners and assistant commissioners of Khushab, Mianwali, and Bhakkar, participated via video link.  \nThe commissioner directed to fill vacant positions of price magistrates. He also directed DCs to lower prices of ghee in collaboration with relevant officers and dealers.  \nHe issued instructions to monitor demand and prices of lentils across the division.  \nHe emphasised the need to further reduce the price of bread after consulting stakeholders to provide relief to the public.  \nHe said it was commendable that under the vision of Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, the prescribed price for roti and naan was being implemented across the division, but strict action should also be taken against those selling underweight bread.  \n"

The report laid out a clear roadmap for Pakistan to become a high middle-income country by 2047.\nThe minister emphasised the World Bank\u2019s focus on climate change, digitalisation, and human development aligned with government priorities. He also appreciated the launching of a single platform to enhance the operational effectiveness of the bank.\nMr Aurangzeb, who represented Pakistan at the spring meetings of the World Bank group in Washington this week, has also urged Moody\u2019s Investor Service to upgrade the country\u2019s credit rating soon.\n\nUrges Moody\u2019s to upgrade the country\u2019s credit rating soon\n\nThe government hopes that financial institutions will also take note of Pakistan\u2019s reinforced economic fundamentals and commitment to reforms and will do a favourable reassessment of the Pakistani economy.\nThe minister expressed his optimism during a meeting with Moody\u2019s representatives in Washington, held on the sidelines of the spring meetings. While the meetings concluded on Friday, the minister remains in Washington for bilateral discussions with US officials and other counterparts.\nIn its last assessment in February, the credit rating agency defended its decision to downgrade the ratings, citing concerns about Pakistan\u2019s liquidity and external position. Characterising Pakistan\u2019s situation as \u201cincreasingly fragile\u201d, with heightened default risks, Moody\u2019s assigned the country a Caa3 rating.\nDuring his meetings with Moody\u2019s representatives, the finance minister shared insights on economic indicators, telling them that recent reforms have had a stabilising impact on the national economy.\nHe also highlighted the government\u2019s priorities, which include tax reforms, energy sector overhaul, and privatisation agenda, said a statement issued by his office.\nThe minister \u201cexpressed intent to access international capital markets, focusing on the Middle East and China\u201d and addressed concerns on inflation, foreign exchange reserves, debt repayments, external account vulnerability, and domestic liquidity\u201c, the statement added.\nHe told Moody\u2019s that \u201che expects a credit rating upgrade soon, fostering confidence in Pakistan\u2019s economic trajectory\u201d.\nPakistan\u2019s current $3 billion IMF arrangement concludes this month, and Islamabad is working to secure a new deal by May. It is seeking a longer and larger package, aiming for $6 billion to $8 billion over three years.\nWhile specifics on loan size remain undisclosed, Pakistan plans to request additional financing under the Resilience and Sustainability Trust.\n\u201cWe expect the IMF mission to be in Islamabad around the middle of May \u2014 and that is when some of these contours will start developing,\u201d the minister told Reuters after meetings with senior IMF and US officials.\nIn his interview with Reuters, Mr Aurangzeb underlined positive trends in foreign exchange reserves and debt rollovers, projecting a robust fiscal outlook.\n\u201cThe bulk of our bilateral debt \u2014 including our China debt \u2014 is being rolled over, so in that sense, I think we are in good shape and I don\u2019t see a big issue during this fiscal year nor the next fiscal year,\u201d he said.

            "Text": "KARACHI: Snapping the three-day bearish spell on Friday despite mounting geopolitical tensions, the Pakistani stocks staged a surprise robust rally, tossing the benchmark KSE 100 index near 71,000.\nSpeaking to Dawn, Arif Habib Ltd Head of Research Tahir Abbas said the ongoing process to secure another bailout package was the key bullish factor as staying in the IMF programme would ensure the sustainability of meeting the country\u2019s external debt repayment obligations and keeping the current account in better shape.\n\u201cPakistan should stay in the IMF programme as it boosts investor confidence in the economic direction and places the country in a better position to deal with current account and debt management issues more conveniently as it would also open up inflows from other multilateral lenders and friendly countries fulfilling crucial financing needs,\u201d Mr Abbas remarked.\nHe added that the government has been making all economic decisions on merit, fuelling bullish sentiments in the stock market.\nMore importantly, Mr Abbas said, the valuations of scrips are still highly attractive even though the benchmark index has crossed an unprecedented level of 70,000 during the current week.\n\u201cHistorically, PSX maintains a price-to-earning (P/E) ratio of 6 against the current 4.2,\u201d he said, explaining the P/E ratio is a benchmark that measures a firm\u2019s current share price relative to its income per share.\nThe market has performed robustly in the last six months, surging almost 60pc. However, its P/E ratio is still attractive, so investors, especially foreign ones, continued across-the-board value-hunting.\nTopline Securities Ltd Chief Executive Muhammad Suhail told Dawn that the news that Saudi Arabia moved closer to buying a $1 bn stake in Reko Diq triggered aggressive buying, taking the PSX to another record closing. Moreover, steady SBP forex reserves despite the $1bn Eurobond payment signalled that the external account is relatively better.\n\u201cLocals got huge cash liquidity after Rs6bn buying of Pak Suzuki shares by their sponsors and now it seems they are re-investing in other stocks,\u201d he added.\nHub Power, Engro Fertilisers, Meezan Bank, Bank Al-Habib, and Oil and Gas Development Company made a major positive contribution to the index, cumulatively contributing 329 points.\nAhsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said the bullish trend is based on a strong earnings outlook and deliberation over privatising state-owned enterprises.\n\u201cThe bullish trend is realistic owing to external account stability after reduction in current account deficit to $1bn for July-February FY24, falling CPI inflation to 20.7pc for March hinting SBP key policy rate cut in coming months,\u201d he observed. He added that the surge in global crude oil prices amid geopolitical tensions and the finance minister\u2019s ruling out significant devaluation with the IMF deal played a catalyst role in the record close.\nSpeaking to Dawn, Pak-Kuwait Investment Company Head of Research Samiullah Tariq remarked that the market rallies as economic conditions remain stable, the successful Eurobond payment and steady forex reserves, good financial results, and optimism regarding the new IMF agreement.\nAs a result, the benchmark KSE 100 index closed at 70,909.90 points after rallying 619.79 points, or 0.88pc from the preceding session.\nThe overall trading volume inched up 8.06pc to 475.83 million shares. However, the traded value fell 4.68pc to Rs23.22bn on a day-on-day basis.\nStocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included Pak Refinery Ltd (49.66m shares), Cnergyico PK Ltd\t(26.77m shares), Kohinoor Spinning\tMills Ltd (22.83m shares), The Bank of Punjab (21.40m shares) and Air Link Communication (20.68m shares).\nThe companies registering the major increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Unilever Pakistan Foods Ltd (Rs200.00), Hoechst Pak (Rs97.49), Hallmark Company (Rs56.00), Nestle Pakistan Rs52.50) and Philip Morris (Rs45.00).\nThe shares registering the most significant decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Rafhan Maize Products Company Ltd (Rs30.10), Service Industries Ltd (Rs9.50), Archroma Pakistan Ltd (Rs9.45), Sitara Chemical Industries (Rs6.00)and Al-Noor Sugar Mills Ltd (Rs5.48).\nForeign investors continued their buying spree by purchasing shares worth $5.69m.\n"

These PVRs are grounded in international research data, which will also limit the discretionary power of customs officials.\nDirector, Directorate General of Customs Valuation, Karachi Fayaz Rasool Maken told Dawn that the import values of PVRs are projected to increase from Rs2.357tr in 2022-23 to Rs3.030tr by the end of 2023-24. He emphasised that this trend underscores the customs department\u2019s intention to transition from VRs to PVRs, which he described as a more reliable and transparent system.\nMr Maken stated that implementing PVRs has significantly reduced the likelihood of mis-invoicing and under-invoicing in Pakistan\u2019s imports, valued at Rs5.5tr. He considers this a substantial accomplishment, particularly because other imports, such as duty-free items and petroleum products, typically present a lower risk of mis-invoicing and under-invoicing.\nEarlier in the day, Mr Maken conducted the orientation session on implementation of Linking International Value (LlVE) System under Innovation Framework to control mis-invoicing, which was developed and deployed in December 2022. Federation of Pakistan Chamber of Commerce & Industry (FPCCI) hosted the session.\nMr Maken said that the directorate of valuation has so far linked over 150 commodities involving an import value of Rs2.280tr, which cover products including HRC, CRC, GP, food items, Paper, Yarn, Crude Oil & LPG, Polymers and Chemicals, etc \u2014 with international publications \u2014 LME, Public Ledger, Asian Pulp and paper, Yarn and Fibre database, Platts, ICIS, Argus Media, Reuter and CCFEI etc.\nHe said that in order to fulfil this objective effectively, the customs department is exploring more robust databases, including QY Research, Statista, and Factiva, to arrive at the actual values of goods as envisioned by the WTO Valuation Agreement. QY Research is a leading global market research and consulting company that offers exhaustive information, inter alia, about commodity prices.\nMr Maken said that the transition from VRs to PVRs will not only optimise revenue realisation but also minimise trade/valuation disputes and ensure regulatory benefits through expeditious clearances and trade facilitation.\nFPCCI chief Atif Ikram Sheikh delivered the welcome note and appreciated the efforts of Customs  in creating a conducive environment for trade and industry.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: Amid warnings about supply chain challenges and ret\u00adail prices increasing by up to Rs27 per litre in Gilgit-Baltistan, the major oil sector stakeholders \u2014 the regulator and the industry \u2014 have proposed gradual deregulation of petroleum prices over a period of two years to avoid the political pressure associated with pricing.\nThe government has also been advised to end its engagements with petroleum dealers and cartage contractors over their commissions and leave them to the oil industry to set their margins on a \u201ccompetitive basis\u201d. \nIt should also strengthen the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) to ensure competitive market conditions, check cartelisation and monopolistic behaviour, and guarantee product quality, quantity, and availability to consumers.\nThe government has also been warned that the deregulation of inland freight equalisation margin (IFEM) \u2014 the pooling mechanism for uniform rates throughout the country \u2014 was announced in 2010, which quickly \u201cescalated into a political challenge and the policy was reversed\u201d.\n\nGovt warned of supply chain issues, up to Rs27 per litre price hike in GB\n\nIn what appeared to be making the process even more cumbersome, the regulator has asserted that the pricing deregulation would need a comprehensive government policy covered through a legal framework and amendments to the Petroleum Levy Surcharge Rules 1967 and Oil Rules 2016 covering refineries upliftment, demand-supply, import, export and transportation along with new provisions for checking monopoly and anti-competition practices.\nTo counter the retail product prices going significantly higher in northern parts of the country and other regions away from ports and refineries, Ogra has suggested the expansion of the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) system for subsidising consumers of petrol, diesel and kerosene, particularly in Gilgit-Baltistan and Chitral.\nThe \u201cgovernment may introduce a direct subsidy for the residents of the area through BISP in view of the expected significant variation in retail outlet prices\u201d.\nOgra has indicated that in case the IFEM is \nabolished, the retail prices would vary by Rs6.50 to Rs8 per litre countrywide on average, although prices in Azad Kashmir and areas near ports and refineries would be lower by Rs2 to 5 per litre.\nUnder the main proposal of Ogra, the product prices \u201cwill be set by refineries and oil marketing companies (OMCs) themselves on a self-chosen frequency of daily, weekly, fortnightly or monthly on a competitive basis\u201d.\nIt said the pricing deregulation should be approached in three phases. \nIn the first step, the ex-refinery price and OMC\u2019s margin should be deregulated with oil supply chain management, to be followed by deregulation of dealers\u2019 margin and then IFEM in six months each.\nOgra has also suggested that a careful assessment of the impact of deregulation should be carried out in view of the recently announced brownfield upgrade policy for refineries.\nOgra said the deregulation would mean the \u201cOMCs would be free to import or locally procure as they deem fit\u201d, and the existing arrangement would have to be abandoned, which required first upliftment of the local refinery product.\n\u201cTo provide a level playing field to OMCs for negotiating ex-refinery price, the first upliftment priority principle of local products will have to be disbanded. The OMCs be given the choice to efficiently source their supplies locally or from the international market,\u201d it said.\nBoth refineries and OMCs would follow the existing government policy for storage and \nminimum stock requirements and the oil industry, including refineries, will implement digitisation of the entire supply chain up to the retail outlets for transparency of product availability.\nOgra has also proposed the introduction of independent retail outlets (without OMCs) to foster competition in the retail sector with company-operated outlets. \u201cAlternatively, the OMCs may be allowed to set the margins for their dealers,\u201d it said.\nThe refineries have agreed to follow the existing ex-refinery price principles of import parity price except to keep the 10pc customs duty paid by PSO on petrol and high-speed diesel as part of the import parity price as opposed to 7.5pc currently allowed as deemed duty on high-speed diesel only.\n"

That was the policy of Imran Khan\u2019s government.

            "Text": "LAHORE: The PTI may be planning an aggressive agitation against alleged rigging in the Feb 8 general elections, and has even formed a committee comprising over two dozen members. However, internal disquiet and grumblings of key leaders might put a damper on the campaign.\nWith many key PTI leaders in prison or hiding, the discontent among the party ranks is primarily due to the inability of the existing leadership to draw crowds. They also complain that \u201cloyal leaders\u201d were ignored in the 26-member committee named to plan the protests, while many of those included in the body have been \u2018underground\u2019, so to speak.\nBut PTI Punjab information secretary Shaukat Basra has dispelled the concerns and called all members \u201cassets of the party\u201d.\n\nParty loyalists in Punjab complain of being excluded from body tasked with planning protests; Basra says all members are \u2018assets\u2019\n\nThe PTI has largely been silent in Punjab since the events of May 9, 2023. In the 11 months that followed, the party has tried to hold agitations, but these were swiftly thwarted by police.\nNow, the party plans to create pressure and reclaim, in their words, its stolen mandate of the Feb 8 elections. The 26-member committee is supposed to chalk out a plan to organise public meetings across Punjab.\nThe committee includes Hammad Azhar, Aon Abbas Bappi, Seemabia Tahir, Ejaz Minhas, Kanwal Shozab, Rehana Dar, Mehrbano Qureshi, Zartaj Gul, Hafiz Hamid Raza, Moonis Elahi, retired Maj Tahir Sadiq, Sheikh Waqas Akram, Malik Amer Dogar, Advocate Salman Akram Raja, Zulfi Bukhari, Zain Qureshi, Ahmad Chatha, Malik Ahmad Bachar, Moeen Riaz Qureshi, Mian Aslam Iqbal, Shaukat Basra, Shabbir Qureshi, Rai Hassan Nawaz, Mehr Abdul Sattar, Shadab Jafery and Zubair Niazi.\nAccording to some PTI leaders, many names made part of the committee are the ones who \u201cstayed away from protests\u201d called by the PTI founder Imran Khan during recent months \u2014 especially those held on March 2 and 10 in Punjab.\nDespite the concerns, the committee held its maiden meeting online and agreed to organise a public meeting in Faisalabad from the platform of the six-party opposition alliance. The exact date of the gathering will be decided later by alliance leaders.\n\u2018The missing fervour\u2019\nIn background conversations with Dawn, several party leaders and workers cast dou\u00adbt over the success of the planned protests and public meetings, since there was no leader left with the charisma to pull crowds.\nWhile expressing their discontent with the committee, some leaders claimed that PTI\u2019s central Punjab general secretary Hammad Azhar \u201cignored\u201d supporters and activists who organised protests in the recent past and \u201cstood up to the wrath\u201d of the incumbent Punjab government.\nThey also questioned Mr Azhar\u2019s absence from the public eye, despite getting bail from the Peshawar High Court.\nFollowing criticism from within the party, Mr Azhar even submitted his resignation from the position of central Punjab general secretary, but this was not accepted on the PTI founder\u2019s instructions.\nMany leaders and lawyers who \u201cdared to hold protests on the Mall [Road]\u201d have not been added to the 26-member committee, the PTI leaders said of the demonstration in Lahore last month.\nWith its core leadership incarcerated, the impression among PTI ranks is that the second- and third-tier leadership has been \u201cunable to galvanise the party\u201d despite \u201cmassive public support\u201d demonstrated through voting on Feb 8.\n\u2018Everyone will be accommodated\u2019\nDawn contacted PTI\u2019s central information secretary, Raoof Hassan, but he did not comment, despite committing to give his version \u201cafter getting details\u201d.\nMeanwhile, Mr Basra said almost every member of his party had faced police wrath for coming out to protest,\nCalling the committee members \u201cassets of the party\u201d, Mr Basra said the struggle of one party leader is in no way lesser than another\u2019s. \u201cMaybe some party leaders, including lawyers, had been ignored, but they will make their way in different committees, and we will launch a mass struggle after by-elections.\u201d\n"

Petitioner Mian Dawood says the former chief justice approved illegal increments for hundreds of employees of the LHC in the name of good performance. \nHe said from July 6, 2021, onwards, two illegal advance increments were given to the officials of the LHC. No chief justice has ever given such increments to the staff, including the registrar, for a period of over one year in judicial history, the lawyer claims. He pointed out that the former chief justice granted four-year paid educational leave to the reader (the court associate) of his court. \nHe said the reader\u2019s spouse, who is a senior civil judge, was also extended the same favor without any record of university enrollment or law department requisition. The petitioner alleged that over 50 notifications were issued in a day to end the penalties of as many employees of the LHC. \nHe argued that withdrawing any penalty under the discretionary powers is tantamount to disbanding the service tribunals established under the law. He said that the former chief justice not only withdrew the penalties of two deputy registrars of the LHC but also granted them advance increments and promotions. \nHe said the former chief justice issued most of the notifications a day before his retirement on March 6. He said the discretionary powers should not be exercised by an individual (chief justice) rather administrative committees of the high courts be given the powers. He asked the apex court to regulate the discretionary powers of all high courts\u2019 chief justices and set aside the notifications issued by the former chief justice of the LHC by \u2018misusing\u2019 his discretion.\n"

Khaqan Murtaza, a BS-21 officer of Pakistan Administrative Service, presently posted as Director General of CAA is transferred and posted as Chairman of Employees Old Age Benefits Institution (EOBI) under Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development Division in terms of section 8A(1) of the Employees Old Age Benefits Act 1976 and under section 10 of the Civil Servants Act 1973 with immediate effect and until further orders.\u201d\nMr Murtaza had assumed the DG CAA charge in Nov 2020.\nAccording to source, the government is considering the name of retired Air Vice Marshal Sajid Habib for the slot of the DG CAA.\nThe government has already announced outsourcing airports in Islamabad, Lahore, and Karachi in a bid to attract foreign direct investment and provide \u201cworld-class facilities\u201d to passengers. The government is keen to implement its privatization policy in the CAA and other under-performing government units/departments.\nOn the other hand, the Director General Shoaib Khoso lost his job in a row between his department, Pakistan Sports Board (PSB), with it administrative ministry of Inter-Provincial Coordination (IPC).\nThe IPC ministry terminated the contract of Khoso on Friday and the Establishment Division issued a notification in this regard. The ED also assigned the additional charge of DG PSB to Zahoor Ahmed, a BS-21 officer of Secretariat Group presently working as additional secretary in the IPC ministry for a period of three months. Earlier this week, after the return of Khoso, PSB challenged the authority of secretary IPC and termed the postings, assigning look-after charge in the board by the ministry as contradictory to the Establishment Division\u2019s rules.\nIn the letter sent to the Secretary IPC on April 15, the Deputy Director General (Admin) of PSB Mansoor Ahmed Khan stated that while the DG PSB was on ex-Pakistan leave, the ministry assigned the charge to a junior officer of BS-19.\nThe letter termed this as against the Management Pay Scale Police approved by the Prime Minister that provides that \u201cthe current charge/additional charge of the position of Heads of Autonomous Bodies in MP-Scales only be granted to a civil or government servants of equivalent grade and that too with the approval of appointing authority which is the Prime Minister of Pakistan.\u201d\nIt further said that the officer who had been assigned the look-after charge \u201crequisitioned the services of various officers on deputation basis for PSB which is purely an administrative matter which also involved financial implications. Such decision does not fall in the ambit of look-after charge range, therefore, is violative of clarification of the Establishment Division.\u201d\nSarfraz Rasoo, an Assistant Engineer of the PSB on April 17 challenged the posting transfers made in the Board by the acting DG PSB and the Islamabad High Court (IHC) issued a stay order in this regard. The appointment of DG PSB was also subjudice before the IHC, however, the IPC ministry terminated his service contract \u201cby paying one month\u2019s salary in lieu of one month notice, with immediate effect.\u201d\n"

            "Text": "LAHORE: A play, Lawrence in Lahore: the Lost Years, has taken up the subject of the life of the spy that the British called military strategist Col T.E. Lawrence and his years spent in colonial Lahore. \nWritten by Fawzia Afzal-Khan and Shahid Nadeem, a staged reading-cum-performance of the play was held at the Lawrence Hall of the Quaid-i-Azam Library at the Lawrence Gardens on Wednesday.  \nThe three-act play begins with the Paris Peace Conference attended by the heads of states of England, France, Italy and the US at Versailles, France, in 1919 after the fall of the Ottoman Empire and then moves to the RAF base at Drigh Road, Karachi, where Lawrence was posted as a clerk despite having a higher rank in the army. The subsequent action happens in Lahore with the arrival of Lawrence in the city.  \nDubbed as \u2018the decolonial spy thriller of our times\u2019 by the writers and production, the play portrays Lawrence as a character poles apart from his portrayal in the movie, Lawrence of Arabia, that won seven Academy Awards. While the film presents him as a hero, the play gives another perspective, an attempt of the \u2018empire writing back\u2019. \nWhile the canvas of the story is huge, the writers have done well by squeezing it in three acts while maintaining the unity of the plot that can be divided in two parts \u2013 the conspiracies of a cunning British spy who disguises himself at will to cheat the leaders and people in India and Afghanistan and his love life and marriage with Akbar Jehan, the daughter of the owner of the famous Nedous Hotel in Lahore.  \nLahore of yore \nWhile the conspiracies of Lawrence are presented with skill, the history of Lahore was also shown through audio-visual effects, especially its two famous hotels, the Arab Hotel and Nedous Hotel, where the action happens.  \nAbout the Arab Hotel, KK Aziz in his book, the Coffee House of Lahore, writes, \u201cfor those orientalists of the 1920s the Mall was too westernised, distant and costly. By chance, they started patronsing a small, unclean restaurant on Railway Road, opposite the gate of Islamia College. A clean-shaved but dirty Arab from Kuwait, known as Bhai Aboud, ran the shop and was happy to serve kebabs and tea to his intelligentsia even on doubtful credit\u201d. \nA Hameed in his book, Lahore Ki Yadain, mentions Hasrat, Noon Meem Rashed, Akhtar Shirani, Krishn Chander as regulars of the hotel. \n\u201cIt was Hasrat who was the life of the party. Arab Hotel was the hub of Lahore\u2019s intellectual activity. News reached Arab Hotel before it hit newspaper offices,\u201d he writes. \nAbout the Nedous Hotel, US-based scholar Dr Nyla Ali Khan, writes, \u201cmy grandmother Akbar Jehan\u2019s paternal grandfather, Michael Adam Nedou started out as a photographer and architect, but destiny had willed otherwise. The decisions that he took shaped that destiny as though with the finesse of a calligrapher\u2019s brush. His first venture in hoteliering was the acquisition of the Sind Punjab Hotel in the port city of Karachi. He built the imposing and courtly Nedous Hotel in Lahore, characterized by charm and grace, in the 1870s.\u201d  \nIn an article, she mentioned that her grandmother Akbar Jehan\u2019s father\u2019s family, the \u2018Nedous\u2019, had emigrated from Dubrovnik, Croatian city on the Dalmatian coast of the Adriatic Sea, to Lahore in the 1800s. At the time of his nutralisation, Michael Adam Nedou explained that he was born in Ragusa, Austria (Ragusa is the Italian and Latin name for Dubrovnik on the Dalmatian Coast). \nDuring his time in Lahore and north India, Lawrence has been shown in the play as a cunning man who changes his name to T.E. Shaw and Pir Karam Shah (as he could speak Arabic) at ease, especially when he instigated the Afghan tribes against anti-British King Amanullah of Afghanistan. He gets into a relationship with 17-year-old Akbar Jehan, the daughter of Nedou\u2019s owner. \nTalking about the play, Fawzia says issues of Middle East and Palestine started in the times of Lawrence were open and out now. She said the colonial forces led to the long standing issue of India and Pakistan also, including that of Kashmir. \u201cAll these topics have been touched in the play.\u201d  \nThe play ends with the end of marriage of Lawrence with Jehan with the divorce forcibly taken by her father by involving Gama Pehlwan. Besides the legendary wrester, Bhagat Singh\u2019s character had also been included in the plot, perhaps an attempt to bring in more familiarity for the audiences. \nWriter and actor Navid Shahzad said the play related the contemporary world with the times of Lawrence when the US, Israel, France, Germany and Jordan were on the scene. \u201cDivide and rule has always been a policy of the empires and it\u2019s still in play.\u201d  \nShe also talked about Akbar Jehan and her family and how her father fell for a Kashmiri milkmaid and married her. Jehan was studying at the Convent of Murree and came to Lahore on vacations. It was time when Lawrence, after his conspiracies in Afghanistan, had come to Lahore, and fell in love with Jehan.  \nComparing the character of Lawrence with Ali (played by Omar Sharif) in the movie, Lawrence of Arabia, she said \u201cthat\u2019s how the west always looked at the Arabs, the Semite and us\u2014always a black and white situation. The English had a kind of arrogance towards our culture, our languages and way of life which was called pure savagery and they considered themselves as carrying out a god\u2019s mission to correct and heal us.\u201d  \nShahzad said the play left the audience offended at times but this was accepted as our chequered history.  \nThe issue of language \nProf Shaista Sonnu Sirajjuddin spoke in Punjabi, saying that a lot had been said about what the British did to us and what\u2019s happening in Palestine now but our biggest trouble (maar) was the English language itself. \u201cThe process of the language-induced troubles continues till date. But we are persistent with it very stubbornly and include it in our plays.\u201d Using the Punjabi word dheet for the Pakistani people, she used a pun, translating dheet as \u2018resilience\u2019 and \u2018tenaciousness\u2019. She congratulated the actors and ended her comments, saying she won\u2019t prolong the punishment for the audience by speaking more Punjabi.  \nEarlier, to the question of the language of the play being in English and not in any local language, Shahid Nadeem said \u201cwe always had this idea that it\u2019s the content, story and desired audiences that determine the language and venue of the play\u201d. He said the story was such and it had international interest. He said the Urdu translation of the play would be staged at the end of this year. \nThe actors included Dr Sameer Ahmad, Yusra Irfan, Dara Hashmi, Sameer Afzal, Ehssn Kareem, Sohaib Nasir, Fatima Abbas, Uswa Amjad, Hassan Atif, Jazib, Ahmad Tajy, Hammad, Hassan, and Waqas. The play was a collaboration among GCU, Kinnaird College and Ajoka.\n"

            "Text": "LAHORE: Pakistan needs to change its investment priorities to focus on delivering education, health and jobs to its people beside developing a coherent industrial strategy combined with structural reforms to increase exports.\nThese were concluding remarks made at the second day of the annual conference by the Lahore School of Economics on \u201cManagement of the Pakistan Economy\u201d which focused on issues of innovation, female employment, skills development of workers and Pakistani trade.\nDr Rabia Arif of the LSE looked at how innovation in the textile sector, the light engineering sector and the automotive sector differs. She found that most of the textile manufacturers surveyed were exporters engaged in product innovation to increase revenues and decrease costs.\nIn the light engineering sector, firms engage in process and marketing innovations but this leads to higher costs and lower revenues. In the automotive sector, larger firms engage in product and marketing innovations to increase their revenues.\n\u201cThe results showed that innovation in the textile sector, which is an export-intensive sector, tend to be different from innovations in the light engineering and automotive sectors which mostly cater to the domestic market,\u201d she said.\nDr. Hamna Ahmed and Zunia Tirmazee of the Lahore School of Economics and Rebecca Wu of the University of Chicago discussed the impact of a training initiative by the Punjab Skills Development Fund which focused on providing access to online training courses for workers in rural and urban Punjab. They found that workers who had completed online training courses transitioned into work more than those who did not, and also gained more income after completing the courses.\nDr Zunia Saif Tirmazee of LSE and Sakina Shibuya from the University of Wisconsin discussed the factors that may hinder firms from hiring women. They looked at the impact of social norms as well as economic factors like the cost of transportation for women and the cost of training for women in firms.LSE Rector Dr. Shahid Amjad Chaudhry concluded the moot with a discussion of how the dramatic fall in Pakistan\u2019s growth rate, with almost zero per cent growth last year and an expected growth of only two per cent this year, has led to an increase in poverty and how transfers to low income households through programmes like the Benazir Income Support Program (BISP) must be significantly increased to help lower income households.\nHe also discussed how the provinces must take the lead role in development and economic growth, by investing in health and education and increasing productivity.\n"

            "Text": "TOBA TEK SINGH: In a surprising development, a DNA test report of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA) laboratory in the Maria murder case received by Toba Saddar shows that the girl was neither raped nor was she pregnant as it was alleged earlier.  \nMaria was murdered by her father Abdul Sattar and brother Faisal at Chak 477-JB Allowal on March 17. Her body was exhumed for autopsy on March 28 after a video of the crime went viral on social media and received large-scale outcry. \nThe main accused, Faisal, had admitted in his statement on camera recorded by media persons in police custody on March 31, a day after his arrest, that he had raped and strangled his sister to hide his incest with her.  \nHowever, after this new development and PFSA report, police have now mentioned in the FIR and challan of the case that the girl was murdered by her father and brother in the name of honour and the FIR previously registered under sections 302, 34 and 201 of the PPC had been amended and Section 311 (honour killing) had also been inducted in it.  \nEarlier, the police officials involved in investigation had said that both the suspects had raped the girl and they strangled her to hide their incest as she was four months pregnant. The DNA report denies any pregnancy.  \nA police officer confirmed that the viral video in which Faisal was seen strangling his sister was proven in the forensic analysis. Both the accused were in the district jail on 14 days judicial remand.  \nFaisal\u2019s brother Shahbaz and his wife Sumaira are also in jail in a separate case on the charge of hiding the murder from police. They had told the police that Maria had told them a day before her killing that Faisal and their father, Abdul Sattar, had raped her. Shahbaz had claimed that he had secretly made video of murder by pretending to be talking to his other sister, Kausar, on the phone.  \nDue to Faisal\u2019s on-camera statement recorded in custody, police had booked a senior journalist, Rana Khalid Mahmood, and his cameraman, Ali Ahmad, for unlawfully recording an interview of the suspect and posting it on social media.  \nSenior lawyer and former vice president of Lahore High Court Bar Association Mian Muhammad Aslam told this correspondent that Maria was murdered on March 17 and buried on March 18 but her body was exhumed about two weeks after her murder. He said so many days after the incident, it was impossible to confirm through swabs in the forensic test by the PFSA whether she was raped or not as most parts of dead bodies would decay in so many days. \nGAS THEFT: The Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) got a case registered against three persons for pilfering gas at Gojra.\nThe pilferage was detected by an anti-theft squad of SNGPL on Friday.\nSNGPL Foreman Rafiqur Rehman said in the FIR registered by Gojra Sadar police that the suspects -- Abdul Ghaffar, Yasir and Arshad -- had been pilfering gas through illegal connections from the main line without meters.\nPolice are conducting raids to arrest the suspects who had fled after detection of gas theft.\n"

In dry conditions we\u2019re not quick enough.\u201d\nAlonso was also thankful for the late rain.  \u201cWe were not super competitive on the dry,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIn the wet it was difficult to judge the level of grip and risk we wanted to apply but in the end I am happy.\u201d\nFifth-placed Sainz said the rain and cool conditions made it very difficult to get his intermediate tyres warmed up.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t manage to switch on the tyres so we couldn\u2019t push,\u201d said the Spaniard, the only driver to win a race this season apart from Verstappen.\nFormula One is back in China for the first time since 2019, when Hamilton won.\nA big crowd at the Shanghai International Circuit let out a huge roar when their hometown hero Zhou Guanyu made it into the third qualifying session.\nHe will start Saturday morning\u2019s sprint from 10th for Sauber.\nThe 24-year-old Zhou was elevated to F1 in 2022, but has had to wait till his third season to make his home debut because of the pandemic.\nZhou is yet to score a 2024 championship point but has given himself a great chance with a near-flawless qualifying show.\nEvery lap in his bright green Sauber was greeted by massive cheers from the grandstand opposite the pit lane as his times appeared on the scoreboard.\n\u201cWe will give it everything,\u201d Zhou said.  \u201cI am just happy with the first day and great to have everyone here.\n\u201cThe pressure before the weekend was so extreme, like I felt when I made my debut.\u201d\nVerstappen, who has won three out of four grands prix this season, again looked quickest until the rain came near the end of SQ2.\nIt sets up an intriguing 19-lap sprint battle for Saturday morning as the three-time world champion attempts to find his way past Alonso, Hamilton and Norris.\n\u201cWe have to try and have the best start possible,\u201d said Vers\u00adtappen. \u201cAnd then I think it will be quite a long stint on one set of tyres in the sprint.\u201d Hamilton said his fate lay with the weather gods.\n\u201cIt really depends what the conditions will be like,\u201d said the seven-time world champion, who has won a record six grands prix in Shanghai.\n\u201cIf they are like they were just now we have a chance of being up there.\u201d\n"

However, the revised schedule for the National Women\u2019s Football Championship 2024 will be announced in due course, following further consultation with club representatives and careful consideration of all relevant factors.\u201d\nIn a letter sent to the teams, a copy of which is available with Dawn, the PFF NC noted that it \u201chad received numerous requests from teams regarding clashes between the scheduled dates of the Championship and important O/A Levels examinations among others\u201d.\nIt added it realises the \u201cchallenges they [examinations] pose for participating teams\u201d.\nThe PFF has already stated that only club sides from the country will be allowed to take part in the women\u2019s championship, meaning departmental teams like defending champions Pakistan Army, who won the title when the event was last held in its entirety in 2020, would not be able to take part.\nThe decision to postpone the women\u2019s championship came a day after the PFF NC admitted it was looking for another venue, with Islamabad\u2019s Jinnah Stadium its preferred \nchoice, due to the unavailability of Lahore\u2019s Punjab Stadium for the knockout stages of the Challenge Cup.\nThe group stages of the Challenge Cup, the premier cup tournament for men\u2019s teams, was held last year and the PFF NC had announced that the concluding part of the tournament will take place from May 1 to 12.\n"

            "Text": "KARACHI: A senior police officer claims to have identified a nexus between jihadi and sub-nationalist secular militant groups in the country and said that they are providing each other safe havens.\nDIG and novelist Omar Shahid Hamid also said young people are inclined towards militancy due to a disconnect between them and the state.\nHe was speaking at a talk on the rising trend of terrorism, crime and violence and solutions to curbing these, organised by Concerned Citizens Alliance (CCA) in collaboration with the Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) at the PMA House on Friday.\nComing to the point right away by bringing up the latest terrorist attack on foreign nationals in the city earlier in the day, DIG Shahid said that the law enforcement agencies are facing difficult times where they are seeing a downward spiral due to the state of the country\u2019s economics. \u201cThere is a spike in street crime, an increase in terrorist attacks,\u201d he said, adding that the challenges faced by Pakistan regarding crime would even overwhelm Western countries.\n\nNovelist and police officer Omar Shahid sheds light on resurgence of terrorism\n\nHe said it is not like nothing was done to control the crime but they are still unable to enjoy the peace dividend of the sacrifices that the law enforcers have made. \n\u201cEven though Pakistan was able to break the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan [TTP], so many militants who had gone back to Afghanistan are back due to some unfortunate decisions on the part of our government. We have been seeing resurgence [of terrorism] for the past two to three years and incidents are not just shooting or firing incidents but suicide bombings, meaning the terrorists\u2019 capacity is increasing. They have slowly revived and we have reverted to our position of 2014,\u201d he observed.\nHe also mentioned militancy in Balochistan and said that it was also eating up the country\u2019s resources. \n\u201cWe have expanded our footprint there but the problem is still not solved because the militant groups have collaborated. The jihadi groups are helping the secular groups, providing each other safe havens. There is looting and extortion as the whole system of crime feeds on it. They enable the militant groups to function comfortably as they collect amazing amounts to become some of the richest groups in the world,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe heart of the problem is the motivation for these groups. The youth are inclined towards militancy due to a disconnect between them and the state. There is a difference between their vision and the vision that the government wants to give to its stakeholders. They are not buying that vision,\u201d he said.\nAbout street crime, he said renting a pistol and snatching three iPhones in a day looks far easier and feasible than holding a job, which pays far less than that in a month. \u201cMeanwhile, desperation is increasing on both sides, that of the criminal and that of the victim. This increase leads to violence and the sensational stories that you see and hear about,\u201d he added.\nDIG Omar Shahid said that he was not saying all this as an apologist for the performance of law enforcement agencies. But he felt that the government has not invested enough in the capacity growth of the police here. \n\u2018Politicisation of police\u2019\nAnother issue that he pointed to was \u201cpoliticisation of police\u201d. \nHe explained this by pointing to the fact that internal politicisation has increased in the police. \n\u201cAnd it\u2019s not by one political party. There are also non-political actors because of whom there comes a problem with accountability. For instance, there is the inspector general of police who may not feel that he is accountable to the chief executive of his province. Then his entire chain of command may also feel the same. This becomes a problem on the operational level then. We need to reverse this, which is a tough thing to do because there is political inference and control in police in the West, too,\u201d he said.\nEarlier, CCA founder Azhar Jamil and their coordinator Mirza Ali Azhar also mentioned how the entire city is in the grips of crime.\n"

Earl of Gloucester, after losing his eyesight and misunderstanding one of his sons at a heavy cost, says, \u201cI stumbled when I saw.\u201d The reference here is to the spiritual awakening which is achieved after losing the visual sense, a physical attribute. \nDolphins found in the Indus River are unlike that: they are \u2018sightless\u2019 but have \u2018high sonar capabilities\u2019. Add what adds to the beauty of this creature is that it exudes innocence like very few creatures in the universe. \nThey need to be taken care of by the authorities concerned with great seriousness because not only this lovely species is an integral part of nature\u2019s munificence but adds to its aesthetical dimension. \nA two-person show titled Hungry Shores featuring works of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Saba Khan that\u2019s under way at the Canvas Art Gallery highlights both the plight and beauty of the blind dolphin.\nAccording to the information provided by the gallery, last year in the month of March, Saba Khan and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto visited Guddu Barrage and Sukkur Barrage for research on the habitat of blind Indus River dolphin. As a result, what the viewer gets to see in the show is an inspiring range of more than a dozen artworks. \nKhan uses oil on canvas to highlight the sightlessness of the species feelingly. Feelingly: because the artist comes up with a poetic personification of the species in exhibits such as \u2018Lightness\u2019, allowing the viewer to empathise with it.\nBhutto presents his noteworthy craft through his Bulhan Nameh (dolphin diaries) in works like \u2018Play\u2019 by using cyanotype on khaddar, broadening the dolphin space into a world of infinite possibilities where man and cetacean can coexist in harmony. Do they? That\u2019s the question the viewer needs to ask themselves.\nApart from that, there are audio and video presentations on the subject that complement the theme of the show well.\nThe exhibition will continue till April 25.\n"

This time, we are forced to spend even our Eid without salaries,\u201d said Dr Faiz Muhammad, an assistant professor at CEMB, adding that the staff was forced to hold protests for their salaries after every three months.\nThe protesters appealed to KU Vice Chancellor Dr Khalid Iraqi, also the chairman of CEMB\u2019s Board of Governors, and the chairman of the Higher Education Commission to intervene in the matter.\n\nAffected employees of Centre of Excellence in Marine Biology seek HEC chairman, varsity\u2019s VC\u2019s intervention\n\nSources said that the prolonged delay in salaries had forced some staff members to go on leave while others had found part-time jobs.\nThe worst affected, they said, were the pensioners as some of them were deprived of their dues pending for years.\n\u201cThere is a major deduction in the facility\u2019s funds and that too is released on a quarterly basis. Almost 45 per cent of the total funds we get go into payment of pensions to 40 retired staff members,\u201d an administrative officer at CEMB told Dawn, adding that the facility had asked the HEC to set up a separate pension fund.\nHe hoped that the funds would be released next week.\n\u201cWe are finding it very tough to pay on-services employees their salaries since the facility has a high number of retired staff members and there is no separate fund for them,\u201d a senior teacher said.\nAccording to him, the financial crisis has hard hit research at the facility. \n\u201cNot a single penny is received for research. Hence, lab infrastructure, classrooms and research equipment are in poor condition. Two of the four vehicles meant for research activities are out of order for a long time. Fortunately, however, faculty members compete for individual research projects and often win grants from private organisations,\u201d he explained.\nHe also shared that the facility headed by an assistant professor hadn\u2019t seen a selection board since 2010 and that there was a special case of a senior teacher who was deprived of his salary for 10 months.\nDawn tried to reach out the in-charge of the CEMB and KU Vice chancellor but they weren\u2019t available for comments.\n"

Dubai, which used to receive rare and very light rains after a gap of several years, had been hit by torrential rains that had affected social and business life across the city, he added.\nHe said: \u201cIn the next 20 years, the impacts of climate change will be devastating. Developed countries are generating more greenhouse gasses by using fossil fuels and other energies while undeveloped countries contribute very little to the greenhouse gases.\u201d\nHe added that earth\u2019s temperature had risen by 1.2 degrees centigrade since the late 19th Century due to human activities, like the use of fossil fuels. Solar, wind, and hydropower energy, however, offered sustainable alternatives to reduce greenhouse gases, he informed.\nZahid Abbasi, secretary to the Sindh Government, said climate change syllabus had been introduced in the school curriculum. He stressed the need to tackle climate change and start tree plantations in schools with the involvement of children. \u201cThe private sector has played a great role in Karachi so we will collaborate with this sector to tackle climate change,\u201d he added.\nDr Fozia Parveen from the Insitute of Educational Development, Aga Khan University, urged school teachers to provide environmental education to the students so that they could gain awareness about water conservation, climate change, and proper waste disposal.\nShe said that teachers\u2019 jobs should not be limited to education and awareness but should also be about changing students\u2019 behaviours for environment conservation and cleaning.\nMs Parveen added that the agriculture sector was now fast progressing and becoming like the industrial sector so children should also be involved in food production, adding that field trips for people, particularly, children, were also needed to show them the changing environment.\nRafia Javed Mallah of the Sindh Education and Literacy Department said that climate change was a phenomenon that all need to learn about and tackle its impacts. She stressed the need to educate and motivate people to save the planet. \n"

            "Text": "HYDERABAD: A division bench of Sindh High Court\u2019s Hyderabad circuit comprising Justice Shamsuddin Abbasi and Justice Amjad Ali Sahito on Thursday ordered an inquiry into the allegations that criminal elements existed within the rank and file of lawyer fraternity and they, in the garb of bar members, used to influence voters with the aim of getting their favourites elected in elections.  \nAdvocate Mohammad Bux alias Waheed Karan Shoro, has in his petition alleged that these elements were involved in drug peddling and other criminal activities. He has prayed the court to order postponement of the Hyderabad District Bar Association (HDBA) elections scheduled for April 20 and order an inquiry to expose lawyers, as well as government officials, found involved in narcotics trade and rigging in the elections.   \nThe bench ordered the Hyderabad SSP, Amjad Shaikh, to conduct the inquiry and submit his report before the bench by May 15, when the matter would be taken up again at 11am. The SSP would submit his report through SHC\u2019s additional registrar.\nAdvocate Shoro had earlier raised the same issue in November last year before then caretaker Sindh chief minister retired Justice Maqbool Baqar during the latter\u2019s visit to the High Court Bar Association office.\n\nPetitioner tells court drug peddlers in garb of advocates rig polls, seeks postponement of HDBA election\n\nWhen the matter came up for hearing on Thursday (April 18), the judges expressed their concern over the issues raised by petitioner Advocate Shoro. Justice Abbasi asked High Court Bar Association (HCBA) President Ayaz Tunio if he was doing anything over the allegations. Advocate Tunio sought time to look into the matter and said he would comply with court\u2019s order when issued in the light of the inquiry report.\n\u2018Secret inquiry\u2019\nDuring the hearing Justice Sahito said that the bench would get a \u2018secret inquiry\u2019 conducted by an SSP and Intelligence Bureau (IB) into the matter. However, the order passed during the course of the day contained directive for inquiry by the Hyderabad SSP alone. The bench also issued directive that the order passed on Feb 22 and the memo of petition should be sent to the SSP. \nPetitioner Shoro has cited the home secretary, Sindh inspector general of police, Hyderabad SSP, Sindh Bar Council (SBC) secretary and presidents of the HCBA and HDBA as respondents. \nRigging in elections\nThe petitioner has informed court that there had been complaints about incidents of \u2018systematic rigging\u2019 during bars\u2019 2024 elections which proved correct the apprehensions that the prescribed code of conduct was not followed in administrative affairs. \u201cLately, it has emerged that some criminal elements under the garb of \u2018advocates\u2019 entered the legal fraternity and pretended to be members of bar associations,\u201d he submitted in court, and lamented that \u201cthey look at elections every year after obtaining favourable results through manipulation and illegal practices\u201d.\nAccording to the petitioner, these elements serve vested interests and misuse powers of the two bars for activities prohibited under law. They use to influence bars\u2019 office-bearers on the basis of their votes to get personal benefits which needs to be stopped. These elements are involved in sale of narcotics and other criminal activities. \nAdvocate\u2019s arrest mentioned\nThe petitioner also submitted in court that one advocate, enroled with a bar, was arrested with a huge cache of psychotropic substance (ice).\nHe pointed out that the Hyderabad SSP had met HCBA and HDBA office-bearers in this regard and provided them with evidence to seek action against the arrested advocate as well as some other lawyers believed to be involved in unlawful activities. \u201cThen an inquiry committee was formed and its report revealed that not only that fellow but other advocates were also misusing HCBA and HDBA,\u201d the petitioner informed the bench.\nAdvocate Shoro suggested that biometric system should be implemented in line with Supreme Court\u2019s relevant order and the system could be used to verify lawyers\u2019 registration in a practical manner.\nFormation of JIT urged\nThe petitioner prayed the court to order formation of a joint investigation team (JIT) comprising police and intelligence officials to ascertain facts and till submission of its report, the April 20 elections of the HDBA should be postponed. Later, the petitioner amended his prayer and urged court to direct SSP Amjad Shaikh to submit a comprehensive report regarding registration of \u2018ice\u2019 peddling cases along with names of the accused and those government officials found involved in the criminal activities.\n"

They also alleged that the officials posted at the procurement centres were also charging Rs200 per wheat bag to buy their produce and that too at a much lower price than the official rate. All these injustices were causing heavy losses to abadgars, they deplored, and raised slogans against the area\u2019s Food Inspector Rajab Panhwar.\nThey said that such corrupt practices were witnessed at the wheat procurement centres in Bhan Syedabad, Wahur, Bobak, Arazi, Dwanbha, Tilti and Lakki Shah Saddar areas.\nThey deplored that small farmers had already incurred heavy losses while buying urea fertiliser at an exorbitantly high rates during the sowing season and now they were being denied gunny bags and official rate of their produce. The losses ran into millions of rupees as wheat growers were being made to sell away their crop at a throwaway price after producing the commodity at a very high cost due to an unprecedented increase in the prices of all agricultural inputs and fuel.   \nThey appealed to the CM to look into their grievances and save them from the heavy losses that were bound to devastate them economically.\nThey also demanded stern action against corrupt officials of the food department and extortionists.\n"

            "Text": "THE rooftop of Vaqar Zakaria\u2019s home in Islamabad is strewn with photovoltaic panels that he says have lowered his electricity bill to virtually nothing. This is countered by the stark contrast in his rising gas costs. \u201cFrom a steady Rs800 a month, it has risen to Rs4,000 in the last six months,\u201d he says.\nMr Zakaria, head of environmental consulting firm Hagler Bailley Pakistan, is fortunate to have a gas supply at home. His situation highlights a nationwide energy paradox, where advancements in one sector are negated by crises in another.\n\u201cIf only Pakistan had imported Iranian gas back in the late 1990s when there were no sanctions,\u201d Mr Zakaria told The Third Pole, recalling a time when prices were far cheaper \u201cat just $2 per million British thermal units (mmBtu)\u201d.\nA participant in some of the early discussions, Mr Zakaria remembers strategising over the proposed 2,775km pipeline that promised to link Pakistan\u2019s energy supply directly to Iran\u2019s abundant gas reserves.\n\nBetween the threat of US sanctions on one side and possible Iranian penalties on the other, experts question whether the \u2018Peace Pipeline\u2019 will be a panacea for the country\u2019s energy crisis\n\nThe long-term project, which came to be known as the \u2018Peace Pipeline\u2019, has faced significant delays due to geopolitical pressures, sanctions on Iran and financial hurdles within Pakistan.\nIran\u2019s proven natural gas reserves, estimated at 1,203 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) as of December 2021, are second only to Russia.\nTen-year wait\nIn February this year, the caretaker government decided to dust off the 2009 agreement, approving the construction of the first phase or 80km stretch (of the total 780km pipeline) from the Iranian border to Gwadar.\nMeanwhile, Tehran has issued a deadline: finish the pipeline segment by March 2024 or incur financial repercussions amounting to nearly $18bn \u2014 a sum that could prompt international arbitration.\n\u201cWe are very reluctant to take this drastic step,\u201d Hassan Nourain, the consul general of Iran in Karachi, told The Third Pole, adding, \u201cbut the gas company of Iran is a national company and belongs to the people of Iran. It invested $1bn years ago. Now, the Iranian parliament is pressuring the government to decide the fate of this project\u201d.\nIran had already fulfilled its part of the agreement by completing 1,100km of pipeline from the South Pars gas fields to the Pakistan border. Then in 2014, it extended the deadline by an additional decade, on Pakistan\u2019s request, he added.\nBut Islamabad is also feeling the pressure from the US. Last month, Donald Lu, the US assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asia cautioned Pakistan against importing gas from Iran, as it would expose it to US sanctions.\nIn response, Pakistan\u2019s Foreign Office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch made a case for national sovereignty; since the pipeline is being built within Pakistani territory, \u201cwe do not believe that at this point there is room for any discussion or waiver from a third party\u201d, she said.\nNonetheless, Thomas Mont\u00adgomery \u2014 the acting US mission spokesperson in Pakistan \u2014 offered the following words of caution: \u201cWe advise anyone considering business deals with Iran to be aware of the potential risk of sanctions.\u201d\nThe US has been pushing Pakistan to seek green alternatives; through its development agency it has helped add almost 4,000 MW of clean energy to Pakistan\u2019s grid since 2010.\nSpeaking in a personal capacity, Senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed of the ruling PML-N highlighted the tension between national sovereignty and the US: \u201cWe invite its meddling by abdicating our own autonomy for decisions on our core interests.\u201d\nDespite the warnings from its longstanding ally, Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif told The Third Pole that the energy infrastructure project would proceed, signalling Pakistan\u2019s intention to assert its autonomy: \u201cWe will go ahead with construction of the pipeline,\u201d he said.\nWaiver favour\nWhile Pakistan grapples with Iran\u2019s deadline, the land in Gwadar earmarked for construction has yet to be acquired, according to government insiders.\nMicheal Kugelman, director of the Wilson Centre\u2019s South Asia Institute in Washington, summarises the predicament: \u201cPakistan is seemingly caught between the devil and the deep blue sea \u2014 build the pipeline and risk being sanctioned, or don\u2019t build it and get slapped with a massive fine.\u201d\nAhmad Irfan Aslam, the former law minister in the caretaker government that greenlighted construction of the 80km section of the pipeline, points out Pakistan\u2019s reliance on the US for \u201ceverything from economic bailouts to its security\u201d. He warned any waiver request would necessitate complex negotiations.\n\u201cWe cannot bear American sanctions. We will present our stance to the US,\u201d Petroleum Minister Musadik Malik told journalists last month. \u201cIran has been told multiple times that we need their gas.\nWe want to complete this project but without any sanctions,\u201c he had said.\nMr Montgomery confirmed Pakistan has yet to present a formal waiver request. With Pakistan in a tight spot, Mr Aslam suggested exploring a deadline extension and seeking a waiver, which \u201cwould require support from both Saudi Arabia and the UAE.\u201d\nBut as tensions mount in the Middle East over the war in Gaza, with new US sanctions against Iran announced on April 18, Mr Kugelman said it was unlikely that the US would grant Pakistan a sanctions waiver to proceed with the project.\nEconomic feasibility\nPakistan has around 19.5 Tcf of proven gas reserves, sufficient for just 12 more years, based on current annual consumption levels.\n\u201cThe only advantage to have Iranian gas is if there is a guarantee of firm supply at favourable rates,\u201d said Haneea Isaad, an energy finance specialist at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).\nAlthough Khawaja Asif said the government was \u201clooking towards raising funds from international banks\u201d, Mr Zakaria warned that securing investment may prove challenging.\n\u201cNeither the development finance institutions nor western and Middle Eastern banks will lend for the project in view of US sanctions placed on Iran, which will also make it difficult for Pakistan to pay for the gas received from Iran,\u201d he said.\nPakistan\u2019s best bet may be to build the pipeline with financing from China or some other external source, notes Mr Kugelman.\nAmong possible funders is Russia. Senator Mushahid Hussain told The Third Pole that, \u201cRussia has offered to fund the initial $160m for the 80km of Pakistan-Iran pipeline.\u201d\nIran, said its consul general, \u201cwould be happy to provide technical and engineering support in building the pipeline\u201d.\nBut Pakistan faces a complex energy transition, marked by growing demand and discussions centred on the immediate challenges of costs, legal action and geopolitical dynamics.\nAs Islamabad prepares to host Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi on an official three-day visit from April 22, Isaad warns against viewing Iranian gas as a panacea for Pakistan\u2019s energy needs, emphasising it is \u201canother imported\ncommodity and subject to geopolitical considerations and linked to global oil prices\u201c.\nPublished in collaboration with The Third Pole at Dialogue Earth.

Two passers-by were injured, one of them in critical condition. According to witnesses, the attack involved a suicide bomber and a second assailant who was shot dead by police.\nNo individual or group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.\nHowever, Raja Umer Khattab, a senior official at the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD), claimed that one of the deceased attackers was a member of an outlawed Baloch separatist group from Panjgur.\nDIG East Azfar Mahesar told Dawn the Japanese nationals were travelling from their residence in Clifton to the export zone when the attackers struck near Murtaza Chowrangi.\n\u201cAll five Japanese remained safe. However, a private security guard accompanying them and two passers-by were injured,\u201d Mr Mahesar, a retired army captain, said.\nHe said the guards and police responded swiftly, with a Sharafi Goth police patrolling unit managing to secure the Japanese and escort them to safety.\nInvestigators seized a submachine gun, a bag full of grenades and a motorcycle at the scene.\nA police official, who asked not to be named, claimed that it was a \u201cfailed operation\u201d by the militants. He claimed they had mistakenly targeted the Japanese nationals, assuming them as Chinese because of facial resemblances.\nDIG Asif Aijaz Shaikh of the CTD told Dawn the van was armoured, which helped prevent casualties among the foreigners. He disclosed that the attackers used a motorcycle to carry out the bombing, adding that the rapid response of the patrolling police averted a greater tragedy.\nMr Khattab said the foreigners were travelling in three vehicles, including a Revo and a Fortuner, apart from the van that was targeted. The company\u2019s senior officials and their guards were travelling in the other two vehicles.\nHe explained the attack began when the van slowed at a speed breaker, prompting the suicide bomber to detonate the explosives prematurely. Although the blast didn\u2019t harm the Japanese nationals, an accomplice fired at least 15 shots from behind roadblocks, while the foreigners\u2019 guards returned fire. Nearby police responded, and as the shooter focused on the guards, a police officer fatally shot him in the head.\nMr Khattab stated that much impact of the blast was absorbed by a passing van carrying bakery goods. Glasses on only one side of the foreigners\u2019 van were broken.\nThe deceased guard was identified as Noor Mohammed, 45, who succumbed to injuries at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC), where two other injured passers-by were also being treated.\nPolice surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed said one unidentified male body of the alleged suicide bomber was brought in fragments at the JPMC. Dr Syed said there were five pieces of the body of the suspected suicide bomber, but he was identifiable.

            "Text": "PESHAWAR: The Pesh\u00adawar High Court (PHC) has directed the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister and cabinet to convene the assembly session within a fortnight to ensure that those elected on reserved seats for women and non-Muslims take oath.\nA PHC bench comprising Justice Syed Mohammad Attique Shah and Justice Shakeel Ahmad, in its 24-page detailed judgement on three identical petitions filed by around 20 MPAs-elect of the opposition in KP, also ordered the provincial assembly speaker to administer the oath to the said MPAs-elect in the session to be requisitioned in accordance with the court order.\nWhile the bench in its March 27 short order had not issued any such directive to the CM and the provincial cabinet, the court in its detailed judgement ord\u00adered both to \u201ctake all material steps in terms of Arti\u00adcle 109 along with all enabling provisions of the Cons\u00adtitution for summoning the session of the provincial assembly within fortnight positively, after receipt of this judgement, so that the oath is administered to the petitioners in term of Article 65 of the Constitution before the upcoming Senate election\u201d.\nThe PHC in its short order had directed the speaker to administer the oath to the petitioners in the session convened for Senate election of April 2 and also to facilitate voting in the election. But the ECP had to postpone the Senate polls in the province making it conditional with the said oath-taking, as no session was convened by the KP government.\nNow multiple petitions have been filed in the high court \u2014 one by the speaker requesting the court to review its order and others by the MPAs-elect seeking implementation of the short order and initiating contempt proceedings against the speaker and the deputy speaker.\nThe PHC in its judgement observed that owing to a dispute over allocation of reserved seats, with the exception of Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) that has a majority in KP Assembly, the present dispensation was resisting oath to those who represent marginalised communities in order to deny them the right to participate in the assembly proceedings and also to deprive them of exercising their right to vote in the April 2 Senate election in violation of the Constitution.\nReferring to the notifications issued by the ECP of declaring the petitioners as MPAs elected on reserved seats, the court ruled that after receipt of the said notification, the assembly secretary was obliged under the law to have informed the CM to requisition the assembly session to administer oath to the petitioners accordingly, but he failed to discharge his constitutional obligations for reasons best known to him.\nThe petitioners, including Shazia Tehmas Khan and 19 other MPAs belonging to the PPP-P, PML-N, JUI-F and PTI-P, had requested the court to declare illegal and unconstitutional the failure of both speaker and deputy speaker to call the assembly\u2019s sitting for administering oath.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq on Friday suspended the membership of two Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) lawmakers for the current session for \u201ceroding the sanctity\u201d of the assembly by \u201cindulging in rowdy behaviour\u201d during President Asif Zardari\u2019s address to the joint sitting of parliament on April 18.\nThe speaker read out his ruling regarding the suspension of MNAs Jamshaid Dasti from Muzaffargarh and Muhammad Iqbal Khan from Khyber after seeking approval of the house on a motion through a voice vote minutes before the culmination of an eventful sitting, marred by separate protests by members of the opposition PTI, the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F), and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) on different issues.\nThe house also witnessed two token walkouts and as many failed attempts to disrupt the proceedings by pointing out the lack of quorum.\nThe PTI and PPP members staged token walkouts as a mark of protest when the speaker did not give them the floor to respond to each other on the issue of the president\u2019s address, whereas the JUI-F lawmakers protested against the speaker\u2019s act of administering the oath to Sadaf Ihsan, who had been declared the winner by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on a reserved seat for women from KP on the JUI-F ticket.\n\nDasti, Iqbal barred from current session; action taken for misconduct during president\u2019s address; NA witnesses two walkouts as opposition members continue noisy protest\n\nSpeaking on a point of order soon after the oath, JUI-F\u2019s Noor Alam Khan termed the speaker\u2019s act \u201cillegal and unconstitutional\u201d, stating that a case was pending before a court of law and party chief Maulana Fazlur Rahman had already informed the ECP that Ms Ihsan had not been issued the ticket.\nAs a mark of protest, he pointed out the lack of quorum, but the speaker declared the house in order after a headcount.\nMNAs\u2019 suspension\nBefore reading out his ruling, the speaker stated that he had been forced to take action against the two MNAs when they crossed \u201call the limits\u201d and that he was doing so with a \u201cpainful heart.\u201d\nMr Sadiq announced that the two MNAs \u201cbe suspended from the services of the assembly for remainder of the session\u201d and asked them \u201cto forthwith withdraw the precincts of the assembly\u201d.\n\u201cI had been showing patience, but today I will not do it,\u201d said the speaker when the PTI members lodged noisy protest when he didn\u2019t give floor to PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan. However, later, he gave the floor to Mr Khan, who said that his party did not consider Mr Zardari a legitimate president.\nWalkouts\nPPP members, led by party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, staged a walkout when Mr Khan lashed out at Mr Zardari for keeping the office of the party\u2019s president, declaring that he did not represent the federation.\nMNA Sharmila Farooqui was given the floor by the speaker to respond to the PTI chairman, but as soon as she took the floor, Mr Bhutto-Zardari with his sister Aseefa, started walking out of the assembly. At this point, PPP\u2019s Shazia Marri pointed out lack of quorum to compel the speaker to adjourn the sitting.\nPlaying intelligently, the PTI members, who had already been protesting against the speaker for not giving them the floor, also staged a walkout to compel the speaker to adjourn the sitting without giving his ruling to suspend the two party MNAs.\nLaw Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar then went to the PPP members and succeeded in bringing them back to the house. Seeing the PPP members returning, the PTI members also came back and started raising slogans. The speaker declared the house in order and subsequently gave his ruling.\nThere was a rumpus in the house due to noisy protest by the PTI members when Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, on a point of order, started lambasting the opposition benches and targeted former prime minister Imran Khan.\nCriticising the PTI members for \u201chooliganism\u201d during the joint sitting and in the presence of diplomats, the minister said Imran Khan had been jeopardising the country\u2019s foreign interests by issuing directives from Adiala Jail.\nSecurity situation\nResponding to a calling attention notice regarding the recent terrorist attack on a bus in Noshki, Balochistan, and Kashmore in Sindh, where an operation against the robbers was underway, Law Minister Tarar said the federal government was providing full assistance to the provincial governments to deal with the security situation.\nThe NA will reconvene on Monday evening.\n"

During the current financial year, combined loss of Rs188 billion, which includes under recovery and loss above regulatory threshold, is anticipated in Pesco and Tesco\u201d.\nCritical high loss areas identified in Pesco also included Dera Ismail Khan -- the hometown of Mr Gandapur -- besides adjacent Bannu, Karak, Kohat, Shangla and formerly frontier regions. Tesco operates in former tribal areas where there is serious problem of non-recovery and non-meterisation. Due to these factors, Tesco may make loss of Rs51bn in the current financial year.\nHe said the success of nationwide anti-theft campaign to reduce losses and improve recovery was dependent \u201con wholehearted support of provincial government and its authorities which is not currently available in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\u201d.  \nThe power minister sought the chief minister\u2019s specific interest to ensure that support of police was available in Pesco so that anti-theft campaign was successfully implemented in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and menace of theft was rooted out.\nBesides, \u201cthere is a challenge of weak writ of the government in the operational jurisdiction of Tesco\u201d, he said and proposed that the KP government should prepare comprehensive plan to support Tesco in recovery and meterisation drive or it should take over supply of power in Tesco region.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The unfolding developments in the Middle East are reshaping the regional dynamics, giving rise to new geopolitical realities with significant implications for regional stability and power structures, which could fundamentally alter the balance of power and influence across the region, speakers at a roundtable discussion said on Friday.\nThe discussion titled: \u2018Israel\u2019s Gaza Genocide: Specter of a Widening War\u2019 was hosted by Islamabad Policy Institute to dissect the escalating conflicts in the region, particularly focusing on Israel\u2019s slaughter in Gaza and Israel \u2013 Iran military exchanges, according to a press release issued by the think-tank.\nThe participants were of the view that the redefining of regional power dynamics has prompted a critical reevaluation of strategies by key stakeholders.\nDr Shireen Mazari, while opening the debate as the chair of the session, said that \u201cUS had been setting the stage for the widening conflict for a while in terms of providing the strategic environment on the ground by not fulfilling the responsibility to protect, and allowing blatant violations of genocide convention, humanitarian law, Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, and gathering of military alliances on the ground.\u201d\nShe regretted the silence of Muslim countries, especially the Arab world on the massacre in Gaza and warned that if these countries that are at the \u201ccrux of the evolving new world\u201d do not act proactively by accepting the new reality, they would suffer for not keeping up with the changing times.\nSenator Mushahid Hussain Sayed said the events that started with \u2018Toofan Al-Aqsa\u2019 on Oct 7 have jolted the Western led security architecture in the region and three new realities have emerged in the shape of shattering of the status quo in the Middle East that had been built by Israel and US; resurgence of terrorism both by state and non-state actors; and intensification of the new cold war unleashed by US against China, Russia and Iran.\nHe said that in the new situation Israel has on the one hand lost the war in Gaza politically, legally and morally as its genocide has rallied the Global South in support of Palestine; it has on the other buried Modi-Biden\u2019s India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor under \u201cthe rubble of Gaza\u201d.\nMr Syed said that though chances of aggravation of conventional direct conflict between Iran and Israel were dim, there was a greater worry that \u2018shadow war\u2019 between the two would intensify. He believed one of the ways Israel would try to destabilise Iran would be to exploit its ethnic minorities, which could in turn affect Iran-Pakistan ties as well.\nSenator Farhatullah Babar, while talking about the start of a direct conflict between Israel and Iran, said that Iran\u2019s reply has broken the myth of invincibility of Israel by sending a strong message that no matter how sophisticated are the air defenses of the Zionist state, targets can still be hit.\nHe argued that though Iran\u2019s retaliation against the missile strike on its Damascus Consulate and Israel\u2019s counter attack in Isfahan early Friday morning have been symbolic with both sides showing restraint in executing them, Tehran has successfully demonstrated its capability to respond to provocations.\nSenator Afrasiab Khattak expressed his fear that the rise of extremism because of the aggravating conflict in the Middle East would affect Pakistan and its neighbourhood the most. He proposed that Pakistan should, therefore, continue with China Pakistan Economic Corridor, strengthen ties with Iran and change its Afghanistan policy for safeguarding its interests in the evolving situation.\nMr Khattak said Iran has won this round of the conflict by delaying recognition of Israel by Arab states and highlighting the Palestinian crisis.\n"

            "Text": "KARACHI: Despite mounting optimism for increased inflows and a new IMF bailout package, the US dollar strengthened in the inter-bank market while the State Bank\u2019s reserves saw a slight decline.\nA financial team led by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb is currently in Washington seeking another loan package from the International Monetary Fund.\nDespite the minister\u2019s hopeful outlook before departing for the negotiations, the market remained indifferent to these developments. On Monday, the dollar appreciated by 18 paise to Rs278.12. The greenback saw a 29-paisa increase in the open market, reaching Rs279.66.\nCurrency experts assert that the market is driven by tangible realities, emphasising that only actual dollar inflows can sway market sentiments; good news is not enough.\n\nState Bank reserves see a slight decline\n\nThere is a pervasive sense of disillusionment in the currency market regarding the country\u2019s increasing foreign debt and debt servicing burden. Experts see little prospect of escaping the substantial debt servicing obligations consuming a significant portion of Pakistan\u2019s export earnings.\nA senior banker remarked that avoiding the $25 billion debt servicing in FY25 appears impossible, especially with the necessity for further borrowings to meet financial obligations.\nLast week, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) disbursed $1 billion against maturing Eurobonds, depleting the central bank\u2019s already modest reserves.\nAlthough the State Bank on Monday reported a marginal decrease of $0.1 million to $8.040bn in its foreign exchange reserves during the week ended on April 5, this figure did not account for the $1bn Eurobond payment. Currency experts estimate the actual reserves post-payment to be around $7bn.\nNevertheless, the SBP intends to bolster reserves by purchasing dollars from the inter-bank market, as it has been doing to maintain reserves at a targeted level of $9bn by the end of this fiscal year under the IMF Standby Arrangement.\nAs a high-level Saudi delegation is currently in Pakistan, Islamabad is pinning hopes on investment from the kingdom, which is interested in injecting $5bn across various sectors in Pakistan.\nMarch witnessed a notable influx of $3bn in remittances and over $82m in treasury bills, marking a significant uptick after four years. However, bankers caution that this trend in T-bill inflows may not persist due to declining returns.\nThe current return rate on T-bills stands at approximately 21 per cent, a level considered high, and stable exchange rates over the past three months have encouraged investors to enter the market.\nThe State Bank reported the country\u2019s total reserves stood at $13.441bn, including $5.4bn held by commercial banks during the week ended on April 5.\n"

Power generation started again in August-September 2023, attaining its maximum 969MW capacity on March 29, as announced by the Water & Power Development Authority (Wapda).\nWithin a week, on April 3, the 48km-long headrace tunnel (HRT) dropped pressure, and power generation fell to about 400MW \u201csoon after the project was restored to full capacity by international contractors because of debris or cracks in HRT\u201d, inside sources told Dawn.\nThey said the project authorities and contractors, in consultation with the Wapda management, tried in-house emergency measures to restore the project but the fault was bigger than anticipated, although generation had incre\u00adased since then.\n \n \n\nAn official said a remotely controlled vehicle would need to be arranged abroad, most probably from China, to trace and potentially address the fault, at an estimated cost of about Rs6bn. He said the prime minister had not yet been intimated about the incident. The partial project closure is resulting in a substantial daily loss of electricity units, he added.\n\nRepair works may cost national kitty Rs6bn\n\nThe earlier repairs of 3.5km TRT cost the nation about Rs6bn, in addition to about Rs37bn in energy loss during repairs, maintenance, and testing over the following 20 months. Wapda has filed about Rs43bn insurance claims for the losses and is reported to have already held a series of high-level meetings on the subject.\nWhen contacted, Wapda confirmed a significant reduction in power generation due to a fall in HRT pressure but remained evasive about its actual cause. \u201cElectricity generation from Neelum-Jhelum Hydel Power Station has been restricted to 530MW due to decrease in headrace tunnel pressure on April 3,\u201d it said in a statement, attributing this to being a \u201cprecautionary measure\u2026to observe the behaviour of pressure fluctuation\u201d.\nThe Wapda spokesperson said the generation from the power station would be increased gradually after analysis and deliberations with the project consultants.\nIt is important to note that all possible maintenance has been carried out during the observation, he said, adding that this maintenance included cleaning of trash racks installed at the intake gates in the reservoir, flushing of all three de-sanders, flushing of pressure gauge installed at the powerhouse and inspection of the spiral cases of the generating units.\n\u201cThe project has a tunnel system comprising 51.5km. It is prudent to observe and monitor such a vast network,\u201d the statement said.\nOn March 29, Wapda announced that the Neelum-Jhelum project had achieved its maximum generation capacity of 969MW. Following the resumption of its operation in early March after inspection of the TRT, the project is continuously in operation as per the availability of water and contributing electricity to the national grid.\nIt had said that taking advantage of the low-flow season, operation of Neelum-Jhelum project was stopped on Jan 10 for inspection of the rehabilitated tail race tunnel. Subsequently, the detailed inspection was successfully carried out prior to resumption of generation from the project\u201c early last month. Most importantly, International Panel of Experts also inspected the tail race tunnel, it added.\nSince its commissioning in 2018, the project has generated 19.829 billion units of electricity, while 1.54bn units have been generated since the resumption of electricity generation after the rehabilitation of TRT in August last year.\n"

            "Text": "WASHINGTON: The spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are due to open on Tuesday, with two clear objectives: help countries combat climate change and assist the most indebted nations.\nThe meetings \u2014 which will bring central bankers, finance and development ministers, academics, and representatives from the private sector and civil society together to discuss the state of the global economy \u2014 will kick off with the IMF\u2019s publication of its updated World Economic Outlook.\nEven as they look ahead, the meetings will have an air of nostalgia this year, as 2024 marks the 80th anniversary of both institutions.\nThey were born of the Bretton Woods conference, held in 1944 as allied nations sought to regulate the international financial order after World War II, which was then still raging.\nAt the time the financial challenges were huge, with great swathes of Asia and Europe needing to be rebuilt.\nIn many ways, the problems now are no less daunting, particularly as the World Bank and IMF \u2014 which just reappointed its managing director Kristalina Georgieva to a second five-year term \u2014 seek a path forward on climate change.\n\u201cThere\u2019s the climate crisis, debt, food insecurity, pandemics, fragility, and there is clearly a need to accelerate access to clean air, water and energy,\u201d World Bank head Ajay Banga said during a recent live-streamed press conference.\nThe Bank \u201ccannot tackle poverty without the broader view,\u201d he said, adding that it is taking steps to widen its scope in order to help \u201ccreate a world free from poverty on a livable planet.\u201d Providing financing as countries make the transition to a low-carbon energy future and prepare for the impact of global warming remains a central focus.\n \n \n\nTrillions of dollars are needed in this area, and both the IMF and WB are clear: they will never be able to cover all the resources required.\nBut it\u2019s not just a question of resources, as Rachel Kyte, a professor specializing in climate policy at Oxford University, pointed out on Wednesday.\n\u201cWe need to see much more radical collaboration\u201d between the IMF, WB and regional development banks at the country level, she said.\nDoing so will call for \u201cstreamlining procedures and processes\u201d.\nDebt, another major challenge\nAnd then there\u2019s debt, with the money owed by emerging countries once again at the heart of the discussions.\nNegotiations between creditors and indebted countries have stalled in a number of cases, further delaying the implementation of IMF aid plans and the release of funds.\n\u201cThe basic problem is that the Chinese don\u2019t necessarily agree among themselves on how to proceed. And they don\u2019t have a clear picture of what they have lent and to whom, given the multiplicity of players involved,\u201d a source close to the matter told AFP.\nThis issue will be a particular focus of Wednesday\u2019s meeting of the Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable, which brings together financial institutions, representatives of the main bilateral and private creditors, and indebted countries.\nThe urgency has been underscored by the effect that interest rate hikes by the central banks of major economies, such as the US Federal Reserve or the European Central Bank, have had on debt.\nCentral bankers have sought to combat post-pandemic inflation with the hikes, but in doing so have sharply increased debt costs for borrowing countries.\nAnd while the first cuts are expected this year, rates are likely to remain higher over the long term than they have been over the last decade, according to all concerned.\nThat presents an additional challenge for governments that can spend more than a third of their income just to pay the interest on their debt.\n\u201cThe inflation news is not good news for the developing world, and it\u2019s especially problematic for a lot of countries that face rollovers on their eurobonds that are coming due in 2024,\u201d said Clemence Landers, a researcher at the Center for Global Development, during a Thursday press call.\n\u201cIn the absence of easing global financing conditions, these EuroBond rollovers are going to be a big problem.\u201d\n"

Make cold calculations and I believe, you will be the winner in the long term,\u201d the prime minister said while addressing a meeting held to review the power sector\u2019s performance.\nThe prime minister said utilising renewable energy resources would also ensure riddance from the crude oil tanker mafia acting as parasites and eating up the national money. \nHe pointed out that the country currently imports oil worth $27 billion to meet its power and transportation needs, a figure that could be significantly reduced by transitioning to alternative energy sources.\n\nPunjab govt\u2019s drive against power theft lauded\n\nTalking about the ongoing drive against power theft, he lauded the performance of the Punjab government and expressed the hope that other provinces would also follow suit to overcome the challenge.\nThe prime minister said: \u201cStreng\u00adthening the country\u2019s power transmission system requires utmost efforts and investment otherwise the power production and investments in the sector would go down the drain unless the flaws in the transmission network are removed.\u201d\nHe asked the energy ministry to engage world-class consultants to suggest ways forward to the government to boost up the country\u2019s power transmission system.\nIn a separate meeting, the prime minister directed officials concerned to take drastic measures including shifting of imported coal-run plants, improvement in power supply system, setting up cost effective and renewable energy plants and functioning of solar projects to reduce cost of electricity per unit thus benefiting the ordinary people.\nShift to local coal He directed for shifting of the imported coal-run power plants to local coal besides improving the power supply system. \n\u201cIn future, only clean, cost effective and renewable power plants should be set up in the country,\u201d the prime minister said.\nThe meeting was apprised of 600MW solar power project and the prime minister directed for expediting work on the foreign investment in this regard.\nThe prime minister directed that the auction process of those power plants of Power Generation Companies (Gencos) that were lying dysfunctional and defective should be accelerated.\nThe meeting was briefed about the existing power generation capability, supply system and the government\u2019s steps and proposals. \nThe meeting was also apprised of the future power demand and supply in the country.\nThe meeting was informed that by shifting the coal-run power plants from imported fuel to local coal would not only save precious foreign exchange but would also make it possible to reduce power price by Rs2 per unit for consumers.\nThe prime minister directed for swift implementation of all measures within the stipulated timeframe.\n"

            "Text": "\n\n\n \nISLAMABAD/KARACHI: PPP\u2019s Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari on Monday made her debut in parliamentary politics by taking oath as a member of the National Assembly amid noisy protest by opposition members who were protesting against the speaker for omitting their agenda items from the orders of the day issued for the sitting. \nThe opposition members had requisitioned the session to discuss the  issue of the letter written by six judges of Islamabad High Court (IHC)  regarding their alleged surveillance by the country\u2019s intelligence  agencies and interference in the judicial matters.\nResponding to the opposition\u2019s protest, the speaker announced that he could not allow a debate on a sub judice matter.\nSome of the protesting PTI members, carrying placards, gathered in front of the speaker\u2019s dais when Aseefa was asked by the chair to sign the roll of members. To avoid any physical confrontation, a number of PPP women accompanied her to the rostrum. \n\nNewly sworn-in MNA\u2019s \u2018unopposed\u2019 victory challenged before SHC\n\nDozens of PPP workers, who were sitting in the galleries, raised slogans like Zinda Hai BB (a term used for Benazir Bhutto) and Jiye Bhutto when Aseefa was signing the roll. On the way back to her seat, she received felicitations from a number of PPP leaders, including Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah who was present in the visitors\u2019 gallery. \nShe was also congratulated by Defence Minister Khawaja Asif before taking a seat beside her brother and party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari. Later, she, Bilawal and some other PPP members left the house after realising that she might not be able to deliver her maiden speech, due to the opposition\u2019s noisy protest.     \nAseefa had been elected unopposed from NA-207 Shaheed Benazirabad (formerly Nawab\u00adshah) on the seat that had been vacated by her father Asif Ali Zardari after becoming President.\nLater, Speaker Ayaz Sadiq prorogued the session due to lack of quorum, which was pointed out by PPP\u2019s Abdul Qadir Patel in protest against the opposition\u2019s behaviour during Aseefa\u2019s oath, and to deprive PTI members of the opportunity to take the floor.   \nSpeaking on a point of order, PPP\u2019s Syed Naveed Qamar regretted the \u201cunmannerly attitude\u201d of the PTI members during Aseefa\u2019s oath-taking.  \nAs soon as the speaker ordered a headcount after pointing out of the quorum \u2014 for which the presence of 84 members is required in the 336-member house \u2014 treasury members started exiting the chamber, leaving behind only the protesting opposition members. The speaker then read out the president\u2019s prorogation order, declaring that the house was not in order as only 64 members were present. \nVictory challenged\nMeanwhile, a PTI candidate petitioned the Sindh High Court challenging the victory of Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari from the NA-207 (Shaheed Benazirabad-I).\nThe petitioner Ghulam Mustafa Rind submitted that he had also filed nomination papers to run the by-election scheduled to be held on April 21. However, he asserted that the returning officer had rejected his candidature allegedly for concealing the acts in the nomination papers.\nThe petitioner claimed he had approached an election tribunal against the decision of RO and the tribunal had directed the petitioner to file an affidavit, but at the next hearing, the respondents filed a \u2018fake\u2019 and \u2018unverified\u2019 power bill before the tribunal. He alleged he was abducted by the Sakrand police when returning to his hometown after attending the hearing and police detained him for two days and an application was also filed before the court in this regard.\nMr Rind argued that the bill did not belong to him and his nomination papers were rejected with mala fide intent as the RO allegedly had close nexus with the PPP. \nHe recalled that an identical petition was also filed before the SHC circuit bench in Hyderabad, but the same was withdrawn without the petitioner\u2019s consent and maintained that since the rival candidate was influential, this petition may be decided at the principal seat of SHC.\nRepresenting the petitioner, Wahab Baloch asked the SHC to set aside the RO order that declared her unopposed election from the constituency in question. \nHe also pleaded to overturn the decision of RO for rejecting candidature of petitioner as well as the order of election tribunal about electricity dues.\n"

He said that he would require at least 4 to 5 hours to conclude the arguments.\nMr Raja on the other hand pointed out that if the trial would continue in late hours, the arguments on the appeal against conviction could continue after the regular court timings. He, however, asked judge Shahrukh Arjumand to give adjournment for a single day.\nThe judge responded that the courts have remained closed for Eid holidays and, therefore, he has workload for the entire week.\nHe adjourned the hearing of the case till April 24.\n"

She was later found dead along the railway line.\nA spokesperson for Pakistan Railway (PR) in a press release said the PR chairman has made a four-member committee, headed by the railway police south zone DIG, to probe into the death of Maryam and submit report in three days.\nThe press release says that Maryam, who was traveling from Karachi to Faisalabad, started scattering the belongings of other passengers. This prompted the passengers to call the police constable who assaulted the woman and moved her to another compartment. However, the constable\u2019s duty only extended from Karachi to Hyderabad. The press release says, according to fellow passengers, the woman suddenly jumped from the moving train near Channigoth station. Once the video of the constable thrashing the woman was posted online, the constable was arrested. He has been suspended from duty and is on bail in the Hyderabad area.\nBahawalpur District Police Officer Asad Sarfraz says that the district police are also looking into the case. The DPO said in a press release that initially heirs were not ready for her postmortem examination, but later they allowed and the postmortem examination was carried out at Ahmedpur East THQ hospital. The DPO said after receipt of the postmortem examination report, further action would be taken in a transparent manner into the woman\u2019s death.\nA PR official source, however, expressed doubts over the \u2018story of Maryam\u2019s suicide by jumping out of the train\u2019s window. The heirs of the deceased Maryam have also accused the constable of pushing her from the moving train. Maryam\u2019s sister, who was also traveling in the same train in another coach, told a news channel that she (Maryam) remained in contact with her during the journey till reaching at a station near Bahawalpur.\n\u201cShe called me that some people, including the police official, were teasing her and the two children with her on the pretext of not having a ticket (reservation). Later she told me that the police official beat her and her nephew and niece,\u201d she told the TV channel.\nShe said on reaching Bahawalpur, Maryam told her that she was dragged in the train by the police. After some time, the children told her that their aunt was found dead. \u201cThe police officials pressured the kids to give a statement that she died by suicide,\u201d she said.\nOne of the children (traveling with Maryam) told the media that her aunt was reciting Quran when the police guard started beating them and took the aunt to somewhere by dragging. Later, they saw her dead when the train stopped somewhere on the way.\nSimilarly, the mother and brother of the deceased also accused the police guard of killing Maryam. Talking to Dawn, her mother said: \u201cMy daughter was absolutely OK as there was no mental health issue with her. The police official killed her by pushing her out of the train,\u201d she alleged.\nBefore Eid, reports claimed that a woman and her two children jumped from the Millat Express, resulting in her death near Channigoth railway station, 70 km from Bahawalpur. Initially, it was suggested she was mentally unstable, and despite passengers\u2019 efforts to restrain her, she leapt from the train. However, following the viral video of her abuse, it emerged that constable Hassan stationed in Hyderabad, forcibly took her with him after torturing her during the journey on the night of April 7. Her body was later spotted  between the railway tracks near Channigoth on the morning of April 8.\nRescue 1122 in Ahmedpur East reported that upon an emergency call, their officials reached Channigoth on April 8, where they, along with police officials, found the body between the railway lines, accompanied by her two children. They shifted the body to Ahmedpur East THQ Hospital.\nMaryam\u2019s brother Muhammad Afzal also arrived in Ahmedpur East to collect the body. Due to her mutilated condition, THQ doctors were unable to perform a postmortem, only conducting X-rays on various parts. Afzal said Maryam worked at a beauty parlour in Karachi. He also filed a complaint with the police to register a murder case against the constable and his two accomplices, alleging that they also looted the deceased\u2019s jewellery and cash from her purse.\n"

For example, a consumer who was to pay Rs20,000 bill against the units he used, had to pay Rs40,000 bill against the overcharged units, which is unfortunate and those responsible for it will face law,\u201d he said and added the FIA\u2019s campaign against overbilling would continue. \u201cWe fully support the FIA\u2019s crackdown against overbilling,\u201d he added. \nMeanwhile, Lesco officers observed a strike on Monday against the FIA\u2019s action, terming it harassment and demanded that the agency should share the data regarding the overbilled units with proof.\nLahore, Kasur, Okara, Sheikhupura and Nankana districts fall in the Lesco jurisdiction.\nMeanwhile, about the facilities planned for the passengers at airports, Mr Naqvi said steps were being taken to increase counters at the Lahore airport to make immigration process hassle-free.\nHe added that electronic gates would also be introduced at airports so that the passport scanning process could be carried out without immigration officers.\nTo a question, he said strict laws were needed to regulate social media. Citing the example of Gulf states, he said that strict legislation was the need of the hour to check \u201cfake information\u201d.\nEarlier, Sub Inspector Faiza Shahzad inaugurated the Shaheed Shahzad Younas Investigation Block at the FIA building.\nOn the occasion, the interior minister paid tributes to the martyred inspector.\nHe also visited different sections of the newly-inaugurated investigation block.\nFIA Director General Ahmad Ishaque Jehangir, Lahore Director Sarfraz Virk and other officers were also present.\n"

            "Text": "LAHORE: Wheat farmers have demanded the Punjab government increase minimum support price and double the wheat procurement target from two million tonnes to four million tonnes. They warned of protests if their demands were not fulfilled. \nSpeaking at a press conference here on Monday, Pakistan Kisan Ittehad President Khalid Khokhar said the farmers were concerned at the reports that the provincial government had reduced wheat procurement target from the previous years\u2019 four metric tonnes to two million tonnes this year on the excuse that it had enough carry-over stock. \nBlaming the last caretaker set-up for importing 3.2 million tonne wheat at the cost of precious foreign exchange only for vested interest, ignoring the pleas of farmers, Khokhar urged Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz to fix the procurement target at four million tonnes like the previous years for controlling the falling grain prices that had come down to Rs3,200 per 40kg against the official minimum support price of Rs3,900. \nThe PKI leader urged the CM to approach the federal government for making fertiliser, electricity and diesel affordable for the growers of Punjab, which was guaranteeing food security for the whole country. He regretted that various countries were effectively making 20-year plans for their agriculture sector while Pakistani authorities could not ensure provision of compost even for one month. \n\nWarn of protests, sit-in outside Punjab Assembly; say even official price is not being implemented \n\nLauding the steps taken for the agriculture sector by the incumbent set-up, Mr Khokhar demanded the government take the farmers on board. \nIn a separate press conference, farmer leaders, Khalid Batth and Mian Umair Masood, regretted that for the first time in the history of the country neither public nor private sector was ready to pick wheat from the growers while the mafia was purchasing grain from the poor farmers at a rate from Rs2,200 to Rs2,800 per 40kg. \nWearing shrouds, they said the Arhtis from whom farmers would get loans for seed and fertiliser were blackmailing the borrowers/farmers who were ready to sell wheat at a rate equal to their production cost. \nThey demanded the government ensure procurement of grain at its officially announced rate of Rs3,900 per 40kg; otherwise, they threatened that farmers would launch a sit-in outside the Punjab Assembly from April 29 and end the protest only when the official rate would be guaranteed. \nThe farmer leaders said the farming community was being forced to sell wheat at lower rates while the urban consumers were being provided wheat flour at higher rates. They blamed the bureaucrats for creating a situation in which neither the rural nor urban population was benefiting from a bumper wheat crop.\n"

            "Text": "SAHIWAL: Despite the Punjab government\u2019s declaration of a support price for wheat at Rs3,900, the market witnesses wheat being sold at from Rs3,000 to Rs3,100 per 40 kg. \nThis disparity arises from the provincial food department\u2019s failure to announce any procurement schedule or targets for wheat purchase from the open market. \nThe situation has triggered panic among the activists of Pakistan Kissan Ittehad (PKI) and Kissan Ittehad. Both organisations have launched social media campaigns, urging farmers not to sell their crops at low prices and to hold onto their produce for the time being. \nHowever, the ongoing rain spells exacerbate the issue, especially for farmers who have already harvested their crops, leaving heaps of wheat exposed in fields due to a lack of storage capacity at their disposal. The ongoing spell of rain is another concern for growers, leaving them with no option but to sell their crops at throwaway prices.\nPKI Provincial President Rizwan Iqbal criticised the recently announced government policy, which limits wheat purchase to a mere 15 maunds or 600 kg per acre of production for any farmer. \nPKI President Khalid Mahmood Khookar expressed concerns over the surplus wheat production anticipated due to the previous caretaker government\u2019s import of 3.2 million tons of wheat. \nHe said that the government has 4.8 million tons of wheat in its stocks, indicating a grim outlook for farmers as it implies a lack of demand at the announced support price. \nThe limited buying of wheat is making farmers fear that the market will crash due to overproduction. Farmers attributed this predicament to a conspiracy against them who consistently yield bumper wheat crops but struggle to find buyers at the announced support price of the government. \nThe PKI announced plans to protest by staging demonstrations outside the offices of all 36 deputy commissioners in Punjab. The PKI demanded immediate intervention from Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, urging her to convene a meeting with representatives of farmers\u2019 professional bodies to address the pressing issue.\nMr Rizwan said that this year\u2019s wheat production has surged by 25-30%, and the government\u2019s reluctance to purchase wheat in limited quantities would lead to a market crash, adversely impacting farmers. \nReports say that wheat is already being sold at Rs3,000 and Rs2,900 per 40 kg in the grain markets of Pakpattan and Sahiwal. \nMuhammad Sheraz, a wheat grower from 77/4-R, said that if the government delayed purchasing wheat or imposed limitations on procurement, it would inevitably result in a market collapse, further exacerbating the plight of farmers. \nHe said then it will badly affect the upcoming cotton crop as farmers will have no cash to buy inputs for the cotton crop.\n"

That, he added, made the \u201cindustry\u201d a lucrative business both for the criminals as well as those who were supposed to stop them, that is, Sindh police.\nHe said street crime was \u201ca racket\u201d being operated from the city which contributed over 70 per cent in national exchequer and shared almost 95pc revenue of the total of the province. The value of the \u201cindustry\u201d and \u201csmooth operation\u201d of the armed bandits, he said, raised many questions about the performance, impartiality and role of the police force in Karachi which \u201cat times come under doubt.\u201d\n\u201cUltimately, when you see the situation of street crime and that police have failed to ensure security of the people, then a question emerges in the back of the mind: are they [Sindh police] facilitating this [street crimes] industry? It\u2019s time to ponder,\u201d said Mr Khurshidi.\nIn the first three months of 2024 alone, 59 people have lost their lives whereas 200 have been injured while resisting robbers across the city. During Ramazan alone, 19 people were killed by armed bandits in Karachi, where more than 6,700 incidents of snatching were recorded in the metropolis during the holy month.\nThe MQM-P leaders, while hinting at taking to the streets if the federal and provincial governments failed to pay heed to its concerns, also demanded compensations for the families of the victims of street crime.\n\u201cWe have already filed a resolution in the Sindh Assembly against these crimes and whenever the session is summoned, you would see us putting our case strongly,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have already raised this issue in the National Assembly. And we ask the federal government as well as to when they would intervene in this situation? Are you waiting for more people to die or the situation slips out of hands?\u201d, he asked.\nExpressing her concerns, senior MQM-P leader Nasrin Jalil said that the metropolis was actually \u201cstormed\u201d by armed bandits and Karachiites had never felt so helpless in front of those criminals.\n\u201cThe people here are tired of carrying dead bodies. It is not in our power to stop the anger of the people,\u201d she said. \u201cOn the other hand, we believe that the government should announce compensation for those who have been killed in street crime incidents. Many of them were sole breadwinners of their families. The government should make it a policy to take care of the families of those who fall victim to street crimes.\u201d\nPPP reaction\nMeanwhile, the PPP-led Sindh government reacted strongly to the MQM-P\u2019s claims and allegations.\nMinutes after the party\u2019s press conference, Karachi Mayor Barrister Murtaza Wahab Siddiqi and Sindh Minister Nasir Shah issued separate statements, calling the MQM-P\u2019s claims an attempt of \u201cdamage control\u201d through fake claims as it was facing \u201cdisintegration.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s an old issue of the MQM-P,\u201d said Barrister Wahab, who\u2019s also the spokesman of the Sindh government. \u201cWhenever the party faces crisis and disintegration, it comes under panic and starts doing strange things. The MQM-P allegations are nothing but point scoring in the name of street crime,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe Sindh government is committed to eliminate crimes both in rural and urban Sindh. Even today [Monday], the home minister and Sindh IG are in Larkana, chairing a meeting to plan action against criminals in the rural areas,\u201d he added.\nBoth Mayor Wahab and Minister Nasir Shah questioned the policy of the MQM-P which, he said, on one hand demanded empowered local government system and power at grassroots level and on the other asked the federal government to intervene for restoration of law and order.\n\u201cThe MQM-P has always pursued a politics of hatred and the party is politically isolated. The people of Karachi still remember the days of loot, plunder and oppression,\u201d they added.\n"

            "Text": "KARACHI: The book launching ceremony of late Irfan Husain\u2019s collection of selected columns A Life Lived with Passion on Monday was quality time spent in the company of his five friends who shared glimpses of his life to help those who didn\u2019t know him personally know him better through their eyes. \nThe event was organised by the Library and Literary Sub-committee of the Karachi Gymkhana in the club\u2019s Sapphire Hall.\nNot at all a sad occasion, it was a celebration of a life with many positive dimensions, of someone who had scaled the heights of integrity and was passionate about several things which he wrote about. In fact, he wrote more than 3,000 columns and articles of which the best 140 pieces covering a diverse array of subjects were selected for the book. \nJavid Ali Khan, Irfan Husain\u2019s close friend, who also published the book, after his passing, also praised the editors of the book \u2014 journalist Carmen Gonzalez and her husband, former Dawn editor Abbas Nasir \u2014 who meticulously selected the pieces and arranged them in chronological order. The selection helps readers witness the evolution of the author\u2019s mind, knowledge and intellect over the span of five decades. \n\nLate columnist remembered at launch of his book A Life Lived with Passion\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, Javid Ali Khan said that the book is a \u201clabour of love, a combined effort of Irfan\u2019s wife and the editors\u201d.\nHe said that he first met Irfan in a classroom where \u201che was the student, and I was the teacher. But later, in life he became my teacher\u201d.\n\u201cHe passed the civil service exam and was posted in Lahore first. I encouraged him to write columns. He wrote honestly and bravely,\u201d he said, adding that he was also instrumental in introducing him to his first wife and was also best man at his second wedding to Charlotte. \nEconomist and writer Dr Ishrat Husain said that he followed Irfan Husain\u2019s columns in Dawn. \u201cHe was a truly global citizen. His columns showed his grasp over politics, history, human rights, science technology, poetry, food, and so many other things,\u201d he said. \n\u201cHe was a conscious and sharp person, who could fit his entire message in a concise column. He had conviction. His advocacy for human rights, minorities\u2019 rights and women\u2019s rights showed his conviction. He wanted the government to invest in social infrastructure, education and empowerment of girls. He was critical of those who used contacts to get anywhere. He wrote about the corrupt system where relatives just got to reach important positions. He was also a firm believer in democracy. Even his earliest writings, which are some 49 to 50 years old, still have relevance,\u201d he said. \nFormer ambassador Dr Masuma Hasan, who knew Irfan Husain from their student days, said that in order to understand his journey it is necessary to look at the vibrant environment in which he was placed. \u201cHis father was a short story writer, who spoke numerous languages. His mother wrote, too. He was raised in a vibrant environment which gave him a world view,\u201d she said. \nEminent writer Anwar Maqsood, who was also an old friend of Irfan Husain from their Karachi University (KU) days, recalled how his friend used to get him into trouble. \u201cI was mistaken as a thief when I was seen taking his father\u2019s expensive ties from his closet. But it was Irfan who was selling them to me for Rs15 each,\u201d he said, making everyone laugh. \nThough Anwar Maqsood is known as a famous humorist, it was former Senator Javed Jabbar, also Irfan Husain\u2019s close friends from their KU days, who had the audience falling out of their chairs with laughter while sharing an old memory of them performing in a play.\nThe play, Julius Caesar, was not allowed to be staged at the KU so the boys, including its production designer Anwar Maqsood, took it to the Karachi Grammar School stage. \n\u201cThe characters in the play were wearing togas. Irfan was not wearing anything underneath his toga. We were directed not to fall with our feet pointing towards the audience. But Anwar Maqsood had put safety pins in all the wrong places in Irfan Husain\u2019s costume. He was not meant to fall but he did and what was worse was that when he did his legs were pointed in the direction of the audience,\u201d Javed Jabbar remembered. \n\u201cWhen the founding father of PTV, Aslam Azhar\u2019s wife Nasreen Azhar, who was reporting on the event, gave us a review in the paper she called it \u2018The Murder of Julius Caesar\u2019. She was being kind. It was in fact the massacre of Julius Caesar,\u201d he finished his tale with a shudder.\n"

It called for supplying water to the tail-end areas and opening non-perennial canals of Kotri barrage forthwith because they were to start providing water from April 15. \nThe meeting demanded audit in agricultural engineering department for corruption and political intervention and rejected corporate farming.\nIt demanded provision of subsidy to farmers on electricity bills whose tariffs kept increasing and deplored corruption in Sindh Seed Corporation (SSC). The SSC should be wound up to lessen financial burden on exchequer as the corporation had failed to benefit farmers as well as agriculture sector, it said. \nThe meeting condemned Sindh government\u2019s decision to purchase wheat from traders instead of farmers and said there was no transparency in ongoing distribution of gunny bags, which should be provided to farmers to procure wheat at support price of Rs4,000 per 40kg. \nThe meeting supported protest by Punjab growers for raise in wheat support price and expressed anger over corruption in Rs4bn subsidy by agriculture extension department.\nIt recalled the department had stomached in 2022 Rs4bn out of which Rs5,000 per acre subsidy was to be provided to flood-hit farmers for wheat cultivation as well as the subsidy for agricultural machinery, which too had fallen prey to corruption. \nThe meeting called for high-profile inquiry into the massive misappropriation of public funds and rejected price of fertiliser being charged by fertiliser companies over and above actual market price. It also expressed concern over \u2018artificial\u2019 raise in the price of tractors.\n"

He appreciated the police force in field for its concerted efforts towards recovery of the hostages held by dacoit gangs.\nThe minister offered an olive branch to defiant outlaws saying that they would be dealt with according to law [will not be harmed or killed by police] if they chose to lay down their arms and court arrest voluntarily. However, he added, they would be dealt with sternly, if they chose not to surrender.\nHe expressed the hope that the law and order in upper Sindh districts would improve soon as police were making great efforts in this regard. \u201cBut it will take some time to eliminate the gangs considering their number being high and the vast difficult approach to their hideouts in the riverine areas,\u201d he said.\nSome media persons posed a question to the home minister about any progress made by the JIT formed to locate a minor girl, Priya Kumari, who has been missing since Aug 2021. Mr Lanjar replied that he would seek an update from the JIT when he would proceed to Sukkur.\nHe was also asked about any progress in reaching the remaining suspects wanted in the murder case of senior journalist Jan Mohammad Mahar, Mr Lanjar said that the suspects were believed to have been hiding in the jungle area but they would be hunted down and put behind bars soon.\n"

Now, he said, municipal corporations were according such permission without bothering to get the physical condition of newly-constructed roads checked. If this is allowed to go on, all newly-constructed roads will also vanish, he cautioned.\nThe DC also mentioned that municipal corporations were collecting road cutting charges but the money was not utilised for the reconstruction of the dug up roads. Rather, it was used for other purposes, mostly disbursement of salaries, he added. \u201cThis practice of road cutting needs to be stopped forthwith,\u201d he stressed in his letter. \nHyderabad Mayor Kashif Shoro, when contacted by Dawn over phone, said that a copy of the DC\u2019s letter was not received by his office as yet. He said it should have been sent to his office. He promised to get back with his comment on the DC\u2019s letter but he did not.\n"

During scrutiny it was revealed that the respondent did not possess the pre-requisite qualification for admission to the MSc programme since, according to the university rules, the qualification of B.Tech (Hons) was not considered equivalent to BSc Engineering.\nThe respondent had filed a petition in the PHC, which was allowed on Feb 21, 2013.\nLikewise, in another case, one of the appellants obtained a B.Tech degree from KP University of Engineering and Technology and applied for recruitment for the post of assistant executive engineer (BPS-17) in Pakistan Railways\u2019 civil engineering department.\nThe candidature of the appellant was provisionally accepted and he was told to provide his registration certificate to the PEC, but he failed to do so, resulting in the rejection of his candidature.\nThe appellant had filed a petition in the PHC which was dismissed on Oct 7, 2013.\nThe third case concerned the filing of a petition before the LHC in which the petitioner holding a B.Tech (Hons) in Electrical (Power) Technology challenged allocation of seats.\nAuthored by Justice Mazhar, the judgement said the educational institutions were competent to manage their own affairs without any outside intervention from executive or judicial organs, unless they contravene or disregard the compass of their authority or act in breach of applicable statutes or admission policies as laid down in the prospectus.\n\u201cNothing on record shows that while cancelling admission of the respondent in the first case, the university committed any act in violation of their rules and regulations. The petitioner failed to achieve the admission criteria and hence, he was not entitled to admission.\n\u201cIt was neither fair nor just or equitable to interfere in the affairs falling into the exclusive domain of the university and its academia and, therefore, the PHC was not justified to intervene in the admission policy which does not seem to be discriminatory or unlawful, but a fair benchmark for applying for admission in the MSc degree programme,\u201d the verdict said.\nThe judgement cited a Nov 15, 2019 decision by the Higher Education Commission\u2019s (HEC) Equivalence and Accreditation Committee declaring that degrees of BSc (Engineer) and B.Tech (Hons) were not equivalent, but could be considered on a par for employment, grade, promotion, etc. in their respective cadre/streams.\nThe SC judgement said the criteria set for admission explained that both degrees \u2014 BSc (Engineering) and B.Tech (Hons) \u2014 were distinct with the rider that if a person who qualified B.Tech (Hons) applied for admission to Engineering Bachelor\u2019s degree programme offered by engineering institutions and universities, he can avail certain exemptions subject to assessment of courses and satisfying PEC regulations.\n\u201cThus the gist of documents placed before us unequivocally demonstrate that the degree of B.Tech (Hons) is not equivalent to BE degree, but both are two distinct disciplines of knowledge in the field of engineering and technology with distinct syllabi and programme objectives but may be treated at a par for recruitment, pay scales and grades.\n\u201cThe Bachelor of Science in Engineering emphasises theories and advanced concepts, while an Engineering Technology degree emphasises hands-on application and implementation with the major difference that BE is more knowledge-based while B.Tech is skill-oriented,\u201d the judgement explained.\n"

Zodiac is partly owned by Israeli businessman Eyal Ofer.\nPakistani crew\nMeanwhile, the Iranian mission in Pakistan said on Monday that it could not yet confirm whether any Pakistani nationals or sailors were on board the seized ship.\nSharing a statement from Tehran\u2019s ambassador in Islamabad, a spokesperson told Dawn they had received details about the Pakistani citizens through Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Sunday, and conveyed them to their capital.\n\u201cWe are following the issue in contact with the Iranian and Pakistani foreign ministries,\u201d the statement said, adding that they were awaiting a response from Tehran.\nMedia reports suggested that at least two Pakistanis were on board the MSC Aries, with the ship\u2019s Chief Operating Officer (COO) Muhammad Adnan Aziz being one of them.\nAccording to Geo News, family sources close to Mr Aziz said he was in fact on the seized vessel. They also claimed to have approached the Foreign Office to seek his safe return.\nThere are also said to be around 17 Indians on board, and India\u2019s External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar is said to be in contact with his Iranian counterpart to secure their release.\nShipping disruption\nReuters quoted Stephen Cotton, General Secretary of the International Transport Workers\u2019 Federation, the leading seafarers\u2019 union, as saying that \u201cinnocent seafarers must be protected from escalating conflicts they have no role in instigating, nor power to resolve\u201d.\nThe International Chamber of Shipping called the seizure a \u201cflagrant breach of international law and an assault on freedom of navigation\u201d.\nPatrick Verhoeven, managing director of the International Association of Ports and Harbors, said the seizure of the MSC Aries \u201chas the potential to further disrupt cargo transits in and out of the region, which will impact all of our member ports, one way or another\u201d.\n"

During its stay, the delegation is scheduled to meet President Asif Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Foreign Minister Dar, Chief of Army Staff Gen Asim Munir, and the apex committee of the Special Investment Facilitation Council.\nA statement issued by the Foreign Office highlighted that the visit aimed to \u201cexpedite follow-up on the understanding reached between Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif and Mohammed bin Salman, crown prince and prime minister of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, during their recent meeting in Makkah Al Mukarramah to enhance bilateral economic cooperation.\u201d\nDuring that meeting, the Saudi crown prince pledged to expedite the first tranche of a $5 billion investment in Pakistan.

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The government on Monday increased the prices of petrol and high-speed diesel by Rs4.53 and Rs8.14 per litre, respectively, for the next fortnight ending April 30.\nIn a late-night an\u00ad\u00adnouncement, the Ministry of Finance stated since the prices of petroleum products had seen an increasing trend in the international market during the last fortnight, it decided to accordingly revise the existing consumer prices of petroleum products.\nThe ex-depot petrol price was thus increased from Rs289.41 to Rs293.94, up by 1.6pc (or Rs4.53 per litre), for the next fortnight. In the retail market, petrol would, however, be available for no less than Rs295 a litre.\nPetrol is mostly used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws and two-wheelers and has a direct bearing on the budget of middle- and lower-middle class.\nOn the other hand, the ex-depot price of high-speed diesel (HSD) was increased by Rs8.14 per litre (2.9pc) to Rs290.38 per litre for next 15 days against Rs282.24 per litre over the past fortnight. Most of the transport sector runs on HSD. Its price is considered inflationary as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains and agricultural engines like trucks, buses, tractors, tube-wells and threshers and particularly adds to the prices of vegetables and other eatables.\nThe government did not announce the prices of kerosene and light-diesel oil. Kerosene is mostly used by unscrupulous elements for mixing it with petrol and to some extent for lighting in very remote areas while LDO is consumed by flour mills and a couple of power plants.\nInformed sources said the prices of petrol and HSD had increased in the international market by about $4 and $4.50 per barrel respectively in the last fortnight before the latest escalation.\nInterestingly, the import premium on petrol has dropped by almost 21pc to $10.7 per barrel over the last fortnight when compared to $13.50 in last few days of March and the rupee strengthened by about 40 paisa, except on April 15 when it lost value against US dollar.\nThe HSD price, on the other hand, was up in the international market and its import premium paid by the benchmark PSO remained unchanged at $6.50 per barrel.\nAt retail stage, the HSD would be sold at about Rs292 per litre.\nFor the purpose of price calculations, officials said the price of petrol had gone up by about $4 per barrel to $98.5 last week from $94.5 earlier while HSD price went up by about $4.50 per barrel to $102.9 from $98.4.\nOn April 1, the government had increased the price of petrol by Rs9.66 per litre and reduced that of HSD by Rs3.32 per litre for the first fortnight of the month.\n"

            "Text": "WASHINGTON: Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said on Monday that Pakistan doesn\u2019t need too many policy prescriptions, it just needs to implement those policies.\nSpeaking at the Atlantic Council think tank on his first working day in Washington, the minister also urged institutions such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) to help countries like Pakistan deal with the effects of climate change and achieve financial inclusivity.\nThe minister, who is in the US to attend the spring meetings of the World Bank group and discuss a new loan package with the IMF, stressed the need for promoting financial inclusiveness and climate resilience when asked to comment on the ongoing debate about reforming the two financial institutions.\nThe minister pointed out that Pakistan was not a major emitter, yet it was among the major victims of climate change. The country also needed financial inclusion to enhance the position of women in the national economy, he noted.\n\nOn his first day in Washington, finance minister seeks help with tackling climate change fallout\n\nMr Aurangzeb made it clear in the very beginning that during his almost week-long stay in Washington, he would seek a new programme from the IMF.\nResponding to another question, he said Pakistan was looking for a larger and longer program from the IMF because \u201cwe need two to three years for structural reforms.\u201d\nHe said he would like to conclude the formalities and get a new Extended Fund Facility (EFF) package from the IMF \u201cas soon as we can, but these are just preliminary discussions\u201d.\nHe said that during his negotiations with the Fund\u2019s team in Islamabad, he learned that the IMF believed Pakistan had the capability, but it needed to carry out the reforms it pledged. \u201cThe PM is quite keen and vocal on the need for a new programme,\u201d he added.\nIf the this week\u2019s discussions are fruitful, Pakistan anticipates an IMF mission visiting Islamabad next month for further talks on the loan. Additionally, the delegation plans to negotiate increased financing with the World Bank.\nPakistan is also eagerly anticipating the release of $1.1bn under the current Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) expiring this month.\nTalking about the need to expand the tax base and reform the system of tax collection, the minister said the reforms would not only increase the revenue but also bring transparency and improve the client experience.\nHe also emphasized the need to encourage public-private partnership, pointing out that the government couldn\u2019t do everything.\nPakistan, he said, needed \u201ctimely decisions, timely execution\u201d to build its economy as \u201cno strategy works without execution.\u201d\nAsked how Pakistan could successfully rebuild its economy, the minister said: \u201cWe do not need too many policy prescriptions. We know what to do \u2026 it\u2019s time for us to start moving\u201d.\nBusiness council\nEarlier, the finance minister commenced his official engagements by meeting a delegation from the US-Pakistan Business Council. During the meeting, the minister highlighted the government\u2019s dedication to attracting both foreign and domestic investments in key sectors, a press statement said. These sectors include agriculture, IT, mines & minerals, and energy.\nHe also met Mohamed Nasheed, former president of the Maldives and the current head of the Climate Vulnerable Forum.\n\u201cHe highlighted Pakistan\u2019s vulnerability to climate change, the role played by the country in the establishment of Loss and Damages Fund and the way forward to address climate challenges in vulnerable countries,\u201d said a statement issued by Mr Aurangzeb\u2019s team.\n"

This task may be assigned to [the Intelligence Bureau] and civil administration,\u201d it said.\nThe commission also advised against using the paramilitary FC and Rangers in the urban areas.\n\nRecommends \u2018zero tolerance\u2019 for violent extremism; criticises past agreements with militant groups as \u2018temporary fix\u2019 that doesn\u2019t work\n\nThe three-member body, headed by retired police officer Syed Akhtar Ali Shah and consisting of former IGP Islamabad Tahir Alam Khan and Additional Interior Secretary Khushal Khan, also called for \u201czero tolerance\u201d towards violent extremism and suggested the government review its policies to address the root causes of the menace.\nThe commission was constituted under the Pakistan Commission of Inquiry Act 2017 to ensure compliance with the February 6, 2019, apex court verdict, authored by then-Justice Qazi Faez Isa.\nThe report said that the fallout from the Faizabad dharna was \u201cmore due to lack of courage of conviction of the leader handling the issue and in particular the government of Punjab\u201d.\nIt recalled that while there was an agreement on the part of the government and official institutions to resolve the matter through negotiations and avoidance of the use of force. Initially, the federal government took the stance that the Punjab government should deal with the issue within its jurisdiction, but the government of Punjab maintained that since they had accepted 11 out of the 12 demands of the protesters.\nSince the demonstrators\u2019 final grievance pertained to the Centre, the provincial government argued that they should be allowed to proceed to Islamabad. The Punjab government reportedly assured the Centre that the demonstrators would peacefully disperse after registering their protest.\nThe commission also noted that since no one from among the then-PM, former ministers for law, interior and the former Punjab chief minister accused intelligence agencies of facilitating the protesters, nor was any evidence furnished to this effect, the commission could not connect any organisation or state official with the TLP dharna.\n\u2018Dynamics of religious militancy\u2019\nThe report also compared the agreement with the TLP with those signed with militant groups in the 2000s. \u201cWithout analysing the dynamics of religious militancy, government, as always, is only trying a quick fix rather than addressing the root cause and such a tendency has never worked in the past and will not work in the future \u2026 the inking of agreement on the terms of protesters and similar agreements in the past with other militant groups might have found a temporary solution to a deep-rooted problem,\u201d the report said while calling for a review of approach in dealing with violent extremism. It also called for an effective system to curb terror financing.\nAccording to the report, there should be coordination among law enforcement agencies, Pemra, and the interior ministry to surveil social media against \u201cinjurious material in violation of law\u201d.\nThe commission also observed omissions in implementing the National Action Plan and sought to \u201cstrengthen the anti-terror agencies through basic reforms in the criminal justice system\u201d.\nIt also called for action against those involved in terrorism and other crimes during the 21-day sit-in and said that cases \u201cmay be re-opened and investigated and taken to a logical conclusion\u201d.\nThe report also noted that the Mustafa Impex case ruling, which diluted the executive authority of the PM, may be revisited.\nThe Islamabad Capital Territory may be given the status of a province with full administrative and financial authority and the Police Order 2002 may be implemented in the capital, it added.\n"

It is nothing but a callous act on their part,\u201d he said.\nA schoolteacher told Dawn that most of the books collected from students after their promotion to the next grade were in bad shape and therefore, they couldn\u2019t be used.\n\u201cWe felt embarrassed while giving away the \u2018overused\u2019 books to the students, who accepted them halfheartedly,\u201d he said.\nThe teacher said most students enrolled in government schools were too poor to afford book binding costs, damaging textbooks.\nA senior official of the provincial textbook board told Dawn that incomplete book sets were dispatched to Malakand, Swabi, Hangu, Tank, and Kohat districts.\nHe said the printing of books was under way and would take a few weeks for completion.\nThe official said the funding denial by the government delayed the printing of school books.\nHe said the textbook board published advertisements in newspapers several times for book printing contracts, as the owners of private printing companies were reluctant to participate in the bidding because the government was not giving away funds to the textbook board.\nMinister for the elementary and secondary education department Faisal Khan Tarakai was not available for comments.\n"

He said masons with experience of Mughal architecture were hired from Lahore.\nHe said the mosque was a miniature model of Lahore\u2019s Badshahi Masjid and was the first building of its kind in Chitral, where red sandstones and marble were used.\nHe said the education department had also been running a seminary in the spacious mosque since 1950s.\nMaulana Khaleeq said the 100-year glory of the mosque had left a deep imprint in the history of modern Chitral, and the people had attachment to it.\nEven after the merger of the state of Chitral with Pakistan as one of its districts in 1969, the elders of the royal family kept on managing the affairs of the mosque through a committee consisting of local notables.\nIn 1980, then military ruler Gen Ziaul Haq provided grant-in-aid for the mosque during his visit to Chitral, and the funds were used to purchase commercial lands, ensuring a regular income accrued from the rent.\n"

Similarly, to make the commercial plots lucrative to investor, it also mulled increasing the payment plan from one year to three years.\n\u201cYes, various proposals came under discussion today; we discussed the future needs of the city, its available infrastructure, and resources. We also discussed that if 1:17 FAR is allowed across Islamabad, then what will be the status of traffic management and utilities, such as water,\u201d said a source. They added there should be some difference in the by-laws of Islamabad: the capital city and other cities. The meeting did not reach a decision and proposals are likely to be finalised in the next sitting. It is relevant to note here after getting a lacklustre response in its auction of commercial plots in recent years, the CDA management had in principle decided to bring major policy changes to promote development and business activity as well as the high-rise buildings.\nSources said the government and the CDA management were planning to increase the payment plan for commercial plots from one year to three years. It is also planning to increase the floor area ratio to 1:16.\nSimilarly, there is also a proposal to give possession to developers after getting 50 per cent payment, instead of 100 per cent. Sources said that during the last two years, the CDA could not attract investors during the auction of commercial plots. In contrast, the central business district in Lahore has been an attractive opportunity for investors across Pakistan, including Islamabad.\nIn light of such policy measures, the investors are moving to Lahore from Islamabad, claimed sources.\nFormer president of Islamabad Developer Association Chaudhry Naseer Ahmed told Dawn that the developers had been advocating changes to the CDA by-laws for years to make them investor-friendly.\nMeanwhile, Real Estate Association President Sardar Tahir Mehmood said that his association had been asking the CDA to amend the by-laws for the past six months at least. \u201cWe also wrote a letter on March 20 in this regard,\u201d he said, urging the CDA to do the needful.\n"

Unfortunately inordinate delay in launch of BS programme in the college is shattering my dream,\u201d said Abdul Haq, a resident of Khar.\nBahadar Said, president of All Bajaur Private Schools Association, said that he was shocked to know that BS programme was not launched in the college. He said that it was tantamount to deprive local girls of their right to education.\nHabib Hassan Yad, a right activist, told this correspondent that the college had been upgraded to degree level nine years ago. However, he said that absence of BS programme meant that the college was not upgraded properly.\nA senior staffer of the college, when contacted, said that shortage of teachers was the major cause of delay in launching of the programme. She said that the college started BS Botany and Islamiat in 2017 but no student was interested in studying those subjects.\n"

The directorate had a complete directorate, but this year, the results were compiled by a private firm hired for teacher training.\nOn Monday, it was decided that from now on, the centralised exam for fifth grade would not be held to reduce the workload of students.\n\u201cAfter careful consideration, it has been decided to discontinue the centralised examination system for grade 5 in the FDE schools. This move aims to alleviate exam stress and anxiety, as well as eliminate unwarranted comparison and competition among peers. By removing this pressure, we can create space for children to focus on developing other essential life skills and engaging in sports activities,\u201d read a statement issued here on Monday.\nIt added that while centralised exams will no longer be conducted, summative internal diagnostic assessments will continue to ensure teachers\u2019 accountability.\n\u201cWe believe that learning extends far beyond the stress of exams and that the early years of schooling should be joyful and enriching,\u201d the statement said.\nIt added that to further enhance students\u2019 experiences, \u201cWe [the Education Ministry and FDE] will introduce a range of co-curricular activities and non-assessed initiatives, providing children with opportunities for holistic development and exploration beyond traditional academic measures.\u201d\nThe FDE also used to offer scholarships to around 150 students annually, and students were given a nominal annual scholarship. As per an FDE official, the exam for eighth grade will continue to be held as per routine.\nMeanwhile, the ministry of education also notified the time-scale promotion of 529 FDE teachers who run schools and colleges. The meeting of the Departmental Promotion Committee (DPC) was held in January, but notification was issued on Monday. The teaching community appreciated Secretary Education for getting notification of their promotions.\n"

            "Text": "RAWALPINDI/ISLAMABAD: The tandoors in Rawalpindi division and Islamabad refused to comply with a government directive which reduced the price of Roti from Rs20 to Rs16 and Naan to Rs20 from Rs25, as they continued to sell it at its previous rates.\nThe price of Roti was reduced by the Punjab government on Sunday without the input of the Naanbai associations whereas the Islamabad administration reduced the price on Monday with immediate effect.\nDespite notifications, the price remained unchanged in almost all markets of the twin cities.\nResidents in Rawalpindi said that the announcement of the government was merely a publicity stunt since the order ignored the situation on the ground. The bakers claimed that the ex-mill price of flour and a recent exorbitant hike in gas prices made it difficult for them to comply with new rates.\n\nAssociation president says order can only be followed after subsidy; Pindi admin arrests two bakers, imposes hefty fines\n\nMohammad Rafique, a resident of Committee Chowk, said there was no reduction in the price of Naan in his area as he bought 10 Naans for Rs250. He said the government should implement the decision to bring down the prices.\nShahmir Khan, a resident of Chaudhry Bostan Khan Road, said the bakers did not accept the new rates and said they would sell the Roti and Naan at prices fixed by the local Naanbai association.\nWhen contacted, Deputy Commissioner Dr Hassan Waqar Cheema said that the new rates of Roti were notified and the order would be implemented within a day or two. He said the price magistrates had been asked to check the markets and bazaars and register cases against all those bakers who refused to accept the notified rates of Roti.\nHe said the price magistrates inspected 81 sites and imposed Rs105,000 fines on 28 bakers. He claimed that the district officials held a meeting with the Naanbai association in the afternoon and it was decided that new rates would be implemented on the directives of the Punjab government in letter and spirit.\nIslamabad reduces price\nOn the other hand, the capital administration on Monday fixed the price of Roti and Naan at Rs16 and Rs20, respectively. \nAccording to a notification issued by the office of the district magistrate, the price of a Roti weighing 120 grams each has been fixed at Rs16. Besides, the price of a Naan weighing 120 grams each has been fixed at Rs20. \nHowever, Roti is being sold between Rs20 and Rs25 in the capital. \nFor instance, in G-8, it is being sold at Rs20 whereas in E-11, it is being sold at Rs25. \nThe notification said the new rates would remain enforced till further orders, the notification said.\nIt added that contravention of the order will be punishable under Section 6 and 7 of Price Control, Prevention of Profiteering and Hoarding Act 1977 and West Pakistan Food Stuffs (Control) Act 1958\nAfter the issuance of the notification, the Secretariat assistant commissioner held a meeting with the Naanbai association and others to discuss the new price.\nIn June 2023, the capital administration fixed the price of Roti weighing 120 grams at Rs18, but the price of Naan remained unchanged.\nTaxila tandoors fail to comply\nIn Taxila, a similar situation prevailed as the tandoors refused to follow the new prices.\nA market survey by Dawn showed that tandoors in Taxila and Wah were selling the bread at the previous rate of Rs20.\nAll Pakistan Naanbai Association President Shafeeq Qureshi told Dawn that they were ready to follow the new rates if they were provided with subsidy. He said a 40-kilogramme bag of flour was available in the market for Rs1,250 while fine flour (maida) was available for Rs1,400 per 40kg.\nHe said the price could only be curtailed if there was a reduction in the ex-mill price. \nHe threatened to announce a shutter-down strike across the province if the district administration imposed a fine or arrest the Naanbais to forcefully implement the new rates through price magistrates.\n\u201cThe government needs to reduce the ex-mill price of the flour before we can provide relief to the public,\u201d said Wali Khan, Taxila\u2019s president of the Naanbai association\n\u201cWe will sell roti at Rs16 if the provincial government provides us flour at cheaper rates,\u201d he said, adding that the new rates would cause \u201chuge losses\u201d to tandoor owners.\n\u2014 Amjad Iqbal in Taxila also contributed to this report\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The committee tasked to revise the by-laws of the Capital Development Authority (CDA) to promote high-rise buildings in the capital held its first meeting on Monday, discussing various proposals to woo investors.\nThe meeting was presided over by CDA Member Engineering Dr Muhammad Khalid Hafiz and attended by director generals of planning, building and housing control, and officials of the finance and estate wings.\nThe meeting discussed various proposals and it was decided that a new policy would be formulated soon, which would be presented before the CDA board for approval.\nOn April 5, the director general of the building and housing control wing notified a six-member committee to be headed by the CDA member engineering.\nThe committee headed by the member engineering is tasked to review and propose amendments to the existing parameters, FAR (floor area ratio) for commercial buildings if deemed appropriate, review existing payment plans and procedures for auctioned plots, and suggest business-friendly measures in line with the policies adopted by other cities, such as Karachi and Lahore.\n\nInsiders claim amendments in payment plan, floor area ratio for commercial plots on the cards\n\nAccording to sources, the meeting held on Monday discussed various issues. As per the existing by-laws, the maximum allowed FAR is 1:10 for plots over 5000 square yards.\n \n \n\nThe participants were of the view that instead of the entire city, FAR should be increased in selective areas of the federal capital. Similarly, to make the commercial plots lucrative to investor, it also mulled increasing the payment plan from one year to three years.\n\u201cYes, various proposals came under discussion today; we discussed the future needs of the city, its available infrastructure, and resources. We also discussed that if 1:17 FAR is allowed across Islamabad, then what will be the status of traffic management and utilities, such as water,\u201d said a source. They added there should be some difference in the by-laws of Islamabad: the capital city and other cities.\nThe meeting did not reach a decision and proposals are likely to be finalised in the next sitting. It is relevant to note here after getting a lacklustre response in its auction of commercial plots in recent years, the CDA management had in principle decided to bring major policy changes to promote development and business activity as well as the high-rise buildings.\nSources said the government and the CDA management were planning to increase the payment plan for commercial plots from one year to three years. It is also planning to increase the floor area ratio to 1:16.\nSimilarly, there is also a proposal to give possession to developers after getting 50 per cent payment, instead of 100 per cent. Sources said that during the last two years, the CDA could not attract investors during the auction of commercial plots. In contrast, the central business district in Lahore has been an attractive opportunity for investors across Pakistan, including Islamabad.\nIn light of such policy measures, the investors are moving to Lahore from Islamabad, claimed sources.\nFormer president of Islamabad Developer Association Chaudhry Naseer Ahmed told Dawn that the developers had been advocating changes to the CDA by-laws for years to make them investor-friendly.\nMeanwhile, Real Estate Association President Sardar Tahir Mehmood said that his association had been asking the CDA to amend the by-laws for the past six months at least. \u201cWe also wrote a letter on March 20 in this regard,\u201d he said, urging the CDA to do the needful.\n"

He was rushed to CMH Muzaffarabad after preliminary treatment at a local facility.\nThe body of the woman was recovered by villagers some 500 metres away, but the young girl could not be found till late evening, Mr Ayoub said.\nThe Rantha Galli stream merges into the roaring Jagran nullah after one or so kilometres away from the site of the tragedy and after seven kilometres from there the Jagran nullah merges into Neelum River in the town of Kundal Shahi.\nMr Ayoub feared that the girl\u2019s body might have been flown by Jagran nullah into the swollen Neelum River.\nHe said as a result of heavy rains, almost all water channels in most parts of the valley had flooded, posing serious risks to the adjacent properties and inhabitants. \nIn the other incident, a 60 years old man, identified as Mir Abdullah, drowned in a water channel in Lawat village when he was returning home from a mosque after Maghrib prayers. \nThe man slipped in the mud and fell into the stream. Though fellow villagers pulled him out of the channel in a short while but did not survive, Mr Ayoub said. \nUnrelenting rains had also triggered landslides along the main Neelum valley road at several places, blocking traffic beyond Shaikh Bela, some151km northeast of here and 5km before the town of Kel, he said, adding that the highways department personnel were braving harsh weather to keep it open for traffic, he said.\nIn response to a question, Mr Ayoub said at least 15,000 tourists were still present in the valley and they had been advised not to leave their respective accommodations until the weather condition improved.\nMeanwhile, the hoteliers and local residents in the valley had offered free accommodation and free meals to tourists who had run out of money due to prolonged stay in the area. \nIn Muzaffarabad, Saeed Qureshi, a senior director at the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA), told Dawn that four persons, identified as Mubashar Hussain, Zahida Bibi, Mehar Ali Shah and Noor Hussain, had sustained injuries in rain-related incidents in Patikka areas of district Muzaffarabad. In the same area, he said, three houses and a cattle pen were destroyed and as many houses were partially damaged by heavy rains.\nElsewhere, 11 houses were partially damaged in district Bagh and one house was partially damaged in district Jhelum Valley, he said.\nOf the inter-provincial roads, Mr Qureshi said the Muzaffarabad-Islamabad road via Kohala was open for all kinds of traffic but the Muzaffarabad-Mansehra road via Lohar Galli was closed due to the huge landslide at Lohar Galli.\nHowever, small vehicles were being diverted to the alternative route of Shaheed Galli to travel to Mansehra and beyond, he said.\n"

            "Text": "TOBA TEK SINGH: Another man who was burnt in a gas cylinder blast at Jhang about a week back succumbed to his injuries at hospital, taking the death toll of the incident to five. \nHafiz Ali was among 14 people who were burnt in the liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinder blast near Ayub Chowk on the Chiniot Road. Four persons had previously died in the incident.  \nIn another incident on Monday, a youth allegedly killed himself at Gojra.  \nAli Raza (18), the son of Khalid Pervez, a resident of the Government Low Income Housing Colony, hanged himself from a ceiling fan at his house over unknown reasons. Gojra City police shifted the body to the tehsil headquarters (THQ) hospital for autopsy. \nIn a robbery incident in Faisalabad, robbers shot two persons on resistance near Pipanwala Chowk on the Canal Road. Two motorcyclists intercepted Arsalan Tariq (19) and Abdul Rehman (20) to rob them at gunpoint but they offered resistance. At this, the suspects opened fire on them, leaving them wounded. Both the injured were shifted to the District Headquarters (DHQ) Hospital. \nKASHMIRI WOMAN: The woman who allegedly was kidnapped from Khulana, a village in the locality of Chakothi police of the Hattian Bala district of Azad Kashmir, told the Toba police that she was 13-year-old when she was abducted in the earthquake of 2005. \nAsia Bibi said one Ghulam Mustafa Kamhar had kidnapped her and brought her to Jhang. He kept her at his house for two years and later sold her to an aged man, Allah Yar, of village Shahpur. Allah Yar contracted a marriage with her and she faced a lot of mistreatment from him.  \nEarlier in her video on social media, Asia had disclosed the names of her father, mother and maternal uncle were Raja Bashir, Nasim Bibi and Raja Abdul Rehman, respectively. The video reached her family and they approached police for action.  \nDistrict police spokesperson said Asia was staying temporarily at Darul Aman on the order of Pirmahal Magistrate Mudassar Maqsood and she would later hand over to Chakothi police.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: Projecting stagnant tax-to-GDP ratios over the next five years, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Wednesday estimated Pakistan\u2019s fiscal deficit \u2014 the gap between total resources and expenditures \u2014 for the current fiscal year at 7.4 per cent of GDP, almost 1pc higher than 6.5pc target set by the federal government.\nOn the positive side, however, the fund anticipates a gradual decline in debt-to-GDP ratios and general government expenditures over the medium term. Also, the primary fiscal balance has been estimated to remain 0.4 to 0.5pc of GDP over the next five years, compared to a 0.9pc primary deficit in FY23.\nThe centre had estimated the overall fiscal deficit at Rs6.9 trillion for the current fiscal year (6.53pc of GDP) on the anticipation that provinces would offer Rs600bn surplus to scale down the federal deficit otherwise estimated at Rs7.5tr or 7.1pc of GDP. The IMF had previously projected the fiscal deficit at 7.6pc of GDP in October last year but has since revised it to 7.4pc, apparently based on the latest data shared by the government last month as part of a quarterly review.\n \n \n\nIn its fiscal monitor released on Wednesday as part of spring meetings of the IMF and the World Bank currently in progress in Washington, the fund forecast fiscal deficit declining 7.3pc of GDP in FY25 \u2014 significantly higher than its 6.9pc forecast made in October last year. In the same direction, the IMF made upward adjustments in deficit estimates for Pakistan.\n\nIMF says revenues to stay stagnant despite falling expenditures in five years\n\nIn doing so, the fund forecast a 5.8pc fiscal deficit for FY26, followed by 5.1pc in FY27 and staying at 4.6pc in FY28 and FY29. In October last year, the IMF predicted Pakistan\u2019s fiscal deficit to be 6.9pc in FY25, 5.4pc in FY26, 4.4pc in FY27 and 4.4pc in FY28.\nThe fiscal monitor for April 2024 also put primary budget surplus \u2014 the difference between revenues and expenditures excluding interest payments \u2014 at 0.4pc of GDP for FY24, followed by 0.5pc in FY25 and then staying stable at 0.4pc over the next three consecutive years and again at 0.5pc in FY29. In October last, the IMF had pitched a primary deficit for FY23 at 1.2pc of GDP compared to 0.5pc claimed by the government, which turned out to be a 0.9pc deficit, according to the latest statement of the IMF.\nReferring to the revenue side, the IMF projected general government revenue to be  12.5pc of GDP for the current fiscal year ending June 30, up from 11.4pc last year. The fiscal monitor predicts general government revenue at 12.4pc for the next two fiscal years, FY25 and FY26, 12.3pc in the following two years, FY27 and FY28, and then back to 12.4pc in FY29.\nThe fund has not changed its revenue-to-GDP ratio estimates for all these years.\nOn the expenditure front, the fiscal monitor estimates general government expenditure at 19.9pc of GDP for FY24, significantly higher than 19.2pc in FY23. It then anticipates a gradual yearly decline over the medium term as debt servicing costs ease. The general expenditure will drop to 19.6pc in FY25), followed by 18.1pc in FY26, 17.5pc in FY27, 17pc in FY28 and 16.9pc in FY29. The fund has slightly revised its previous forecasts about the expenditure to GDP ratio by 0.2 to 0.3pc for these years.\nFalling govt debts\nLikewise, the IMF expects the gross government debt to ease down to 71.8pc of GDP at the end of the current fiscal year from 77.1pc last year. It anticipates a declining trend, but more is needed to eliminate vicious violations of the Fiscal Responsibility & Debt Limitation Act (FDRLA), which seeks to ensure that debt always remains below 60pc of GDP.\nThe IMF projects the gross government debt-to-GDP ratio to come down to 69.4pc next year, followed by 68.4pc in FY26 and 66.8pc in FY27. The debt is expected to drop to 64.8pc in FY28 and 63.1pc in FY29.\nThe fund noted that Pakistan would be among the economies with relatively high deficit levels and projected to undergo rapid fiscal consolidation over the medium term.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: Despite 79 per cent of power generation coming from cheaper local fuels, the government has sought clearance from the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) to extract about Rs23 billion additional in fuel cost adjustment (FCA) from consumers for electricity consumed in March.\nThe Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) \u2014 a subsidiary of the Power Division \u2014 has demanded Rs2.94 per unit additional fuel cost to recover from consumers through May bills. \nThe proposed additional FCA is almost 46pc higher than the pre-fixed fuel cost of Rs6.44 per unit already charged to consumers in March. This raises questions about the power sector bureaucracy\u2019s capabilities to forecast fuel costs even for 6-7 months. In recent months, the additional FCAs have ranged between 50 and 115pc higher than the pre-determined fuel costs notified at the start of the current fiscal year.\n\nNepra to consider petition for Rs2.94 per unit FCA rise on 26th\n\nThis FCA is on top of about a 26pc increase in the annual base tariff and another 10pc hike under the quarterly tariff adjustment currently in place and being charged to consumers at Rs2.75 per unit. As a result, consumers continue to pay excessive bills despite lower consumption patterns. This was despite more than 79pc of electricity coming from cheaper local resources. Nepra has accepted the request for a public hearing on April 26.\nThe higher proposed FCA for March is apparently mainly due to higher domestic coal and gas prices, although the use of imported fuels like coal, diesel, and furnace oil remained zero. LNG was relatively cheaper, and the exchange rate remained stable.\nIn a petition, the CPPA, acting as commercial agent of Discos, demanded an additional FCA of Rs2.94 per unit in the May bills for electricity consumed in March. It claimed that the reference fuel cost for March was Rs6.44 per unit, but the actual fuel cost rose to Rs9.38 per unit. The average fuel cost in February also stood at about Rs9.42 per unit. It said about 8,023-gigawatt-hour (GWh) of electricity was generated at an estimated fuel expenditure of Rs66.7bn (Rs8.3 per unit) in March, of which 7,756 GWh energy was delivered to Discos at the cost of Rs72.67bn (at Rs9.38 per unit).\nThe data showed declining consumption trends. The consumption in March was also 8.3pc lower than same month (8,459Gwh) last year. The Rs2.94 per unit FCA for March this year is more than double the Rs1.17 per unit FCA of same month last year.\nThis included the biggest share of hydropower at 28pc in March against its 25pc share in February. Hydropower has no fuel cost.\n"

Allowing them to proceed to Islamabad was not a proper decision,\u201d the report says, adding that then-Punjab law minister Rana Sanaullah remained conspicuous by his refusal to appear before the commission, or answer any of its questions, either in writing or otherwise.\n \n \n\nAs per its terms of reference, the commission was asked to \u201cinquire into any illegal financial and/or other support provided to TLP for the sit-in; recommend action against those who issued edicts or fatwas during or in relation to the Faizabad sit-in\u2026 determine violation, if any, of the law and the liability incurred by any person or public office holders, [and] fix responsibility of any person and/or government officers, including those working with intelligence agencies\u201d.\n\n\u2018Theoretical\u2019 report blames Punjab govt for allowing protesters into capital; deplores weak command and coordination between security agencies, police\n\nHowever, a review of the commission\u2019s TORs and background conversations with sources privy to the commission\u2019s workings suggest that its report is silent on many questions it was supposed to answer, being described by one insider as being \u201ctheoretical\u201d in its nature.\nIn addition, the report notes a failure to implement aspects of the National Action Plan (NAP), highlights gaps in the capacity of law enforcement agencies and points out deviations from standard operating procedures (SOPs) that led to a lack of coordination between security agencies and the federal and Punjab governments.\nAccording to the report, the federal government gave Inter-Services Intelligence the go-ahead to negotiate with protesters, and assigned the Rangers DG to lead an operation against them. However, the eventual law enforcement action against TLP demonstrators \u2014 which went south, resulting in around seven deaths and over 250 casualties to police and FC personnel \u2014 was led by the Islamabad inspector general.\nThis also raises a legal question: under the laws of the land, armed forces are supposed to act \u201cin aid of civil power\u201d. As such, leading any law enforcement operation falls to the civil administration, which consists of the district magistrate, chief commissioner and police chief.\nThe report notes that Islamabad police launched an operation to disperse protesters in compliance with the directives of the Islamabad High Court, but \u201cfailed due to a lack of coordination between Rawalpindi and Islamabad police\u201d, adding that this also indicated the inability of the Rawalpindi administration and police to block reinforcements to the protesters.\n\u201cWeak command and control was observed at the senior level,\u201d the report noted, referring to a lack of coordination between police in Punjab and Islamabad, and observed that multiple forces doing the same job within the territorial jurisdiction nullify the concept of unity of command.\n\u201cThere must be one force, that is police, to deal with issues of law and order and resources spent on others may be diverted to Islamabad police\u2026 Rangers and Frontier Constabulary have been raised for patrolling border areas, therefore, their use in urban areas may be avoided,\u201d it observed.\n"

He said the report was not credible because both the main characters in the episode did not appear in front of the commission to answer its questions for the report, an apparent reference to former army chief retired Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa and then-ISI DG (C) retired Lt Gen Faiz Hameed.\n\u201cWhy were these people not presented? Their absence makes this report incomplete,\u201d the minister said, adding that the pair had \u201call sorts of power\u201d during the period under investigation by the commission.\nSeparately, former Senate chairman and veteran PPP leader Raza Rabbani called the report \u201ca non-starter\u201d.\n\u201cIt chose to close the matter while avoiding further controversy and avoided to fix any responsibility, Mr Rabbani noted, adding: \u201cIt has tried to shift the burden on the civilian government of Punjab, exonerating the then DGs of Rangers and ISI.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the PTI called on the chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) to make the Faizabad dharna commission report public and issue orders regarding the execution of the commission\u2019s recommendations in order to bring the culprits to justice.\nThe party has demanded the apex court to issue orders to register criminal cases against Shehbaz Sharif and his cabinet in view of the recommendations of the commission.\n"

Flash floods in the area also affected the Quetta-Taftan highway, disrupting traffic.\nTraffic was suspended bet\u00adw\u00adeen Harnai-Sanjavi-Ziarat due to badly damaged inter-district roads, leaving residents stra\u00adn\u00added without road access to Qu\u00ad\u00adetta or other areas.

Rafique and the victims\u2019 family were close relatives, and there had been ongoing family disputes between the parties.\nOn July 16, 2022, complainant Shazia Kashif, her husband Kashif Majeed, her sister-in-law Farzana, and her mother-in-law Zubaida Bibi returned home in Latifabad colony after appearing in a family court. At home, Rafique suddenly appeared and opened fire, killing Kashif and Farzana on the spot and injuring Zubaida Bibi, who later died in hospital.\nAt the same time, Farzana\u2019s sister Maryam tried to save Zubaida but was also shot at and injured. Both were referred to Sahiwal DHQ Hospital from DHQ City Hospital.\nThe court handed down death sentence to Rafique on three counts for the intentional murders of Kashif Majeed, Farzana and Zubaida. \nThe sentence is subject to confirmation by the Lahore High Court. The court ordered Rafique to pay Rs1m to the legal heirs of each deceased, and if he fails to pay the fine, he will serve an additional six-month simple imprisonment.\nRafique was also sentenced to seven years of rigorous imprisonment under section 324 of the PPC and fined Rs0.2m for injuring Maryam Bibi.

However, the judge granted a seven-day physical remand of both in another case related to photo-copied documents presented by the prosecution for investigation.\nMs Javed\u2019s father, speaking to reporters outside the court, accused the prosecution of ethical and legal violations. He said the documents, purportedly linking the accused to the May 9 incident, were actually related to events in March 2023, held outside Zaman Park, and were neither distributed nor communicated on May 9 in Mianwali by either Ms Hamza or Ms Javed.  \nHe said the jail superintendent, under the influence of powerful entities, was illegally denying food to the detainees, leading them to embark on a hunger strike for the past four days.  \nThe judge directed the jail authorities to ensure that food items, as per the jail manual, are provided by the inmates\u2019 families.\nBoth women activists remain detained at the Sargodha District Jail for further investigation by Mianwali police, with a scheduled presentation in court next Wednesday. \nMs Javed\u2019s father said both women endure these hardships to convey their dedication to the freedom of the younger generation.\nMURDERED: Brothers Azam Tariq and Qaiser, of Chak 171/168-NB in Sillanwali, were abducted by armed men while en route to submit their father Nazar Abbas\u2019s death certificate at the union council office.  \nArmed assailants Tahir and others intercepted them at gunpoint. Later, they shot and killed the brothers near village Sobhaga before fleeing the scene.  \nHajira Batul, mother of the victims, lodged a complaint, leading to the registration of a case against Tahir, Shani, Farhan, Muhammad Ramzan, Tasawar, Faisal, and Allah Bakhsh. After post-mortem, the police handed over the bodies to the heirs.\nHONOUR KILLING: Shafqatullah Sago of Thal village allegedly murdered his 22-year-old wife, Nagina, of Chakwal, on suspicions of her extra-marital affair, and declared her death as suicide.  \nHowever, visible signs of violence on her body revealed the crime.  \nThe police are looking into the case.\nSUSPENDED: Commissioner and Municipal Corporation (MC) Administrator Muhammad Ajmal Bhatti has suspended five officials for negligence in their official duties.  \nIssuing a stern warning to all building inspectors, rent inspectors, and accountants, Mr Bhatti urged them to improve their performance within a week.  \nHe said that persistent underperformance would lead to further consequences, possibly including the surrender of accountants. \nRecognising exemplary work, Mr Bhatti awarded certificates of appreciation to two recovery officials and ordered the promotion of one.  \nDuring a performance review meeting at his conference room, the chief officer presented branch-wise performance details. Mr Bhatti instructed to disconnect water and sewage services for users with outstanding bills, take legal action against illegal constructions and connections, and file cases accordingly. He sought performance reports of building inspectors, warning of consequences for those failing to meet standards.  \nHe ordered a renewed crackdown on encroachments and instructed a timeline for removing cattle from the city. He also urged for thorough rent recoveries from shops and lease properties and announced weekly meetings to review MC officers\u2019 performance, with rewards and penalties determined accordingly.\n"

Definitely, the momentum we gained in New Zealand will also count. \n\u201cWe know we can beat good teams, and our preparation has been terrific.\u201d\nNida was confident the resources she has at her disposal would be enough for Pakistan to put up a good show against the West Indies. She was especially in awe of all-rounder Fatima Sana, hailing her all-round abilities.\n\u201cOur spinners and especially Fatima, have very good records,\u201d said the Pakistan skipper. \u201cFatima has excellent records in ODIs, and she\u2019s also been the ICC Emerging Player of the Year. \n\u201cOur spin attack has been strong from the start, while our fast bowlers are doing a great job as well.\u201d\nWest Indies captain Hailey Matthews believed the team needed to improve their show with the bat, as they languished at the ninth place in the Women\u2019s Cham\u00adpionship table.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s been evident in our past year two that we probably haven\u2019t scored as many runs as we would have wanted to,\u201d she said. \u201cBut at the same time, it\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been working on a whole lot throughout our regional competition and throughout training camps as well. \n\u201cI think when we look at the teams we faced in the championship as well, we\u2019ve had a lot of the higher-ranked teams to play against. \nSo hoping that we can go out there and really put up some good performances and, yeah, I guess be able to gain some points off of the teams that are more closely right to us.\u201d\nPAKISTAN: Nida Dar (captain), Aliya Riaz, Bismah Maroof, Diana Baig, Fatima Sana, Muneeba Ali, Najiha Alvi (wicket-keeper), Nashra Sundhu, Natalia Parvaiz, Sadaf Shamas, Sadia Iqbal, Sidra Amin, Sidra Nawaz (wicket-keeper), Tuba Hassan, Umm-e-Hani, Waheeda Akhtar\nWEST INDIES: Hayley Matthews (captain), Shemaine Campbelle (vice-captain), Aaliyah Alleyne, Afy Fletcher, Chedean Nation, Cherry Ann Fraser, Chinelle Henry, Jannillea Glasgow, Karishma Ramharack, Kate Wilmott, Qiana Joseph, Rashada Williams, Shamilia Connell, Stafanie Taylor, Zaida James\n"

            "Text": "RAWALPINDI: While declaring that Pakistan are targeting this year\u2019s T20 World Cup on the eve of the home series against New Zealand, reappointed captain Babar Azam on Wednesday said currently no player is a sure selection for the global event.\n\u201cAll the players in our system have emerged on the basis of their performance. The New Zealand [T20] series is a step towards the World Cup [preparations] for which we have made our mindset. And we are going to play [all] the coming series while keeping the primary focus on the World Cup,\u201d Babar told reporters during a pre-match news conference at the Pindi Cricket Stadium.\nPakistan face a second-string New Zealand side, led by Michael Bracewell, in the first of a five-match T20 series in Rawalpindi on Thursday. After the New Zealand series, Pakistan are scheduled to undertake T20 tours to Ireland (May 10-14) and England (May 22-30) before Babar and his men launch the all-important campaign of the World Cup being held in the US and the Caribbean in June.\nAnswering a question regarding the familiar problem of meeting a certain run-rate at crucial stages which Pakistan have faced in recent World Cups, Babar said that the players are trying to improve on weak areas.\n\u201cWe have 12 T20 Internationals lined up [including four against England and three against Ireland] before the World Cup. After the Pakistan Super League [held in February-March] we had a break and then regathered for a fitness camp in Kakul. While trying to identify our lackings, we are learning from our mistakes something which we will implement in the World Cup,\u201d the 29-year-old Babar, who was re-installed as Pakistan\u2019s white-ball captain last month by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), said.\nOn whether the World Cup squad will be composed of the players picked for the New Zealand series or otherwise, Babar was very much explicit in saying that the places for the June 1-29 global event are still up for grabs but at the same time also sounded unsure on the subject.\n\u201cThere is sometime before the World Cup squad is announced, even after the squad is named there will be time to make [final] changes. Though the team [composition] will be more or less remain same, but you never know. [Currently] no player is 100 percent sure of his selection. For the World Cup, the best players will be selected,\u201d a tentative-looking Babar said.\nReplying to a question on his batting position, Babar who will play his first game for Pakistan after being re-installed as skipper, said that the team set-up is being kept \u201cflexible\u201d.\n\u201cWe are keeping things flexible, and will be using different team combinations in the lead-up to the World Cup in batting as well as bowling. Youngsters will get [appropriate] chances to show their mettle,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe [team combination-related] things will be clearer for us in the Ireland and England series.\u201d\nReplying to a query on Pakistan\u2019s batting fragility particularly in the middle and late order, Babar said that the present squad has the players, both junior as well as senior, to deliver.\n\u201cWe have inducted [uncapped batters] Usman Khan and Irfan Khan Niazi both of whom did well in the last PSL. Then we have Iftikhar Ahmed, Azam Khan and Shadab Khan plus [returning all-rounder] Imad Wasim, all of them strengthen our batting,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI always hope all my players to perform. And we, the senior players, back the junior ones to deliver.\u201d\nA controversy emerged following the out-of-the-blue removal of T20 captain Shaheen Shah Afridi who was replaced with Babar after just one series, which Pakistan lost 4-1 in January. \nResponding to a question on his bonding with Shaheen, Babar said that his relationship with the left-arm pacer was as strong as ever.\n\u201cWhatever information I receive [on this subject] comes from you [media]. On my part, I would say that there is nothing wrong in our relationship which is very old. We all support each other in the team,\u201d Babar stated.\n\u201cThe only aim for all of us is to deliver our best for Pakistan\u2019s victory. In our team, no one thinks individually, all players are positive and work towards the team\u2019s goals.\u201d\n\u2018INTERESTING CHALLENGE\u2019\nMeanwhile, stand-in captain Bracewell said playing in Pakistan conditions is a challenge for his side which is missing several key players for the series against Babar and company for different reasons. \nFirst-choice New Zealand players including Trent Boult, Devon Conway, Lockie Ferguson, Matt Henry, Daryl Mitchell, Glenn Phillips, Rachin Ravindra, Mitch Santner and Kane Williamson are presently engaged in the Indian Premier League. Will Young is pursuing an overseas deal with Nottinghamshire, Tom Latham is awaiting the birth of his second child while Tim Southee is currently resting.\n\u201cYes, I think that\u2019s an interesting challenge of international cricket. You get to different places around the world and you\u2019ve got to be quick to adjust to the new conditions and I think that will be a great challenge for us as coming in here and getting our feet on the ground pretty quickly and getting used to the conditions here in Pakistan,\u201d Bracewell told reporters during his presser on Wednesday. \n\u201cBut yes it has to be enough time we\u2019ve got to go out and play an international game tomorrow so we\u2019ll be ready to go come 7:30 tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously a huge challenge coming up against a full-strength Pakistan side. They\u2019re a great T20 side and they showed that in the [T20] World Cup last time so I think the there was a few guys missing from this series when New Zealand played Pakistan this time last year and I think that that series showed that we can compete against these guys.\n\u201cTwo-all was a pretty fair result in the end. Therefore, I think as a group we\u2019re expecting to come here and play some really good cricket and we expect Pakistan to do the same. so yeah hopefully there\u2019s no washouts this time and we can see a winner.\nOn the Pindi Cricket Stadium which will host the opener today, Bracewell said, \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a great place to play cricket and it looks like it\u2019s going to be a good wicket out there as well.\u201d\nSquads:\nPAKISTAN: Babar Azam (captain), Abrar Ahmed, Azam Khan, Fakhar Zaman, Iftikhar Ahmed, Imad Wasim, Mohammad Abbas Afridi, Mohammad Rizwan, Mohmmad Amir, Mohammad Irfan Khan Niazi, Naseem Shah, Saim Ayub, Shadab Khan, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Usama Mir, Usman Khan, Zaman Khan\nNEW ZEALAND: Michael Bracewell (captain), Tom Blundell, Mark Chapman, Josh Clarkson, Jacob Duffy, Dean Foxcroft, Ben Lister, Cole McConchie, Jimmy Neesham, Will O\u2019Rourke, Tim Robinson, Ben Sears, Tim Seifert, Ish Sodhi, Zak Foulkes.\n"

However, practically, only landlords governed this relationship and enjoyed all rights under the law while peasants remained poor and marginalised, he said.\nThe peasants never benefited from subsidies the government provided during floods and in the event of rise in inflation and equally suffered losses in production whereas only landlords were paid compensation, he said.\nThe gathering was told that the appeal was filed in January 2020 and then agriculture minister Ismail Rahu had confirmed the government would not pursue the appeal against the judgement in the apex court. But Sindh government, on the other hand, continued to fight the case till April 2023, he said.\nThe HWA received a copy of government\u2019s plea which revealed the government had no concerns for the rights of peasants and rural workers and it was rather pursuing anti-peasant rights policies that aided repressive feudal system and structure, he said.\nSujag Women Hari Trade Union\u2019s president Habib Khatoon said that lack of enforcement of law deprived peasants and rural workers of protection and welfare, exacerbating difficulties in accessing land and getting fair treatment in their relationship with landowners. \nShe shared some cases about landlords\u2019 ill-treatment of peasants her organisation had gathered in September 2023 and said that a landlord in Mirpurkhas attempted rape of a peasant girl and in Larkana a landlord allegedly murdered peasants.\nShe said that a landlord dispossessed peasants in Mithi in August and police lodged fake case against peasants in Dadu and later occupied their lands at the behest of an influential landlord. In Benazirabad, a landlord was allegedly involved in attempted rape of a peasant girl, she said.\nShe said that a landlord had allegedly killed a peasant in November in Mirpur\u00adkhas, a peasant\u2019s sons were abducted over repayment of debt in Badin district \nand a landlord had allegedly kidnapped three daughters and their mother in Naushahro Feroze. Scores of peasants were forcibly evicted by landlords in other districts, she said.\n"

Even the most prominent poets like Dr Allama Iqbal and Sufi Ghulam Mustafa Tabassum had written for children, which only a few people knew about and read, he said. \nHe said that all creative writers must write for children and their creations should have elements of education, entertainment and knowledge in order to entertain and educate children. Ustad Dayo\u2019s storybook had all the three ingredients, he said. \nProf Mukhtiar Samo, writer and founder of Knowledge Centre, said that Sindh\u2019s educational institutions had failed in exposing children to the world of literature due to lack of libraries. If there was a library, it was not fully equipped or functional and was short of literary books, he regretted. \nHe said that whatever scanty literature was produced for children in Sindh was not reaching their targeted readership. The children in remote areas and countryside of Sindh had no access at all to literary books. In addition, closed, partially functional and destroyed primary and middle-level schools in flood-hit, tribal feuds-ridden and dacoits-infested areas had deprived children of even basic education, not to speak of literature, he said.  \nHe praised Ustad Dayo\u2019s efforts for the promotion of children\u2019s literature and said his book on stories and poetry had always been an interesting read for children. \nUstad Dayo, the author, said: \u201cWhatever I have written for children have been done with honesty and with the aim of betterment of children so that they read it, learn lessons and develop reading habit\u201d. \nHe thanked the appreciation of his work and vowed to continue it in future as well. \nMumtaz Lohar, short story writer and poet, said that it was good to write fiction and poetry for children but writers were also encouraged to pen profiles of exceptional children who excelled in their studies, art and creativity. \nProf Jahangir Abbasi, fiction writer and translator, said that many prominent writers had started writing for children but later gave up the idea and limited their writings to grown-up readers only. He urged them to resume contributing to children\u2019s literature.\n"

The police arrested Darkhshan SHO Ali Raza Leghari and head moharir Faisal Leghari and registered a murder case against them.\nOn Wednesday, the investigating officer (IO) brought the held suspects before Judicial Magistrate Mazhar Ali and requested for their 14-day physical remand for further investigation. However, the court remanded the suspects in police custody till April 21 and directed the IO to produce them in court on the next date.\nRepresenting held SHO Ali Raza, Advocate Salahuddin Panhwar appeared before the magistrate and informed him that SP-Clifton Nayyar-ul-Hassan took the victim from Darkhshan police station to a private location where he was allegedly subjected to torture and subsequently died.\nAdvocate Panhwar told Dawn that he informed the magistrate that Sub-Inspector Sanaullah Soomro had arrested the suspect Naeem in connection with an extortion case. But after his death, the SP attempted to \u2018manipulate\u2019 the situation by claiming that the suspect died of a heart attack.\nIt may be noted that SP Nayyer was transferred by Karachi police chief Imran Yaqoob Minhas on the same day when suspect Naeem died in police custody.\nAlso on Wednesday, Junaid, son of deceased Naeem, was also brought before the magistrate after completion of his initial remand period in the same extortion case in which his father was arrested.\nDuring the proceeding held inside the judge\u2019s chamber, Barrister Zainul Abideen filed an application on behalf of the legal heirs of the deceased to assist the prosecution.\nHe argued on behalf of suspect Junaid that the police did not obtain a warrant to arrest his client. He contended that it was merely a monetary dispute between Naeem and complainant Abdul Basit. He claimed that the police first apprehended his client and then registered the FIR.\nThe IO sought an extension in Junaid\u2019s police remand but the court sent him to prison on judicial remand.\n"

            "Text": "IT looks like it\u2019s not yet over for Kamran Tessori. Having support from all stakeholders in the past, it appears he still has his charms, although rumours are rife about his imminent departure from the palatial Sindh Governor House and even his own associates believe he\u2019s still in deep water.\nThe businessman-turned-politician was appointed the Sindh governor in October 2022 as a nominee of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) as a result of a power-sharing agreement between his party and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N).\nAfter the Feb 8 general elections and formation of the Shehbaz Sharif-led federal government, it was agreed between the PML-N and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) that the governors of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab would be from the PPP while the governors of Sindh and Balochistan would be from PML-N. Later, the PML-N decided to give the governor\u2019s post to its coalition partner the MQM-P.\nDuring talks with the PML-N after the elections, the MQM-P had made clear to it that it was not interested in replacing Mr Tessori. However, it was the PPP which asked the PML-N to remove the incumbent Sindh governor.\n\nMQM-P says federal govt hasn\u2019t asked for change of governor or appointment of a new one in Sindh, at any level\n\nSources said that President Asif Zardari was reportedly not happy with Governor Tessori due to some of his actions during the caretaker set-up in the province and he had conveyed to the PML-N and powerful quarters that a new governor must be appointed in Sindh.\nEarlier this month, the PPP took a firm stand against governor Tessori. First, PPP-Sindh General Secretary Waqar Mehdi issued a hard-hitting statement, accusing Mr Tessori of widening the gulf between urban and rural population of Sindh and demanding his removal. Then, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab fired a salvo that the decision to replace the incumbent governor had already been taken but the implementation was delayed due to Ramazan.\nWhile the PML-N kept mum, the PPP\u2019s opposition to Mr Tessori casts doubts about his future.\nSeveral names have sprung up, including ex-MQM MNA and senator Khushbakht Shujaat, Senator-elect Faisal Vawda, former law minister Dr Farogh Nasim and ex-chairman of Board of Investment Azfar Ahsan as potential successor of the incumbent governor. Former caretaker chief minister and retired Justice Maqbool Baqar is the latest addition in the long list of names.\nThe sources said that initially, the MQM-P had itself considered the idea of replacing Mr Tessori but the hard-hitting statements by the PPP against him compelled the party to take a firm position in his favour.\nWhen contacted, a spokesperson for the Sindh governor told Dawn: \u201cThe MQM-P has given only Kamran Tessori\u2019s name [to the PML-N to retain him as the governor] and if any other name comes up, it will not be from the MQM-P.\u201d\nWhen Dawn approached the MQM-P about the future of Mr Tessori, a party spokesperson claimed that the federal government had not contacted the party at any level regarding the change of the Sindh governor or the appointment of a new governor in Sindh.\n\u201cWe have only learned about these discussions through the media. If we are officially contacted on this matter, we will provide a position after consulting internally, but for now, any speculation is premature,\u201d he said.\nWhen asked to comment on whether the party was considering Khushbakht Shujaat, Faisal Vawda, Azfar Ahsan or Farogh Nasim as Mr Tessori\u2019s replacement, the spokesperson said: \u201cWhen the federal government has not contacted MQM-Pakistan regarding the change of the governor, and based on our information, no such decision is imminent, then we have no intention of proposing or discussing any alternative names for the governor of Sindh.\u201d\nHowever, a senior MQM-P leader, privy to the internal discussions about Mr Tessori\u2019s fate, told Dawn that the incumbent governor was still in hot water. \u201cI think we have to make a decision soon,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe governor has stirred a hornet\u2019s nest when he played a proactive role in the affairs of the Sindh bureaucracy during the caretaker government. Besides, his decision to turn [part of] Governor House into an IT learning centre does not bode well for many and it seems he is paying the price of his popularity,\u201d the leader said.\nRegarding potential candidates, he said Khushbakht Shujaat chose not to contest Feb 8 general elections from the platform of the MQM-P, despite the fact that she was asked to file her nomination papers from the Clifton-Defence National Assembly constituency (NA-241). \u201cShe has not been seen in any important party activity for quite some time\u2026I don\u2019t know whether she\u2019s still with us or not,\u201d he added.\nHowever, the MQM-P spokesperson, when asked about Ms Shujaat\u2019s status in the party, said: \u201cFormer Senator Khushbakht Shujaat remains in touch with us, just as she has been in the past.\u201d\nMeanwhile, it seems it\u2019s business as usual for the governor as he administered the oath to the newly inducted members of Murad Ali Shah-led Sindh cabinet, chaired a meeting of business community and met Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab at the Governor House on Wednesday.\n"

However, he sought time to get instructions from the respondents.\nThe petitioners\u2019 lawyers argued that a huge fine could be imposed on social media platforms carrying misinformation and false news and the service providers were bound to issue a notice before shutting down a social media platform seeking a response, failing which the relevant platform can be closed.\nAdvocate Jaferii pointed out that before the emergence of the interior ministry\u2019s Feb 17 letter, the PTA had even refused to admit the closure of X and the federal law officers used to mislead the court about the platform\u2019s functioning through virtual private networks (VPNs).\nThe SHC chief justice said the institutions and courts were there for the benefit of the people and the supremacy of the Constitution. He noted that no justification had so far been produced in court for banning X.\nHe said the interior ministry must come up with reasons for writing a letter to the PTA for shutting down X or to rescind its Feb 17 letter; otherwise, the court will pass an appropriate order in the next hearing on May 9.\nThe bench was hearing a set of identical petitions filed against the suspension of mobile internet and broadband services during and before general elections, as well as the outage of social media platforms, including X, across the country.\nAt the previous hearing, the interior ministry informed the SHC that the social media platform X was blocked in February till further orders on the reports of intelligence agencies.\nIn its earlier interim order, the SHC directed the respondents to ensure the provision of smooth and uninterrupted internet services, as well as access to social media platforms, unless relevant laws were invoked and also specifically ordered to restore X if there was no justification or reasonable grounds for its closure.\n\u2018Ban necessary to protect national integrity\u2019\nMeanwhile, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) received a detailed report from Interior Secretary Khurram Agha on Wednesday, defending the temporary suspension of X citing national interest and security concerns.\nThe report, submitted before IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq, said the social media platform was not registered in Pakistan nor was it under any obligation to comply with Pakistani laws.\nIt claimed that X had \u201cnot complied with the requests of Pakistani authorities\u201d after the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA)\u2019s cybercrime wing forwarded numerous requests via the Pakistan Telecommun\u00adication Authority (PTA) to take \u201csignificant action to block accounts involved in a defamatory campaign against the honourable Chief Justice of Pakistan\u201d.\nNoting that the FIA\u2019s wing had initiated several FIRs against hundreds of Twitter accounts, the interior ministry asserted that the \u201clack of cooperation from Twitter/X authorities in addressing content that violates Pakistani laws and values further justifies the need for regulatory measures, including the temporary ban\u201d.\n\u201cThe government of Pakistan has no alternative but to temporarily block access/suspend the operation of this platform within Pakistan,\u201d it said.\nThe report said the interior ministry had on Feb 17 asked for blocking of X immediately till further orders on the reports of intelligence agencies.\n\u201cThe decision to impose a ban on Twitter/X in Pakistan was made in the interest of upholding national security, maintaining public order, and preserving the integrity of our nation,\u201d it contended, adding that the decision was taken after considering \u201cvarious confidential reports received from intelligence and security agencies of Pakistan\u201d.\nIt emphasised that \u201chostile elements operating on Twitter/X have nefarious intentions to create an environment of chaos and instability, with the ultimate goal of destabilising the country and plunging it into some form of anarchy\u201d.\n\u201cThe ban on Twitter serves as a necessary step to disrupt the activities of these elements and prevent them from achieving their destructive objectives,\u201d the report said.\nIt noted that X was neither registered in Pakistan nor had it signed an agreement to abide by local laws. It said the platform\u2019s \u201cfailure to establish a legal presence or engage in meaningful cooperation with Pakistani authorities underscores the need for regulatory measures to ensure accountability and adherence to national laws\u201d.\n\u201cThe ban on Twitter/X serves as a necessary step to address this regulatory vacuum and compel the platform to respect the sovereignty and legal jurisdiction of Pakistan,\u201d the interior ministry added.\nIt said social media platforms were extensively used to propagate extremist ideologies and fake information, adding that some miscreants were using social media as a tool to create a law and order situation and destabilise Pakistan.\nIt said the ban on X was not to restrict access to information but to streamline the use of social media platforms, and the interior ministry was under obligation to protect citizens\u2019 rights and national interests.\nIt pointed out that TikTok was also banned earlier and was only restored after it agreed to abide by the law of the land.\nJustice Farooq adjou\u00adrned further hearing in the petition till May 2.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: A controversy over what apparently started as an internal dispute between a political party and one of its workers spilled over into the country\u2019s highest court with a plea that someone it had not fielded as its candidate has managed to win the slot, allegedly through impersonation.\nThe Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) moved the Supreme Court against the Peshawar High Court\u2019s (PHC) April 2 order which had led the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to reinstate Sadaf Ihsan as a member of the National Assembly.\nSadaf Ihsan is accused of stealing identity and impersonating another candidate actually fielded by the JUI-F on a reserved seat for women from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\nIt may be recalled that the ECP had earlier withdrawn the victory notification after the JUI-F disowned Sadaf Ihsan being a member of the party.\n\nJUI-F claims Sadaf Ihsan \u2018impersonated\u2019 its actual candidate Sadaf Yasmin; assails PHC order after her notification by ECP\n\nMoved through senior counsel Kamran Murtaza, the petition explained that JUI-F had submitted with the ECP separate lists of its candidates in order of priority for seats reserved for women and non-Muslims.\nThe petition pleaded that a list was furnished to the ECP containing all required details for three candidates, including Hina Bibi (Respondent 6). However, to the extent of Sadaf Yasmin \u2014 the original candidate whom Sadaf Ihsan apparently impersonated \u2014 only her name was added to the list because other details had not been conveyed by her to the party.\nAccording to the petition, prior to the issuance of the notification of returned candidate, the ECP ought to have either rejected the list to the extent of Sadaf Yasmin or sought clarification from the party whether Sadaf Ihsan was Sadaf Yasmin or not.\nThe petition contended that the JUI-F informed Hina Bibi that Sadaf Yasmin had not submitted her nomination papers as she was living with her family in Karachi, and she had rather decided not to avail of the opportunity. Thus Hina Bibi should have been considered the third validly nominated candidate of the JUI\u2013F.\nAt the time of submission of nomination papers, Sadaf Ihsan with the probable collusion of someone within the party \u2014 who knew that Sadaf Yasmin was not pursuing her nomination \u2014 decided to portray herself as Sadaf Yasmin, since her first name was identical.\nInitially, the ECP issued a notification on Feb 22, in which two of the 10 seats were given, one to PML-N and the other to JUI-F. Both the returned candidates of these parties were the top priority candidates.\nBut after the Sunni Ittehad Council\u2019s claim for allocation of reserved seats was decided against them, the ECP issued another notification on March 4, for the remaining eight seats for women from KP in which Naeema Kishwar, who was second in priority list of the JUI-F, was listed as the returned candidate of the party.\nHina Bibi filed an application on March 6 to the ECP while the JUI-F also filed an application against the March 4 notification.\nSubsequently, the ECP issued a notification on March 11 suspending the notification to the extent of Sadaf Ihsan and also published a press release on March 12, citing that it had initiated an inquiry and will hear all the parties concerned before deciding the matter.\nThe press release also stated that the Returning Officer had been suspended as he should not have accepted Sadaf Ihsan as the JUI-F\u2019s candidate.\nFearing the outcome of the hearing before the ECP, Sadaf Ihsan challenged the March 11 notification before the PHC without making the JUI-F a party in the petition, the JUI-F regretted.\nConsequently, on April 2, a division bench of the PHC allowed Sadaf Ihsan\u2019s petition.\nThe JUI-F emphasised that it was purely the prerogative of political parties to decide the candidature for the reserved seats of women in order of priority under Article 51(e) of the Constitution, Section 104 of the Elections Act, 2017 and Chapter VI of Elections Rules 2017.\nThe ECP can recall or amend a notification issued under Article 51 of the Constitution, read with Section 104 of Elections Act 2017 for reserved NA seats for women, if an impersonator has managed to get a reserved seat due to negligence of the Returning Officer, the petition said.\nA political party and the rightful candidate cannot be deprived of a seat due to negligence on part of an ECP official, the petition bemoaned, adding that the claim of Sadaf Ihsan on the seat was a privilege granted by the party. Thus Sadaf Ihsan cannot claim rights on a seat before the PHC by going against the stance of her own party about her being an impersonator and her having no right to enforce for a reserved seat not meant for her, the petition emphasised.\n"

            "Text": "WASHINGTON: In a meeting with the IMF chief and some members of its board of governors, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has reaffirmed Pakistan\u2019s resolve to carry out \u201caggressive reforms\u201d to stabilise its economy.\nThese discussions were part of a meeting of Middle East and North Africa (MENAP) ministers and governors with IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva held on Tuesday.\nMr Aurangzeb \u201cunderscored aggressive reforms, including broadening the tax net, privatising loss-making SOEs, expanding social safety nets and facilitating the private sector,\u201d his team said in a statement issued a day after the meeting.\nThe minister underscored the implications of geo-economic fragmentation on Pakistan and expressed gratitude to the IMF, multilateral development banks, and \u201ctime-tested sincere bilateral partners\u201d for their unwavering support during these trying times.\nHe stressed the significance of reallocating a nation\u2019s special drawing rights (SDRs) within the IMF to tackle economic hurdles effectively. Additionally, he highlighted the necessity of reassessing surcharge policies and giving precedence to the IMF\u2019s Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST) to address climate vulnerabilities.\n\nAssures lender of broadening tax net, privatising SOEs, expanding social safety nets, facilitating private sector\n\nThe IMF\u2019s Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST) has been in operation for more than a year, with the initial 17 countries securing commitments of financial assistance. Pakistan, identified as a low emitter yet severely impacted by climate change, is also seeking aid from this fund.\nAdvocating for a more proactive and responsive Global Financial Safety Net to address heightened risks, the minister applauded the IMF\u2019s renewed focus on Capacity Building through Regional Capacity Development Centres (RCDCs).\nThe minister advocated for a proactive global financial safety net to address heightened risks and appreciated the IMF\u2019s renewed emphasis on capacity-building through regional capacity development centres. He also stressed the importance of collaborative efforts for sustainable economic development.\nPakistan, in pursuit of another long-term package \u2014 its 24th thus far \u2014 from the IMF, has formulated a comprehensive economic recovery plan. This plan encompasses three primary components: taxation, energy, and streamlining the privatisation of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), including PIA.\nThe IMF board is scheduled to convene on April 29 to deliberate on releasing the final tranche of its current programme with Pakistan. Subsequently, discussions between IMF staff and Islamabad regarding the new package are anticipated to commence.\nDuring Tuesday\u2019s meeting, the IMF acknowledged Pakistan\u2019s progress in meeting its conditions, while Pakistani officials advocated for a new plan tailored more specifically to Pakistan\u2019s needs.\nLater, at a JP Morgan Seminar on Pakistan\u2019s Economic Policy Outlook, Mr Aurangzeb emphasised positive economic indicators such as the robust performance of the agriculture sector, decreasing inflationary pressures, a stable exchange rate, shrinking trade deficit, and robust remittance inflows.\nHe informed the participants that Pakistan was committed to engaging in a broader and extended programme with the IMF.\nAt a meeting with Ajay Banga, president of the World Bank Group, the minister emphasised Pakistan\u2019s advancements under the nine-month SBA programme and the ongoing reforms in key sectors such as taxation, energy and privatisation.\nBoth parties acknowledged the necessity of establishing a 10-year rolling Country Framework Plan.\nThe World Bank president pledged his complete support for Pakistan\u2019s reform initiatives and digitalisation efforts aimed at stabilising the economy and boosting revenues. Additionally, the minister extended an invitation for the president to visit Pakistan.\n"

It is of paramount importance that these glaciers be regularly monitored by field staff through close coordination with local communities to report any event with reference to glacial lake formation, glacier rapid melting, glacial advances, Glofs or any hazard related to Glofs and glaciers,\u201d the PDMA said in the advisory.\nIt said that the Pakistan Meteorological Department had intimated it about the possibility of another weather system hitting the country between April 23 and April 29.\n\nWarns public life, property, infrastructure vulnerable to Glofs in nine cities\n\nThe PDMA said it was imperative to regularly monitor glaciers in those districts through field staff.\nIt said an advisory shared with it by the National Disaster Management Authority declared that in light of the forthcoming weather system, temperature gradients across the country could cause strong winds, dust storms, thunderstorms, and hailstorms.\n\u201cThe increased temperature and rainfall in northern Pakistan, especially in mountainous areas of KP, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Azad Jammu and Kashmir, may lead to avalanches in at-risk, vulnerable snowbound valleys,\u201d it said.\nThe disaster management body said that in light of increased temperatures across the northern part of the country, there was a risk of Glof incidents in the vulnerable valleys of KP, GB, and AJK.\n\u201cIncreased rainfall in the northern half of Pakistan and Balochistan, including districts of KP, northern and central Punjab, GB and AJK may lead to flash flooding and landslides in vulnerable and at-risk mountainous and hilly areas,\u201d it said.\nThe PDMA said irrigation water would be required at regular intervals for season vegetables and newly-sown kharif crops.\nDuring the last three days, rains battered the province killing 36 people, injuring scores and damaging standing crops.\nThey also played havoc with the infrastructure leading to the suspension of traffic in several districts.\nEARLY HELP ORDERED: On the orders of Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, a process has been \u201cgeared up\u201d to provide financial assistance to the families of the people, who lost lives in various rain-related incidents, according to a statement issued by the Chief Minister\u2019s Secretariat.\nIt said that Rs50 million had been released by the PDMA as financial assistance to the heirs of the deceased in various districts.\nThe CM\u2019s Secretariat said that Rs20 million had been released for Nowshera district, Rs5 million for Lower Dir, Rs3 million each for Swat and Malakand, Rs2 million each for Upper Dir and Tank, and Rs1 million each had been released for Lower Chitral, Battagram, Karak, Peshawar, and Charsadda.\nIt added that Rs10 million had also been released for general relief in Lower Chitral.\nExpressing satisfaction with the steps taken by the PDMA and other relevant departments in providing relief to the rain-affected families, the chief minister said the provincial government would not leave the victims of natural calamities alone.\n\u201cProviding immediate relief to them is the first priority of the provincial government, and all available resources are being utilised for this purpose,\u201d he said.\nThe CM directed authorities to carefully assess the damages in all affected districts and ensure that all the victims are provided with relief and assistance.\nHe ordered speedy work on the rehabilitation of rain-hit infrastructure and said the issues faced by people could be resolved as soon as possible and they could return to their normal lives.\n\u201cNothing can replace a human life. However, the provincial government not only equally shares the grief of the bereaved families, but it is also going all-out to provide them relief and assistance,\u201d he said.\n"

The VC position has been vacant at eight universities for the last one year, according to officials.\nThey told Dawn that those eight universities included Abbottabad University of Science and Technology, Gomal University Dera Ismail Khan, Khushhal Khan Khattak University Karak, University of Agriculture Dera Ismail Khan, University of Lakki Marwat, Hazara University Mansehra, University of Engineering and Technology Mardan, and Women University Swabi.\nSeven other universities have been awaiting the filling of the top position for three months. They include Abdul Wali Khan University Mardan, Bacha Khan University Charsadda, Shuhada-i-APS University of Technology Nowshera, Kohat University of Science and Technology, University of Peshawar, University of Science and Technology Bannu, and University of Engineering Peshawar.\nOfficials said five universities, including Fata University Dara Adamkhel, Islamia College University Peshawar, the University of Buner and the University of Chitral had been functioning without regular VCs for the last one month.\nThe newly-established University of Agriculture Swat, University of Engineering and Applied Sciences Swat, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Swat, and University of Shangla also don\u2019t have regular VCs.\nSources in the higher education department claimed that the process for appointing regular VCs to public sector universities in the province was completed three months ago, but the provincial government was reluctant to notify the names of VCs \u201cwithout any justification.\u201d\nThese vacancies were advertised during the last Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government, with Mahmood Khan being the chief minister, according to them.\nThe sources said the academic search committee for the appointment of vice-chancellors conducted interviews for VC posts from January 22 to January 26.\nThey, however, said the provincial government insisted the process of appointing VCs had been completed during the time of the caretaker government, which had no authority to appoint VCs.\nThe sources said the current elected government intended to re-advertise all those positions.\nMeanwhile, the chairman of the Higher Education Commission has written a letter to the secretary of the higher education department in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa about the issue.\n\u201cThe development of higher educational institutions hinges, among other things, on the quality and continuity of their leadership. Discontinuity and ad hoc arrangements, on the other hand, cause inconsistencies in work, gaps in policy implementation, and financial indiscipline, resulting in inefficiency, poor governance, and weak institutional performance. Unfortunately, the situation in KP is serious as there are many public sector universities with the offices of VCs either vacant or being overseen by individuals on an acting basis,\u201d he said.\nThe HEC chairman pushed the higher education secretary to ensure the early filling of the top vacancies in universities.\n"

In this model, every member of the community acts as the guard of wild animals, so their numbers, especially those of markhors and snow leopards, have increased incredibly over the years,\u201d he said.\nThe expert said the loss of one species could lead to the extinction of the other, as in the natural scheme of things, they had close interdependence.\nHe said the loss of a markhor meant a colossal loss of Rs50 million as the fee for trophy hunting was auctioned at that rate last year.\n\u201cEighty per cent of the fee is transferred to the local community, which spends it on its collective development in a democratic way,\u201d he said.\nThe conservationist said a few years ago, members of Denin VCC rescued a markhor by risking their lives as it got stranded on a steep hillock. \nHe added that the markhor was shifted to the local veterinary hospital for treatment but succumbed to injuries in a Peshawar hospital.\n\u201cThe local community shifted an injured cub of snow leopard to the local veterinary facility from where it was taken to Peshawar, but it was too late to save the life of the wild cat due to excessive bleeding,\u201d he said.\nThe expert said presently, the only specialised facility for markhor was present in the core zone of Chitral Gol National Park, where sick or injured animals were quarantined.\nHe said that facility could be converted into a wildlife rescue centre with staff members trained in the treatment of wild animals.\nMeanwhile, emir of Jamaat-i-Islami in Lower Chitral district Maulana Jamshed Ahmad and general secretary Wajeehuddin, and Al-Khidmat Foundation president Abdul Haq have demanded an early yet fair assessment of the damages caused by the recent torrential rains and snowfall here.\nThey told a joint news conference here the other day that Chitral\u2019s poor residents had lost homes, crops, and orchards to the natural disaster, and therefore, the government should provide them with relief goods and proper compensation for damages.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The embassy of France on Wednesday honourd French companies for their notable contributions in women empowerment and corporate social responsibility in Pakistan.\nIn an unconventional diplomatic event, the Embassy of France hosted a gathering to honor these companies for their efforts, highlighting the pivotal role of the private sector in addressing societal issues.\nIn his remarks, the Ambassador of France Nicolas Galey informed his guests that Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) had evolved beyond mere financial contributions to societal welfare. \nIt encompassed a commitment to values and principles, including gender equality, support for disadvantaged groups, and community development.\n\u201cFrench companies operating in Pakistan have been at the forefront of this movement, recognising that their interests are intertwined with the well-being of the society,\u201d he said.\nThe event showcased the contributions of four prominent French companies \u2013 L\u2019Or\u00e9al, Schneider, IPSOS, and Servier \u2013 through a series of inspiring videos. These companies had integrated CSR into their operations, not only for the benefit of society but also for the betterment of their employees and business performance.\nAmbassador Galey emphasised the alignment of private and public interests in promoting societal development.\nHe underlined the importance of initiatives like the one being celebrated, which demonstrated the convergence of interests between the public and private sectors.\nGuests were informed that the commitment of French companies to women\u2019s empowerment aligned with France\u2019s foreign policy priorities, including its ambitious \u201cfeminist diplomacy\u201d.\nThrough initiatives like this, French investors in Pakistan were fulfilling their responsibilities towards the host country by creating employment, building skills, and reducing inequalities.\nThe event shed light on the systemic impact of these companies\u2019 activities, promoting values, standards, and sustainable development goals.\nFrench companies in Pakistan had demonstrated good practices in governance, gender equality, human rights, environmental sustainability, and local development.\nThe event highlighted that French government and French companies shared a common commitment to social and environmental responsibility. Recent legislation in France mandated the consideration of social and environmental issues in corporate management, reflecting a broader global shift towards sustainability.\nNicolas Galey highlighted that the economic presence of French companies in Pakistan, with 20 subsidiaries and 2 billion Euros of investments, not only contributed to the country\u2019s economy but also to its social development.\nEven during challenging times, such as the floods of 2022, French companies exhibited solidarity by supporting local communities directly or through funding NGOs.\nAmbassador Galey commended the participating companies for their long-term commitment to Pakistan\u2019s development. Despite economic challenges, these companies continued to invest in human capital and foster inclusive work environments that empower both men and women.\nThe event celebrated the contributions of French companies in Pakistan to women empowerment and CSR. It emphasized the importance of private sector engagement in addressing societal challenges and highlighted the mutual benefits of corporate responsibility for both businesses and communities.\n"

However, the judge responded in writing and did not raise this matter with the administration. Instead he stated that the junior judges had also been instructed not to allow any outsider in their respective chambers.\nThe sources said the judge was transferred because a party in a high-profile murder case lodged a complaint against the verdict for his leniency towards the accused persons.\nAnother sessions judge transferred during this period was one whose house was robbed, and the thieves took Rs5.5 million, $15,000 and gold ornaments.\nA senior official of the sessions court told Dawn that there were at least four remedies available for the judicial officer in case someone tried to influence him or her.\nHe said that the judge of the sessions court can write to the registrar and the second remedy is the Member Inspection Team (MIT) at the high court level, where a serving sessions judge deals with complaints related to district judiciary.\nThe third remedy is to approach the inspection judge, who is a serving judge of the high court. There are three inspection judges in the IHC to oversee the special courts and East and West Sessions Divisions of the federal capital.\nHe, however, said not a single application or complaint was sent to the sessions judges or the IHC.\nThe district bar president said there was a possibility that certain quarters might secretly approach a judge, but this could not be done without the consent of the said judge.\nIn case a judge gives them a cold shoulder, such elements never dare approach them again, he added.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The reluctance of the authorities to allow heavy traffic on two key roads \u2013 the 5km-long Bhara Kahu bypass and Karnal Sher Khan Avenue (formerly I.J.P Road) \u2013 despite spending billions of rupees on these projects has resulted in a question mark on the reliability of these projects.\nThese projects were executed by the National Logistic Cell (NLC) and inaugurated by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif during his first tenure last year. The bypass has proved a blessing for commuters who can now skirt the traffic mess in Bhara Kahu, particularly during summer and special occasions. But to reap the maximum benefits of this project, the Capital Development Authority (CDA) needs to allow the heavy traffic on this road.\n\u201cBillions of rupees were spent on this project, but we cannot understand why it is not opened for heavy vehicles; is the CDA afraid of extra load,\u201d asked Luqman Khan, a driver.\nThis project was completed in 10 months as the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) government wanted to complete it during its tenure. The original cost of the project was Rs6.5 billion, but the scope of the project was expanded which resulted in an increase in its cost. Recently, the CDA board was told that the NLC had moved a bill of Rs1.8 billion against the additional work.\n\nOfficials say roads to be opened to heavy traffic soon, cite traffic management issues behind delay\n\nThe CDA had referred the bill to the consultant firm of the Punjab government, which endorsed the additional work and recommended the approval of Rs1.3 billion. The board after approving the recommendation directed the engineering wing to place the issue before the CDA\u2019s Development Working Party (DWP) for the final approval.\nLike the bypass road, the overhauling and expansion project of the 8.5-kilometre-long I.J.P. Road cost Rs5 billion. It has two major flyovers \u2013 one near Sabzi Mandi and the second in front of 9th Avenue. Sabzi Mandi flyover is closed for heavy traffic whereas the flyover next to the 9th Avenue has developed rutting due to the load of heavy traffic vehicles.\nAccording to the CDA officials, the Bhara Kahu bypass and the I.J.P. flyover would be opened for heavy traffic \u201csoon after the resolution of the traffic management issues\u201d.\nThey said that due to \u201ctechnical\u201d reasons heavy traffic was not allowed on these roads at present.\nThe officials said the flyover on the I.J.P. Road was opened for traffic but it was later closed due to a fear of road accidents. They said the heavy vehicle moving on a rigid lane could not change lanes after crossing the flyover due to the traffic mess outside the nearest bus stand. The CDA member engineering visited the site recently and asked the officials concerned to resolve the issue of traffic management.\nSpeaking about the Bhara Kahu bypass, the officials said the contractor NLC was directed to take necessary measures after the recommendation of the consultant. The officials claimed the bypass road would be opened for the heavy traffic as soon as possible.\nTo a query, about rutting on the 9th Avenue flyover, the official said that it was being repaired and initial work had been done. \u201cWhen the temperature will increase up to 30 degrees Celsius, asphalt will be laid on it since the procedure is not recommended during rainy days as per the standards engineering protocols, he claimed.\nCDA spokesperson Nauman Khalid said that the authority was aware of both issues and the engineering wing had already been directed to get the bypass and the flyover in question opened for heavy traffic after resolving the traffic management issue. \u201cThe contractor of the bypass road has already started working for the traffic management while a way forward is being finalised for the flyover as well for the ease of the motorists,\u201d he said.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: While the health ministry has been considering outsourcing the radiology department of the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims), the hospital employees believe patients will face the brunt of this decision.\nThey have pinned their hopes on the newly-appointed coordinator to the Prime Minister on National Health Services (MHS) Dr Malik Mukhtar Ahmed Bharath and a draft has been prepared to share the factual position with him.\nAccording to the draft, even though 90 per cent of the services were free the department earned Rs5 million which went to the national exchequer. Moreover, the draft termed the department a \u201cjewel in the crown\u201d.\nAccording to documents available with Dawn, the ministry has been considering outsourcing the diagnostic unit of Pims.\n\nStaffers believe it will impact patients, term department \u2018jewel in crown\u2019\n\nAs per the draft, the radiology department provides services to 500,000 patients a year through the latest equipment which includes a 1.5T MRI by Siemens (2023), 128 slice CT scanner by Canon (2021), mammography machines by Hologic and Helianthus, ultrasound machines, and digital X-ray machines.\nThese data are integrated and stored by the latest picture archiving system (PACs) from Boston with servers capable of over five years of data storage.\n\u201cThe radiology department comprises 12 fellow consultants comprising a professor, two associate professors, three assistant professors, five senior registrars, and a senior consultant headed by Prof Ayesha Isani Majeed (Fellow of the Royal College of Radiologists, UK and PhD public health), 30 postgraduate students (FCPS and MD with a number of them in the dual process of sitting for the FRCR), and 40 paramedical and support staff,\u201d it stated.\nBreakdown of patients\nIn 2023, the total number of X-rays performed was 247,745; out of which, 90.8pc were free. The total number of ultrasounds performed was 58,133; out of which, 97.6pc were free. The total number of Doppler\u2019s performed was 2,975; out of which, 95pc were free. The total number of CT scans performed was 51,441; out of which, 98.8pc were free. Similarly, over 80pc of MRI were provided free of cost.\nEven though less than 5pc patients charged for the radiological services paid nominal amounts the department still made Rs5m. The hospital charges only Rs70 for the X-ray, Rs200 for ultrasound, Rs300 for Doppler, Rs2,500 for a brain CT scan, Rs3,000 each for HRCT Chest, CT Abdomen, and Rs4,000 for MRI.\nThe letter also provided a comparison with the private sector. For instance, private health facilities charge Rs1,000 for the X-ray, Rs 3150 for the ultrasound, Rs5,000 for Doppler, Rs6,450 for a CT scan of the brain and Rs 9,450 each for HRCT Chest, CT Abdomen and MRI.\n\u201cHowever, despite the subsidy the department has earned Rs 5 million for the government of Pakistan which goes into the exchequer and if a viable financial model is made the amount earned by the radiology department at Pims can contribute towards the budget of the hospital for its upkeep and renovation,\u201d said the document.\nAccording to the draft, the Radiology department conducts multidisciplinary meetings where oncologists, surgeons, pathologists, and Gynae among others for the best outcome for the patients which is decided by consensus of all speciality experts.\n\u201cMultiple research projects on artificial intelligence on chest X-rays and mammography are underway. Similarly, breast cancer genetics, tuberculosis, HIV research have been conducted through grants and different academic platforms with multiple publications in international and national journals,\u201d it stated.\n\u201cThe first ever holistic breast cancer screening centre of the public sector has been established.

The department performs X-ray chest around the clock for the burn centre,\u201d it stated.\nHealth coordinator visits NEOC\nMeanwhile, Dr Malik Mukhtar Ahmed Bharath, accompanied by Health Secretary Nadeem Mahboob, visited the National Emergency Operations Center (NEOC) for Polio Eradication to review the progress of anti-polio efforts.\nAccording to NEOC Coordinator Dr Shahzad Baig, \u201cWe have set two goals for this year. First, to interrupt transmission of the local YB3C poliovirus genetic cluster, by the middle of this year, and the second is to close all outbreaks of the imported YB3A virus and interrupt its transmission by the end of this year.\u201d\n\u201cSince last year, we have implemented an intense vaccination schedule which we will continue this year to ensure children have high immunity against polio infection,\u201d he added.\n"

            "Text": "\u2022 Says upcoming budgetary measures may have implications for near-term inflation outlook\n\u2022 Industry says expensive borrowing has caused significant losses to economy\nKARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) kept its key interest rate unchanged at 22 per cent for the seventh straight policy meeting on Monday as it found no improvement in the economic situation while the fear of inflation continues to haunt policymakers.\n\u201cThe level of inflation is still high. The upcoming budgetary measures may have implications for the near-term inflation outlook,\u201d the central bank said in its Monetary Policy Statement.\nMost analysts and financial experts expected a cut in the interest rate, particularly due to poor economic growth. This decision comes in light of flat private sector borrowing, which has been significantly impacted by the high borrowing costs.\nThe Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) stressed the continuation of the current monetary policy stance to bring inflation down to the target range of 5pc to 7pc by September 2025.\nThe committee said the inflation outlook is susceptible to risks emanating from recent global oil price volatility, bottoming out of other commodity prices, the potential inflationary impact of the resolution of circular debt in the energy sector, and tax rate-driven fiscal consolidation going forward.\n\u201cCognisant of these risks, the committee assessed that it is prudent to continue with the current monetary policy stance at this stage, with significant positive real interest rates,\u201d it said. The committee views inflation to continue to remain on a downward trajectory, it added.\nThe MPC observed economic recovery during the first half of fiscal 2024, strong rebound in agriculture, sizeable surplus in current account in March, and inflation expectations of consumers inching up in April.\nThe SBP projected the 2023-24 GDP growth in the range of 2pc to 3pc, with 6.8pc agriculture growth (in the first half of the fiscal year). Large-scale manufacturing (LSM) showed no improvement to drive the economy this year. The LSM declined by 0.5 per cent during the eight months from July to February.\nHowever, the MPC expects value-addition from the manufacturing and services sectors to recover in the coming months.\nExternal sector\nThe current account has performed better than expected, recording a sizeable surplus of $619 million in March, mainly due to the Eid-related surge in workers\u2019 remittances.\nThe current account deficit during July-March FY24 narrowed by 87.5pc to $0.5 billion compared to the same period last year. Exports continue to exhibit steady growth \u2014 led by rice \u2014 while imports have decreased due to better domestic agriculture output and moderate economic activity.\nThis reduction in the current account deficit \u2014 amid weak financial inflows \u2014 allowed the SBP to make sizeable debt repayments, including that of a $1bn Eurobond, while sustaining the SBP\u2019s foreign exchange reserves around $8bn.\nFiscal sector\nIn line with fiscal consolidation efforts, the primary surplus increased to 1.8pc of GDP during July-January from 1.1pc in the same period last year. This improvement is mainly led by the continuous increases in revenue collection and some restraints on non-interest expenditures.\nThe sizeable increase in both tax and non-tax revenues largely reflects the impact of taxation measures and ongoing economic recovery. The interest payments, however, have increased due to high debt levels and the government\u2019s reliance on expensive domestic borrowing.\n\u201cAs a result, the overall deficit increased to 2.6pc of GDP during July-January FY24 from 2.3pc in the same period last year,\u201d the SBP said.\nIndustry\u2019s reaction\nIftikhar Ahmed Sheikh, president of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the industry was expecting a reduction of 150 to 200 basis points in the interest rate due to declining inflation and support for economic growth from the IMF and World Bank.\nHe said the expensive borrowing rate has caused significant losses to the economy, particularly the cost of doing business, which has grossly suppressed the manufacturing sector.\nJohar Ali Qandhari, president of the Korangi Association of Trade and Industry, also expressed serious concern over the State Bank\u2019s decision to continue with the 22pc interest rate.\nFearing that such a move could be a disaster for the industry, Mr Qandhari asserted that the high interest rate posed a formidable barrier to achieving economic objectives, exacerbating challenges faced by businesses.\n"

Under the sweeping arrangements, funds lying in bank accounts are swept out and made part of non-food account No.1 at the close of each banking day, and swept back to bank accounts at the start of banking hours.\nTo ensure timely availability of funds for settling authorised expenditures, the Budget Wing and Debt Management Office of Finance Division shall project an estimate of cash buffer requirement on regular basis and the Finance Division would be empowered to utilise surplus funds to retire public debt in coordination with the State Bank of Pakistan.\nOn the fifth day of each month, the accountant general of Pakistan Revenues shall provide revenue and expenditure data to the secretaries of all divisions for review. Additionally, at the end of each quarter, the secretaries will be obligated to submit a three-month forecast of revenue and expenditure to the Finance Division by the 20th of the following month.\nThe Debt Management Office will prepare quarterly projections of debt servicing, and the Finance Division will prepare monthly cash forecast reports based on data provided by divisions and the Debt Management Office.\nGovernment offices and public entities will open, maintain, and operate bank accounts only in accordance with the new rules. Requests for opening of a bank account shall be submitted to the Finance Division along with any legal provision or government approval or clear justification for opening a bank account.\nThe existing accounts would be jointly reviewed by the Finance Division and division concerned, and those accounts which are found non-essential for functioning shall be closed and balance funds shall be transferred to the Federal Consolidated Fund or the Public Accounts.\nThe State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) shall provide a quarterly report to Finance Division of all bank accounts and balances therein operated and maintained by the government offices and public entities.\nThe government offices and public entities would be required to provide on quarterly basis a complete list of bank accounts to Finance Division that would cover information relating to balances, purpose, signatories, and the legal instrument or approval for operating these accounts. On the basis of information provided by the SBP, government offices and public entities, Finance Division shall maintain an inventory of these bank accounts.\n"

The committee, headed by Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal, will likely hold the TTS project directors responsible.\nThe TTS is a software-based solution for tracking vehicles, loading units, shipments, and products throughout the entire supply chain, from supplier to consumer.\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif tasked Mr Bosal to identify officials involved in the delayed implementation of the system. The federal cabinet made the decision last week after rejecting an earlier report submitted by a committee led by former finance secretary Tariq Bajwa.\nSources in the finance ministry said the new committee has found that the project\u2019s poor implementation resulted in serious lapses and delays.\nThe committee will also determine the reasons for the failure to integrate the tracking system throughout the supply chain.\nThe TTS was implemented by a consortium through bidding by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR). It was initially implemented in 2021 in the cigarette industry, followed by the sugar, cement, and fertiliser sectors.\nThe sources also noted issues between the project directors and the consortium, particularly disagreements over the concessions granted for importing necessary equipment and discrepancies in setting up the plants compared to the initial designs proposed by the consortium.\nMeanwhile, the earlier committee led by Tariq Bajwa, in its report, did not find any wrongdoing in awarding the contract.\nHowever, it proposed that the FBR establish a dedicated enforcement force for the Track and Trace project to enhance its effectiveness.\nThat committee also recommended that the government notify the supervisory committee, to be chaired by the prime minister or the finance ministry, to oversee the entire project implementation. It said the supervisory body should be empowered to take action against stakeholders for delays.\nIt also proposed that the FBR might be asked to strengthen its data analytics capability to match production data with sales tax returns of companies or notified units.\n"

Depending on the final calculation of the inland freight equalisation margin (IFEM), the price of petrol is projected to come down by Rs4.50-5.20 per litre and that of HSD by Rs8-8.50 per litre.\n \n \n\nThe petrol import premium has dropped by almost 10pc to $9.60 per barrel from $10.7. This is the second fortnightly fall from $13.50 per barrel in March. On the other hand, however, the rupee lost about 45 paise against the dollar during the fortnight to Rs278.65. The net impact is estimated to be about Rs5 per litre reeducation in petrol price from the existing Rs295.\nThe HSD price also dropped by about $5 per barrel, and its import premium, paid by Pakistan State Oil, remained unchanged at $6.50 per barrel. Thus, the HSD rate was estimated to be down by Rs8 to Rs8.50 per litre, subject to final exchange rate adjustment and IFEM in pricing, from the current rate of Rs290.38 per litre at the depot stage. Officials said the international market price of petrol had dropped to $96.6 per barrel from $98.5 earlier, while the HSD price to $97.5 from $102.9 per barrel.\nAlmost a fortnight ago, the government had increased the price of petrol and HSD by Rs4.53 and Rs8.14 per litre for the fortnight ending April 30.\nThe government has already achieved Rs60 per litre petroleum levy \u2014 maximum permissible limit under the law \u2014 on both petrol and HSD.\n"

She wondered if there was a dearth of people in Pakistan to do the job.\n\nShibli slams govt urgency to pass money bill; Irfan Siddiqui denies plans to extend judges\u2019 terms\n\nThe senator sought to know as to who had authorised the hiring of Mckinsey and Co while ignoring Public Procure\u00adm\u00adent Regulatory Authority (PPRA) rules and standard operating procedures. She noted that tenders should have been invited and insisted that a single individual could not take such decisions.\nShe then read out a press release that said Finance Minister Senator Muham\u00admad Aurangzeb chaired a meeting of the Steering Committee on Digitalisation of FBR, which was attended by \u2018key stakeholders\u2019 including the FBR chairman, CEO Karandaz and representatives from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

She reg\u00adretted that \u201cagenda of others\u201d was imposed on lawmakers and they were being asked to advance it. She said such things would be detrimental for the country.\nLeader of the Opposition in Senate Syed Shibli Faraz also endorsed her views and asked as to what was the urgency to pass the money bill. He said the practice of bulldozing laws must come to an end.\nHe regretted that bills are passed without discussion in the House. He said just three senators examined the money bill, noting that this was \u201ca sophisticated form of bulldozing legislation\u201d. Minister for Law and Justice Azam Nazeer Tarar, however, advised the lawmakers on the other side of the aisle to avoid opposition for the sake of opposition and instead support the \u201cpositive moves\u201d by the government.\nThe House later adopted the recommendations made by the special committee through a motion moved by Senator Farooq H.

He was responding to the concerns expressed by PTI lawmaker Aon Abbas, who had claimed the legislation was on the cards to extend the tenure of judges.\n\u201cWe are going to become a rubber-stamp to define the term of judiciary, but the PTI will not become part of it\u201d, the PTI senator had said. He also slammed the campaign against Islamabad High Court judge Justice Babar Sattar.\nDenying any move to extend the term of judges, Senator Siddiqui  also termed as unfortunate the trend of mudslinging on judges and said it was condemnable.\nMeanwhile, JUI-F\u2019s Maulana Attaur Rehman decried that Khyber Pakhtunwhwa was deprived of full representation in the Senate unlike other provinces and wanted to know what was its crime. \u201cIs it not a crime to add to sense of deprivation of the province?\u201d he asked. He also recalled his party\u2019s stance that it neither accepted the results of 2018 elections nor 2024 polls.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has condemned the use of force against the farmers who arrived in Lahore to protest, as the government neither offered a genuine price for their produce nor purchased wheat at all.\nA party spokesperson noted that the farmers were coerced to sell wheat in the open market at a much lower rate than the officially fixed rate due to the government\u2019s \u201canti-poor\u201d policies regarding wheat procurement.\nIn a statement, he alleged that history showed that whenever PML-N came into power, it economically exploited the country\u2019s farmers.\nHe warned that the rural economy, especially the farmers, would face billions of rupees in losses due to the possibility of selling wheat at a rate 20 per cent or 25pc less than the farmer support price.\nThe PTI spokesperson pointed out that the farmers were bearing the brunt of the government\u2019s decision to import three million tonnes more wheat than the locals need in October. He asked the government to provide an explanation for the strategy and rationale behind importing extra wheat at such a high price.\n\nSeeks accountability for wheat import by caretakers; condemns appointment of Dar as deputy PM\n\nHe went on to say that the government\u2019s policies would directly impact the public in the form of expensive flour. He reminded that the Imran Khan-led government had adopted a policy to revive the economy by giving farmers better rewards for their hard work.\nHe highlighted that during the PTI government, farmers were paid reasonable and timely payments for the first time in the history of the country, resulting in a total addition of Rs1,100 billion to the rural economy. He contended that even at present, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has devised a plan under Imran Khan\u2019s farmer-friendly policy to purchase wheat from farmers at a rate of Rs3,900 per 40kg to prevent their exploitation.\nPTI demanded that those responsible for importing wheat worth billions of rupees during the caretaker government should be brought to book.\nPTI Punjab to support farmers\nSeparately, PTI central Punjab\u2019s general secretary stated that the incumbent rulers, over the past two years, have economically ruined everyone, including farmers, lawyers, the salaried class, journalists, and social workers.\nPTI Punjab\u2019s information secretary, Shaukat Basra, in a video message, urged the farmers to come out of their homes and demand their rights from the PML-N government, which he claimed came to power through fraud and a fake mandate.\nHe said the PTI would join hands with the farmers and farmer organisations to raise their voice for the procurement of wheat at reasonable rates.\nIshaq Dar\u2019s appointment\nMeanwhile, PTI has criticised the appointment of Ishaq Dar as deputy prime minister, calling it an act of nepotism. The party spokesperson claimed that there was no provision in Pakistan\u2019s act to appoint a deputy prime minister and that a constitutional amendment was required for such an appointment.\n\u201cIt is strange that after the brother and daughter, now it has been decided to oblige the father-in-law of the daughter,\u201d he said.\nMansoor Malik in Lahore also contributed to this report\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: As the Supreme Court resumes hearing on Tuesday (today) of a case relating to alleged meddling by spy agencies in judicial affairs, more petitions are pouring in one after another with a request to become a party in the matter.\nOn Monday, Sindh High Court Bar Association (SHCBA) Presi\u00addent Rehan Aziz Malik requested the top court to declare that it was imperative for all state institutions to refrain from overstepping their rightful boundaries and that they must consistently operate and abide by legal framework and principles enshrined in the Constitution.\nHeaded by Chief Justice of Pa\u00ad\u00adkistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa, a six-judge SC bench will resume hearing of the case it instituted on a suo motu. Other ben\u00adch members include Justices Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Jamal Khan Mando\u00adkhail, Athar Minallah, Musarrat Hilali and Naeem Akhtar Afghan. Justice Yahya Afridi has already recused himself from the bench.\nThe Supreme Court has alrea\u00ad\u00addy clubbed a set of 10 petitions and applications seeking its intervention in response to allegations of \u201cintelligence agencies\u2019 meddling in judicial affairs\u201d, which were highlighted in a March 25 letter written to the Supreme Judicial Council by six Islamabad High Court judges.\n\nSHCBA seeks order for state institutions to work within designated lawful domain\n\nThe fresh petitions requested the Supreme Court to declare that vesting prerogative to constitute benches and mark cases to the unilateral and unstructured discretion of the chief justices of high courts harms both the external and internal independence of judiciary and violates Articles 10-A, 175, 192 and 202 of the Constitution.\nThe SHCBA pleaded before the apex court to declare that principles of good governance and the rule of law command that all state institutions must operate within their designated lawful domain.\n\u201cThey should adhere to the parameters set by the law and the Constitution, ensuring that their actions and behaviour remain within the boundaries established by these legal frameworks. This commitment to upholding the law and respecting the Constitution is vital for the proper functioning of state institutions and for maintaining a just and democratic society,\u201d it argued.\nThe petition said the high courts should be directed to hold full court meetings and ascertain whether any judges of the respective courts or of courts subordinate to them have similar complaints and to report the same to the Supreme Court.\nIt requested the apex court to pass orders to safeguard the independence of judiciary and protect it from such intrusions in future and for initiation of appropriate proceedings against any officers or persons responsible, whether through acts of commission or omission.\nThe petition said the high courts should frame appropriate rules and guidelines on the administrative side detailing how any complaints by judges or staff of the high courts and subordinate courts of external interference in judicial or court-related functions should be reported and how they were to be redressed and, insofar as judges and staff of this court were concerned.\nThe petition sought a directive for the SC registrar to place proposals in this regard for the consideration of the full court as well as order the federal government to devise appropriate mechani\u00ads\u00ad\u00adms for effective scrutiny and oversight over the functioning of intelligence agencies to ensure they do not transgress their lawful dom\u00adain and to ensure that int\u00adelligence agencies are duly regulated through requisite legislation.\nAnother petition filed on Monday requested the Supreme Court to form an inquiry commission comprising three top court judges to probe the contents and context of the IHC judges\u2019 letter.\nAdvocate Khudayar Mohla, the petitioner, invoked the SC jurisdiction under Article 184 (3) of the Constitution, making the federal government through prime minister, secretaries of the cabinet division and ministries of law and justice and interior as respondents in the matter.\n\u201cThis court may constitute an inquiry commission consisting of at least three honourable judges of this court to thoroughly inquire and investigate the matter and contents of the letter of March 25, 2024, written by six learned judges of the IHC to fix responsibility of persons in their official status who had indulged in interfering judicial working of the said learned judges to close backdoor of interference by any executive authority or intelligence agency, etc., in the interest of justice and independence of the judiciary,\u201d said the petition filed through counsel Dr G.M. Chaudhry.\n"

How is this letter related to the FIA?\u201d\nHe observed that the IHC judges\u2019 letter was about the ISI, not the FIA.\n\u201cDoes the FIA have any connection with fixing hidden cameras in judges\u2019 houses?\u201d he asked while referring to one of the issues raised by the six judges in their letter.\nThe PTA counsel also failed to satisfy the judge, while the IB representative said the application was filed with the approval of a joint director general.\nWhen asked the official\u2019s name, the AAG Duggal replied that his name was Tariq Mehmood.\nJustice Sattar summo\u00adned the director at the next hearing after the IB representative failed to provide a satisfactory response.\nPemra, in its petition, had reasoned that since another IHC bench had already dealt with an identical matter, Justice Sattar should recuse himself so that the same bench that the same bench may proceed on the petitions in hand.\nJustice Sattar dismissed Pemra\u2019s and PTA\u2019s petitions and imposed a fine of Rs500,000 each on FIA, PTA and Pemra. \nHe also hinted at initiating contempt proceedings against the heads of the three departments, and the hearing was later adjourned.\nIn May last year, Justice Sattar had asked the intelligence agencies and PTA to trace the source of the audio leak while Pemra was told not to broadcast the unauthorised and leak\u00ad\u00aded conversation of citizens.\nIn their reports submitted to the court, IB and ISI claimed phone calls could be tapped through mobile apps and viruses, and intelligence agencies could not trace the culprits. The ISI said its inability to trace the source of the leaks was due to encryption being a significant barrier.\n\u201cBeing encrypted traffic, technically, it is not possible to ascertain the source; only SM [social media] platforms can provide information,\u201d it said.\n"

He said the hybrid seed technology increased corn production and suggested adopting modern trends to break the stagnation in other crops.\nHe said while wheat production per acre is limited to 30 maunds, progressive farmers are achieving 60 to 70 maunds, and the UAF is introducing soybeans, climate-resistant wheat, high-yielding sugarcane, cotton, and other commodities to boost agricultural prosperity.\nNational Seed Development and Regulatory Authority Chairman Dr Asif Ali said that increasing wheat production from 30 to 50 maunds per acre could reduce the current nine million hectares of wheat cultivation to 6.5 million hectares, allowing the remaining 2.5 million hectares to be used for other crops. He said public-private partnerships should be promoted to ensure the production and delivery of quality seeds.\nHe said due to hybrid seed, India is getting 31.8 million bales of cotton while Pakistan is getting up to 8.35m bales.\n"

He said on the protest of some patients, the SZMCH administration got repaired the MRI machine and installed a new ST Scan near the emergency building. He said the Color Doppler Ultrasound machine in the Radiology Department, Feco machine for eye operations and two digital machines in emergency OPD were also not working properly.\nAnother source in the hospital paramedics association said 15-year old angiography machine had completed its life after 10,000 procedures and now it was outdated.

Firstly, it would create such atmosphere which could become deterrence for the people who have inclination towards crime and secondly to work as a medium in reforming the offence.\n\u201cDeterrent punishment is not only to maintain balance with gravity of wrong done by person but also to make an example for others as prevented measures for reformation of society,\u201d it added.\nDuring the trial, state prosecutor Ghulam Abbas Dalwani submitted that the four accused did recce of Mr Abidi and facilitated their four absconding accomplices in carrying out the murder.\nDefence counsel Abid Zaman argued that no confessional statements were recorded by the investigation officer and pleaded for their acquittal.\nHowever, the court rejected the defence plea and ruled: \u201cThe evidence shows that all accused persons in furtherance of their common intention are involved in the commission of murder\u2026 and they are equally responsible for the act.\u201d\nAccording to the prosecution, 46-year-old Abidi was shot dead by armed motorcyclists in an attack on his vehicle outside his residence in Defence Housing Authority, Phase-V, on December 25, 2018.\nSubsequently, the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) arrested accused Farooq and during grilling, he disclosed that he along with his brother Mustafa and other accused conducted recce and made a plan to murder the former MNA.\nOn a lead provided by held Farooq, the CTD had conducted a raid near the Kakri ground in Lyari and apprehended other three accused presons. At a press conference, the CTD had claimed that the accused were affiliated with criminal gangs operating in Lyari.\nThe prosecution stated that the accused had tried to torch a motorcycle used in the crime in a Lyari locality.\nIt said that accused Haseeb disclosed that absconding accused Ghulam Mustafa sent him to the Soldier Bazaar area to meet an unknown person who gave him Rs800,000 for killing the former MNA. He said he had handed the amount to Mustafa.\nA case was registered at the Gizri police station on the complaint of victim\u2019s father Akhlaq Hussain Abidi under Sections 302 (premeditated murder), 109 (abetment) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code read with Section 7 of the ATA.\nIt may be noted that complainant Akhlaq Abidi passed away around two years ago.\n"

            "Text": "KARACHI: Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Monday inaugurated a week-long anti-polio campaign across 24 districts by administering polio drops to children at the newly established health facility in Gadap.\nHe urged parents to protect their children from the crippling disease by providing them with oral vaccines.\n\u201cTogether, as a community, let us forge a path towards a polio-free environment, securing a healthier future for our children,\u201d he said while speaking at the inauguration ceremony of the anti-polio campaign.\nThe programme was attended by Health Minister Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho, Health Secretary Rehan Baloch and others.\nThe health department launched a Sub-National Immunisation Days (NIDs) campaign from April 29 to May 5. The crucial initiative aims at vaccinating approximately eight million children under the age of five against poliovirus in 24 districts of Sindh.\nOver 62,000 front-line workers will work throughout the province, ensuring every eligible child receives that life-saving vaccine. The massive effort will be supported by almost 4,000 security personnel. \nThe CM urged all schools, hospitals, and caregivers to welcome vaccinators, as they were truly fighting on the frontline in the last stages of our battle against that debilitating disease.\nThe health minister said that the campaign was aimed at stopping the alarming trend of positive environmental samples in Sindh and all over Pakistan, threatening the health of children.\nIn recent reports, 11 positive environmental samples had been isolated from various sites in Sindh. That situation underscored the urgency of that vaccination drive, she said, adding that Pakistan and Afghanistan were the two remaining endemic countries, and interrupting virus transmission in this epidemiological block was critical to eradicating polio.\nThe polio programmes of both countries were united in a single mission to protect children from lifelong disability and end polio in the region, she said.\nThe CM said that despite security challenges and persistent virus clusters, efforts were ongoing to ensure vaccination of every child. \n\u201cTo ensure no child is left unprotected, we encourage parents whose children are missed to contact the Emergency Operations Centre\u2019s Sehat Tahaffuz Helpline 1166,\u201d he said.\nThe media plays a pivotal role in disseminating critical information, he said and urged journalists and community leaders to rally support for the ongoing anti-polio campaign, echoing the endorsement of medical experts and religious scholars who advocate for the safety and efficacy of the oral polio vaccine.\nMeanwhile, Karachi Mayor Barrister Murtaza Wahab said that 1.8 million children would be vaccinated against polio during the week-long campaign in Karachi.\nHe said this while talking to media representatives after administering polio drops to children at the SMB Fatima School Garden on Monday. \u201cWe will try to achieve this goal in the next seven days,\u201d he added.\n"

            "Text": "KARACHI: Lovers of music were treated to an impressive playlist of Punjabi songs on Sunday evening sung by Sawera Ali, who had especially flown in from Lahore to take part in the National Academy of Performing Arts\u2019 (Napa) ongoing first Women\u2019s Festival. \nAlthough the programme was highlighted as \u2018Punjabi folk renditions\u2019, the vocalist presented a decent range of numbers, including films songs made immortal by none other than the late Noor Jehan.\nSawera began by singing Sajna raah tera tak tak haariyan from the movie Jatt Mirza. She sang it pretty well. It\u2019s not an easy track to master. The second song, too, wasn\u2019t simple enough to perform. It was Ki dam da bharosa yaar from the film Sakhi Badshah. By this time it was evident that the vocalist was comfortable hitting higher notes and worked harder on the lower ones. The result was good.\nThen came the well-known number Main te mera dilbar jani. At that point in time the audience, which were sparse considering the fact that it was a holiday, were completely invested in the concert. Some of them had begun clapping to the beat. Sensing what the attendees were swaying to, Sawera\u2019s next offering was the extremely popular Sayuni mera maahi. It was an instant hit. No different was the case with Dildar sadqey. One should be reminded that while these songs sound easy to perform, they are not uncomplicated compositions. Therefore, the young artist must be commended for her effort.\nIn between the performances, she asked the audience what they would like to hear. A couple of requests came her way. The first one that she presented complying with the farmayesh was Laiyan laiyan. Next up was a track of her own choosing, Rab jaaney after which she sang a few more famous songs such as Maahi aavey ga and Kaindey ne naina. They were warmly received.\nOne was really impressed with the remarkable set of musicians that accompanied Sawera Ali on stage, led by Salman Nazeer (on keyboard). The band, especially its percussionist, was absolutely superb. The kind of tunes that she was singing required a highly professional group of instrumentalists. But they went a step ahead and amplified the effect of the show beautifully with their brilliant musicianship. It was a special experience listening to them.\n"

To date, these units have treated over 1.3 million patients without cost,\u201d he said. \nAccording to Prof Saghir, NICVD\u2019s main hospital, satellite centres, and chest pain units treat over 2.4m patients every year while over 20,000 primary angioplasties and 10,000 early invasive and elective angioplasties are performed annually.\nHe announced the introduction of a new treatment modality for acute stroke at NICVD Karachi and NICVD Tando Muhammad Khan.\nIn reply to a question, he explained that acute stroke intervention could reverse the effects of stroke by removing blood clots in the brain vessels.\n\u201cWe are the first institution in Sindh to offer this life-saving treatment without any charge. The programme will soon be available at NICVD Sukkur as well.\u201d\nHe also shared details about the collaboration with Sheikh Mohamed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan Institute of Cardiology in Quetta. Through this partnership, he said, NICVD would be expanding its reach to provide free paediatric cardiac services to the people of Balochistan.\nProf Saghir acknowledged what he described as \u201cinvaluable support of the Sindh government\u201d that had been instrumental in providing high quality care to thousands of patients from other provinces of Pakistan as well.\nA state-of-the-art MRI machine, he said, had been installed at the hospital, enhancing the institute\u2019s diagnostic capabilities.\n\u201cThis latest technology will provide patients with high-quality imaging services, aiding in the accurate diagnosis and treatment planning for cardiovascular and related conditions,\u201d he said.\n"

There was no intensive care unit at Tando Allahyar district headquarters hospital, he said.\nThe DC said that when he asked EPI focal person and staff to share three months plan for measles they could not produce it. Three children whose deaths were reported in first phase lived in Hyderabad but Chandro Meo Rajput village was their native area, he said.\nMeanwhile, Atif son of Asif, died in Liaquat University Hospital (LUH) Hyderabad, taking the toll to six. He was put on ventilator in view of his critical condition. Atif had to be shifted to LUH under DC\u2019s advice two days back. \nTwo more deaths of children were reported from Tando Allahyar. Local reporters said that three-year-old Younus Mallah, a resident of Bukera, and a year old Azam Rajar, a resident of Bashir Memon village, died of measles. Their deaths had not been confirmed yet. Nine-month-old Mubashira daughter of Rafiq of the same family from the Chandro Meo village was admitted to district hospital.\n"

If reports of cheating came from any examination centre the very paper of that day would be cancelled and rescheduled, he warned. \nHe said that the department would approach chief minister and chief secretary to put in place effective and foolproof security arrangements during the \nexaminations. The use of mobile phones would be completely banned while uninterrupted electricity supply would be ensured after contacting chiefs of power utilities, he said.\nThe minister said in answer to a question that if any irregularities regarding examination and assessment process were communicated by any board, a third party would be asked to investigate the charges. \nHe said that he had waged the fight against cheating on the instructions of Pakistan Peoples Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Ms Faryal Talpur. \nHe disclosed that a fully computerised system would be introduced in the boards on the pattern of Sindh Public Service Commission and IBA so that the candidates would have easy access to the system right from filling out examination forms to getting admission slips and result cards online. This mechanism would be evolved in consultation with all stakeholders, he said.\nHe said the Sindh government would be approached to get the boards\u2019 arrears cleared.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: Delivering his maiden speech in the National Assembly, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Monday lambasted the \u201cestablishment\u201d for \u201cconstantly interfering\u201d in politics and announced his party\u2019s plan to launch a protest movement from next month against the alleged rigging in the Feb 8 polls.\nThe announcement from the JUI-F chief to begin the protest movement with a \u201cmillion march\u201d in Karachi on May 2 came as the National Assembly hastily passed the Tax Laws (Amendment) Act 2024 after suspending the rules and without allowing a general debate, prompting the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) members to lodge a protest and stage a walkout.\nBefore staging the walkout and in an effort to block the passage of the bill, a PTI member pointed out lack of quorum, but Speaker Ayaz Sadiq after a headcount declared the house in order and gave the floor to Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar to present the bill for passage.\nThe JUI-F chief, who had come to the assembly first time after taking oath on Feb 29, announced that his party would hold \u201cmillion march\u201d in Karachi on May 2 and in Peshawar on May 9 and warned against any efforts to stop them from carrying out the rallies. \u201cThis system is not acceptable to us. If anyone tries to stop [protest marches], he will invite trouble for himself,\u201d he warned while asking the PML-N and the PPP to join him, after handing over government to the PTI.\n\nAsks PML-N, PPP to join him; blasts \u2018establishment\u2019 over \u2018interference\u2019 in politics; NA passes first bill in controversial manner\n\n\u201cOut of sympathy, I am asking Nawaz Sharif, [PM] Shehbaz Sharif and my son Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari that if you are the representatives of the people, then let\u2019s face the people together. Leave this power, come and sit here [in the opposition benches] and if the PTI is really a larger group [with seats], then give them the government,\u201d he said, adding that perhaps he would be seen as speaking \u201cfoolish things\u201d.\nRecalling the country\u2019s checkered political history, the Maulana said the country had most of the time remained either under semi-martial laws or complete martial laws. \u201cDoes this parliament represent people or has it been constituted by the establishment?\u201d asked the JUI-F chief while criticising the bureaucracy and the \u201cestablishment\u201d for deciding as to who would become the prime minister.\nThe term \u201cestablishment\u201d is generally referred to the military top brass that has always been accused of manipulating the elections and political process in the country. He said the parliament even could not do legislation without the approval of the powerful quarters. \u201cHow long we will continue to make compromises? How long we will continue to beg before them [establishment]?\u201d he asked. He said they considered that people\u2019s mandate had been stolen in both the 2018 and 2024 elections. He alleged that they had the reports that the assemblies had been \u201csold and purchased\u201d in the recent elections.\nThe JUI-F chief regretted that those who should be \u201csubservient\u201d to the politicians had become their \u201cmasters\u201d. He alleged some forces controlled the country from behind the wall, but politicians were put on the front to take the brunt and abusing from the people.\nThe JUI-F chief also expressed his concerns over the law and order situation and alleged that there was no writ of the state in many parts of the country, especially in Balochistan. He said how the terrorists had returned to the country after becoming more powerful despite successful military operations against them in the past. He recalled that former army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa had announced they had erected a fence on the Pak-Afghan border, then how those 30,000 to 40,000 people managed to cross the border. He said billions of rupees were spent on the border fencing, but \u201cno one is here to be made accountable\u201d.\nThe Maulana said Pakistan was justified in asking the Afghan government as to why it had been failing to prevent the terrorists from entering Pakistan, \u201cbut you are also here on the border\u201d. \u201cPakistan has become an insecure state. Who is responsible for it?\u201d he said, adding that his party was not allowed to run election campaign. He said despite the Taliban\u2019s announcement that they would not carry out any action during the elections, the JUI-F leaders continued to receive \u201cthreat letters\u201d.\n\u201cAs soon as the elections are over, the threat letters have also been stopped,\u201d he said, while questioning as to how the militants succeeded in targeting the JUI-F function in Bajaur in which 80 people were killed.\nThe Maulana also endorsed Asad Qaiser\u2019s demand that the PTI should be allowed to hold public meetings as it was its constitutional right.\nEarlier, Mr Qaiser had condemned the government for not allowing PTI\u2019s rallies and for arresting party workers. He remarked Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi was the \u201creal prime minister\u201d, but warned that if the PTI was pushed to the wall, they would not let this assembly run.\nTax Laws (Amendment) Act\nLater, the NA passed the Tax Laws (Amendment) Act, 2024 seeking to amend the Sales Tax Act, 1990 aimed at expediting the process of the recovery of over Rs2 trillion held up in litigation before the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR).\nThe bill was presented for the passage by the law minister after approval of a motion seeking to suspend the rules under which the bills are referred to the standing committees.\nPTI\u2019s Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and Opposition Leader Omar Ayub Khan demanded that the passage of the law should be deferred till formation of the standing committees. But the minister said they required to pass the bill before the commencement of the next financial year on July 1.\nImmediately after passage of the bill, the speaker then read out the president\u2019s prorogation order.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The Karachi-based K-Electric has sought approval to charge up to Rs18.6 per unit additional fuel cost from power consumers at an average monthly burden of about Rs2 per unit to mop up about Rs28bn additional funds and clear a backlog of about nine months (July 2023 to March 2024).\nIn a series of petitions filed before the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), the KE presented three different options for additional fuel cost recovery from consumers on a \u201cprovisional basis\u201d to clear the backlog and avoid a sudden increase in burden on its consumers.\nNepra has called a public hearing on May 9 for the KE\u2019s petition on provisional monthly fuel charges adjustments (FCA) for the period of July 2023 to March 2024. The KE explained that since its multi-year tariff (2024-30) was currently under regulator\u2019s deliberation, it has filed FCAs based on three scenarios with the request for the approval of any one of the three scenarios and guide recovery mechanism for these nine months to facilitate timely recovery of costs and avoid further accumulation of adjustments to be recovered from customers.\nUnder the first scenario, the KE has proposed that the FCA be calculated as the difference between actual fuel cost and the reference monthly fuel cost as per the interim tariff currently in place. In this option, the KE sought increase in rates for seven months and reduction in rates for two months, with a net additional revenue of about Rs19bn. The cumulative net impact for nine months works out to be about Rs13 per unit or an average of Rs1.45 per unit per month.\n\nHigher FCA won\u2019t apply to \u2018lifeline consumers\u2019\n\nIn the second option, the KE demanded that it be allowed to charge consumers the difference between the actual and reference monthly fuel cost as per the tariff petition filed by the KE and currently under Nepra\u2019s deliberation. In this case, the utility has also sought fuel cost increase for seven months and reduction for two months with the net accumulative additional fuel cost of Rs18.6 per unit at a monthly average of Rs2.06 per unit for nine months to raise about Rs28bn.\nIn the third scenario, the KE proposed that the difference between actual fuel costs versus annual weighted average fuel reference costs being considered as per the tariff petition filed by the KE and currently under Nepra\u2019s deliberation. In this case, too, the utility sought additional fuel cost for seven months and reduction for two months. The net combined impact works out to be Rs16.9 per unit at a monthly average of about Rs1.90 per unit and entails a financial impact of about Rs24bn.\nThe consumers of ex-distribution companies (Discos) have already paid these additional fuel costs ranging between Rs3 and Rs7.5 per unit a month.\nOn approval, Nepra will also set the mechanism and schedule for recovery of increase in FCAs. The FCA is normally reviewed every month as per the tariff regime applicable across the country and is usually applicable to the consumer\u2019s bills for one month only. However, the KE has a backlog given its delayed tariff petitions and regulatory approvals for monthly, quarterly and annual basis.\nThe higher FCA, on approval, would be applicable to all consumer categories except lifeline power consumers and protected domestic consumers using up to 300 units, and agricultural consumers and electric vehicle (EV) charging stations. The adjustment on account of monthly FCA is also applicable to the domestic consumers having Time of Use (ToU) meters irrespective of their consumption level.\nUnder the tariff mechanism, changes in fuel cost are passed on to consumers only on a monthly basis through automatic mechanism while quarterly tariff adjustments on account of variation in power purchase price, capacity charges, variable operation and maintenance costs, use of system charges and including impact of transmission and distribution losses are built in the base tariff by the federal government.\n"

Police not only blocked the road by placing containers, but also arrested several protesters.\nKissan Ittehad Pakistan General Secretary Mian Umair Masood, who led the demonstration, told Dawn that more than 250 farmers were arrested by police in Lahore. He, however, managed to evade arrest himself.\nThere were reports that arrests were also made in Rahim Yar Khan, Khanewal, Vehari, Kasur, Multan, Sadiqabad, Pakpattan, Muzaffargarh, and Sahiwal districts. Police sources, however, claimed 46 protesters were taken into custody: 30 from The Mall and 16 from Manga Mandi.\n\u2018Province-wide protests\u2019\nMian Umair said they were planning to block highways across the province with the help of their families and livestock, which would be brought to roads. The protesting farmers have also found their allies in the opposition, particularly the PTI and the Jammat-i-Islami, as well as in lawmakers from the treasury benches who are apprehensive about the procurement policy.\nThe farming community has found allies in the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf and Jamaat-i-Islami, whose farmer wing Kisan Board is scheduled to hold protests on Tuesday (today), while those ruling PML-N MPAs belonging to the countryside have also expressed their concerns at the present procurement policy.\nThe government, however, continued to play down the issue, with its spokesperson Azma Bukhari claiming that the police had not taken any protest leader into custody from anywhere. She said that the government was in contact with \u201creal representative bodies\u201d of the farmers and accused the workers of a political party of launching the protest for \u201cpolitical purposes\u201d.\nProcurement policy faults\nPunjab \u2014 the bread basket of the country \u2014 procured over 4 million tonnes of wheat every season to meet its yearly requirements. But, this year the authorities decided to slash the procurement target by half, claiming that there was a carryover stock of 2.3m tonnes already available.\nThe caretaker government \u2014 tasked with the day-to-day affairs and overseeing the elections \u2014 imported around 3m tonnes of wheat, which was more than the province\u2019s needs and led to a huge carryover stock leaving little storage capacity.\nLikewise, the government had also changed the procedure for applying to sell wheat to the food department. Unlike in the past when the growers were required to submit written applications to procure gunny bags used to pack and transport wheat to procurement centres, the government launched a mobile application for the purpose, conveniently ignoring the fact that a majority of the rural population is not well-versed in technology.\nEven then, over 400,000 growers applied for gunny bags; but the government said it would issue six bags per acre and only to those who owned up to six acres of land.\nMian Umair said the government\u2019s decision was mala fide. \u201cOwners of up to six acres of land rarely sell their wheat to the government because they retain almost half of the produce for domestic use and the rest is meant for the aarti (middlemen), fertiliser, and pesticides dealers from whom they had made purchases for their fields on credit.\nSimilarly, the procurement campaign has also been unusually delayed this year, crashing the local wheat market with middlemen exploiting the situation by buying wheat from the growers at much less than the officially fixed minimum support price of Rs3,900 per 40kg.\nThese steps raised many an eyebrow even among the ruling party\u2019s elected representatives. The issue also resonated multiple times in the Punjab Assembly and a general discussion was also held.\n\u2018Above normal moisture\u2019\nWithout clearly committing when to start the procurement drive, Food Minister Bilal Yasin defended the delay saying due to rains the grain carried above normal moisture up to 18 percent. \u201cAfter drying up this produce will lose weight causing financial loss to the provincial kitty,\u201d he claimed.\nMeanwhile, the government is trying to appease the farming community by feeding information that it is considering a Rs130 billion package and also planning to give a subsidy between Rs400 and Rs600 per 40kg instead of increasing the procurement target.\nBut Kissan Ittehad leader Khalid Batth voiced his suspicion, saying the government would use this policy \u201cas a ploy to relieve pressure\u201d from the farming community for the time being.\nSuch dilly-dallying measures are disturbing even for the ruling party members, who are under pressure from their rural electorate. Punjab Assembly speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmed Khan refused to prorogue the ongoing assembly session, which was to be put off sine die on Monday, when the finance and food ministers said the government would give a wheat policy on Tuesday (today).

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: Clearing the air after months of confusion and speculation, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) on Mon\u00adday finally designated Khyber Pakh\u00adtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and parliamentary opposition leaders Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz to hold talks with the military establishment.\nTheir names were confirmed by PTI founding chairman and former prime minister Imran Khan while speaking to media persons inside Adiala Jail following the hearing of a \u00a3190m corruption case.\nWhen asked if the PTI is still holding talks with the establishment, Mr Khan said: \u201cI have authorised Ali Amin, Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz for these dialogues.\u201d\nHe made it clear that no one, except these three leaders, has been authorised to hold talks with the establishment.\nReferring to the court order restraining him from speaking against institutions, Mr Khan insisted he never disrespected any state entity and that the directive is against his fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution.\nHe regretted that a petition against violation of human rig\u00adhts pending before the Supreme Court was not being heard. Mr Khan expressed the hope that uncertainty about the nomination of chairman of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) would end on Tuesday (today).\nHe said initially PTI leader Sher Afzal Khan Marwat was nominated for the post; however, he wanted more consultations on this matter. According to him, the jail authorities gave him only half an hour for consultation, which is not a reasonable time for such a serious deliberation.\nThe former PM endorsed the KP chief minister\u2019s statement threatening to storm Islamabad over unfulfilled commitments made by the federal government, saying the Centre is not giving the due share to the provincial government.\nEarlier, talking to journalists outside Adiala Jail, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan had denied any backchannel dialogues with the establishment. \u201cWe are not holding dialogue with anyone,\u201d he said, adding that the PTI did not nominate any leader for holding talks with the establishment; however, Imran Khan might make an announcement in this regard.\nMeanwhile, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said he was unaware of any talks or an \u201cimminent deal\u201d between the PTI and the military establishment.\nWhen asked about the issue by reporters during an appearance in Islamabad on Monday, he said he had no such information.\nHe also did not give a clear answer when asked if the names of some PTI leaders had been struck off the ECL, saying names were removed from the ECL through a standard procedure.\nCourt proceedings\nAccountability Court judge Nasir Javed Rana recorded statements of four witnesses in the \u00a3190m corruption reference, the defence counsel cross-examined one witness.\nThe court has so far recorded the testimonies of 25 witnesses, out of them 16 have been cross-examined.\nMeanwhile, the Islamabad High Court adjourned the hearing of bail petitions filed by Imran Khan and his spouse Bushra Bibi in the \u00a3190m corruption case because of the absence of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) special prosecutor.\nAn IHC division bench comprising Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri resumed the hearing on the bail petitions. The counsel of Imran Khan told the court that he travelled all the way from Lahore to attend the hearing.\nJustice Farooq said he was also not feeling well, but came for the hearing of this particular case. He warned the prosecution that no further adjournment would be made and the court would decide the bail petition on merits.\n"

The problem is that most people think that donating blood is not good for their health, which is incorrect medically, and every healthy person can give blood every three months,\u201d he said. \nHe, however, said the donors should be screened for certain diseases. \n\u201cAs per plans, we want to do one bone marrow transplant on alternate days, as the incidence of these cases is very high. We\u2019ll later expand services to cover a larger population,\u201d he said.\nDr Amjad said after the approval of the plans for the RBC\u2019s autonomy, rules would be relaxed for procurement and hiring for the institute.\n"

The consumer court again conducted an inquiry, which also endorsed the plea of RPDC\u2019s administration and the assistant director consumer protection.\nConsumer court judge Ms Muneera Abbasi had, upon completion of arguments from both the sides, again on November 16, 2022, issued an oral order asking the DC to vacate the playground within a week.\nBut the DC office again moved the Peshawar High Court\u2019s Abbottabad Bench, seeking the cancellation of consumer court\u2019s order. \nThe provincial scrutiny committee led by provincial law secretary discussed the matter of litigation between the DC office and principal RPDC on Feb 15, 2023, and advised that the writ petition pending with the PHC\u2019s Abbottabad Bench should be withdrawn.\nThe additional advocate general and additional assistant commissioner revenue, Haripur, Ejaz Ahmed Jadoon appeared before the court on behalf of the petitioner, deputy commissioner, and prayed for the withdrawal of the writ petition. The PHC bench allowed the same on April 4, 2024, leading to removal of cabins from the playground.\nWhen contacted, RPDC principal Hanifullah told Dawn the administration had removed the cabins on the orders of provincial secretary law. \n"

He said the hybrid seed technology increased corn production and suggested adopting modern trends to break the stagnation in other crops.  \nHe said that while wheat production per acre is limited to 30 maunds, progressive farmers are achieving 60 to 70 maunds, and the UAF is introducing soybeans, climate-resistant wheat, high-yielding sugarcane, cotton, and other commodities to boost agricultural prosperity.\nNational Seed Development and Regulatory Authority Chairman Dr Asif Ali said that increasing wheat production from 30 to 50 maunds per acre could reduce the current nine million hectares of wheat cultivation to 6.5 million hectares, allowing the remaining 2.5 million hectares to be used for other crops. He said public-private partnerships should be promoted to ensure the production and delivery of quality seeds.\nHe said due to hybrid seed, India is getting 31.8 million bales of cotton while Pakistan is getting up to 8.35 million bales. He said that all possible measures are being taken to prepare quality seeds and deliver them to the farmers under the seed authority.\nPro-Vice Chancellor Dr Muhammad Sarwar Khan said that quality seeds ensure high production and announced the establishment of a seed centre at the UAF with the cooperation of the Federal Ministry of Science and Technology. He highlighted the need for viable and innovative trends to break the stagnation in crop production, mentioning two new varieties of sugarcane developed by UAF as potential milestones in improving farmers\u2019 economic conditions.\nFederal Seed Certification and Registration Department Director General Mohammad Azim Khan urged joint efforts to catch up in hybrid seed technology, while Dr Irfan Afzal called for strengthened academia-industry linkages, knowledge-based economies, and innovation in agriculture.\n"

Sources said the PM was expected to chair a conference on Tuesday (today), but on Monday night it was postponed for a few days because of his other engagements. \nPakistan has 26.2 million out-of-school children (OOSC). Besides the OOSC crisis, the country is also facing the low literacy rate of 62pc. Likewise, the government\u2019s dismal spending of 1.7pc of the Gross Domestic Product (GPD) in the education sector is a matter of concern. Similarly, disparity in the availability of essential facilities such as toilets, potable water and boundary walls in schools in different parts of the country is also a matter of concern. A large number of schools across the country, particularly in the peripheries, are without potable water and other basic facilities.\nLast month, Federal Education Minister Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui after getting a briefing from officials about OOSC and other educational facilities across the country had said he would request the prime minister and the federal cabinet to declare a national education emergency.\n\nNational conference to devise strategies, initiatives to ensure inclusive, quality education for all children, says ministry\n\nPakistan Education Statistics in its recent report for 2021-22 pointed out that there were 26.21 million OOSC in the country. The report stated that 39pc children in Pakistan were out of school: 11.73 million in Punjab, 7.63m in Sindh, 3.63m in KP, 3.13m in Balochistan and 0.08 million in Islamabad.\nThe education ministry before the meeting was postponed on Monday issued a press release which stated: \u201cWith a commitment to leave no child behind, the National Conference on Education Emergency underscores Pakistan\u2019s dedication to building a more equitable and prosperous society through.\u201d \nIt said the National Conference on Education Emergency scheduled to take place at the Prime Minister\u2019s Office on April 30 [now postponed] aims to address the pressing issues of out-of-school children, learning poverty and to provide support to lagging districts across Pakistan.\u201d \nChaired by the prime minister, the event will be attended by chief ministers, country heads of development partners, diplomats, foreign delegates and educationists from around the globe.\n\u201cThe conference serves as a platform for collaborative efforts, bringing together key stakeholders to devise effective strategies and initiatives to ensure inclusive and quality education for all children in Pakistan. Through targeted interventions and collective action, the conference seeks to pave the way for transformative change in the education sector, fostering a brighter future for the nation,\u201d the press release said.\nA source said due to PM\u2019s engagement in Saudi Arabia, the proposed conference had been postponed for a week.\nWhen contacted, Secretary Education Mohyuddin Ahmad Wani said that bringing improvement to the education sector was main the agenda of the federal and provincial governments. He said that on the direction of the PM and education minister, the education ministry in collaboration with all stakeholders was taking steps to bring improvement.\n"

Mr Cheema directed the authorities concerned that a standard polio campaign should be organised in the district and vaccination should be done at the entry and exit points.\nHe said that multiple doses of vaccine provide the best protection against the virus, so parents should welcome polio teams until polio is completely eradicated.

Now, June\u2019s end is the cut-off date for the department to hand over the hospital to its administration.\n\nNew deadline for the hospital is June now; hospital official says facility will be operational by July-end\n\nHowever, sources said the hospital would likely become functional by the end of July since the pace of the work had been sluggish for the past two weeks.\n\u201c\u2026we have completed 72 per cent of the work so far,\u201d a senior official of the Communication and Works department told Dawn. He said that the work in the old block of the hospital had been completed while the construction work in the new block was going to end by next month. \n\u201cThere is no shortage of funds; hitherto, we have received almost Rs2.548 billion and all of the money has been utilised,\u201d he said.\nAccording to the official, the work on the ground floor and first floor of the new block is completed up to 93 per cent whereas more than half of the work in the basement is needed to be completed. He claimed one more month was needed to wrap up the work. \nHe said that the provincial government wanted to complete the work as soon as possible as the patients were suffering due to the closure of the \u201clargest hospital\u201d in the garrison city for the last five months. \nA senior doctor at the hospital told Dawn that due to the closure of the HFH, the patients had to visit the Benazir hospital and the district headquarters hospital, putting extra burden on these facilities.\nThe hospital has a total area of 672,000 square feet. \nThe number of beds in the hospital is 1,030 whereas the average number of patients reported in its OPD is 2,161 and 915 patients in the emergency department on a daily basis.\nMeanwhile, District Coordination Committee Chairman Qamarul Islam Raja visited the hospital on the instructions of Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz and issued instructions to the relevant officials to ensure the timely completion of the hospital. \nHe directed the Communication and Works Department to wrap up the construction work and hand it over to the hospital administration in July.\nQamarul Islam Raja visited Holy Family Hospital accompanied by Rawalpindi Medical University (RMU) Vice Chancellor Professor Dr. Muhammad Umar. \nHe was given a briefing about the new proposed PC-1. The officials informed him about the extra funds to the tune of Rs700 million required for new facilities, like air conditioning and the heating system.\nQamarul Islam Raja asked them to prepare the revised PC-I regarding future needs so the government could decide about it soon.\n"

Today, as we gather to commemorate King Willem-Alexander\u2019s birthday on King\u2019s Day, we emphasise the enduring partnership and friendship between the Netherlands and Pakistan during these turbulent times globally. It is in times like these that it is even more important for us all to stand still and appreciate and celebrate what connects us rather than what divides us.\u201d\n\u201cThe Netherlands and Pakistan have forged a strong bond transcending geographical boundaries throughout history, despite our differences. In times of adversity, the Netherlands and Pakistan have consistently stood in solidarity with each other, offering invaluable support during critical moments,\u201d she added.\nRecognising the numerous conflicts and rising tensions in the world \u2014 near and far \u2014 she said 2024 promised to be an important year with half of the world\u2019s population voting for new governments.\n\n\nDutch Ambassador Henny de Vries speaks at the event held to celebrate the birthday of King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands.

The Netherlands is deeply concerned by the ongoing conflict in Gaza. We call for an immediate ceasefire leading to a lasting cessation of hostilities and a drastic scale-up of humanitarian aid,\u201d she added.\nThe chief guest, Industries and Production Minister Rana Tanveer Hussain congratulated the embassy on the auspicious occasion and extended his wish for the prosperity and progress of the Netherlands.\n\u201cI am confident that with common efforts, the friendly relations and good cooperation existing between our two countries will be further strengthened and fruitfully bolstered in the coming years for the benefit of both nations, thus contributing to peace, stability, and development cooperation,\u201d he said.\nThe embassy invited two wonderful musicians from the Netherlands to collaborate with local musicians and entertain the guests throughout the evening, playing both the national anthems of the two nations as well as traditional songs.\nEva Aukes is a distinguished Dutch classical guitarist who has significantly contributed to the vibrant Dutch music scene through solo performances and collaborations with various groups in concert halls and festivals across the country.\nShe is also a founding member of the Dutch trio DEBU, focusing on interpreting Claude Debussy\u2019s piano music. Anastasia Fridman, a versatile violinist and erhu performer, is a sought-after soloist for private and corporate events, presenting a diverse repertoire. Pursuing a Master\u2019s at Codarts, Rotterdam, she contributes significantly to cross-cultural musical exploration.\nWajih Nizami and Irfan Khan, from the RUNG School in Karachi, performed with the visiting musicians.\nThe evening ended with a fabulous dinner, with numerous live stations in the courtyard and seating indoors.\n"

Referring to a World Bank report, he said that there was ample room to increase tax on tobacco products. \n\u201cThe government can generate additional Rs65 billion from the industry by increasing the tax up to 26pc,\u201d he stated.\nHe said the draft of proposal had been shared with Dr Bharath in which it had been stated that this approach has the potential to yield a \u201ctriple win\u201d for Pakistan: a reduction in the number of smokers by 517,000, a 12.1pc increase in tax revenue for the government and a 19.8pc recovery of healthcare costs associated with tobacco use.\u201d\nMr Imran said tobacco use was the leading cause of preventable deaths in Pakistan, claiming over 160,000 lives annually. He said the economic burden was equally significant with smoking-related illnesses and deaths costing Pakistan 1.4pc of its GDP each year.\nHDF Programme Manager Zahid Shafiq said: \u201cIf the traditional forms weren\u2019t enough, the tobacco industry has also flooded the market with novel products (nicotine pouches, e-cigarettes and heated tobacco devices) which are openly sold to youth through point-of-sales advertising and extensive social media campaigns. There is a need to ban all forms of novel products immediately before our youth becomes addicted to them.\u201d He urged the government to consider a significant increase in tobacco taxes. \n\u201cThe policy change will not only generate substantial revenue for the national economy and healthcare system but, more importantly, will also save countless lives,\u201d he added.\n"

However, on Monday morning, heavy rain and hailstorms again lashed different parts of the region and continued till the afternoon.\nRainwater accumulated in the fields due to which the chaff and grains were likely to get spoiled, said Raja Mohammad Afzal of Negail.\nDora Budhaal village, Mohreeh Rajgan, Dhoke Amb, Guliana Mor, Dulmi and Mandra villages were also hit by hailstorms.\nThe uncertain weather conditions have rendered farmers helpless and they see rains during the harvest not less than a calamity, said Lumbardar Athar of Dora Budhaal.\nThe wheat crop was ready for harvest and the strong wind and showers spoiled it,\u201d said Mohammad Akhtar, a landowner in Rawat.\nOn the other hand, the rain followed by cool winds brought down the temperature in the twin cities. \n\u201cThe temperature will remain down in the next 24 hours,\u201d said an official at the Met Office. The rain brought down the maximum temperature from 29 to 26 degrees Celsius in the capital and 29 to 27 degrees in Rawalpindi. The Meteorological Department recorded 2mm of rain at Zero Point, 3mm at Airport and 1mm each at Bokra and Golra in Islamabad; 3mm at Kutchery and 2mm at Shamsabad and Chaklala in Rawalpindi. It also recorded winds with the speed of 40km per hour.\nThe official said a strong westerly wave was affecting upper parts of the country and likely to persist during next 24 to 36 hours. He said that dry weather with gusty winds was likely in most parts of the country. More rain-windstorm/thunderstorm (with isolated hailstorm) is expected at isolated places in upper Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, upper Punjab, Islamabad, Gilgit-Baltistan and Kashmir.\nHe said isolated/moderate to heavy rainfall may generate flash floods in nullahs/streams of Dir, Swat, Chitral, Mansehra, Kohistan and Kashmir. Heavy fall may cause landslides in upper KP, Murree, Galiyat, Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan. \nThe official said that in May normal to slightly above normal precipitation was likely over most parts of the country. Almost normal rainfall is likely over most parts of the country in June, he added.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Wednesday approved a Rs392 billion investment plan for K-Electric\u2019s transmission and distribution network to reduce system losses and meet demand growth over the next seven years.\nUnder the decision, the Karachi-based private power utility has been allowed to invest over Rs238bn in the transmission network, Rs137bn in the distribution network, and another Rs17bn in related support systems like defence, cybersecurity, information technology, resource planning, etc., from FY24 to FY30.\nThe approval comes almost one and a half years after the privatised entity sought Rs484bn worth of a seven-year investment plan, on which the regulator conducted a public hearing on March 1, 2023.\nNepra, in its decision, noted that the KE took the stance that subsidy was the government\u2019s prerogative and dependent on multiple factors. The KE said that its claimed investment of Rs484bn would result in a Rs3.2 per unit increase in tariff based on an exchange rate of Rs206 to a dollar on account of Rs1.9 per unit in transmission tariff and Rs1.3 per unit in distribution tariff. While the investment has been reduced from Rs484bn to Rs392bn, the exchange rate has since deteriorated to Rs280 per dollar. \u201cSince there is a uniform tariff in the country, thus the subsidy will be impacted. However, this issue will be discussed and finalised during the proceedings of supply tariff,\u201d the regulator noted.\nThe investment plan involves 14 growth projects to meet the future load growth of the customers at total cost of Rs120bn in Multi-year Tariff (MYT) control period from FY24 to FY30. Out of this total amount, Rs80bn has been allowed against KE\u2019s claim for Rs85bn for the growth projects related to grid stations. Another Rs41bn has been allowed for transmission lines for growth against a claim of Rs55bn.\nThis would involve adding 450km of transmission lines, 13 new grid stations, and enhancing the transformation capacity to 755MVA (megavolte amperes) at the 132 kV voltage level and 3,800MVA at the 220 kV and above voltage level.\nKE had claimed customs duties at the rate of 15pc on the foreign cost component (FCC) of the transmission projects which was reduced to 8pc by Nerpa in line with past precedents in the case of 660 kV high voltage transmission line from Matiari to Lahore. The custom duties shall be allowed as per actual, subject to the certification and third-party audit to be provided by KE.\nLikewise, KE had claimed the cost of interest during construction (lDC) at 20pc, which was accepted by Nepra on provisional basis. However, it held that IDC shall be allowed only for the allowed completion period and shall be worked out based on the cost of debt, to be allowed in the tariff determination.\nLoss reduction\nOn the distribution side, Nepra allowed the biggest chunk, Rs43bn, of the total Rs137bn investment to be spent on energy loss reduction, followed by Rs30bn for distribution network maintenance and Rs29bn for distribution growth. About Rs20bn would be spent on distribution safety.\nNepra noted that most of the growth projects on the transmission side were primarily demand-driven projects, as KE had estimated a yearly demand growth rate of 2.4pc to justify the proposed investment. According to KE, if the demand turned out to be higher or lower than expected, the timing of these projects would need to be adjusted to match the actual demand to ensure that the resources were used efficiently and the customers were not burdened with the cost of non-utilisation of assets.\n"

This reflects a decrease of 8pc year-on-year but an increase of 10pc quarter-on-quarter.\nHigher operating expenses and interest expenses dragged down overall profitability on a year-over-year basis. However, lower income was the primary factor affecting profitability on a quarter-over-quarter basis. As a result, the bank announced a cash dividend of Rs2 per share.\nAllied Bank profit surges\nAllied Bank Ltd (ABL) reported PAT of Rs11.6bn and EPS at Rs10.14 for 1QCY24, an increase of 51pc year-on-year. However, quarter-on-quarter, it was down 5pc (4QCY23 EPS: Rs10.7).\nThe decrease in earnings QoQ was mainly attributed to reduced markup and non-markup income. However, on a YoY basis, higher income and provisioning reversals contributed to an increase in overall profitability.\n"

Thus to safeguard law, Consti\u00adtution and fundamental rights of the citizens of Pakistan, a comprehensive investigation into these allegations is not only justified but necessary, it had emphasised.\n\u201cThis is our response to the Supreme Court and it will remain so,\u201d Mr Naek explained.\nGovt reluctance\nA source privy to the development told Dawn that the federal government may also not furnish any reply or suggestion to the Supreme Court, since it believes that it is an institutional matter and should be decided within the institution.\nBesides, he explained, there was no need of giving any reply when the IHC judges had accused the government or institutions of meddling into the judicial affairs. However, the government will follow any directions issued by the court.\nSince a number of petitions have also been filed before the apex court, the source said, it is likely that the SC may consider issuing notices to the respondents and may give another opportunity to the bar associations to furnish their response.\nAnother plea\nOn Wednesday, the Balochis\u00adtan Bar Council and the Baloch\u00adistan High Court Bar Association moved separate petitions before the Supreme Court seeking a direction that illegal acts of meddling into judicial affairs should be declared unconstitutional and unlawful rather a threat to the rule of law, access to justice and independence of judiciary.\nThe court should also ord\u00ader the federal government to deal in accordance with law with those who were found involved in such matters.\n"

Special prosecutor of the National Accounta\u00adbility Bureau (NAB), Amjad Pervaiz, was also absent.\nHis associate informed the court that since there was no intimation about the fixing of the case, Mr Pervaiz could not come from Lahore. Justice Farooq responded that the bail petitions are automatically fixed after a certain period.\nThe court, however, asked the counsel of Mr Khan, Sardar Latif Khan Khosa, to advance the arguments. Mr Khosa argued that the amount in question was transferred from the UK to Pakistan under an agreement, which was then deposited into the Supreme Court\u2019s account.\nJustice Jahangiri inquired about how the amount landed in the SC\u2019s accounts. Mr Khosa replied that it was transferred under a confidential deed signed by the then adviser on accountability, Miraz Shahzad Akbar.\nAdvocate Khosa added that the Supreme Court opened an account into which Malik Riaz was asked to deposit Rs460 billion. Justice Jahangiri further inquired if the amount was crime proceeds and why it was frozen in the UK.\nThe counsel replied that it was a suspicious transaction, which was later cleared.\nThe court questioned why the adviser of the then prime minister was a signatory of an agreement between the National Crime Agency UK and the property tycoon Malik Riaz, and why the private agreement was presented before the federal cabinet for approval.\nThe court adjourned further hearing till April 29.\n"

Initially, Mr Nasibullah emerged victorious in the Feb 8 election, but his win was contested by opponents who alleged rigging in certain polling stations.\n\nPkMAP candidate challenges by-election results in PB-50, cites irregularities\n\nFollowing hearings, the ECP ordered re-polling in seven stations, subsequently declaring Nawab Jangeez Khan Marri as the winner. However, after his opponent once again approa-ched the Election Commission with rigging complaints, the ECP ordered re-polling in four stations.\nThe situation turned violent last night when unidentified assailants launched rockets near the election camp of Mir Nasibullah Marri, killing one of his supporters.\nAdditional rockets and landmine explosions followed in the Nasao area of Kohlu, causing damage to property, including a vehicle. Gunfire also took place in the area, in which a Levies soldier was injured.\nThe situation in the area remains tense, with the district administration deploying a heavy contingent of security forces.\nPB-50 results challenged\nMirwais Khan Achakzai, the Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) candidate for the provincial constituency PB-50 (Qila Abdullah), has rejected the April 21 by-election results.\nDuring a press conference in Quetta on Wednesday, Mr Achakzai, flanked by party Secretary General Abdul Rahim Ziaratwal and other party members, insisted that he was the rightful winner and called for the returning officer to release the actual Form 45 results that he claimed showed his victory.\nMr Achakzai alleged that during the by-election, held under directives from the Supreme Court, the polling stations had been improperly staffed by supporters of his opponent, who acted as polling officials.\nHe also claimed that on the eve of the elections, staff from five polling stations were abducted. He said a complaint was formally lodged with both the Election Commission of Pakistan and the returning officer concerned, but it went unresolved.\nAccording to Mr Achakzai, the absence of polling staff led to fraudulent activities at the stations, where presiding officers allegedly produced fake Form 45s that were accepted by the returning officer.\nHe highlighted discrepancies, such as voter turnout being lower than the total votes reported and missing ballots. He noted that some presiding officers had sent letters to their polling agents pointing out these irregularities.\nMr Achakzai also expressed his concern over procedural breaches, mentioning that two separate Form 47s were sent \u2014 one on the polling day and another the following day \u2014 which he deemed a clear violation of the Elections Act and Rules of 2017.\n\u201cWe demand that our victory be officially recognised by a margin of over 14,000 votes and that those involved in the election manipulation be held accountable under the law,\u201d he said.\n"

He stated that in 2018, another drug inspector, Uzma Khalid, took a sample of tablet Septran, batch number HSBDS, manufactured by GSK and sent to Drug Testing Laboratory Rawalpindi, which had declared the drug substandard.\nThe representatives of the company were charge-sheeted by the court in February 2023. However, all the accused pleaded not guilty to the charges and faced a trial.\nThe judgement said that GSK, with an estimated net worth of $82.38 billion, has production and quality control units. However, it did not bother to recall or stop marketing the drug, nor did it conduct any inquiry regarding the manufacturing of the substandard drug.\nThe court found the company\u2019s CEO, production manager, quality control manager and warrantor guilty.\nThe CEO was awarded imprisonment until the rising of the court and an overall fine of Rs4.7 million. She may face three months in prison if she fails to pay the fine.\nThe three others have each been awarded two years in prison and a fine of Rs600,000. They will face an additional six months\u2019 imprisonment each in case of failure to pay the fines.\nHowever, GSK Secretary Agha Salman Taimur has announced the company\u2019s intention to challenge the judgement before the appellate forum.\nIn a letter to the Pakistan Stock Exchange,  seen by Dawn, he wrote: \u201cGSK as well as the officers impleaded in the proceedings hereby  deny any sort of wrongdoing in the matter and are taking immediate steps  to challenge the aforementioned judgment before the appellate forum.\u201d\nVerdict triggers debate\nThe judgement was announced by a three-member bench headed by Chairman Drug Court Rawalpindi, Nadeem Babar Khan, and has triggered a debate in the pharmaceutical sector and health fraternity.\nWhile explaining the case, Pakistan Drug Lawyers Forum President Noor Muhammad Mahar said that there was nothing wrong with the quality of the medicine.\n\u201cIn simple words, it had an accurate percentage of molecules, but during testing, the dissolution time of the tablet was not accurate. The tablet was taking more time to disintegrate,\u201d he said.\nWhen asked about the dissolution, he explained that film-coated tablets disintegrated within 30 minutes in the stomach and other coated tablets disintegrated within 60 minutes. If a tablet took more time to disintegrate, it would take more time to cure the ailment.\n\u201cAll medicines should disintegrate as per the standards of the US Pharmacopoeia, and action can be taken in case of any difference. However, even I could not digest the imprisonment.\u201d\nHe feared that this verdict may prompt a campaign to amend the Drug Act and tone down the punishments contained in it. \u201cIf this happens, in the future, we will see only the imposition of fines instead of imprisonment,\u201d he said.\nMr Mahar warned that the decision could have a negative impact, and patients would ultimately suffer as laws might be relaxed in the future and the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap) could become dysfunctional. He suggested establishing a commission to look into the case.\nThe head of a pharmaceutical company, who asked not to be named, said that he had never heard of such a decision before.\n\u201cIt seems that the decision was taken because of some issue, as the court was issuing notices again and again but the company was not taking it seriously. The company representatives should have been more submissive in court rather than arguing too much. This decision serves as a lesson for other companies as well,\u201d he said.\nA senior officer of the health ministry, requesting anonymity, said that the courts make decisions according to the law.\n\u201cAll courts have the power to take strict action and award imprisonment, so pharmaceutical companies should not take the drug courts lightly,\u201d he said.\n"

A strict action may be taken against those found guilty in the light of inquiry report, he adds.\nThose injured in the incident have been shifted to Rasheeda Shafi Trauma Centre at the ABSTH, where their condition is said to be stable, hospital sources say. They say that four other persons who suffered minor injuries in the incident have been discharged after provision of first aid.\nPunjab Health Minister Khwaja Salman Rafique, Minister for Communication and Works Sohaib Bharth, along with the provincial secretaries of their respective departments, also reached the ABSTH and inspected the site.\nThey also inquired after the injured persons and assured them of treatment facilities.\nThe health minister says the Punjab government has ordered an inquiry into the incident and a committee has been constituted in this regard, whereas the C&W department officials will also prepare a report.\nIn a statement at night, Kh Salman Rafique said the provincial government has removed MS Dr Asif Mahmood and buildings executive engineer. He said the contractor would also face action.\nEarlier, the Gujrat DC sent an initial report of the incident to the provincial government.\n"

Seven other workers injured in the incident are still in serious condition in the burns unit of the Allied Hospital.\nReacting to the incident, Labour Qaumi Movement (LQM) Chairman Baba Latif Ansari at a press conference on Wednesday, especially lamented death of the underage worker, Salman, saying it has exposed the blatant use of child labour in the textile industry.\nHe said health and safety measures were not being adopted in the industry and  children were being used as labourers due to negligence of the labour welfare  department officials.\n\nSeven others injured in April 20 boiler blast at textile unit critical\n\nAnsari quoted a labour department official as saying that child labour was common in the local textile industry.\nThe LQM leader alleged that to conceal the use of child labour in the textile unit where the blast occurred, the injured boy was admitted to the district headquarters (DHQ) hospital, instead of the Allied Hospital\u2019s burns unit.\nHe also alleged that as the DHQ hospital had no burns unit, the boy succumbed to his injuries for lack of proper treatment, while his father Fayyaz. died at the Allied Hospital.\nDemanding stern action against the millers who failed to ensure health and safety measures for workers, he urged Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz to order payment of ample compensation amounts to the heirs of five deceased  workers of Sargodha mills, besides to the families of four other workers who had burnt alive in a fire incident last month in a textile mills.\nHe also demanded compensation for another worker who was burnt alive after falling into a furnace at a  bricks kiln at Faisalabad recently.\nAnsari also alleged that to avoid high cost of gas, many textile mills were using hazardous materials, including used clothes, remains of corn crop, wheat husk etc to heat boilers, putting at risk health and safety of 1.4 million workers employed in the sector.\nHe announced if the demands were not accepted, workers would stage a protest demo outside the Faisalabad DC office on May 1.\nMeanwhile, the CM directed the authorities concerned to get the   standard operating procedures (SOPs) strictly implemented to ensure   workers\u2019 safety.\nExpressing grief and sorrow over the loss of   precious human lives due to a boiler explosion in Faisalabad, she said:   \u201cAction should be taken against all those factory owners who do not   follow workers\u2019 safety guidelines.\u201d\nShe ordered an inquiry into the  incident, and sought a report from the Faisalabad commissioner in this  regard.\nGIRL RAPED: A minor girl was allegedly rapedby a youth  in Kot Bahadur locality of Jhang on Wednesday.\nAthara Hazari police claimed to have arrested the accused, who allegedly lured the nine-year-old girl to a house and raped her.\nJhang District Police Officer (DPO) Muhammad Rashid Hidayat visited the DHQ hospital and inquired after the girl.

At the beginning of the proceedings, opposition MPA Rana Shehbaz lamented that wheat growers were being offered very low price in the market and claimed that middlemen were offering growers just Rs2,800 per 40kg against the minimum support price of Rs3,900.\n\nMPAs seek probe into import by caretakers when enough grain was in stocks\n\nAgriculture minister Ashiq Kirmani held the caretaker government responsible for the situation, claiming the caretakers had imported wheat unnecessarily when the province had enough grain in its stock. He said that a solution was being worked out in consultation with the food department.\nThe speaker urged them to meet the chief minister for bringing a clear wheat policy as the farmers of Punjab were worried.\nOpposition leader Ahmed Khan Bhachar said farmers owning up to 12 acres of land had sold their grain at throwaway prices to the middleman.\nTreasury member Iftikhar Chhachhar regretted that the food department could not so far appoint staff at the wheat procurement centres, and demanded forming a committee comprising MPAs and government officials to resolve the issue.\nSardar Muhammad Khan said that the government was determined to `eliminate\u2019 farmers.\nCriticising the government\u2019s wheat policy, the MPAs demanded an investigation into the import of wheat by the caretaker government.\nThe speaker announced that the house would discuss wheat and agriculture issues in its sitting on Thursday (today).\n"

The GOR-1 residences occupied by the LHC judges that also have guardrooms/check posts on open green areas are: 19-Aikman Road; 1-A, 1-B, 2, 4, 10 and 12 Tollinton Road; 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 Tollinton Lane; 8-B, 12-B, 14-B and 15-B Golf Road; and 1-D Club Road. \nThe S&GAD had requested the LHC registrar to make necessary arrangements vis-\u00e0-vis removal of the structures or move them inside the residences.\nWhen contacted, an LHC official privy to the developments told Dawn that the court was currently consulting the security agencies and police ahead of removing the guardrooms to ensure security of the judges. \u201cThe judges are facing security threats and it is necessary to make alternate arrangements before implementing the CJP\u2019s direction,\u201d the official stated.  \nWhen contacted, additional secretary (welfare) retired Capt Muhammad Waseem remained tight-lipped over the demolition of guardrooms outside bureaucrats\u2019 residences as well as whether the government was planning to launch a similar operation in the GOR-II and III or not.\n"

            "Text": "LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Wednesday set aside notices by the ECP to two PTI-backed independent MNAs on the applications for recount in their respective constituencies of the National Assembly.\nEhsanullah Virk challenged the ECP proceedings on an application for recount by Zulfiqar Ali Bhindar, the runner-up candidate of the PML-N, in NA-79, Gujranwala, and Dr Azeemuddin Zahid Lakhvi assailed the recounting plea in NA-133, Kasur.\nVirk said the ECP declared him successful in the Feb 8 election as he secured 104,023 votes. He said the respondent, Bhinder, came second with 99,635 votes.\nLakhvi contended that he defeated the respondent runner-up candidate, Rana Muhammad Ishaq Khan of the PML-N, with a margin of 10,757 votes. He said the respondent filed an application to the ECP requesting a recount in the constituency and the commission also issued him (the petitioner) notices.\nLawyers for both petitioners mainly argued that the commission could not intervene in the matter relating to the results after the completion of the election process.\nThey said in both cases, the applications for the recount were filed after the issuance of the gazette notifications of the petitioners\u2019 victory.\nFurthermore, they said the election tribunals had also been formed to hear the election petitions when the commission entertained the applications for the recount and issued notices to the petitioners.\nThey asked the court to set aside the impugned notices for being unlawful.\nAllowing the petitions, Justice Shahid Karim observed that the decisions being made by the ECP were not commendable. He said it needed to be clarified why all this was happening in Gujranwala. He said the election commission is a constitutional institution and the court does not want to interfere in its matter.\n\u201cIt is better for the election commission to make decisions itself, otherwise, the court will give its decision,\u201d Justice Karim observed.\nThe judge set aside the impugned notices by the ECP issued to the petitioners.\nLast week, Justice Karim also struck down a decision of the ECP for a recount in NA-81 of Gujranwala.\nThe judge ruled that the election commission cannot review its decisions after the declaration of results by it.\n"

            "Text": "SAHIWAL: More than five dozen farmers under the banner of Pakistan Kisan Ittehad (PKI) on Wednesday staged a two-hour sit-in in front of the deputy commissioner\u2019s office against what they said government\u2019s flawed wheat procurement policy. \nThe farmers chanted slogans condemning the Punjab government\u2019s inaction in purchasing wheat from them.\nThey criticised both the Punjab government and the agriculture department for failing to enforce the wheat support price in the open market. Farmers lamented that wheat was being sold by them at rates ranging from Rs2,800 to Rs3,000. PKI Punjab President Muhammad Hussain led the protest.  \nThe protesters presented four demands: ensuring wheat purchase at the government-announced support price of Rs3,900, strict enforcement and legal action against commission agents and brokers at Ghala Mandi purchasing wheat below the official rate, announcement of schedules by Passco and the provincial food department for the distribution of gunny bags and wheat purchase, and a change in the ongoing provincial policy by eliminating the requirement of six gunny bags per six acres of land.  \nMuhammad Hussain, speaking to Dawn, criticised Passco officials in Pakpattan district for allegedly selling gunny bags to commission agents through forgery in Gardawari records instead of genuine farmers.\nMr Hussain strongly condemned the Punjab government\u2019s wheat import policy, arguing that the import of 3.2 million tonnes of wheat had harmed the interests of local farmers. He accused the government of not being willing to purchase wheat at its own rate, leaving farmers at the mercy of commission agents and open markets where they were forced to sell their crops at very low prices.\nThe farmers demanded that if the government cannot enforce its own support price, it should regulate the local market and take legal action against those involved in purchasing wheat at below-market prices.\nDawn learnt from sources that Deputy Commissioner Ikramul Haq was transferred today (Wednesday), so negotiations with farmers were conducted by additional DC Mr. Marth along with AC revenue Usman. They assured farmers that their demands would be forwarded to the provincial chief secretary.\nFood Deputy Director Imran Munir said the department had received 50,000 applications through the Punjab government app from Sahiwal district. However, he stated the government had not yet announced schedules for the distribution of gunny bags and wheat purchase targets in Sahiwal division.\n"

            "Text": "LAHORE/ISLAMABAD: It is no good news for Pakistan hockey which is already struggling badly for survival while facing crises and setbacks of all kinds. \nAmid internal wrangling within the Pakistan hockey Federation, the International Hockey Federation (FIH) on Wednesday gave a brief yet sombre message to the federation which has witnessed a growing tussle for control between two rival groups in recent months.\nIn a letter written to the PHF, the FIH has set April 25 (today) as the deadline for Pakistan to determine one genuine body which can properly represent the country at the international level. Other\u00adwise, the world governing body added, that Pakistan\u2019s participation in the forthcoming Sultan Azlan Shah Cup (May 4-11, Malaysia) and the Nations Cup (May 31-June 9, Poland), will remain in question.\nThe FIH gave the ruling after the Azlan Shah Cup organisers asked for guidance from the international body after two rival groups in Pakistan hockey \u2014 one headed by Tariq Hussain Bugti and the other by Shehla Raza \u2014 contacted the hosts for sending their teams to represent Pakistan.\nBugti was nominated by interim prime minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar while Shehla was nominated by PM Shehbaz. \n\u201cIt is imperative that the situation is resolved [within the PHF] by the end of this week and it is determined who will be sending the teams to the upcoming tournaments. We request that the agreed outcome and details of the official representatives are clearly communicated to us, FIH, by the end of the day on Friday [April 25],\u201d the FIH letter to the PHF said.\n\u201cFailure to reach an agreement between the two [rival] parties by this time will mean we will have no choice but to write to the Pakistan government or the Pakistan Olympic Association, requesting their intervention and resolution,\u201d added the letter.\n\u201cFor clarity, allowing one of these organisations to send a team to these tournaments [in Malaysia and Poland] will not necessarily lead to automatic recognition of this group as the official Pakistan Hockey Federation.\n\u201cWe will need to go through the correct process to recognise them. But the urgent priority for this [ongoing] week is to resolve the situation such that the Pakistan athletes are able to compete in these upcoming tournaments,\u201d it concluded.\nAccording to the FIH letter, Tayyab Ikram, who is a Pakistani and current president of the game\u2019s world governing body, has been kept separate from the issue because of being a man of the country working in the senior management of the FIH which is dealing with PHF\u2019s affairs.\nMeanwhile disturbed over the prevailing situation, the government has summoned both the groups in Islamabad on Thursday to resolve the issues between them.\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the PHF patron-in-chief, tasked the Adviser on Youth Affairs Rana Mashood to look into the matter. \nAccording to sources in the PHF, Mashood after listening to both the groups will decide the matter so that a strong and properly prepared national squad could be sent to Malaysia. \nHowever in a clear sign of heightened tensions between the said factions, the Shehla group has conveyed to the government that they will sit separately for the meeting where their rival group will not be sitting.\nHaider Hussain, the secretary of Shehla-headed group within the federation, told Dawn on Wednesday that their group would not sit with the Bugti group in today\u2019s meeting while claiming that some officials included in the Bugti group were facing corruption charges and the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) cases against them were in final stages.\n\u201cYes in order to resolve the issues we are ready to sit with the government representative, Rana Mashood, but separately, as corruption cases involving some former Olympians, who part of the Bugti group, are being investigated,\u201d Haider underlined.\nRana Mujahid, the secretary of the Bugti faction, claimed they were the genuine and legitimate body of the game in Pakistan.\n\u201cOn Thursday, my group will present [the] evidence to prove before the FIH that we are a legitimate body to run the PHF,\u201d Mujahid said.\n\u201cBugti took the vote of confidence from the PHF Congress in a meeting where the representatives of the Pakistan Olympic Association and Pakistan Sports Board were also present,\u201d he added.\nInterestingly, Mujahid speaking on the occasion said that he would announce a five-member selection committee on April 27 to pick the national squad for next month\u2019s Azlan Shah Cup.\nThis assertion signals that the training camp he had set up in Islamabad a week ago is running without selectors.\nIt may be mentioned that both the groups have set up training camps for the forthcoming event in Malaysia. Shehla group is running their camp in Karachi.\nIt is the first time that the PHF has explicitly split into two factions, after the POA and some other federations witnessed similar issues in the past.\nBoth the PHF groups held their Congress meeting separately last month to elect Bugti and Shehla as their president. In Karachi, Shehla was elected by Congress members belonging to Sindh and Balochistan, while in Islamabad Tariq was elected by the Congress, whose members are from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab hockey associations.\nOLTMANS EYEING PRO LEAGUE QUALIFICATION\nMeanwhile, Pakistan coach Roelant Oltmans said that his main target was to enable the team to qualify for the FIH Pro League. \nThe Dutch coach who is in contract with the PHF for the events in Malaysia and Poland and is supervising the camp set up at the Naseer Bunda Hockey Stadium for the Sultan Azlan Shah Cup, said that he was working to improve fitness of the players. \n\u201cWe are concentrating on the job and my [primary] aim is to help Pakistan qualify for the Pro League. During the Azlan Shah Cup, the players will get a chance to improve their skills,\u201d Oltmans said while adding that the national team required restructuring for which \u201cthere is a need to bring senior players\u201d.\nOltmans emphasized that domestic hockey in Pakistan required attention and strong competitions at domestic level so that the game\u2019s standard in the country could improve.\nHe said that any coach required ample time to develop a strong team and added that currently Pakistan had a number of talented players who could become stars in the future.\nWhile 57 players are currently attending the camp in Islamabad, this strength is going to be reduced to 25. \nThe Pakistan squad, to be selected in coming days, is likely to travel to Malaysia on May 1 to play their first match of the Azlan Shah Cup against the hosts on May 4.\n"

Everyone has seen the way he has served Pakistan with his performances. \n\u201cThankfully Rizwan\u2019s injury isn\u2019t that serious and he\u2019s being given rest to recover fully as we have more series to play before the T20 World Cup [in June].\u201d \nThe series against New Zealand is an opportunity for the Pakistan squad, featuring several new players, to gel into a winning combination ahead of the World Cup in the United States and the West Indies. \nBabar was reinstated as captain ahead of the series and stated he was hopeful his side would rebound in the series. \n\u201cWe lost the last match but we must be careful about pointing fingers at one or two players as the entire team lost the match,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are playing as a team and if we had not wasted opportunities in the field the result would have been in our favour. \n\u201cWe will try not to repeat the past mistakes to win the remaining two matches to win the series.\u201d \nHe also backed Shaheen Shah Afridi and Naseem Shah to show their true form after the duo were hit to all parts by the belligerent Mark Chapman in the last match; the New Zealand batter taking his side to victory. \n\n\nLAHORE: New Zealand players in action during a training session at the Gaddafi Stadium on Wednesday.\u2014M. Arif/White Star\n\n \nBabar stressed that Pakistan will continue to rotate their players for the rest of the series, adding that all the players were on board with the team management. \n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to give everyone a chance,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re also trying to give our bench strength chances to play so that we have everyone in top shape for the World Cup. We\u2019re testing different combinations and there is always proper communication by the team management whenever a player is being dropped.\u201d \nNew Zealand captain Michael Bracewell, meanwhile, said that the Black Caps had been buoyed by their victory in the third T20. \nAfter the opening match of the series was washed out, Pakistan romped to victory in the second game and Bracewell said that his team\u2019s \u201cconfidence had been restored\u201d after their victory in the last game. \n\u201cThe playing conditions are different in Pakistan and we always learn something while playing here,\u201d he added. \u201cWe might be without our big names but it\u2019s a big opportunity for the younger players to express themselves in an international series. With Pakistan having all their big guns, it\u2019s a great opportunity for our players to play against a tough side.\u201d\nBracewell hailed Chapman for his sensational knock in the last match and said his side will continue to build on their victory. \n\u201cWe learnt from our loss against Pakistan in the second game as a batting unit and adjusted our game accordingly,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are under no illusion that the last two games at the Gaddafi are going to be easy. We will keep focus on making adjustments and not resting on our laurels after winning the last game.\u201d\n"

But some responsible batting by Rimsha Rajput (20 not out) and Tasmia Rubab (26 not out) took their team over the line in 34.4 overs.\nMeanwhile, Lahore\u2019s skipper Kaynat Hafeez played a careful 58-runs knock before Noreen Yaqoob took three wickets to help their team secure a comprehensive 88-run win against Quetta at the Jawad Sports Complex Ground.\nBatting first, Lahore posted a respectable total of 199 in the stipulated 50 overs for the loss of nine wickets and wrapped Quetta\u2019s innings on 111 in the 46th over to claim the victory.\nIn Wednesday\u2019s last match, Peshawar\u2019s suffered a crushing defeat against Karachi, with four of their top-order batters falling victims to runs outs.\nHuraina Sajjad (76) and Syed Aroob Shah (44) responsible batting helped Karachi post a total of 190 with Peshawar\u2019s bowler Hamna Iqbal returning with the figures of 4-25 in 9.2 overs.\nIn reply, Peshawar got off to a decent start but in a bizarre turn of events their four top-order batters, including top-scorer Maham Anees (56), were ran out to hand Karachi a 36-run victory.\nScores in brief:\nMultan beat Peshawar by four wickets:\nPeshawar 101 all out in 38.2 overs (Aleena Shah 50; Noor-ul-Iman 5-25); Multan 104-6, 34.4 overs (Tasmia Rubab 26 not out, Aleena Masood 24; Momina Riasat 3-7).\nLahore beat Quetta by 88 runs:\nLahore 199-9 in 50 overs (Kaynat Hafeez 58, Noreen Yaqoob 31; Ayesha Amjad 4-44); Quetta 111 all out in 46 overs (Khadija Chishti 21; Noreen Yaqoob 3-22).\nKarachi beat Rawalpindi by 36 runs:\nKarachi 190 all out in 48.2 overs (Huraina Sajjad 76, Syeda Aroob Shah 44; Humna Bilal 4-25); Rawalpindi 154-9 in 50 overs (Maham Anees 56; Anosha Nasir 2-26).\n"

At this juncture, the CJP asked the lawyers to advance arguments about their case instead of provincial government and said that the lawyers must come prepared for to argue the cases.\nDr Kumar suggested that the land in question be handed over to the Sindh government. The CJP asked him whether he could tell the court about a single building in the city preserved by the Sindh government and said that the time will come when the rulers will have to think about the masses instead of themselves.\nThe chief justice also observed that the court was more concerned about Hindu community then the applicants and asked Dr Kumar what party he belonged currently since he used to switch political parties so often. Dr Kumar replied that he was affiliated with the Pakistan Peoples Party.\nThe bench expressed its displeasure when the lawyers sought one month\u2019s time to come prepared for arguments.\nThe lawyer for Napa submitted that the building in question was established by Seth Ramgopal Gourdhanandh Mohatta in 1925 and the government had taken over the same after the partition.\nDr Kumar again asked the court that they be declared custodian of the said building so that the Hindu community could carry out social activities on the premises.\nThe lawyers recommended Yasmain Lari, Arif Hasan, Marvi Mazhar and others after the CJP asked them to suggest the names of architects/experts for the preservation of the heritage building.\nDr Kumar yet again attempted to address the bench and said that he may also be allowed along with others to inspect the building.\nThe CJP asked Dr Kumar that he may be kept out of this since he had a lot of work to do in the parliament.\nHowever, the advocate general submitted that provincial culture department had already constituted a committee for preservation of heritage sites/buildings.\nThe bench directed the Sindh government to ensure preservation of the building in question and also said that the parties concerned may file suggestions, if any, by the next hearing and the court would settle the matter after considering the same.\nIt was contended in the petition that the said heritage site belonged to the Hindu community of Karachi before partition as the gymkhana building was established for the promotion of social and religious activities of Hindus, but the government took it over as an evacuee trust property after partition.\nIn October 2021, the apex court had expressed concern over an inordinate delay in getting vacated the said building and observed that the apex court had been issuing directives to authorities for the past three years to get the building vacated and grant substitute land to Napa, but the officials were shifting responsibility to each other. It had directed secretary culture department and commissioner Karachi to come up with a report about alternative land to Napa.\n"

The offensive has laid to waste much of the enclave, displacing most of its 2.3 million people and creating a humanitarian crisis.\nIn the past 24 hours, Israeli strikes have killed at least 79 Palestinians and wounded 86, the Gaza Health Ministry said.\nResidents in the north, many of whom have started to return to homes abandoned in the first phase of the war, described some of the most intense bombing since the war\u2019s early weeks.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know why this is all happening. Is it because we returned home and we finally got some aid through after months of starvation, and the Israelis didn\u2019t like that?\u201d said Mohammad Jamal, 29, a resident of Gaza City, near Zeitoun, one of Gaza\u2019s oldest suburbs.\n\u201cIt is as if the war started again. As if it is just happening, they burnt up the place,\u201d he told Reuters via a chat app.\nIsmail al-Thawabta, head of the Hamas government media office, said an invasion would be a \u201ccrime\u201d and that central Gaza and Khan Yunis \u201ccannot accommodate the numbers of displaced people in Rafah\u201d.\nMedics said an Israeli air strike against a group of people in Nasser Street in the heart of Gaza City had killed three people and wounded others. Palestinian journalist Amena Hmaid and one of her children were killed in an Israeli air strike on Gaza City\u2019s Beach refugee camp, her husband said.\n"

Khawaja.\nMr Khawaja is one of the parties in the matter and sought the reconstitution of the larger bench, consisting of senior-most judges, to decide appeals in the military court case.\nSubsequently, the committee formed the present bench, which consists of Justice Aminud Din Khan, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Justice Syed Azhar Hasan Rizvi, Justice Shahid Waheed and Justice Musarrat Hilali.\nHowever, on Wednesday, to the bewilderment of some of the family members of the accused facing trial before the military courts who were sitting in Courtroom No. 4, the Supreme Court bench retired for the day with an observation that they were referring the case back to the committee.\nThis forced TV analyst Hafeezullah Niazi to approach the rostrum with folded hands and plead in a voice filled with emotion. He said he was not concerned whether it was a nine-judge bench or a six-member bench, his concerns were about the safety of his son, Hassan Niazi, who had allegedly gone missing from military custody and had not been heard of for several days now.\n\u201cThe NAB law is considered draconian for having the provision to detain an acc\u00adused for 90 days, but here our children are in phy\u00adsical remand for the last eight to 10 months,\u201d Mr Nia\u00adzi regretted, saying that he could not sleep in at night since he was a father. \u201cAll I want is to become a party in the case,\u201d he pleaded. Justice Moham\u00admad Ali Mazhar asked Attorney General Mans\u00adoor Usman Awan to look into the matter.\nEarlier, senior counsel Khwaja Ahmad Hosain, on behalf of former CJP Jaw\u00adwad S. Khawaja, citing his fresh plea said a larger bench having not fewer than nine judges should be formed to hear the appeals in light of voices from within the SC.\nThe counsel also cited notes, authored by Jus\u00adt\u00adices Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Yahya Afridi, who had highlighted the need for a larger bench, adding that the potential ramifications demanded high level of judicial scrutiny. He argued that a larger bench would lend credibility to the present appeal process and to any pronouncement on whether civilians could be court-martialled by military courts.\nBesides, the larger ben\u00adch is also necessary in view of any possible split in equal numbers, he said, referring to a letter by incumbent Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa to then-Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial, highlighting the constitution of a bench comprising junior judges to hear the same matter.\nHowever, Justice Mazhar observed that the notes the counsel was relying on were mere observations, adding that Justice Afridi even joined the court proceedings till the end. Besides, Justice Isa\u2019s letter had no relevance with the present case since it was not a judicial or a binding order.\nAGP Awan told the court about the release of 20 people who were arrested for their involvement in the May 9 violence after undergoing the sentence awar\u00added so that they could celebrate Eidul Fitr with their families.\nAt this, senior counsel Faisal Siddiqui requested the court to order the federal government to place on record the orders passed by the military trial court for the perusal of the apex court, adding that 85 accused were still under detention and therefore it required urgent hearing into the matter to decide their fate.\nJustice Shahid Waheed also observed such orders should be placed before the court so that it could determine whether the requirements of Art\u00adicle 10A, which ensures fair trial, were adhered to while deciding the matter of these individuals.\n"

Let\u2019s focus on genuine industrial and agricultural growth and double the exports in the next five years. It\u2019s difficult but not impossible. It\u2019s an article of faith for me. I would listen to you and make a plan to put that into action.\u201d\nIn a veiled reference to the booming economy of Bangladesh, he recalled \u2018East Pakistan\u2019, which was \u201conce considered\u201d a burden on the country, but had made tremendous strides in industrial growth.\n\u201cI was quite young when \u2026 we were told that it\u2019s a burden on our shoulders\u2026 Today you all know where that \u2018burden\u2019 has reached [in terms of economic growth]. And we feel ashamed when we look towards them,\u201d said PM Shehbaz.\nTrade ties with India\nAfter the PM\u2019s brief speech, the house was opened for a question and answer session, where business leaders voiced their appreciation for the government\u2019s recent moves, but made more demands.\nThey also shared proposals for economic policies to achieve desired results.\nThere was a sense of concern among the business leaders over the political instability in the country for which they even advised the PM to take initiative as the head of the government. \u201cYou have made a few handshakes after taking the charge that has produced good results and progress on the IMF deal is one of them,\u201d said Arif Habib, the chief of Arif Habib Group \u2013 a capital market giant.\n \n \n\n\u201cI suggest you do a few more handshakes. One of them is regarding trade with India, which would greatly benefit our economy. Secondly, you should also [patch up] with a resident of Adiala Jail (a reference to jailed PTI leader Imran Khan). Try to fix things at that level as well and I believe that you can do it.\u201d\nThe PM avoided responding directly to the questions aimed at political stability, but claimed to have noted down his proposals for economic growth and assured him that he would soon invite businessmen from all across the country to Islamabad and sit with them \u201ctill all the issues aren\u2019t resolved\u201d.\nThen came a presentation from Zubair Motiwala, a prominent industrialist and chief of the Trade Development Authority of Pakistan (TDAP), who heads the Karachi businessmen\u2019s body called Businessmen Group (BMG).\nIn his presentation, he questioned the government\u2019s ambitious plan amid the existing business regime. \u201cThe prime minister is keen to support the industry by doubling exports and reducing business costs but it seems impossible in the current situation,\u201d said a point of his presentation shared by the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI).\n\u201cDue to the increasing cost of doing business with these gas and electricity prices, our competitors would soon take us over and get Pakistan\u2019s export orders. It is surprising that we want to increase exports and local manufacturing, but we are increasing energy prices by including cross-subsidies, which has resulted in a gas tariff of Rs2,600 per unit for industrial heating and Rs3,100 per unit for captive power.\u201d\n\u2018Fair gas price\u2019\nHe referred to the gas prices six months ago when they were charged at Rs1,150 and Rs1,350 per unit respectively and asked \u201cif any business can survive with such an increase in the current international market situation\u201d.\n\u201cThe industry is willing to pay 100 per cent of the gas price without any subsidy. We don\u2019t want any subsidy. We just want the industry to get a fair gas price,\u201d said Mr Motiwala. In his presentation, he pointed out that the \u201cunnecessary capacity\u201d of power plants had put a burden on Pakistan in the form of capacity charges, resulting in a situation where surplus electricity was neither sold nor provided to industries at lower rates.\n\u201cThis unnecessary capacity is also increasing the circular debt issue in the power sector. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce a scheme to reduce the flat tariff for industrial consumers, which will increase electricity consumption and also help reduce the circular debt issue,\u201d he added.\nEarlier, the premier was received by Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, CM Murad Ali Shah, Sindh ministers and senior officials at Karachi airport. The PM also went to the Quaid-i-Azam\u2019s mausoleum to pay his respects.\n"

The US threats of sanctions are strategically designed to deter Pakistan from enhancing its economic ties with Iran.\nAmong other steps for boosting trade and economic cooperation, Pakistan and Iran agreed on early convening of Joint Business Trade Committee and the 22nd round of the negotiations of the Joint Economic Commission (JEC). Exc\u00adh\u00ad\u00adange of economic and technical exp\u00aderts and trade delegations, it was decided, would be facilitated.\n\u201cThe declaration of \u2018Reemdan border point\u2019 as an international border crossing point under TIR and opening of the remaining two border sustenance markets was also agreed,\u201d the communique read.\nPakistan and Iran expressed satisfaction with the progress in goods shipments under the TIR Convention, an international system designed to simplify and speed up road transport across borders. Both countries, it added, agreed on the importance of fully implementing the Convention to enhance efficient, swift, and unrestricted trade between them and to potentially promote regional integration and connectivity across the broader ECO region.\nIslamabad and Tehran further agreed to strengthen \u201cmutually beneficial and enduring linkages\u201d between Gwadar and Chahbahar ports.\nThe two countries pledged to enhance cooperation to address challenges, including terrorism, narcotics, smuggling, and human trafficking.\nThe communique emphasised the importance of regular exchanges between political, military, and security officials, as well as cooperation through the utilisation of existing bilateral institutional mechanisms for combating terrorism. It stressed adherence to the principles of the UN Charter, particularly respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of member states while dealing with the terrorism problem.\nBoth sides advocated for resolving the Kashmir dispute through dialogue and peaceful means that reflect the will of the Kashmiri people, in accordance with international law.\nAlso, Islamabad and Tehran expre\u00adssed a forceful condemnation of the ongoing violence by the Israeli regime against Palestinians. They denounced the severe humanitarian impacts resulting from the blockade of Gaza, including extensive casualties and the displacement of millions. They called for an immediate ceasefire, unrestricted humanitarian access to Gaza, the return of displaced Palestinians, and accountability for the crimes committed by the Israeli regime. They reiterated their support for a just, comprehensive, and lasting resolution that aligns with the aspirations of the Palestinians.\nBoth Pakistan and Iran emphasised the threat that terrorist havens in Afghanistan pose to regional and global security. They expressed a commitment to intensify their collaborative efforts on counter-terrorism and security, aiming to establish a unified stance against terrorism threat from Afghanistan. Additionally, they acknowledged the importance of aligning regional and international initiatives to bolster security and regional stability.\n"

These members, equivalent to the high court judges, he said, would be appointed through an open competition and conduction of tests through reputable institutions like IBA, NUST and LUMS.\nHe said through the proposed legislation, various tax forums had been readjusted keeping in view the amount. He said the cases of tax liabilities up to Rs10 million would continue to be heard by the commissioners whereas the other cases would be referred to the ATIR.\nHe explained that the duration of the appeal in high courts had been reduced from 90 days to 30 days with the provision that the tax payer would automatically get a stay to prevent immediate withdrawal of the amount from his account. He said the government had made an effort to create a balance so that the rights of the tax payers were protected.\nThe minister said the bill had been drafted in consultation with the Tax Bar Association and asked the opposition members to give suggestions to improve it.\nStanding committees\nThe members from the treasury and the opposition benches informed the house that they had agreed on the formula for the distribution of the committees and that the process would be completed in another meeting scheduled to be held on Thursday (today).\nThe issue had been raised by MQM\u2019s Khawaja Izharul Hassan on a point of order in which he had expressed his concerns over the delay in the formation of the committees which, according to him, had started to affect the legislative business of the house.\nDr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry of the PML-N, who is a part of the process, informed the house that the government had agreed to give chairmanship of 10 standing committees to the opposition. He said that they would soon reach an understanding as to which committees should be handed over to the opposition parties keeping in view the past traditions.\nMeanwhile, sources in the government told Dawn that besides chairmanship of 10 committees, the government had also agreed to hand over the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) also to the PTI as per the parliamentary tradition, though there was no constitutional bindings.\nOn the other hand, the National Assembly Secretariat through a statement rebutted reports in some media claiming that the speaker did not want to make PTI\u2019s Sher Afzal Marwat as the PAC chairman. It said that no decision had been made in this regard and traditionally the chairmen of the committees were finalised through consultations between the government and the opposition.\nPTI\u2019s protest\nSpeaking on a point of order, Leader of the Opposition Omar Ayub alleged that Bushra Bibi had been poisoned in jail and that the government was hiding the matter through her false medical reports. He demanded that the doctors of Shaukat Khanum Hospital should be provided an access to Bushra Bibi and to conduct the tests.\nLaw Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said that it was on the PTI\u2019s demand that the medical tests of Bushra Bibi were conducted in one of the best private hospitals of Islamabad, instead of any government hospital, adding that there was no reason for referring Bushra Bibi to another hospital of PTI\u2019s choice as all her tests were clear.\nWheat procurement\nThe NA witnessed a heated debate on points of order on the issue of the wheat procurement, criticising the government for not procuring wheat causing difficulties for the farmers. The issue was raised by PPP\u2019s Nafisa Shah on a point of order.\nThe members sitting on the opposition as well as treasury expressed their concerns over the government\u2019s refusal to purchase wheat and for allowing import of the commodity despite having a bumper crop.\nOpposition\u2019s Sheikh Waqas Akram warned the government that soon the farmers would be in the streets and the rulers would not be able to face the brunt.\nMinister for National Food Security Rana Tanveer admitted that it was the wrong decision of the caretaker government to allow import of the wheat, stating that they would write letters to the provincial governments to procure maximum wheat from the farmers.\n"

            "Text": "PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court on Wednesday rejected a petition for including the Peshawar Development Authority as a respondent in the petition against a National Accountability Bureau inquiry into the alleged irregularities in the Bus Rapid Transit project.\nA bench consisting of Justice Shakeel Ahmad and Justice Sahibzada Asadullah observed that if the PDA had any issues with the NAB probe, the court should be approached by it and not project contractors.\nThe petition was filed last year by Ch. A. Latif and Sons Limited (Calsons), which was part of a joint venture of contractors awarded the project, through directors Chaudhry Imran Latif and Amir Latif against the NAB inquiry into the alleged irregularities in the BRT project.\nThe court granted the two directors interim relief last year by directing the NAB to continue with the inquiry without arresting them.\n\nObserves if PDA has issues with NAB probe, it should move court itself\n\nThe petitioners filed an application requesting the court to include the PDA as a respondent in the petition, insisting the civic agency is a necessary party to the BRT controversy because it is the executing agency of the project.\nJustice Sahibzada Asadullah wondered how PDA could be made party to the petition when it didn\u2019t approach the court.\nThe counsel for the petitioners said the PDA had issued different documents to his clients, and therefore, it was necessary to hear their point of view on the matter.\nHe said certain documents were required in the case, and they\u2019re in the possession of the PDA.\nThe lawyer said the main petition challenged the NAB\u2019s inquiry.\nThe bench wondered whether an inquiry could be challenged when no final order had so far been made in it.\nNAB deputy prosecutor general Mohammad Ali argued that the application was meant to further delay the matter.\nHe said an interim relief was granted to the petitioners many months ago, and they wanted to further prolong it.\nMr Ali argued that when the PDA had not approached the high court to seek any relief, then how the petitioners could file an application for impleading it as the respondent in the case.\nHe pointed out that the main petition was fixed for hearing on May 23, and over an application from the bureau for an early hearing, it was fixed for May 2.\nThe NA deputy prosecutor said the application was filed by the petitioners to further delay proceedings.\nHe argued that if the petitioners considered that the PDA had certain proofs in their favour, they should produce the same during trial instead of requesting to make it party to the petition.\nMr Ali argued that it had yet to be decided whether the petition was maintainable or not.\nHe added that the court had to decide whether it could interfere in the matter at the stage of inquiry or not.\nIn the main petition, the Calsons directors requested that the court declare that the NAB has no authority or mandate to hold an inquiry or investigation into the matters of the BRT project and harass them.\nThey prayed the court to declare illegal the proceedings initiated by the NAB, including the inquiry and call-up notices against them.\nThe petitioners contended that the disputes, if any, arising out of the BRT contracts were required to be adjudicated by and decided through a three-tier redressal mechanism, including a dispute board, as per the contract agreements, and the NAB had no right to influence or cause impediment in the process of that mechanism.\n"

Research scholars and bibliophiles stressed the need for developing a taste for reading among youth to sharpen their critical thinking.\nPohantun Adabi Stori, (PAS) a literary body of university graduates, Sahu Leekunkio Adabi Maraka, Halqa-i-Arbab Zauq, Bazme Bahar-i-Adabi and several other literary associations and rights activists organised events to mark the day and help youth to revive habit of book reading.\n\nLiterary bodies, printers observe world book day\n\nMohammad Haris Karim Khan, chief of Peshawar Circles, a forum of college students, told this scribe that their organisation recently arranged its 41th monthly study circle where more than 200 students turned up and showed keen interest in the event . He added that the trend of reading books on variety of topics and issues had arisen over the last three years.\nProf Abaseen Yousafzai, the patron-in-chief of PAS, stated that it was a good sign that young people were turning to reading books on issues both local and global but still a large number of school going students remained sticking to their mobile phones and most were involved in negative use of social media platforms.\nProf Nasir Ali Syed, a senior writer, said that too much dependency on social media kept youth away from serious reading. He said that parents and teachers should encourage children to understand the significance of reading, especially books outside their course.\nAbdur Rahman Afridi, an activist of Dosti Welfare Organisation (DWO), told this scribe that his organisation held several events since the start of the year and it gave them a spirit to organise such literary festival across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\nProf Inayatullah Khan, an avid reader, said that reading books could help in reshaping societies and refine people\u2019s approach to respecting other\u2019s opinions and believes. He said that advanced countries invested in books not in weapons, built schools not garment markets. \u201cEven teachers spend no money on purchasing books. Writers gift their books while students turn their backs on books,\u201d he added.\nHe said that without reading books, no talent could come up and dream of progress would remain a far-fetched target. \u201cLiterary festivals inspire youth to read books on wide range of topics to build a worldview and promote critical thinking for better understating of local and global issues,\u201d he said.\nMamoonur Rasheed, a student of English literature at National University of Modern Languages (NUML) Peshawar campus said that students at school level were not encouraged to read books outside their syllabus that\u2019s why cheating in examinations at even higher level continued, corrupting the minds of youth.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The tiff between the capital administration and the Naanbai association over the reduction in the price of Roti has landed in the Islamabad High Court (IHC), with the court asking the deputy commissioner to appear before the bench on Thursday.\nIHC Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri directed the deputy commissioner to appear in person on Thursday (today).\nHe was hearing the petition challenging the legality of government notification whereby the maximum price of Roti and Naan had been slashed by over 36pc. After hearing the preliminary arguments, the court admitted the petition for the hearing and asked the ICT administrator to appear before it within 24 hours.\n \n \n\nAs per the details, the Punjab government in April issued a notification slashing the price of Roti, followed by a similar notification by the ICT administration.\nThe Islamabad administration notification had set the price of Roti and Naan at Rs16 and Rs20, respectively. Just four months ago, the price was fixed at Rs25 (Roti) and Rs30 (Naan) respectively, as per the petitioner. This decision was challenged by the Capital Naanbai Association, a union comprising over 3,000 tandoors in Islamabad. The petitioners were represented by the Barrister Umer Ijaz Gilani.\nDuring the proceeding, Justice Jahangiri asked why the petitioner assailed the notification even though it seemed to be for the benefit of the general public. Responding to the query, Barrister Gilani submitted that no subsidy mechanism had been implemented in the matter in line with flour prices. In the current scenario, more than 3,000 tandoors in the capital territory are facing financial loss due to a cut in reasonable profit, the lawyer added.\nThe counsel further contended that without legal authority, the district magistrate issued the notification on April 15, 2024, while exercising powers under Section 3 of the Price Control and Prevention of Profiteering and Hoarding Act, 1977. He pointed out that Section 3 of the act only authorised the federal government to issue such a notification. Barrister Gilani urged the court to set aside the notification because an \u201cincompetent authority\u201d had issued this order.\nAfter a brief hearing, the bench issued an order, issuing notice to the DC. \u201cPoints raised need consideration. Notice to the respondents. [The] deputy commissioner\u2026is directed to depute a senior law-knowing officer, well conversant with facts of the case to appear, in person, along with record in order to assist the court on the next date of hearing.\u201d\nThe additional attorney general and the Islamabad advocate general were also directed to depute \u201claw-knowing officers\u201d to appear, in person, to assist the court.\nLater, the matter was adjourned for Thursday (today).\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The federal capital is likely to house two more five-star hotels as the Capital Development Authority (CDA) has moved a summary seeking the federal cabinet\u2019s approval for the construction of these hotels in Sector F-5.\nSources in the interior ministry said the summary was prepared by the CDA in light of a decision taken in a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday. They added the civic agency would prepare three frameworks in this regard that would be placed before the cabinet to have its pick.\nThe summary was moved via the interior ministry for its onward submission to the federal cabinet. The CDA was also asked to include advantages and drawbacks for every framework so that the executive could pick a suitable model. Sources said that three options were going to be placed before the federal cabinet: freehold rights, public-private partnership mode, and leasehold rights.\n \n \n\nThey added that there was a dire need for new luxury hotels in Islamabad as merely 4,000 rooms per night were available in Islamabad while the demand for the rooms exceeded over 8,000 rooms.\n\nThree plans to be placed before federal cabinet for the best possible option\n\nSources said Plot No. 6 near the Pakistan National Arts Council (PNCA) measuring 4.51 acres and Plot No. 8 measuring 3.73 acres (back side of Marriot Hotel) are cumulatively worth Rs20 billion. Both pieces of land hold significant promise for the development of upscale hospitality offerings since they are located next to the key administrative headquarters and offices of government entities.\nThey said that the proximity of both plots to the Diplomatic Enclave accentuates their suitability for luxury hotel development, meeting the needs of diplomats and high-profile visitors. \u201cIslamabad\u2019s role as the gateway to the country\u2019s northern areas ensures a consistent flow of tourists, underscoring the urgency to address the scarcity of high-end accommodations,\u201d said sources, adding that there were only two five-star hotels in the city.\nAdditionally, the picturesque location of both plots, coupled with their easy accessibility, promises high turnover potential, the sources said, adding, \u201cLuxury hotels are esteemed as enduring assets, with an anticipated return period of 8-9 years and minimal depreciation, affirming the long-term viability of this venture.\u201d\nIt is relevant to note that the CDA had tried to auction the said plots several times but failed as the approval of the cabinet was mandatory to put these plots up for auction. Last year, one of the plots was part of the auction list, but the CDA had to withdraw it at the eleventh hour because the cabinet was not consulted.\nHowever, this time the CDA and the federal government are \u201con one page\u201d regarding these plots.\nAccording to insiders, there are chances that a foreign country, particularly Saudi Arabia, will invest in this project as the Saudi government plans to pump up to $5 billion into the national economy.\nRecently, a high-powered Saudi delegation led by the Kingdom\u2019s foreign minister also visited Pakistan aimed at enhancing bilateral economic cooperation and pushing forward previously agreed investment deals.\n"

When she was asked to disclose her name and whereabouts, she not only refused to do so but also used abusive language against the official and tried to escape.\nHe said as he tried to stop her, she intentionally hit him, inflicting multiple injuries on him. The woman not only hit the police official, but also the barrier and sped off. Later, the injured police official was shifted to the hospital.\nThe FIR of the incident was registered with Naseerabad police station on January 2 on the complaint of the motorway police on charges of attempted murder, negligent driving and obstructing a police official in performing his duty.

Ambassador Blome also congratulated Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani on being elected as the Senate chairman and wished him a successful tenure.\nThe challenges faced by students and businessmen in obtaining US visas were also discussed in the meeting. Ambassador Blome acknowledged Pakistan\u2019s counter-terrorism efforts and reiterated US support in combating terrorism, recognising the significant impact of terrorism on the country.\nIn a statement issued by the Senate, Yousaf Raza Gilani expressed Pakistan\u2019s commitment to nurturing its long-standing friendly ties with the US and emphasised the importance of further promoting parliamentary relations between the two nations.\nBoth also discussed the importance of parliamentary contacts, with the Senate chairman appreciating the fact that a strong Parliamentary Caucus existed in the US Congress for promotion of bilateral ties.\n\u201cWe are in the process of reconstituting the friendship group as a consequence of the recent Senate elections. \nThis would help promote mutually beneficial ties and give parliamentary diplomacy a chance to build strong people-to-people contacts,\u201d Mr Gilani said.\nAmbassador Donald Blome commended the new economic team and expressed optimism regarding the ongoing discussions between Pakistan and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\nHe praised the efforts of the Pakistani economic team and emphasised the potential for further cooperation between Pakistan and the US.\nAcknowledging the positive economic indicators, Ambassador Blome noted the downward trend in inflation and high dollar reserves, stating that the IMF\u2019s positive feedback would encourage investors.\nHe also highlighted the flourishing gaming industry in Pakistan and called for enhanced cooperation in the digital sector.\nWorld Malaria Day\nSenate Chairman Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani has said that he stood with the global community in Pakistan\u2019s commitment to eradicate malaria once and for all.\n\u201cMalaria continues to devastate communities around the world, particularly in regions where access to healthcare and resources is limited,\u201d Mr Gilani said in a message on Wednesday.\nWorld Malaria Day, observed annually on April 25, serves as a reminder of the imperative to unite in raising awareness and finding effective solutions to combat malaria in areas where it remained endemic.\nMalaria was a preventable and treatable disease, but its control required collaborative efforts from all stakeholders.\nThe Senate chairman reaffirmed his dedication to supporting research, funding and initiatives aimed at combating this deadly disease, adding that, \u201cwe recognise the importance of collaboration between governments, organisations and individuals to implement effective prevention and treatment strategies\u201d.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: Notwithstanding a relatively better global outlook, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Tuesday maintained Pakistan\u2019s economic growth prospects for the current fiscal year at two per cent, which it had revised downward in January from its previous estimate of 2.5pc.\nIn its flagship World Economic Outlook (WEO 2024), released on Tuesday, the IMF kept the country\u2019s growth rate at 3.5pc for the next fiscal year. In January, the Fund had lowered the current year\u2019s growth rate by 0.5pc from 2.5pc and by 0.1pc from 3.6pc for FY25, which it anticipated in October 2023.\n \n \n\nThe growth estimates are based on the Fund\u2019s recent quarterly review of Pakistan\u2019s macroeconomic position as part of the $3bn Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) on which the two sides reached a Staff-Level Agreement (SLA) on March 20.\nThe IMF forecast is slightly higher than projections made by its Washington-based cousin \u2014 the World Bank \u2014 at 1.8pc early this month. The IMF\u2019s growth forecast is significantly lower than the government\u2019s 3.5pc GDP growth target for the current year but generally in line with the State Bank of Pakistan\u2019s expectation of 2pc to 3pc announced last month as part of the Monetary Policy Statement.\n\nLender lifts global growth forecast to 3.2pc this year\n\nThe IMF estimated that Pakistan\u2019s average inflation will decelerate to 24.8pc this year from 29.2pc last year and further slow to 12.7pc in FY25. Also, the Fund projected the current account deficit increasing to 1.1pc of GDP this year from 0.7pc last year and rising further to 1.2pc next year.\nOn the other hand, the IMF estimated that the unemployment rate would gradually decline from 8.5pc in FY23 to 8pc this year and 7.5pc next fiscal year.\nRaises global growth\nIn the WEO report, the IMF raised the global growth rate for 2024 to 3.2pc, 0.1pc higher than its 3.1pc forecast of January and significantly higher than its October forecast of 2.9pc. \u201cThe forecast for 2024 is revised up by 0.1bps from January and by 0.3bps from October 2023\u201d.\nThe pace of expansion is low by historical standards, owing to both near-term factors, such as still-high borrowing costs and withdrawal of fiscal support, and longer-term effects from the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine; weak growth in productivity; and increasing geo-economic fragmentation.\nThe WEO expected the global headline inflation to fall from an annual average of 6.8pc in 2023 to 5.9pc in 2024 and 4.5pc in 2025, with advanced economies returning to their inflation targets sooner than emerging market and developing economies. The latest forecast for global growth five years from now \u2014 at 3.1pc \u2014 is at its lowest in decades. The pace of convergence toward higher living standards for middle- and lower-income countries has slowed, implying persistence in global economic disparities, the IMF said.\nThe relatively weak medium-term outlook reflects lower GDP per person growth stemming, notably, from persistent structural frictions preventing capital and labour from moving to productive firms. It noted that dimmer prospects for growth in China and other large emerging market economies will weigh on the prospects of trading partners, given their increasing share of the global economy.\n\u201cRisks to the global outlook are now broadly balanced\u201d, the IMF said but noted on the downside that new price spikes stemming from geopolitical tensions, including those from the war in Ukraine and the conflict in Gaza and Israel, could, along with persistent core inflation where labour markets are still tight, raise interest rate expectations and reduce asset prices.\nA divergence in disinflation speeds among major economies could also cause currency movements that put financial sectors under pressure. High interest rates could have greater cooling effects than envisaged as fixed-rate mortgages reset and households contend with high debt, causing financial stress. \u201cIn China, without a comprehensive response to the troubled property sector, growth could falter, hurting trading partners\u201d, the WEO warned.\nMoreover, amid high government debt in many economies, a disruptive turn to tax hikes and spending cuts could weaken activity, erode confidence, and sap support for reform and spending to reduce risks from climate change. Also, geo-economic fragmentation could intensify, with higher barriers to the flow of goods, capital, and people implying a supply-side slowdown.\n \n \n\nOn the upside, looser fiscal policy than necessary and assumed in projections could raise economic activity in the short term, although risking more costly policy adjustments later on. Inflation could fall faster than expected amid further gains in labour force participation, allowing central banks to bring easing plans forward. Artificial intelligence and stronger structural reforms than anticipated could spur productivity.\nThe IMF advocated the near-term priority for central banks to ensure that inflation touched down smoothly, by neither easing policies prematurely nor delaying too long and causing target undershoots as the global economy approached a soft landing.\nAt the same time, as central banks take a less restrictive stance, a renewed focus on implementing medium-term fiscal consolidation to rebuild room for budgetary maneuver and priority investments, and to ensure debt sustainability, is in order.\n\u201cMultilateral cooperation is needed to limit the costs and risks of geo-economic fragmentation and climate change, speed the transition to green energy, and facilitate debt restructuring\u201d, the WEO said.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The quantum of large-scale manufacturing (LSM) rose 0.06 per cent in February, its third increase in a row, according to data released by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics on Tuesday.\nThe quantum index of LSM industries was 126.01 points in February compared to 125.93 in the same month last year.\nHowever, the index for the month was 4.14pc lower than for the previous month, Jan\u00ad\u00aduary 2024, when it stood at 131.45 points.\n \n \n\nThe annual change in the LSM index has been mostly positive since August 2023, when it rose 0.26pc. Before that, the index was down for 13 consecutive months.\n\nIndex drops 0.51pc in July-February, its 20th cumulative fall in a row\n\nThe removal of import restrictions, clearance of outstanding letters of credit and improved dollar liquidity following improvement in the State Bank\u2019s foreign exchange reserves are considered to help pick up economic activity.\nAs for this fiscal year\u2019s first eight months (July to February), the large-scale manufacturing index fell 0.51pc year-on-year to 117.99 points. The PBS data showed that the cumulative change in the index was in the negative for the 20th month in a row, i.e. since July 2022.\nDuring July-February, 11 of 22 sectors witnessed positive growth, including food, beverages, wearing apparel, leather, wood products, coke and petroleum products, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, rubber products, machinery and equipment, and furniture.\nAccording to the Finance Ministry Econo\u00admic Outlook for March 2024, the LSM cycle usually follows the cyclical movements in the main trading partners.\nHowever, since it is focused on the main industrial sectors and not on total GDP, it is somewhat more volatile than the cyclical component of GDP in Pakistan\u2019s main export markets.\nThe economic situation in the major export markets has improved and is currently above the neutral 100 benchmark. In Pakistan, the seasonally adjusted LSM output in February 2024 remains above the neutral benchmark, indicating a cyclical revival in large-scale manufacturing output.\nDespite the domestic downside risks for the industrial sector such as high input cost and high policy rate, the cyclical component of LSM recorded above the potential level for the months of December and January of the ongoing fiscal year.\nIt is expected that this positive trend will continue in the upcoming months and LSM will post a modest growth as compared to fiscal 2023.\nIn the textile and clothing sector, positive growth was observed in yarn (3.44pc) and cloth (0.64pc) in February from a year ago.\nHowever, a massive growth of 18.74pc was recorded in the garment sector in February from a year ago.\nIn the food group, wheat and rice production posted a negative growth of 0.51pc in February over the same month last year. The production of cooking oil rose 7.69pc while vegetable ghee saw a decline of 13.32pc during the month.\nPetroleum products posted a negative growth of 16.85pc in February, mainly because of a decline in all products. In February, iron and steel production declined by 1.43pc. However, electrical equipment increased by 2.09pc.\nThe production of fertilisers experienced a surge of 33.14pc, while the production of rubber items grew 10.63pc. The production of pharmaceutical products experienced a significant surge, with an increase of 9.96pc. The manufacturing of machinery and equipment saw a growth of 28.98pc.\nAccording to finance ministry report, the performance of the auto industry during July-February remained subdued due to massive increases in inputs prices and tightening auto finance.\nCar production and sale dropped 40.8pc and 40.9pc, while trucks and buses production and sale decreased 50.6pc and 48.7pc, respectively. However, tractor\u2019s production and sale increased by 68.6pc and 67.6pc.\nSales of total petroleum products dropped 13pc to 10.2 million tonnes during the eight-month period compared to 11.7m tonnes a year ago.\nThe total cement dispatches (domestic and exports) were 30.56m million tonnes, 2.5pc higher than in the year-ago period.\n"

The absence of manufacturing and expiry dates on cement bags poses a consumer risk. It could lead to the purchase of expired products and compromise the integrity of construction projects.\nThe policy note emphasises the need to align Pakistan\u2019s standards with international labelling practices to ensure consistency and transparency in the domestic market. It also aims to address the disparity between domestic and export labelling requirements, thereby safeguarding the interests of local consumers.\nCurrently, all types of cement in Pakistan adhere to packaging standards set by the Pakistan Standards and Quality Control Authority (PSQCA).\nThe introduction of mandatory manufacturing and expiry date disclosures is expected to empower consumers, foster competition among brands, and streamline inventory management processes.\nThe CCP condemns the omission of material information on cement packaging as deceptive marketing and advocates for the mandatory printing of expiry dates to protect consumer interests and promote fair competition within the industry. An advisory has been sent to the All Pakistan Cement Manufacturers Association (APCMA) and its members, urging compliance with the new labelling requirements to prioritise consumer safety and satisfaction.\nUnpaid marking fees \nIt may be worth mentioning that during a previous meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and Technology, it was revealed that the cement industry had not paid the marking fee to the PSQCA for the past 15 years, resulting in outstanding dues of over Rs4.5bn as of June 2022.\n"

However, it closed at 70,483.66 points after losing 60.92 points, or 0.09pc from the preceding session.\nSectors like oil and gas marketing, power generation, fertiliser, and cement contributed to the index\u2019s negative movement. Comp\u00adanies including Fauji Ferti\u00adliser Company, Engro Ferti\u00adl\u00adisers Ltd, PSO, Hub Power, and Fauji Cement Company collectively shed 146 points.\nHowever, Habib Bank Ltd, Bank Alfalah Ltd and Ma\u00adri Petroleum contri\u00adbute\u00add positively, adding 189 points.\nThe overall trading volume fell 1.22pc to 548.41 mi\u00adl\u00adlion shares.

He said the main reason for rain damage was encroachment on 82 nullahs in and around the provincial capital that blocked the flow of rain water coming from roads and human settlements.\nAlmost all main roads of Quetta were flooded as sewers failed to drain water due to blockage, as per officials.Parts of Makran, including Pasni, Kech, Panjgur, Gwadar, and other divisions of Balochistan, also suffered huge damages to infrastructure and homes during the previous spell of rainfall.\n"

            "Text": " \n\nIrfan Khan\n\nLAHORE: An alarming report from the World Hea\u00adlth Organisa\u00adtion (WHO) indicates that Pakistan had the highest number of viral hepatitis C infections in the world, around 8.8 million, and accounts for 44 per cent of all new hepatitis C infections attributed to unsafe medical injections.\nIn previous years, Egypt repor\u00adted the largest number of hepatitis C and B cases, followed by Pakistan.\nThe data from 187 countries shows the estimated number of deaths from viral hepatitis increased from 1.1 million in 2019 to 1.3 million in 2022.  Of these, 83pc were caused by hepatitis B and 17pc by hepatitis C, according to the report.\nIf the number of hepatitis B and hepatitis C cases are combined, then Pakis\u00adtan ranks fifth in the world, only trailing behind China, India, Indonesia and Nige\u00adria, with around 12.6 million cases reported in 2022.\n\nWHO\u2019s Global Hepatitis Report 2024 reveals country accounts for 44pc of new infections from unsafe injections\n\nThe WHO\u2019s Global Hepa\u00adtitis Report 2024 notes that ten countries account for nearly two thirds of the global burden of viral hepatitis B and C, with Ethio\u00adpia, Bang\u00adla\u00addesh, Vietnam, Philippines and the Rus\u00adsian Federation rounding off the top ten.\nFor hepatitis C, six countries \u2014 China, India, Indo\u00adnesia, Pakistan, Russian Federation and US \u2014 represent 50pc of the global burden However, the report states that Egypt has become the first country to achieve gold tier status on the path to elimination of hepatitis C, based on fulfilling WHO criteria that will set the country up to ach\u00adieve the reduced incidence and mortality targets of full elimination before 2030.\nIn addition, as of Dec 2023, 16 countries have been validated for eliminating either one or more among HIV, syphilis and HBV, the report noted.\nCommenting on the report, senior medical experts say most of the patients in Pakistan are either diagnosed incidentally or get symptomatic when their illness advances years after getting the infection.\nDr Masood Sheikh from the Lahore General Hospital told Dawn that Pakistan has been bearing the second-largest burden of hepatitis C globally, with a nationwide prevalence of 4.8 per cent.\n\u201cFrom 2015 to 2019, there was a 5pc increase in hepatitis C-related deaths and an 8pc increase in hepatitis B-related deaths,\u201d he said.\nThe transmission of the virus increased manifold in Pakistan due to ignorance of sterilisation techniques, sharing personal items, and unsafe healthcare practices. He lamen\u00adted that the burden of liver cancers and transplants has risen three-fold all over the country over the past 20 years.\n\u201cHepatitis is an inflammation of the liver that can cause a range of health problems and can be fatal,\u201d Dr Sheikh said.\nThe latest WHO report also contains information on access to health products from 38 countries for the viral hepatitis response, which together account for about 80pc of the global disease burden of viral hepatitis B and C.\nUpdated WHO estimates indicate that 254 million people live with hepatitis B and 50 million with hepatitis C in 2022 all over the world.\n\u201cHalf the burden of chronic hepatitis B and C infections was diagnosed in 30\u201354 age group, 12pc among children under 18 years of age,\u201d reads the report. Men account for 58pc of all the cases.\nHowever, drug pricing data offers a silver lining; the lowest reported price of daclatasvir/sofosbuvir \u2014 a two drug combo for the treatment of hepatitis C \u2014 for a 12-week course of treatment was from Pakistan at about $33 for a generic course of treatment. The highest reported price was from China, at about $10,000.\n"

Drawing a comparison with the modern world, where cases are decided within six months, Wardag suggested improving the local judicial system by setting a six-month adjudication time for criminal cases and one year for civil cases.\nAbout high power rates for farm tube-wells, Mr Wardag suggested that the government offer solar systems on an installation basis for running the tube-wells to facilitate the farmers.\n"

We will try to make use of it, the aim is to field the best XI when we play our first T20 World Cup game on June 6.\u201d\nThe PCB\u2019s seven-member selection committee\u2019s rotation policy in effect has kept all options open for Azhar and his coaching staff to decide how to use each player\u2019s strengths and that would apply on the opening slots as well, which have been occupied by Babar and Mohammad Rizwan for most of the last four years.\nPakistan have a number of players to choose from for the top order, including the likes of Saim Ayub, Fakhar Zaman and Usman Khan.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t decided who will open the innings,\u201d Azhar said. \u201cAnyone can play on any number. In T20, only the top three batters have to have to know their numbers, the rest can adjust according to the situation.\u201d\nThe options down the order are also ripe, boosted by the return of veteran pacer Mohammad Amir and seasoned all-rounder Imad Wasim \u2014 both rescinding their respective retirements from international cricket last month.\n\u201cI\u2019m very satisfied with the squad, it covers almost all aspects of the game,\u201d said Azhar. \u201cIt\u2019s a balanced side, we have two all-rounders and the fast bowling line-up is also very strong.\n\u201cThe return of Amir and Imad gives us an edge and we can use them at any point. The batting line-up has got the best available talent right now.\u201d\nAzhar, who recently won the HBL Pakistan Super League for Islamabad United as head coach, said that data suggested New Zealand \u2014 apparently depleted by the absence of their top players due to their participation in the ongoing Indian Premier League \u2014 were still a formidable side.\n\u201cAlthough we will not be competing against a full-fledge New Zealand team, this is still their best available talent,\u201d he noted. \u201cIf you crunch the data and the stats, you\u2019d know all these players have done really well in domestic cricket and in New Zealand.\n\u201cThis [Pakistan series] will be a good opportunity for these players to knock on the doors for selection in the T20 World Cup. No team can be ruled out as a weak side in the T20 format.\u201d\nNew Zealand batter Mark Chapman echoed Azhar\u2019s views, saying that while his side is \u201cmissing couple of [main] players, we have an exciting and a talented team.\u201d\nChapman added that for the second-string Kiwis, the Pakistan series was a very good opportunity for them to put their hands up. The left-hander expected that the series, which starts Thursday here, will be an exciting affair.\nThe 29-year-old said his team-mates were wary of Pakistan\u2019s pace battery \u2014 which now includes Amir \u2014 and that they were \u201caware about skills he possesses\u201d.\n"

Of this number, only 1,200 are registered,\u201d Mr Ahmed of HWSK said.\nHe said that the organisation was managing the medication cost of the 1,200 registered patients with the help of World Federation of Haemophilia and private donations.\nAccording to him, around 200 new patients are annually registered with the organisation that has also set up Pakistan\u2019s first treatment centre for haemophilia patients last year.\n\u201cWe need an annual budget of Rs1.8 billion to treat all affected children adequately. Besides, there is an acute shortage of medicines, which the government should address,\u201d he said.\nSindh govt yet to okay treatment of 50 patients\nThe sources said that the Sindh government was yet to approve a summary pertaining to the treatment of 50 haemophilia patients registered with the HWSK.\nThey said that even after one year the summary, duly signed by the then health minister and health secretary, couldn\u2019t find its way to the Chief Minister\u2019s House for final approval.\n\u201cDuring meetings we had with the health department last year, it was decided that the provincial government would offer its financial support for treatment of 50 patients in the first stage and then gradually extend it to over 200 patients, aged between one and 12 years,\u201d Mr Ahmed said.\nHe added that the government released only Rs24m last year that covered treatment cost of only six patients. \u201cWe have raised our voice at multiple forums for release of funds but to no avail,\u201d he said. \nAccording to the US Centres of Disease Control and Prevention, haemophilia is usually an inherited bleeding disorder in which the blood does not clot properly.\nThis can lead to spontaneous bleeding as well as bleeding following injuries or surgery. Blood contains many proteins called clotting factors that can help to stop bleeding. People with haemophilia have low levels of either factor VIII or factor IX.\nThe severity of haemophilia that a person has is determined by the amount of factors in the blood. The lower the amount of the factor, the more likely it is that bleeding will occur which can lead to serious health problems.\n"

And we don\u2019t even exploit properly the best things that we have,\u201d he said and added that that would open gates for business in Pakistan.\nAll the panellists stressed the need for critical reforms in the country\u2019s media and entertainment industry.\n\u2018Digital media will be the future\u2019 \nIn another session titled \u2018Potential of Digital Media in Pakistan\u2019, the panellists said with the world rapidly moving towards digitalisation, it is almost impossible to escape the monster called content creation. \nThey said the art of producing media, which is both entertaining and engaging, is not for the people who do not know their audience, and there is a dire need of massive investment when it comes to digital media.\nAt the session, Faizan Syed, founder and CEO of a digital advertising agency, asked the audience to share their screen time since he wanted them to first understand what digital media actually is. Then he asked them what their top three apps were. \n\u201cThe penetration of media has changed the landscape,\u201d he remarked after the activity.\nThe panellists \u2014 Javed Jafri of Unilever Pakistan, Jehan Ara of Katalyst Labs and Farhan Khan of Brainchild Communications \u2014agreed that the content consumption, be it in any form, depends upon how well one knows their audience.\n\u201cThe views are monitored when it comes to TV and other mediums, however we still don\u2019t monitor digital mediums properly, hence the numbers are not accurate but I can tell you that the market is really huge, and we need hacks to properly utilise it,\u201d Mr Khan said.\nWhen questioned about the divergent fates of startups, Ms Jehan Ara said: \u201cThe art lies in knowing the need and the audience. Your business should cater to some sort of need of the people and then of course, strong marketing is also a factor. But knowing your audience changes the entire game.\u201d\nThe panellists further delved into how an average person in the country spends seven to eight hours on road, and while they\u2019re at it, they\u2019re scrolling their phone screens instead of consuming any other form of media. \nThey also talked about how the present form of media is going to expand further and digital media will be the future only if it\u2019s understood and utilised properly.\n"

            "Text": "HYDERABAD: The Sindh Human Rights Commission (SHRC), following its inspection team\u2019s March 20 visit to the Sir Cowasjee Jehangir Institute of Psychiatry, has urged the provincial health secretary to pay due consideration to its recommendations, primarily increased budgetary allocations, to help the institute overcome its \u201ccritical deficiencies\u201d.\nSHRC Chairman Iqbal Detho, in a communication to the secretary on Tuesday, said that the inspection team headed by him had visited the institute with the overarching objective of scrutinising conditions and standards of mental health services at this facility.\nThe inspection team felt that there was a pressing need for concerted efforts to address the challenges being faced by this healthcare facility. The critical deficiencies included shortage of staff, infrastructure, patient services and budgetary allocations which required immediate attention.\nThe commission urged the health secretary to prioritise resource allocation and expedite recruitment process to address the issues.\nThe SHRC has attached its inspection report with the communication and suggested that health department should pay due consideration to six key areas mentioned under subtitles like staff shortage and infrastructure deficiencies; implementation of holistic patient care initiatives; vocational and non-formal education; establishment of old-age home facility; strengthening of support services for vulnerable patients and legislative advocacy; and compliance for drafting rules of implementation of the Sindh Mental Health Care Act-2019. Some of these measures are supposed to be taken by health department in consultation with culture and law departments, Sindh technical education authorities and Nadra.\n\u2018A unique institution\u2019\nAccording to the inspection report, the Sir Cowasjee Jehangir Institute of Psychiatry is a unique institution dedicated to provision of mental healthcare services. With a multidisciplinary team of mental health professionals comprising psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers and psychiatry nurses, the institute strives to deliver evidence-based interventions tailored to cater to the needs of each patient.\nDespite being such a unique institution, the mental healthcare facility faces myriad challenges in fulfilling its mandate effectively. From staff shortage to infrastructural limitations, it grapples with countless obstacles that impede its ability to provide optimal care and support to individuals in need for rehabilitative nature. As an integral component of mental healthcare landscape in Sindh, the institute plays an indispensable role in safeguarding health and well-being of community.\nElaborating the six specified areas, the commission suggested that vacant positions must be filled by prioritising recruitment of psychiatrists urgently and to chalk out clear strategies to attract and retain qualified professionals, besides recruiting lower-grade workers. It suggested partnerships with academic institutions, teaching hospitals and professional bodies.\nIt stressed allocation of adequate funds for the procurement of ambulances and essential medical equipment. It also called for a maintenance plan for the existing infrastructure. \nThe commission advised culture department to introduce a patient care programme featuring indoor recreational activities and music therapy to support patients\u2019 rehabilitation and well-being. \nFor vocational and non-formal education of patients, the SHRC suggested, a partnership could be established between the hospital and the Sindh Technical Education and Vocational Training Authority (Stevta).\nThe commission is of the view that a separate building should be established for the under treatment elderly and senior citizens. \nIt has proposed effective implementation of the Sindh Mental Health Act-2019 and its rules for the rights and welfare of individuals with mental health disorders. It said that relevant authorities and stakeholders should be engaged to expedite adoption and implementation of legislative reforms aimed at improving mental healthcare services.\n"

In another incident in Eid night, trade of fire between Jalbani and Vessar clans left two persons injured, they said, adding on Monday again, Vessars and Jalbanis exchanged fire in Resham Gali. \nThe protesters demanded elected representatives Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, Faryal Talpur, Larkana DIG and SSP set up permanent police pickets in the market to check the miscreants so that traders could carry on their business with peace of mind. \nThey urged the government and influential persons of the area to end ongoing disputes between different tribes and clans.\n"

He was arrested by police and a case was lodged against him for assaulting the woman after his footage went viral during Eid days. \nThe SHO, Sub-Inspector Mohammad Hussain, informed the court that the suspect was not cooperating with police in the investigation of the case. Police had produced him in the court on April 13 to seek his remand in police custody but Consumer Protection Court judge declined the police\u2019s request and accepted the suspect\u2019s bail for Rs35,000, he said.\nHe said that since the suspect was not cooperating, police also needed to have his medical examination done by an authorised medical officer so as to assess his state of mental health. Therefore, he contended, the court should allow the suspect\u2019s remand in police custody and recall his bail order. \nThe court issued notice to the suspect on the SHO\u2019s application and asked him to appear before the judge on April 22.\n"

Tanks advanced into Beit Hanoun and surrounded some schools where displaced families have taken refuge, said the residents and media outlets of Hamas.\n\u201cOccupation soldiers ordered all families inside the schools and the nearby houses where the tanks had advanced to evacuate. The soldiers detained many men,\u201d one resident of northern Gaza said.\nBeit Hanoun, home to 60,000 people, was one of the first areas targeted by Israel\u2019s ground offensive in Gaza last October. Heavy bombardment turned most of Beit Hanoun, once known as \u2018the basket of fruit\u2019 because of its orchards, into a ghost town comprising piles of rubble.\n\nFamilies which had returned home begin moving out again after the raid\n\nMany families who had returned to Beit Hanoun and Jabalia in recent weeks after Israeli forces withdrew, began moving out again on Tuesday because of the new raid, some residents said.\nPalestinian health officials said an Israeli strike had killed four people and wounded several others in Rafah, where over half of Gaza\u2019s 2.3 million people are sheltering and bracing for a planned Israeli ground offensive into the city, which borders Egypt.\nLater on Tuesday, Palestinian health officials and Hamas media said an Israeli air strike had killed 11 Palestinians, including children, in the Al-Maghazi refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip.\n\u201cMy brothers were sitting by the door, my brother was injured, and his cousin too, and I lost my son, I do not have a house, nor a husband, nor anything anymore,\u201d said Wafaa Issa al-Nouri, whose son Mohammad and husband were killed in the strike.\n\u201cHe was playing by the door, we didn\u2019t do anything, I swear we didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d she said.\nThe Hamas-run interior ministry also said an Israeli air strike had hit a police car in the Tuffah district of Gaza City, killing four police officers and three civilian passers-by.\nNo sign of ceasefire\nAfter six months of fighting, there is still no sign of any breakthrough in US-backed talks led by Qatar and Egypt to clinch a ceasefire deal in Gaza, as Israel and Hamas stick to their mutually irreconcilable conditions.In Al-Nussei\u00adrat refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip, residents said Israeli planes had bombed and destroyed four multi-storey residential buildings on Tuesday.\nIsrael is still imposing \u201cunlawful\u201d restrictions on humanitarian relief for Gaza, the UN human rights office said on Tuesday, despite assertions from Israel and others that barriers have eased.\nThe amount of aid now entering Gaza is disputed, with Israel and Washington saying aid flows have risen in recent days but UN agencies say it is still far below bare minimum levels.\nIsrael is under international pressure to allow more aid into Gaza, especially northern areas where famine is expected by May, according to the United Nations.\n"

The trip was also intended to serve as a precursor to an anticipated visit by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to Pakistan later in the year.\nThe Saudi delegation\u2019s visit followed a foundational meeting between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the Saudi crown prince \u2014 known by his initials MbS \u2014 in Makkah earlier this month, where commitments were made to intensify economic engagement.\nA central aspect of the understanding reached at that meeting was to fast-track an initial $5 billion investment tranche under a broader Saudi commitment to invest $25bn in Pakistan over the next five years.\n\u201cWe are very impressed not just by the breadth of the opportunities that exist but also by the format [for facilitating investment],\u201d the Saudi foreign minister said.\n\u201cThis gives us some very, very significant confidence that we will be able to move forward on those projects we identify as worthy of investment,\u201d he said, adding that his country \u201cwill be moving significantly ahead on a multitude of opportunities\u201d.\nHe, however, avoided naming any specific projects in which the kingdom was planning to invest.\nDuring their meeting before the media conference, Mr Farhan and Mr Dar discussed the potential for trade and investment collaboration.\nAt the presser, Mr Dar reassured Saudi investors of Pakistan\u2019s commitment to fully supporting them.\nHe recalled Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif\u2019s directive to the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) and relevant ministries to \u201cmove forward on investment projects in a diligent and time-bound manner in a fast track\u201d.\nSaudi-Pakistan investment conference\nThe two foreign ministers co-chaired the investment conference, which was the main feature of the Saudi delegation\u2019s visit to discuss potential investments in Pakistan.\nDuring the conference, the Pakistani side highlighted legal and administrative reforms, including establishing the SIFC to streamline investments.\nMr Dar spotlighted opportunities in sectors such as agriculture, IT, and mining and invited Saudi investors to invest in them.\nInvestments in state-owned enterprises, which are being put up for privatisation, were also solicited. Technical teams later delved into various investment proposals.\nThe Saudi delegation expressed its interest in improving the investment environment and appreciated SIFC\u2019s role in resolving past investment and business issues related to Saudi investments.\nThe conference was anticipated to lead to a structured investment framework under the SIFC for dealing with Saudi investments.\nMeetings with PM, president\nThe Saudi delegation, led by Foreign Minister Farhan, also separately met President Asif Ali Zardari and PM Sharif.\nPresident Zardari expressed Pakistan\u2019s desire to transform the relationship with Saudi Arabia into a long-term strategic and economic partnership.\nMr Sharif, meanwhile, underscored the need for both sides to work closely to expedite the first phase of Saudi investments in Pakistan under the new arrangement.\nMiddle East situation\nThe Saudi foreign minister, in his remarks at the Foreign Office presser, called for de-escalation in the region in the aftermath of Iranian retaliatory strikes against Israel and the continued Israeli aggression in Gaza.\n\u201cWe are in an unstable region. The humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza is inflaming the region. We do not need more conflict, we do not need more confrontation,\u201d he said.\nDe-escalation, he maintained, should be \u201ceverybody\u2019s priority\u201d and differences should be resolved through dialogue instead of use of force.\nHe criticised the international community for failing to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza and ensuring unimpeded delivery of humanitarian assistance to the Gazans.\nMr Salman also called out the world\u2019s double standards, noting that the killing of six Western aid workers moved the international community on aid in a way the death of 33,000 Palestinians couldn\u2019t.\nMr Dar endorsed Mr Salman\u2019s call for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire and unimpeded delivery of humanitarian assistance.\n"

However, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) conducted a recount on a request of the respondent, Mr Nahra, after which he was declared victorious with a margin of 3,100 votes.\nAt least 10,000 votes of the petitioner were declared cancelled in the recount, the counsel said.\nHe argued that the commission violated the law by allowing a recount after the formation of the election tribunals to hear challenges to election disputes and asked the court to strike down the ECP\u2019s impugned recount order for being unlawful.\nJustice Karim observed that in ordering the recount, the ECP had ignored the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling. The judge also asked the ECP lawyer if ignoring the Supreme Court\u2019s decision constituted contempt of court.\nThe judge maintained that the commission could not entertain complaints against election disputes after tribunals had started working, and allowed the petition, setting aside the notification of the respondent\u2019s victory.\nMeanwhile, the Bahawalpur bench of the Lahore High Court unseated Abdul Rehman Kan\u00adjoo, the PML-N MNA from NA-154 Lodhran, and declared the petitioner, PTI-backed Rana Faraz Noon, as the winner.\nAccording to the PTI candidate\u2019s lawyer Makhdoom Kalimullah Hashmi, the LHC bench, deciding an intra-court appeal (ICA), declared null and void the notification issued by the ECP, regarding Mr Kanjoo\u2019s victory in the Feb 8 general elections.\nMr Kanjoo, a former minister, has also taken oath as an MNA in the National Assembly session.\nIn both cases, the petitioners \u2014 who were runners up in the polls \u2014 are likely to be notified as the returned candidates following the success of their pleas.\nPP-133 notification suspended\nAlso on Tuesday, the LHC suspended the victory notification of PML-N\u2019s Rana Arshad from PP-133, Nankana Sahib.\nJustice Shahid Karim issued the stay order on a petition filed by PTI-backed independent candidate Mohammad Atif, who pleaded that he was initially declared the returned candidate with a margin of over 3,500 votes.\nHowever, he said, the ECP held a recount on an application of the respondent and declared him victorious by 2,500 votes. He asked the court to set aside the recounting order of the ECP and the impugned notification of the respondent\u2019s victory for being unlawful.\nThe judge suspended the notification and sought a reply from the ECP and other respondents.\nYasmin\u2019s challenge\nFiled through her lawyers, Ahmed Awais and Rana Mudassir, the former Punjab health minister\u2019s petition argued that the ECP issued Mr Sharif\u2019s victory notification in violation of the law.\nPreviously on Feb 13, the LHC dismissed a writ petition filed by Ms Rashid against Mr Sharif\u2019s victory, directing her to approach the ECP.\nOn Feb 14, the ECP issued a notification of Mr Sharif\u2019s victory from NA-130.\nHe won the Feb 8 election with 179,310 votes while Ms Rashid came second with 104,485 votes.\nNow, the latter has filed an election petition before the tribunal with a request to set aside the victory of the former prime minister and to declare her returned candidate. She alleged that the ECP manipulated the election results to ensure her defeat.\nBalochistan speaker\nSeparately on Tuesday, the ECP suspended the victory notification of Balochistan Assembly Speaker Abdul Khaliq Khan Achakzai from PB-51, Chaman.\nThe notification has been suspended until the outcome of re-polling at 12 polling stations, scheduled for April 21, along with by elections in 23 national and provincial assembly constituencies and a re-election in PB-51 (Qila Abdullah).\nMeanwhile, the commission also notified Sadaf Ihsan as a returned candidate for the seat reserved for women in the National Assembly from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The notification of her victory was suspended on March 4 after the JUI-F complained that she was not among the names the party had submitted for election to reserved seats.\nIftikhar A. Khan in Islamabad and Majeed Gill in Bahawalpur also contributed to this report\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this report incorrectly identified the Nankana Sahib constituency of PML-N\u2019s Rana Arshad as NA-133. It is PP-133. The error is regretted.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: With by-elections on vacant seats of the national and provincial assemblies less than a week away, the PTI has accused the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) of pre-poll rigging in the run-up to the elections slated to be held on April 21.\nThe former ruling party also decided to organise public gatherings in constituencies where by-polls are slated to be held in which Omar Ayub, Barrister Gohar, and Sher Afzal Marwat will \u201censure their presence\u201d.\nIn a press conference on Tuesday, PTI Secretary General Omar Ayub said the PTI candidate in PP-36 was being harassed by the police which raided and encircled his house and also brought a prison van. The PTI leader claimed that the PTI was not allowed to run its election campaign. He alleged that Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz and the Punjab IG were using \u201cbrutal and coercive tactics against PTI leaders and workers in other constituencies\u201d to rig elections.\nOmar Ayub claimed that the number of polling stations was reduced and they were set up in remote areas to discourage voters in an alleged bid to influence elections. He claimed that Gujranwala RPO (regional police officer), a relative of the PML-N candidate, was given the charge of Wazirabad. \u201cThe officials are instructed that Form-45 should not be given to the PTI nominees,\u201d he alleged.\n\nParty to move IHC against installation of \u2018glass wall\u2019 in room where Imran meets visitors\n\nJudicial inquiry\nSpeaking about the Bahawal\u00adnagar incident, the opposition leader sought a transparent judicial inquiry into the \u201cclash\u201d between the police officials and army personnel to ensure accountability. \u201cThe incident is reflects the lack of discipline in the law-enforcement institutions,\u201d he added.\nCriticising the economic policies, he said the \u201ceconomic collapse was followed by the worst food inflation that jumped to 45 per cent coupled by an alarming surge in unemployment and unbearable cost of living\u201d.\nTalking about the Iran and Israel issue, he said that Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar should have given a policy statement on the \u201cgrowing tensions in the Middle East\u201d but unfortunately the foreign minister did not have any time to give any statement in this regard.\nThe PTI leader, however, welcomed the Saudi delegation\u2019s visit to Pakistan but linked investments with the rule of law. \u201cWhy would investors come to such a country where lawlessness and anarchy reign supreme,\u201d he added.\nOmar Ayub demanded that Bushra Bibi\u2019s medical check-up be done by a doctor from the Shaukat Khanum Hospital, alleging that \u201csecret cameras\u201d were installed in her bedroom, which was condemnable and should be removed.\nAbout the opposition alliance, Mr Ayub asserted that the six-party opposition alliance came into being with the sole objective of the restoration of the Constitution and upholding the rule of law in the country.\nHe said the opposition alliance held \u201chistoric public gatherings\u201d in Pishin and Chaman and challenged the PML-N and PPP to hold such public meetings in these areas.\nGlass wall in Adiala Jail\nIn a separate press conference outside Adiala Jail, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said a glass wall had been erected in the room where PTI founder Imran Khan meets his family members and party leaders.\n\u201cToday Imran Khan has directed Sher Afzal Marwat to file a contempt petition in the Islamabad High Court against the erection of the glass wall which is a severe violation of the court\u2019s orders,\u201d he said after meeting Imran Khan in the jail.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The military leadership on Tuesday pledged to take stringent action against individuals disparaging the armed forces, emphasising a zero-tolerance approach to maligning and attacks on their reputation.\nThe corps commanders and the principal staff officers of the army, who met at the General Head\u00adquarters for their monthly conference, with army chief Gen Asim Munir presiding over the session, discussed the \u201cmalicious propaganda campaign\u201d, which they believed was aimed at demoralising the armed forces.\nWhile expressing concern over the situation, the top brass vowed not to \u201callow such efforts to succeed and that as per the law and constitution, stern action will be ensured\u201d.\nOver the past few years, the army has encountered escalating criticism, especially on social media platforms, with such discussions intensifying amid recent political turmoil. While many of these conversations have focused on the military\u2019s involvement in civilian governance and its impact on democracy in the country, some critics have crossed the line with their remarks.\nRecently, an incident in Bahawalnagar involving the army troops and police officials sparked widespread outrage on social media. Videos that showed police personnel being beaten by troops circulated extensively, intensifying public reaction.\nThe military later desc\u00adr\u00adi\u00adbed the incident as \u201cunfortunate\u201d and announced to jointly probe it along with police. But at the same time, it blamed elements with \u201cvested motives\u201d for cashing in on the issue by \u201cfanning vitriolic propaganda on social media\u201d.\nThe recent statement from the corps commanders\u2019 conference was triggered by discussions on social media regarding the Bhawalnagar incident.\nThe military leadership regretted that \u201cunfounded and baseless allegations\u201d against security forces have become \u201ca fashion\u201d. They consider the malicious \u201cpropaganda\u201d was part of a sinister design to divide the masses and the armed forces.\nCounter-terrorism ops\nGen Munir praised the successes of counter-terrorism operations and dir\u00adected their continuation to \u201cpro-actively deny any space to the terrorists\u201d.\nWhile discussing the attack against Chinese workers in Bisham in which five of them lost their lives and incidents of violence in Balochistan, the participants of the conference were told that the terrorists having sanctuaries in Afghanistan were \u201cacting as proxies\u201d against Pakistan and its economic interests, especially China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.\nIran-Israel conflict\nThe military expressed concern about the potential risks posed by escalating tensions in the Middle East due to the start of direct conflict between Iran and Israel with the former retaliating the bombing of its consulate in Damascus by the latter.\n\u201cThe forum expressed concern over escalating tensions in the Middle East and noted that a wider regional conflict could ensue if both sides did not de-escalate immediately,\u201d ISPR said in its statement.\nBy highlighting the possibility of a wider regional conflict if both of the involved parties do not de-escalate immediately, the military demonstrated a neutral stance in the conflict.\n"

Previous reports indicated Pakis\u00adtan\u2019s interest in a $6bn-$8bn EFF package spanning three years to bolster its economic stability.\n\u201cBy the time we get to the second or third week of May, I do think we\u2019ll start getting into the contours of discussions\u201d about a new programme, he said.\nThe IMF\u2019s Extended Fund Facility provides financial assistance to countries facing serious medium-term balance of payments problems due to structural weaknesses that require time to address.\nIn his Tuesday meetings, the finance minister addressed reforms proposed by the IMF to meet targets agreed upon during negotiations for the current programmes, expiring later this month.\nIn one of these meetings, Mr Aurangzeb briefed Hela Cheikhrouhou of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) on ongoing reforms in Pakistan\u2019s taxation, energy and privatisation sectors.\nHe also expressed Pakistan\u2019s commitment to collaborate closely with the IFC \u201cin the priority areas of securitisation of remittances, mining, airport management and capacity-building,\u201d as his team stated.\nIn interviews with various US and international media outlets, the finance minister expressed optimism about market confidence, which spurred him to initiate discussions with the IMF for a larger and extended programme.\nHowever, an IMF spokesperson emphasised the organisation\u2019s current commitment to completing the ongoing Stand-by Agreement programme. The Fund, he said, would engage in preliminary discussions for a successor programme following its conclusion.\nThe finance minister also stressed the importance of striking a balanced approach in Pakistan\u2019s trading relationships with the United States and China amid their trade war. He hoped Pakistan could sustain positive relations with both countries despite their rivalry.\nThe minister also emphasised the government\u2019s dedication to carrying forward the structural reform programme initiated by the previous administration.\nAs part of the programme, Pakistan is privatising underperforming state-owned enterprises (SOEs), including Pakistan International Airlines, the national flag carrier.\nMr Aurangzeb reiterated the government\u2019s objective to go ahead with privatisation and accomplish it by the end of June.\nHe added that if the privatisation of Pakistan International Airlines is successful, other state-owned enterprises could undergo a similar process.\nMeeting with Saudi minister\nOn Tuesday, Finance Minister Aurangzeb also met his Saudi counterpart, Mohammad Al-Jadaan.\nA statement released by the Pakistani embassy conveyed that the Saudi finance minister reaffirmed support for Pakistan\u2019s economic growth, including through investments. Both sides agreed to enhance bilateral cooperation and broaden the partnership across various sectors.\nAt the IMF headquarters, Mr Aurangzeb participated in the G-24 finance ministers and central bank governors\u2019 meeting. He acknowledged the support the IMF and the World Bank provided to Pakistan.\nThe minister\u2019s team said that he \u201ctalked about reforms in the areas of taxation, energy, privatisation, and digitalisation\u201d.\nHe also \u201cunderlined the need to bring in more private sector investment and leverage the Adaptation Fund to help the country deal with adverse impacts of climate change\u201d.\nUS State Dept\nMeanwhile, the US State Department welcomed last month\u2019s announcement that the IMF has reached a staff-level agreement with Pakistan.\n\u201cWe understand that the Pakistani Minister of Finance is in town here in Washington for meetings at the IMF and World Bank. Pakistan has made progress in stabilising its economy, and we support its efforts to manage its daunting debt burden,\u201d State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said.\n\u201cWe encourage the government to prioritise and expand economic reforms to address its economic challenges. Our support for the country\u2019s economic success is unwavering, and we will continue to engage with Pakistan through technical agreements as well as through our trade and investment ties, all of which are priorities of our bilateral relationship,\u201d he said.\n"

He added that the petitioner was an MPA and scores of cases had been registered against him after May 9 and 10 protests.\nHe stated that most of these cases were registered on political grounds for victimising the petitioner.\nHe stated that the petitioner now wanted to approach the relevant court to get relief but for that purpose he needed to know about the cases pending against him.\nMr Afridi stated that the petitioner apprehended that he would be arrested on way to the court concerned.\nAdditional Attorney General Sanaullah Khan objected to the petition and contended that he belonged to Lahore and he should have approached the court there.\nHe questioned how could the petitioner approach this high court when cases pertained to other provinces.\nThe bench observed there was nothing to hide in providing information about cases against the petitioner.\nWhen the bench inquired from Mr Afridi whether the petitioner was present in the courtroom, he replied that he was busy in marriage ceremony of his daughter on Monday night due to which he could not turn up in the case.

            "Text": "SHANGLA: Police investigations have revealed that poor car checking at security posts and a lack of coordination among law-enforcement agencies led to the March 26 Bisham bus bombing that killed five Chinese workers and the Pakistani driver, say officials.\nThey told Dawn that the explosive-laden car that targetted the bus of Chinese workers reached Bisham from Balochistan\u2019s Chaman area 10 days before the terrorist attack. The officials shared with Dawn the footage of CCTV cameras installed on the road from Shangla Top to the Bisham Maira area.\nThe video recording showed that the car entered Shangla by the Shangla Top in Alpuri tehsil early on March 15.\nThe car travelled through Chakdara in Malakand district and Swat district before crossing all checkpoints in Shangla district. It crossed around 30 police checkpoints from Chakdara to Bisham, according to the footage.\n\nIt also points out lack of coordination among law-enforcement agencies\n\nA senior police official told Dawn that the bombing\u2019s planners were also involved in the July 14, 2021, suicide attack on the bus carrying Chinese workers of the Dassu hydropower project in Upper Kohistan district.\nChinese nationals are working on most of the energy and other projects being executed in the region under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor initiative.\nA police official in Bisham told Dawn that the explosive-laden car was parked by the bomber\u2019s facilitator at a filling station in the Shaga Maira area of Bisham on March 15 after the payment of Rs500 a night before both the bomber and his facilitator left for the Oghi area in Mansehra district.\nHe said the CCTV cameras installed at the filling station were out of order, and therefore, the movements of both terrorists couldn\u2019t be filmed.\nThe official said the guard and the owner of the premises had been taken into custody for interrogation. He said Hazrat Bilal, the prime suspect in the attack, belonged to the Jag Dubair area of Lower Kohistan but currently lived in the Oghi area of Mansehra district.\nThe official said that the suspect was involved in the 2021 Dasu attack and was a close aide to Tariq alias Button Kharab, the planner of terrorist attacks from Afghanistan.\nSenior officials of the counter-terrorism department told Dawn that all planners and facilitators of the Bisham bombing had been traced with the help of a SIM card, and they were based in both Pakistan and Afghanistan.\nThey said more arrests were also expected in the days ahead.\nThe officials saidMohammad Shafiq, a government Class-IV official, Wajid, from the Kohistan region, facilitated the March 26 Bisham suicide attack.\nThey said the car drove past the Bisham police station at 6:17am on March 26 that stood 3.5 kilometers from the blast site, while the two Chinese buses crossed that point at 12:49pm and reached the Lahore nullah at 01:01pm before being hit by the slow-moving explosive-laden car.\nThe investigators said the car moved between Bisham and Pandiar checkpoints, which bordered Kohistan, for eight hours, waiting for the Chinese convoy to show up.\nThey insisted that the bomber\u2019s facilitator stayed in contact with an attack planner over the phone until the mission was accomplished.\nA police officer in Bisham insisted he wrote a letter to his top bosses, insisting that the Chinese security officials never asked the police for help or informed them about the movement of their convoys.\nHe also said Chinese nationals worked in Kohistan, but the region\u2019s police or intelligence officials didn\u2019t share anything about the movement of those foreigners.\nThe government has already suspended RPO of Hazara region Ijaz Khan, DPO of Upper Kohistan Suliman Khan, DPO of Lower Kohistan Jamil Akhtar and Dasu project security officer over the \u201cfailure of security coordination\u201d after the Bisham bus bombing.\nA staff member of the Dasu Hydropower Project told Dawn that Chinese engineers and workers travelled to and from Islamabad in buses every two days via the Karakoram Highway, but arrangements for their security were never changed.\nHe, however, said the security of Chinese workers and the buses carrying them was significantly improved after the Dasu attack.\n\u201cFour to five security vehicles used to follow the buses with Chinese workers aboard,\u201d he said.\nWhen contacted, district police officer Imran Khan said no check posts in Shangla had scanners. He said police officials manually checked cars at all entry and exit points.\nA senior law-enforcement officer told Dawn that there should be proper coordination among police, law-enforcement agencies, and Wapda and Chinese security officials, as well as proper vehicle examination at security checkpoints after the Dasu attack due to the vulnerability of Chinese workers.\n\u201cIt is essential to change vehicles, routes, and bus timings, and even security vehicles should follow each of the buses instead of following both buses from front and back,\u201d he said.\n"

A number of literary figures, members of political and social organisations and local youth representatives attended the session.\nSpeakers Naseem Lala, Riaz Afridi, Yousaf Baheer, Aftab Shinwari and Rizwan Shalmani said Faqir Eppi waged a noble war against the British and rendered numerous sacrifices for the liberation of Pakhtun nation.\nThey said Faqir Eppi was a Darwaish (pious person), who spent very simple life while leading the Pakhtun nation from the front in their struggle for their independence from the colonial forces.\nThey said Faqir Eppi played an important role in imparting both religious and formal education to Pakhtun children. He also stressed the need for development and prosperity of Pakhtuns.\nThey, however, regretted that Pakhtun nation was intentionally kept ignorant about the glorious past of their heroes, whose achievements were not included in the textbooks. They said Pakhtun nation could not progress unless their mother language was included in the educational curriculum for which a collective struggle was required by all the stakeholders.\nThey stressed the need for awareness about the glorious achievements of all the Pakhtun nationalist leaders, while also demanding legitimate share in the natural resources and befittingly remembering their past leaders. \n"

The interior minister will be given a detailed presentation on CDA\u2019s ongoing development work as well as future plans.\nOfficials of civic agency remained busy on Tuesday in completing the presentation and other arrangements for the said visit. \u201cThe interior minister is likely to visit CDA on Wednesday to get a briefing and we are preparing working papers for his briefing,\u201d said a CDA deputy director. \nSources said that the minister will be briefed about the ongoing development projects that include the expansion project of Islamabad Expressway, a portion of Margalla Road to link D-12 and E-11, ongoing work of Park Road, 10th Avenue, 11th Avenue etc. Whereas, he will also be briefed about Islamabad\u2019s master plan as well as development work in some new residential sectors and stalled sectors.\nHe would also be briefed about the planned projects.\nOfficials of CDA Dawn spoke to said that there are chances that the interior minister will give new targets to the civic agency.\nThey, however, said that CDA management should also convince the interior minister to lend his support for resolving two major issues of CDA, which could not be resolved without the acting support of the interior minister.\nThey said that a mega project of 10th Avenue, worth Rs 10.2 billion \u2013 which is a federal government-funded project has been facing delay in completion mainly because of funding. The officials said that the interior minister could play his role in securing maximum funds for this project for the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.\nThis project was supposed to be completed by March 2024, but it missed the deadline and sources said that so far only 25pc work is completed. Sources said that so far the federal government had released only Rs3 billion for this project.\nSimilarly, the officials said that the interior minister could play his role regarding a CDA summary, which is already lying somewhere in the interior ministry or the cabinet division, for the formation of Islamabad\u2019s master plan commission.\nThey said that in December 2022, CDA had moved the summary after the commission formed in 2018 by the PTI government became inactive.\nHowever, the said summary was not approved rather the interim government directed the CDA to send a revised summary, which was sent in February this year. Officials said that the interior minister\u2019s help would be required to get it approved by the cabinet.\nIt is relevant to note here, according to the authors of the master plan of Islamabad, prepared in 1960, the blueprint of the capital was supposed to be revised every 20 years in accordance with the need of hours, but no proper revision was made yet that resulted in poor planning issues.\nOn the other hand, the successive governments made 45 selective changes, without any input from experts, whereas the incumbent government is also set to make another amendment, which is related to the land use change in Sector H-16, for converting two sub-sectors from institutions to residential.\n"

He said that after the reduction in the flour price, the price of Roti has also been reduced.\nMeanwhile, the All Pakistan Naanbai Association president was sent to jail after he was detained by police under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) for allegedly inciting people against the Punjab government\u2019s notification regarding the reduction in the price of Roti.\nRizwan Zafar, a head constable posted at Banni police station, lodged an FIR saying that he was sitting at a hotel near Razi Hospital when he came across a message on WhatsApp where one person was seen disputing the notification of the Punjab government in a video statement.\nHe said in the FIR that the man identified himself as Shafiq Qureshi, the president of the naan-bai association. \nAccording to the FIR, Mr Qureshi claimed that the notification was fake and they would fight against the government and their organisations across Punjab had become active. \nWhile addressing the tandoor owners, he told them not to reduce the prices of Roti as per the government\u2019s directive. The police said that the said person incited people against the government by issuing statements against government policies and disrupting public peace.\nCrackdown in Attock\nThe Attock district administration on Tuesday launched a crackdown on Naanbais, arresting nine tandoor owners and imposing a fine of Rs94,500. During the crackdown, 706 tandoors across the district were inspected.\nTalking to journalists, Attock Deputy Commissioner Rao Atif Raza said that price magistrates would carry out surprise visits to tandoors in all six tehsils in the morning and evening and the government would not allow anyone to sell bread at high prices.\nResponding to a question, he claimed the price of a 20kg bag of flour had dropped by Rs500. He said the price list should be displayed in all shops and the local administration should ensure its implementation.\nDC Raza said that the Punjab government had fixed the price of Roti at Rs16 for 100 grams, while the price of Naan was fixed at Rs20 for 120 grams. He requested the public to assist the divisional administration and register their complaints on 0800-02345.\n\u2014 Amjad Iqbal in Taxila also contributed to this report\n"

Such decision does not fall in the ambit of look after charge range, therefore, is violative of clarification of Establishment Division.\u201d\nThe Establishment Division issued an office memorandum on April 9, 2021 in which the clarification about the look after charge was circulated among all the ministries.\nIn the clarification, the Establishment Division stated that \u201cthere is no provision of look after charge in Civil Servants Act, 1973 and Rules made thereunder, rather an officer can be deputed temporarily as an internal arrangement to look after the work of another post for disposal of day to day work of urgent and routine nature.\u201d\nIt added: \u201cas a matter of principle, the senior most officer is normally asked by the head of Division/Department to look after the work of a post when its incumbent is temporarily away.\u201d\nAs per the Establishment Division\u2019s memorandum, the officer on current charge cannot exercise the powers related to financial and administrative in nature.\nThe PSB also termed the assigning of look after charge and subsequent posting and transfer by the acting DG against the law laid down by superior courts.\nThe letter concluded: \u201cthe above mentioned deputations and postings were made by the IPC ministry in PSB in violation of the constitution of the PSB, clarification of Establishment Division, laws, rules and against the principles settled by superior courts, therefore, have no legal sanctity in the eye of law.\u201d\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: Strongly opposing the petroleum pricing deregulation model suggested by the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra), the oil refineries have started shutting down their refining units due to storage constraints caused by declining sales of domestic products and the rising influx of smuggled products throughout the country.\n\u201cWhy would oil marketing companies (OMCs) lift oil product from refineries, involving a substantial impact of taxes, when they can access cheaper product in the black market?\u201d questioned an official representing the refining sector. He added that Ogra had proposed doing away with requirement of uplifting domestic products from refineries, giving companies the freedom to source their products at their own will on commercial basis.\nThe current situation is an eye-opener even before the pricing deregulation is allowed, he said, adding that availability of smuggled products, once limited to border areas, has now expanded across the country, forcing refineries to drastically cut down their production.\n\u201cAttock Refinery has been forced to shut down its main distillation unit (of 32,000 barrels per day), reducing its capacity to only 33pc on Monday,\u201d the official said.\n\nSay shutting down units due to storage constraints, low sales and smuggling surge\n\n\u201cThe ongoing rampant smuggling and now proposals of oil pricing deregulation without consultation of all stake stakeholders may jeopardise refineries\u2019 upgradation plans, which were expected to bring in $5-6 billion investment following the recent approval of Refineries Upgradation Policy,\u201d warned all five refineries in the country.\nIn a letter, the refineries expressed \u201cdeep concern\u201d over Ogra\u2019s recommendation to disband the first upliftment priority principle of local product for providing \u201clevel playing field to OMCs for negotiating ex-refinery price\u201d. They also protested Ogra\u2019s recommendation that \u201cOMCs should be given the choice to efficiently source their supplies locally or from the international market in complete negation of the laid down principle\u201d as required under Rule 35(g) of Pakistan Oil (Refining, Blending, Transportation, Storage and Marketing) Rules 2016 (OGRA Rules).\nThe protest letter stated that the refineries were strategic assets of the country, and their sustainability and continuity were essential for the prosperity and economic development of Pakistan. \n\u201cLocal refineries are the backbone of industrial development and are intrinsically connected to the defense and energy security needs of the country. Any blind reliance on completely imported fuels will not only increase the risk to the country\u2019s energy supply chain but also has the potential to result in disastrous consequences,\u201d noted the letter, jointly written by chief executives of Attock, Cynergico, National, Pak-Arab, and Pakistan Refineries.\nThe refineries\u2019 $5-6bn upgradation plan would not only result in cleaner, environment-friendly fuels of Euro-V specifications but would also lead to savings of precious foreign exchange by substantially increasing local production of diesel and petrol. \n\u201cHence, it would be most unfortunate if the planned upgradation projects are abandoned by the refineries due to these irrational recommendations,\u201d the refineries said, adding that the deregulation of the inland freight equalisation margin (IFEM) would also impact the adjustment of customs duty paid by the refineries on the import of crude oil, subsequently placing importing refineries at a huge disadvantage.\nThey said the refining sector was already struggling to operate at optimum levels due to the menace of smuggled inferior products in the country and would further get a major set-back from Ogra proposed model. \nThey said the deregulation of petroleum products was a complex and critical issue and local refineries being major stakeholders must be involved and consulted before moving forward. The sector required pragmatic and supporting measures rather than suggesting ways that if implemented would result in permanent closure of refineries.\n"

Companies like Mari Petroleum Ltd, United Bank Ltd, Engro Fertilisers Ltd, Lucky Cement and Oil and Gas Development Company collectively contributed 351 points to the index performance. \nHowever, Hub Power, Bank Al-Habib and EPCL collected wiped out 57 points. Ahsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation attributed the rally to robust corporate earnings season and rising expectations of a cut in the State Bank of Pakistan\u2019s policy rate in its upcoming Monetary Policy Committee meeting on April 29 following a sharp deceleration in the headline inflation to 20.7pc in March.\nHe added that the deliberations on privatisation of state-owned enterprises, rupee stability amid foreign inflows and progress on the new Extended Fund Facility as an IMF team will be visiting next month to proceed further on Pakistan\u2019s loan request also contributed to the market\u2019s highest closing ever.\nHowever, the index moved both ways, dipping to the day\u2019s low at 70,882.45, losing 27.46 points, and a high of 71,861.18, gaining 951.28 points. As a result, the benchmark KSE 100 index closed at 71,433.46 points after adding 523.56 points, or 0.74pc from the preceding session.\nThe overall trading volume surged 37.69pc to 655.20 million shares. The traded value also rose 34.57pc to Rs31.24bn on a day-on-day basis.\nStocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included Habib Bank Ltd (48.14m shares), Pak Refinery Ltd (30.50m shar\u00ades), Pak Elektron Ltd (28.59m shares), Worldcall Tele\u00adcom Ltd (24.62m sha\u00adres) and K-Electric (23.58m shares).\nThe companies registering the major increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Mari Petroleum Company Ltd (Rs133.51), Ismail Indu\u00adstries (Rs76.35), Hallmark Company Ltd (Rs60.00), Nestle Pakistan Ltd (Rs52.01) and Sazgar Engin\u00adeering Works Ltd (Rs41.63).\nThe shares registering the most significant decre\u00adases in their share prices in absolute terms were Unile\u00adver Foods Ltd (Rs366.66), Sapphire Fibres (Rs69.90), Philip Morris Pakistan Ltd (Rs54.30), Rafhan Maize Products Company Ltd (Rs40.00), Shahmurad Sugar Mills Ltd (Rs36.03).\nForeign investors continued their buying spree and picked shares worth $1.19m.\n"

            "Text": "WASHINGTON: The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will meet on April 29 to finalise its last review of Pakistan\u2019s $3 billion Stand-By Arrangement (SBA).\n\u201cAccording to the IMF\u2019s event calendar, the review meeting is set for 10:00am on April 29,\u201d a diplomatic source informed Dawn.\nEarlier this week, the Fund published a schedule of the Executive Board\u2019s meetings on its website, which indicated Nigeria as the country whose programme would be reviewed on April 29. The subsequent meeting on May 1 will review IMF programmes with Kiribati and Montenegro, with Pakistan notably absent from the list.\nPrevious statements from both the IMF and Pakistani officials indicated that not only would the board convene on April 29, but it would also approve the release of the final tranche of $1.1 billion under the SBA signed in June 2023.\nThe absence of this meeting from the IMF\u2019s public calendar has sparked speculation in Pakistan, suggesting that the country may have been excluded from the board\u2019s agenda. Some have even speculated that Pakistan might need to renegotiate the release of the final tranche.\n\u201cThese are baseless speculations,\u201d said a former World Bank official. \u201cThe IMF doesn\u2019t operate in this manner. If there\u2019s a decision to delay a programme, it would be done openly, not clandestinely.\u201d\nHe explained that while a meeting might be delayed due to scheduling complications, this typically has no impact on a programme after a Staff-Level Agreement (SLA).\nIn March, IMF staff and Pakistani authorities reached an SLA for the second and final review, which was subsequently forwarded to the board for final approval. Upon approval, Pakistan would have access to SDR 828 million (approximately $1.1bn).\nMeanwhile, in an interview with the US news magazine, The National, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb stated that Pakistan is on track to secure a new loan from the IMF, adding that the money lender had been \u201cvery receptive in terms of agreeing to consider a larger, longer programme\u201d.\nIn the interview published on Monday, Aurangzeb said that macroeconomic indicators were shifting in Pakistan\u2019s favour. \u201cHe also sounded optimistic that Pakistan\u2019s currency has finally stabilised and said rampant inflation is on track to drop to single-digit levels by the end of next year,\u201d The National said.\nThe National noted that Pakistan was seeking a $6bn IMF loan, but Aurangzeb said the figure was more of a \u201cguesstimate.\u201d The loan\u2019s final details will be determined when an IMF mission visits Islamabad next month.\nIn the interview, the finance minister also talked about China and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), stating that Pakistan had \u201cmissed a trick\u201d by taking too long to monetise projects, including through boosting exports to special economic zones.\n\u201cWe have been slow over the last few years,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going to move forward with phase two so that we can get going with the revenue-generating part of the CPEC,\u201d he said.\nHe also underscored the importance of remittances to Pakistan\u2019s economy. He said that payments from overseas were on the rise and were expected to rise to about $29bn this fiscal year.\nMeeting with UAE investors\nThe state-run news agency APP reported on Monday that Mr Aurangzeb held meetings in Dubai with leading UAE investors, including Ayana Holding Chairman Abdulla Bin Lahej and Nad Al Shiba Holding chief Mohammed Hilal Bin Tarraf Al Mansoori.\nThe minister explored ways to enhance investment activity between the UAE and Pakistan by supporting existing economic partnerships and exploring further diversification in information technology, renewable energy, transport and logistics, infrastructure and real estate development, according to a press statement issued by the finance ministry.\nHe highlighted the competitive advantages that make Pakistan an ideal destination for investors seeking high returns and sustainable growth.\nThe minister also highlighted the role of the Special Investment Facilitation Council in assisting investors at every stage of their journey, comprehensive support services including market research, regulatory guidance, investment facilitation, and post-investment support, ensuring a smooth experience.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Monday issued notices to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), attorney general (AGP) and MNA Sadaf Ihsan in an impersonation case, filed by the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F).\nThe party accuses Ms Ihsan of impersonating the candidate actually fielded by them on a reserved seat for women from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\nThe case was taken up by a three-judge SC bench headed by Justice Amin-ud-Din Khan. The JUI-F had moved the apex court against the Peshawar High Court\u2019s (PHC) April 2 order which had led the ECP to reinstate Ms Ihsan as a member of the National Assembly.\nWhile issuing notices, the apex court observed that it cannot settle the matter without hearing the commission as well as the AGP and postponed the proceedings for two weeks.\n\nJUI-F claims Sadaf Ihsan \u2018impersonated\u2019 its candidate to become MNA\n\nRepresenting JUI-F, senior counsel Kamran Murtaza explained that the party had submitted with the ECP separate lists of its candidates in order of priority for seats reserved for women and non-Muslims, adding the party would withdraw its stance if Ms Ihsan presents before the court the ticket that the party had issued to her.\nEarlier, the ECP had withdrawn the victory notification after the JUI-F disowned Ms Ihsan being a member of the party.\nIn its petition, JUI-F pleaded that a list was furnished to the ECP containing details for three candidates, including Hina Bibi (Respondent 6). However, to the extent of Sadaf Yasmin \u2014 the candidate who Sadaf Ihsan impersonated \u2014 only her name was added to the list because other details had not been conveyed by her to the party.\nAccording to the petition, prior to the issuance of the notification of the returned candidate, the ECP ought to have either rejected the list to the extent of Sadaf Yasmin or sought clarification from the party whether Sadaf Ihsan was Sadaf Yasmin or not.\nThe JUI-F emphasised that it was purely the prerogative of political parties to decide the candidature for the reserved seats of women in order of priority under Article 51(e) of the Constitution, Section 104 of the Elections Act, 2017 and Chapter VI of Elections Rules 2017.\nThe ECP can recall or amend a notification issued under Article 51 of the Constitution, read with Section 104 of Elections Act 2017 for reserved NA seats for women, if an impersonator has managed to get a reserved seat due to negligence of the Returning Officer, the petition said.\nA political party and the rightful candidate cannot be deprived of a seat due to negligence on part of an ECP official, the petition bemoaned, adding that the claim of Ms Ihsan on the seat was a privilege granted by the party.\nThus Ms Ihsan cannot claim rights on a seat before the PHC by going against the stance of her own party about her being an impersonator and her having no right to enforce for a reserved seat not meant for her, the petition emphasised.\n"

The theme of this year\u2019s Earth Day was \u201cPlanet vs Plastics\u201d. \n\u201cAs we unite to observe this day under the theme, \u201cPlanet vs Plastics\u201d that calls for a 60 per cent reduction in plastic use by 2040, let us reaffirm our commitment to use plastic responsibly to reduce plastic waste that is not only polluting our oceans, lakes, and rivers but are also making inroads into our food systems, posing a direct and serious threat to human health,\u201d the PM\u2019s message said. \nThe prime minister appealed to the people to reduce the use of single-use plastics and embrace recycled and eco-friendly alternatives, and advocate for stronger environmental policies at every level of society.\n\nShehbaz emphasises role of provincial govts, people in safeguarding planet\n\nSeveral past governments tried to impose a complete ban on use of plastic shopping bags but failed to implement it.\nCalling the International Earth Day a reminder of shared responsibility towards protecting our planet for now and for future generations, the prime minister said that though Pakistan was among one of the most climate-vulnerable countries, there was little awareness about the risks of climate change threatening the development, well-being and economic security of the masses.\n\u201cYear after year, we are witnessing its devastating impacts \u2014 from changing seasonal weather patterns, rising temperatures, variability of monsoons and melting of glaciers in the north, further compounded with recurrent extreme weather events and natural disasters \u2014 to the slower onset events of sea level rise, warming seas and loss of ecosystems,\u201d the prime minister said.\nHe said that effects of climate change had exacerbated over the years, which puts the country at an even greater economic and physical risk. \n\u201cHence, we understand the urgency of taking bold and decisive steps to confront these challenges and build resilience in the face of adversity,\u201d he said.\nThe government, he said, was leading the charge and remained committed to making its contribution as it had initiated an exhaustive consultative process with ministries concerned, provincial environment departments, Islamabad Capital Territory  administration, industries and other relevant stakeholders for developing Single-Use Plastics (Prohibition) Regulations, 2023, as well as restriction on the use of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) bottles in federal ministries/divisions.\n\u201cThese initiatives underscore our commitment towards promoting a sustainable circular economy for plastics by reducing waste, and consumption, and encouraging reuse, recycling, and material recovery.\u201d\n\u201cTo achieve a plastic-free society and effectively combat the escalating issue of plastic pollution in Pakistan, it is imperative to address the underlying causes and promote a holistic approach for managing plastic waste,\u201d the prime minister said.\nMr Sharif said the role of provincial governments and local authorities was of prime importance and urged the people to play their role in safeguarding the planet for the prosperity of all.\nRecounting the nature\u2019s bounties for the country in the form of awe-inspiring mountains, dense forests and pristine lakes and coasts, the prime minister emphasised the society\u2019s responsibility to protect them.\nLater, the visiting Iranian President Dr Seyyed Ebrahim Raisi and PM Sharif jointly planted a sapling in the lawn of the Prime Minister\u2019s House to mark the annual Earth Day.\nAccompanied by his spouse and a high-powered delegation of ministers and businessmen, the Iranian president arrived here on a three-day official visit on Monday.\nBoth the dignitaries planted the sapling of Chir pine, also known as Pinus roxburghii, native to the Himalayas.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: Just a day after by-elections were held across the country, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leaders alleged that intelligence and security agencies had played a role in rigging the polls.\nSaying that April 21 will be remembered as a \u201cblack day\u201d in the history of Pakistan, the party urged the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to withhold the notifications of results and announced a series of protests, starting from Friday.\n\u201c[The] day of election is considered an accountability day, and people cast their votes with great zeal. However, on April 21, open and blatant violations of law were observed. The magnitude of the rigging and violation of law has never been observed in the history of Pakistan. Gates of polling stations were closed, and at some polling stations, more votes were polled than the total registered votes,\u201d PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan told a press conference.\nAccompanied by Opposition Leader in the National Assembly Omar Ayub, Central Information Secretary Raoof Hasan, and Sunni Ittehad Council chief Sahibzada Hamid Raza, the PTI chairman said that at one polling station in Gujrat, election staff informed him that 120 votes were cast, yet three boxes full of ballot papers were seen.\n\nAnnounces plans to protest poll manipulation from Friday; demands sedition cases against Punjab govt bosses\n\n\u201cAt one polling station, the candidate\u2019s father informed us that votes were already cast even though polling time had not yet begun. We have reported all complaints to the ECP, but the election watchdog took no action. We demand that the ECP conduct an inquiry and also share that how it will ensure that such rigging will not be repeated next time,\u201d he said.\nHe also questioned why the ECP didn\u2019t involve returning officers (ROs) and district returning officers from the judiciary, highlighting doubts about the ECP\u2019s credibility.\n\u201cWe went to another polling station but found out that our polling agents were forced to leave,\u201d Barrister Gohar said.\nOmar Ayub said that pre-poll rigging began with suspension of the internet, and alleged that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz did not \u201cbelieve in transparency\u201d.\nHe also showed a letter from RO of NA-8 Bajaur to the DRO, claiming that the RO alleged that an intelligence official had beaten the staff.\nHowever, the letter has been debunked by the Bajaur administration as being \u2018doctored\u2019.\n\u201cPunjab police picked up and badly beat journalists. We also heard reports of agency personnel wearing Punjab police uniforms. Police also misbehaved with us and claimed they were helpless. We will take legal action against the DIG Gujrat, SP Investigation, DSP and SHOs\u2026 who also assaulted journalists,\u201d he said.\nMr Ayub claimed that Shehbaz Sharif got fewer votes during the general elections than the candidate contesting on the PML-N ticket in by-election.\n\u2018\u2018This is beyond comprehension.\u2019\u2019\n\u201cWe will start protests, along with other parties, next Friday across the country.\n\u2019\u2019Then we will hold another protest in Faisalabad, followed by organising a public meeting in Karachi on May 5, and then a series of public meetings will be held across the country,\u201c he said.\nHe said that police officials told them that intelligence agencies were not allowing voters to enter polling stations.\nSahibzada Hamid Raza alleged that the Punjab government was involved in rigging.\nHe said government officials forcefully obtained signatures on Form 45s and made videos while paying money to some individuals.\nHe suggested that cases of sedition, including Article 6, be registered against the Punjab government high-ups.\n"

The police said both suspects have confessed to their crime.\nAccording to reports, six months ago, Bisma, of village 111/EB, was married to Nasir in village 79/EB. Allegedly, Bisma was not willing to marry Nasir and had an affair with Imran, a fellow villager.\nAfter the marriage, Bisma eloped with Imran, prompting her mother Sadiqan to file a case against Ismail and Imran at Arifwala Saddar police. However, Bisma, in court, testified in favour of Imran and Ismail, claiming that she had left Nasir\u2019s house due to mistreatment.\nThe case was dropped and Bisma was returned to her parents\u2019 home.\nA few days ago, Nasir requested Bisma\u2019s parents to return her, to which they reluctantly agreed. However, Bisma refused to return to Nasir\u2019s house, to which her parents administered poisonous pills to her in her food. The police shifted the body to Arifwala Tehsil Headquarters Hospital.\nRAID: Commissioner Shoaib Iqbal ordered the replacement of the entire examination staff at the Government Graduate College examination center due to \u201cpoor efficiency and vigilance\u201d on Monday.\nNaveed Azamt, the controller of the Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, confirmed to Dawn that a new staff comprising six personnel had been appointed before the commencement of the evening paper.\nReports said suggest that the commissioner, who holds dual charge as board chairman, observed lax vigilance and witnessed the unauthorized use of mobile phones outside the examination centre.

In such a situation, the farmers are stuck between the devil and the deep blue sea.  \nThe procurement target to two million metric tonnes set by the Punjab Food Department for the year 2024-25 is already less than half of the previous year as the government currently has a carryover wheat stock of 20 million metric tonnes. \nWaqar Gondal, a farmer from tehsil Jatoi, told Dawn that he had cultivated wheat on 35 acres after the district administration and food department launched campaigns to cultivate the crop. He said he was told by the bureaucracy on wheat cultivation month that the government would purchase all the wheat from the farmers in the province and would also offer a better price.  \n\u201cHowever, the government first did not announce a good wheat support price (Rs3,900 per maund) and then it delayed purchasing wheat.\u201d \n\nGovt reluctant to procure wheat while local market offers peanuts\n\nGondal said the government should have announced the support price around Rs6,000 per maund and provided gunny bags to the farmers at the start of April but thousands of farmers who had harvested their crop had not received a single bag yet. He said he himself needed 2,000 bags to sell his wheat. \nCriticising the government of Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, he said that the CM was celebrating Baisakhi festival but did not start wheat procurement where harvesting had been done. \n\u201cThe farmers would not be able to sow cotton if all their wheat is lying in the fields. And if their wheat produce is not purchased, they won\u2019t have any money to cultivate the cotton,\u201d Gondal shared his apprehensions. \nBesides, the government had only announced to purchase wheat only from the farmers having six acres of land, he lamented. \nAbout the rate of wheat, Gondal claimed that the local market was offering Rs3,100 per maund, which was akin to ruining all of farmers\u2019 produce and they would prefer to set the wheat on fire instead of selling at such a low rate. \nAnother farmer, Sardar Afzal Khan, told Dawn that his tehsil Alipur falls under the Pakistan Agriculture Storage and Services Corporation Ltd (PASSCO) and he had held meetings with the corporation officials to get bags to sell his wheat. He alleged that the officials were willing to give bags only after getting Rs400 per bag.  \n\u201cWe also have offered the officials to give Rs200 per bag but giving Rs400 per bag would leave us in deficit.\u201d \nKhan alleged that the coalition government in Islamabad and PML-N government in Punjab were trying to kill the farmers and it was the history of the PML-N that it would always facilitate the middleman (traders) and not the farmers. \nHe said the wheat procurement had not started yet and they were covering their wheat in the open while the weather conditions were also turning against them and it was a risk to keep wheat in the fields. \nMeanwhile, PTI Senator and the party president of south Punjab Aon Abbas Buppi along with other leaders addressed a press conference at the Multan Press Club. He highlighted the PTI\u2019s stance on farmers\u2019 issues, emphasizing the urgent need to address the significant problem of wheat price in south Punjab. \n\u201cThe current wheat pricing crisis has pushed farmers to the brink, with wheat being priced at Rs2,700 per maund in the Bahawalpur  region. In contrast, during the PTI\u2019s tenure, wheat was priced at Rs3,900, demonstrating the party\u2019s commitment to resolving farmers\u2019 issues.\u201d \nBuppi talked about the international pressure, prompting the purchase of wheat from Ukraine and demanded an inquiry against those who profited from the wheat bought from Ukraine.  \nThe government imported 3.2 million tonnes of Ukrainian wheat at the cost of Rs3,100 per maund and subsequently sold in the market for Rs4,500.  \nMeanwhile, the government has stockpiled four million tonnes of local wheat in its warehouses, exacerbating the crisis for local farmers. The imported wheat has been sold in the market while local wheat is being neglected. \nSenator Buppi warned that if the government fails to address farmers\u2019 concerns, it could lead to a severe wheat crisis in Pakistan, possibly resulting in farmers refraining from wheat cultivation next year. He announced that his party would support the farmers and hold peaceful protests against the injustice to the wheat farmers. The protest rally would commence from Multan and move towards Lahore, where thousands of farmers would bring their wheat on tractor-trolleys to block Lahore.\n"

            "Text": "LAHORE: In an unprecedented move, the Punjab government has appointed Professor Dr Shazia Bashir as the acting vice chancellor (VC) of the Government College University (GCU) \u2014 the first woman in the university\u2019s 160-year history to have this position.\nProf Bashir, a former Ravian, has been serving GCU Lahore since 1996 and was previously the dean of the Faculty of Mathematical and Physical Sciences. She has an extensive academic background, with a Master\u2019s degree in Physics from the Government College Lahore, an MPhil from the University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore, and a PhD from the Technical University, Vienna, Austria.\nHer tenure as the director of the Centre for Advanced Studies in Physics and Institute of Physics and Chairperson, Department of Physics, has been marked by significant contributions to research and development in the field. She has more than 150 research publications appearing in reputed international journals to her credit.\nThe appointment, conferred by Punjab Governor Balighur Rehman, is for a period of four months or until the appointment of a regular VC. The faculty, staff, and students have welcomed this historic appointment.\nHowever, this appointment comes amidst a leadership crisis in Punjab\u2019s public sector universities. At least 29 of these institutions are currently operating without regular VCs, leading to a host of academic and administrative issues.\nThe Higher Education Department (HED), which administers 34 public universities in the province, has seen the tenure of regular VCs at 22 universities expire one and a half years ago and four others more than six months ago. Three new universities established by the government also require the appointment of VCs.\nThe lack of permanent leadership has raised concerns among the academic staff associations of the universities, which believe that absence of regular VCs is compromising the standards of education and research in these varsities.\nThe most important positions, including VCs, registrar, treasurers, and controllers of examinations, have been lying vacant in many universities in the province.\nOn March 24, Governor Balighur Rehman had written a letter to Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, urging her to make permanent appointments to important posts, including those of VCs, across the province.\nThe interim government had issued advertisements for the vacant posts of VCs and constituted search committees for interviewing the candidates for the slots.\nHowever, the process remained incomplete as it was challenged in court with the argument that the interim government could not hire VCs under the law.\nSources claim that HED officers are reluctant to re-advertise the posts and want to fill them based on the previous advertisement.\nThis lapse in statutory tenures has disrupted the varsities\u2019 core functions, such as academic processes, administrative controls, decision-making, and financial management. Currently, these universities are being run by pro-VCs or VCs having additional or acting charge.\nProf Bashir is also third acting vice chancellor of the GCU, as the Punjab government has again failed to tackle the larger issue of vacant posts of VCs in the universities of the province.\n"

            "Text": "LAHORE: The Punjab government has appointed a junior police officer as new DIG Operations Lahore (BPS-20), leaving many officers, particularly those serving in BPS-20, shocked over the choice of the PML-N government. \nFaisal Kamran (BPS-19) from 36th Common was serving as district police officer (DPO) Sargodha when he was transferred and posted as DIG Operations Lahore on Monday against the BPS-20 slot vice Ali Nasir Rizvi who had been posted as IG police Islamabad. \nThe sources, privy to the development, said Mr Kamran was appointed on recommendations of PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif who suggested his name to Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz. The officer had served him as chief security officer (CSO) in 2016-17 when he was the prime minister. Since then, Mr Kamran has remained in the good books of Nawaz, the sources said. \n\nPosting, done on Nawaz\u2019 recommendations, overlooked many BPS-20 officers to favour a BPS-19 officer\n\nThere are also some reports that IGP Usman Anwar was unwilling to give him the abovementioned posting. But despite his reluctance, the Punjab government bypassed several BPS-20 officers and many in BPS-19 who were from 34th Common but had at least done the senior management course (SMC), the sources said. Faisal Kamran (BPS-19) has yet to do SMC course and he and his other batchmates serving in Punjab may take five to six years for promotion to the rank of DIG (BPS-20), an official source said. The SMC is mandatory for capacity-building of the potential officers with a view to enhancing their knowledge, skills, attitude and leadership ability to formulate, evaluate, implement and monitor public policies at the strategic level to improve the service delivery. \nKamran\u2019s colleagues from the same 36th common, including Abadat Nisar, Sardar Ghias Gill and Tariq Wilayat, are serving as the DPOs of Toba Tek Singh, Attock and Pakpattan, respectively, which are relatively the low profile districts. Another officer, Syed Khalid Mahmood Hamdani, is serving as the CPO Rawalpindi. \nThe source said many senior colleagues of Kamran from 34th Common have completed the SMC last year and qualified for promotion to the next grade. Of them, Ali Zia is serving as CPO Faisalabad, Hassan Sukhera in Intelligence Bureau, Ammara Athar as CTO Lahore and Sahibzada Bilal Umar as assistant inspector general (AIG) development at the Central Police Office. No one from them was even discussed for the DIG Operations post Lahore. \nThe Punjab government also blatantly bypassed several police officers already serving in BPS-20. The names of two of them had come under discussion for replacement of Ali Nasir Rizvi. \nThe officers, including Gujranwala CPO Ayyaz Saleem, Lahore Organized Crime Unit (OCU) Imran Kishwar, were also in the race. Another BPS-20 officer Sadiq Dogar, serving as Multan CPO a relatively junior position, could also be a choice for the Lahore post. \nThe source has termed the DIG Operations Lahore slot highly sensitive and important, requiring a designated BPS-20 officer as per the Police Order 2002. He says the posting of a junior officer could be overlooked in smaller districts or on non-field assignments but the same can\u2019t be done in Lahore, which reports over 350,000 crimes annually and deals with law and order situations, particularly being a hub of political unrest. \nThe source says the police circles have termed posting of Faisal Kamran a disappointing at a time when CM Maryam Nawaz had announced that she believed in upholding merit. \n"

He criticised the import of wheat despite the huge stocks of the grain produced locally lying in the government\u2019s godowns. \nSimilarly, Pakistan Kissan Board central president Jam Hazoor Baksh said that because of the government\u2019s flawed procurement policy, the wheat growers were now forced to sell their produce to the agents from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan and upper Punjab, who were visiting the grain markets of south Punjab to purchase wheat at cheaper rates.\nIn Ahmedpur East, farmers Mushtaq Ahmed Sahoo and others say that as the government failed to announce open wheat procurement policy, the growers were compelled to sell their stocks at throwaway prices, bearing loss of about Rs600 to Rs700 per maund. Presently, he said the rates of wheat in the open market have fallen to Rs3,100 or Rs3,200 per maund, mocking the government\u2019s support price of Rs3,900. \nPakistan Seraiki Party (PSP) has also criticised the government\u2019s policy and pledged to join the protest on April 29 in Lahore.\n"

I know the facts and I am comfortable,\u201d he told the paper.\n\u201cThe suggestion that it\u2019s systemic is so far from anything I have seen here the whole time.\u201d\nChinese state media downplayed the accusations in domestic reports and said other countries were conspiring against Beijing\u2019s national swim team.\nXinhua news agency published an article on Sunday referring to  \u201csome foreign media reports\u201d without mentioning details of the allegations, with most of the article a paraphrase of WADA\u2019s statement.\n \n \n\nState-owned tabloid Global Times on Monday called the allegations  \u201cslanderous accusations\u201d, suggesting that foreign media reports on the issue were part of Western efforts to block China\u2019s rise as a sporting power.\n\u201cRelevant countries are currently manipulating the issue of doping and smearing China\u2019s swimming program, clearly doing so intentionally,\u201d the Global Times said.\nDiscourse on China\u2019s tightly censored social media echoed state media sentiments, with internet users saying the allegations would not stop the Chinese swim team.\n\u201cWhy are they targeting China\u2019s swimming team? It\u2019s because we\u2019re getting stronger and stronger,\u201d one Weibo user said.\nARD aired a documentary on the subject Sunday, with the Montreal-based WADA issuing a fresh statement afterwards.\n\u201cThe agency still stands firmly by the results of its scientific investigation and legal decision concerning the case,\u201d it said.\nWang said the Chinese government  \u201cconsistently upholds a resolutely zero-tolerance position when it comes to doping\u201d, adding China upholds  \u201cfair competition\u201d in sport.\nChinese swimming has a chequered doping history. Seven Chinese swimmers tested positive for steroids at the 1994 Asian Games in Hiroshima.\nIn 1998, swimmer Yuan Yuan was banned after Australian customs officers discovered a large stash of growth hormone in her bags at the world championships in Perth.\nThree-time Olympic champion Sun is about to finish a second doping ban.

The CJP deplored that the matter was pending for almost 15 years, but the lawyers were not ready to proceed with it.\nThe chief justice summoned Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab and local government secretary.\nMayor Wahab appeared in court and submitted that the case was filed by the defunct CDGK and now the issues of land came within the domain of the KDA.\nThe director general of the KDA, Syed Shujaat Hussain, was also in attendance and he submitted that he was unaware of such matter and requested for a short adjournment.\nAdjourning the case for April 26, the bench directed the KDA chief to engage a counsel and made it clear that no further adjournment would be granted in the cases of public importance.\nDuring the hearing, the CJP also asked some senior lawyers \u2014 Dr Farogh Naseem, Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed, Khalid Jawed and Faisal Siddiqi \u2014 present during the proceedings regarding the time period to file appeals in the apex court against the orders of high courts.\nThey said that a five-member bench of the apex court had passed an order on the subject matter, but the same had a limited scope and suggested that it can be taken up for reconsideration on the administrative side.\nCommercialisation of road\nThe bench also issued notices to the KMC, master plan department, CBC and other respondents in a petition filed in 2020 against the commercialisation of Chaudhry Khaliquzzaman Road and subsequent construction of high-rises.\nThe petitioner\u2019s lawyer submitted that high-rises were being built after the commercialisation of the road which, he claimed, could not be commercialised under the relevant laws.\nReferring to the construction of a 22-storey building apparently built without proper documentation, the CJP remarked that they would not go into it at the moment, but were aware of the unauthorised and illegal activities being carried out in the city. \nA counsel for one of the respondents /builder argued that amalgamation and commercialisation fee in respect of the entire land was paid to the relevant departments.\nBut the lawyer for the petitioners contended that the same was not established. Thereafter, the lawyer for the builder submitted that if permitted he would file the proof of such payment.\nPutting the respondents on notice, the apex court directed them to files comments/replies till April 25. \nPlea against auction of land dismissed\nThe bench also dismissed a review application of a private contractor filed against the auction of a piece of land in Paposh Nagar as the provincial government submitted that it was planning to set up a bus terminal on the subject land.\nThe chief justice remarked that the subject amenity plot belonged to the people of Karachi and the land could only be used for public services.\nHe also said that it was the prerogative of the government to recall the auction, but it was good if the government was utilising such land for public services.\nThe lawyer for the petitioner stated that the petitioner had offered the highest bid and also paid 25 per cent of total amount.\nA law officer of the Sindh transport department stated that the government was planning to build a bus terminal on the subject land. \nPlea of FBR rejected\nThe apex court on Monday also turned down an application filed by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) seeking a review of an earlier order of apex court against the award of a contract to a firm for tracking and monitoring of imported cargo.\nIn 2022, while dismissing an appeal of the FBR against an order of the SHC, the Supreme Court had directed the federal government to initiate an inquiry into identifying officers of the FBR responsible for awarding a contract to the NLC Construction Solutions (Pvt) Ltd for tracking and monitoring of imported cargo in real time in the Afghanistan transit trade.\nThe chief justice expressed resentment against the FBR chairman for filing a review application in order to protect the officers responsible for selecting an unqualified and inexperienced firm to award the contract. \nHe also asked court office to send this order to the ministry of finance and FBR members.\n"

With a fleet of total of 10 new buses, the Pink Bus Service is expected to serve thousands of women on the two busy routes.\nDuring the launching ceremony organised by Sindh transport department at Frere Hall Karachi, chief of the Pakistan Peoples Party women\u2019s division Faryal Talpur called the service a \u201cgift from the Sindh government to women.\u201d\n\u201cThe provision of safe and comfortable travel is a valuable gift from the Sindh government to women. By offering such facilities and empowering women, we can foster development and prosperity in our society,\u201d she said in her address.\n\nTwo new routes of women-only bus service launched\n\nMs Talpur urged the transport minister to introduce \u201cat least\u201d more economical and cheaper fares for the women passengers, if the bus service was unable offer free rides to them.\nOn her appeal, Sindh Transport Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon announced two-month free travel for all women passengers on the new routes of the Pink Bus Service. Karachi Mayor Barrister Murtaza Wahab, his deputy Salman Abdullah Murad and Sindh minister Syed Nasir Hussain Shah also attended the ceremony.\nIn his address, the transport minister said the fresh initiative was part of materialisation of the PPP\u2019s manifesto which promised women empowerment.\n\u201cThese new initiatives are actually the results of guidance of the leadership of the PPP particularly, Ms Talpur,\u201d he said. \u201cThis initiative has garnered widespread appreciation globally, with international media commending the project by the Sindh government. The high-quality standards, affordable fares, and commitment to safety of the pink bus service have been praised worldwide,\u201d he shared.\nHe said that the efforts were underway to train female drivers, conductors and the staff, ensuring efficient and effective service delivery and the Sindh government remained steadfast in its commitment to empower women.\nIn the ceremony, Ms Talpur presented licenses to 4 female drivers of the Pink Bus Service. \nLaunched in February 2023, the Pink Bus Service is now offering services on five routes, with one operating between Model Colony and II Chundrigar Road passing through Star Gate, Nata Khan Bridge, Drigh Road Station, PAF Base Faisal, Laal Kothi, Karsaz, Nursery, FTC, Regent Plaza, JPMC, Cant Station, Metropole, Regal Chowk and Aram Bagh.\nThe second route is run between Powerhouse Chowrangi, North Karachi and Indus Hospital, Korangi passing through Nagan Chowrangi, Shafiq Mor, Gulshan Chowrangi, Johar Mor, COD, Drigh Road, Shah Faisal Colony and Singer Chowrangi, Korangi No 5.\nThe third runs from Numaish Chowrangi to Sea View Beach and then Ibrahim Hyderi, passing through MA Jinnah Road, Zaibunnisa Street, Metropole, Teen Talwar, Do Talwar, Abdullah Shah Ghazi, Dolmen Mall and McDonalds.\n"

            "Text": "KARACHI: Exactly one year after the tragic and untimely demise of African elephant Noor Jehan at the Karachi Zoo, animal lovers, including wildlife conservationists, musicians, artists, filmmakers and animal welfare activists, gathered on the call of Pakistan Animal Welfare Society (PAWS) and the I Am Noor Jehan Movement, at the Indus Valley School of Art and Architecture on Monday. \nSpeaking on the occasion, documentary filmmaker and co-founder of PAWS Mahera Omar said that Noor Jehan was born free in the wild lands of Tanzania. \u201cShe was a baby still nursing from her mother when brutally captured by a Pakistani animal trader in 2009, along with three other baby elephants, after killing their mothers, to be forcibly brought to Karachi for a harsh life in captivity,\u201d she said. \n\u201cWe are gathered here today in her loving memory, and to highlight the plight of the many other wild animals suffering in captivity in Pakistan,\u201d she added. \u201cZoos rob elephants of their most basic needs. Elephants are active for 18 hours and roam up to 30 miles a day in the wild. They live in social herds and form complex lifelong bonds with each other,\u201d she said. \n\u201cFoot problem from cement floors is a leading cause of death for elephants in captivity. Wild animals belong in the wild. They don\u2019t deserve a life in captivity. Several zoos abroad have shut down their elephant exhibits, including San Francisco, Chicago, Toronto and London Zoo. The last three elephants remaining in Pakistan \u2014 Madhubala, Malika and Sonu \u2014 deserve a better life in a species appropriate sanctuary. We must do all that we can to ensure they spend the rest of their lives together free from pain and suffering, and try to right the years of wrongs that have been done to them over the last 15 years in our country.\u201d \n\nSpeakers highlight plight of captive wild animals in country; call for reuniting Madhubala with her sisters in Safari Park\n\nCurrently, Madhubala lives in the Karachi Zoo while her sisters, Malika and Sonu, are at the Safari Park. The elephants had been broken into pairs soon after arriving in Pakistan. \nAnimal activist Jude Allen thanked all who helped Noor Jehan in her final days at the Karachi Zoo including her team of doctors led by Dr Amir Khalil and other international and local doctors including Dr Shalla Hayat and Dr Zulfiqar Otho. \n\u201cWe are here to celebrate the legacy of Noor Jehan. Her spirit lives on though she has transitioned to another world after spending a life in captivity,\u201d he said.  He also thanked PAWS and Four Paws International along with all the other organisations that work for the betterment of animals for lending their support. \nHe said that after Noor Jehan died, Madhubala, the other elephant left behind in her enclosure, was grieving and lonely but the Four Paws team trained him to train Madhubala, which he has been doing since November last year. \u201cWe have now developed a bond of trust. She loves to play. We play football in which she also cheats,\u201d he chuckled. \nBut he also mentioned, on being coaxed by Mahera, something which showed how majestic and intelligent animals are. \n\u201cThey sense everything. Today, on Noor Jehan\u2019s first death anniversary, I noticed Madhubala after training to go to the area in her cage where Noor Jehan is buried and circle it,\u201d he shared, making everyone very sad for the late elephant and her captive friend who still misses her. \n\u201cAs an animal lover, I had the worst experience treating Noor Jehan in her final days,\u201d said Dr Zulfiqar Otho, one of the veterinarians who were treating Noor Jehan. \u201cThere was so much mismanagement and she died young. I could see the will to live in her eyes but no energy in her body,\u201d he said. \nAlso present were Salman Ali and Azhar Khan who had helped lift Noor Jehan so that she could stand. \u201cIt was not like taking care of a sick dog or cat, who you can pick up and carry. This was lifting four to six tonnes,\u201d Salman reminded. \nEveryone was in agreement that Madhubala should be shifted from the zoo and be reunited with her sisters at the Safari Park. The grieving Madhubala has not seen her sisters in 14 years. \nFinally, Fizza Anvarali sang a sweet song she had written in memory of Noor Jehan, wishing freedom for all birds and creatures.\n"

            "Text": "KARACHI: The Arts Council of Pakistan held an Eid Milan event on Sunday evening for its members at which the renowned qawwal group Farid Ayaz and Abu Muhammad performed. \nIt is a fact that the qawwal gharana is inarguably the most prominent in comparison to their contemporaries having an international fan-base. Justifiably so. The reason for it is that they have mastered their craft and perform with a great deal of understanding of the kalaam. Their performance on Sunday was no different. In fact, it was better than the last time they took the stage at the council.\nHowever, Farid Ayaz has developed this habit of constantly preaching the audience. There is nothing wrong with that. He is a senior, experienced artist. The problem that sometimes arises is because of an air of condescension with which he does that. During the performance, for example, he said to his fellow musicians that \u2018present something that the audience could understand\u2019. When you are performing in front of hundreds of people, talking to them sternly for not paying attention\u2026 it doesn\u2019t create a cordial atmosphere. That being said, the audience didn\u2019t seem to mind it and enjoyed the qawwali.\nThe group began the show with Qasida Burda Sharif. It was masterfully and soulfully done. Then they shifted their attention to warming up the attendees by presenting the famous Mera Piya Ghar Aaya. As always, the group intersperse the main bit with Urdu and Punjabi verses that added a rhythmic charm to the tune. To boot, the fellow younger performers (members of their family) who flank the two main senior artists did extremely well by singing extra bits. Their control and voice projection was worth praising.\nThen came Dum Hama Dum Ali Ali. It was another soul-stirring piece which got the audience to hum along. And it didn\u2019t take the qawwals much time to move from that composition to the very well-known and loved Chhap Tilak Sab Chheen Li. This is the kind of kalaam that a lot of people know by heart which is why they invariably find themselves singing with the vocalists. The brothers also performed, among other pieces, verses of Allama Iqbal\u2019s poetry.\nAll in all, it was a good concert.\n"

            "Text": "THATTA: The Sujawal police on late Sunday evening stormed their way into the office of \u2018The Shia Imami Ismaili Council\u2019 in Var town by breaking open the main gate and ransacking the CCTV camera network and smashing windows apparently to vent their anger over some unknown and unrevealed happening that may have infuriated them.  \nA large number of enraged community members living in the neighbourhood strongly reacted to, what they believed, \u2018uncalled for and unwarranted\u2019 police action. They came out of their homes and held a noisy demonstration raising slogans against the local police, who failed to come out with any plausible explanation for their action. Leaders of the community approached the Ghorabari DSP and Sujawal SSP to ascertain the reason for the \u201chighly provocative act on the part of the police team, led by Sujawal SHO Sajjad Jamali\u201d.\nVehicular traffic between Var town and Thatta city remained suspended during the course of the protest that continued for about two hours. \nCouncil\u2019s claim\nA member of the council\u2019s staff who was present in the office when the raid was conducted, claimed that members of the police team in an aggressive manner broke open the main gate, smashed windows, barged into the office and dismantled the CCTV network without informing him of a reason for the action. The raiding team also advanced towards the adjacent Ismaili community hall (Jamaat Khana) but could not enter into it seemingly fearing a violent reaction from a large number of enraged community members who had already gathered there and were resisting the police action.\nIn an attempt to escape the protesters\u2019 rage, the Sujawal SHO and two of the accompanying police officers kept warning them against \u201cinterfering in the discharge of their official duty\u201d.\nAfter the episode, the SHO and other officers tried to calm down the community members claiming that they had received information that a \u2018gutka factory\u2019 was functioning on the premises of the office and the raid was aimed at unearthing the same. \nHowever, the protesters disbelieved their contention arguing that why was the building pelted with stones by members of the police party during the action.\nPolice on the back foot \nWhen the raiding team withdrew from the council building to return to the police station, the angry protesters followed them and some of them went into the office of the SHO to lodge a complaint. \nHowever, SHO Jamali appeared regretful and started trying to convince them that all this happened owing to the \u201cwrong information\u201d.\n\u201cWe did not know the raiding site belonged to the Ismaili community; we never intended to hurt sentiments of the community; the wrong information we had received actually made us to conduct the raid,\u201d the SHO was quoted as telling the protesters.\nIn the meantime, the Ghorabari DSP also arrived to regret over the raid. He maintained that he was absolutely unaware of the police action before it was taken. He said no advance information was sent to his office nor was such a permission sought.\nThatta SSP Imran Khan, when contacted by Dr Nazir Jummani, President of the Ismaili Council for Thatta and Shah Bundar, also denied having ordered any such raid.\nProbe promised\nA delegation of the Iocal Ismaili community led by Qaim Karwani approached Sujawal SSP Dr Khaliq Pirzada and narrated the whole episode to him. The SSP assured the delegation that a departmental inquiry against the police officers and personnel involved in the matter would be ordered.\nAccording to some protesters living close to the council office and Jamaat Khana, the raiding party comprised DSP Safar Dawach, Sujawal SHO Sajjad Jamali, Jati SHO Parhiyal Panh\u00adwar, Chuhar Jamali SHO Qurban Qambrani and teams of their respective subordinate personnel.\nFinally Ghorabari DSP Izhar Hussain held negotiations with representatives of the protesting community members and assured them of appropriate action against any officer or personnel found guilty of excesses. On his assurance, the protesters dispersed peacefully.\n"

The USAID\u2019s collaboration and assistance including will not only strengthen vital infrastructure but also enhance resilience of communities against natural disasters,\u201d he said.\nMr Tribble appreciated Hesco\u2019s efforts for maintaining supply of electricity immediately after floods despite on the ground challenges. \u201cUS government\u2019s assistance to Hesco is just one facet of our broader support to Pakistan\u2019s energy sector. Our energy partnership is now more critical than ever as we work together to mitigate effects of climate change - our greatest long term global challenge,\u201d he said. \nOver the past decade, USAID had been instrumental in introducing innovative technologies and providing extensive training to government officials across Pakistan and this comprehensive support not only enhanced the reliability of electricity access but also supported economic growth, said the press release.\nMr Tribble later visited the US Centre of for Advanced Studies in Water in Mehran University of Engineering and Technology, Jamshoro, where he met Vice Chancellor Prof Tauha Hussain Ali and said that water issue in Pakistan and Sindh demanded attention.\n"

            "Text": "JERUSALEM: The head of Israeli military intelligence has resigned after accepting responsibility for the failures that allowed the devastating Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct 7, the military said on Monday.\nMajor General Aharon Haliva, a 38-year veteran of the military, was one of a number of senior Israeli commanders who said they had failed to foresee and prevent the deadliest attack in Israel\u2019s history.\n\u201cThe intelligence division under my command did not live up to the task we were entrusted with. I have carried that black day with me ever since,\u201d he said in a resignation letter released by the military.\nHe will remain in post until a successor is named. Israeli media and commentators expect further resignations once the main military campaign in Gaza wraps up.\n\nUS hints at sanctioning Israeli military unit over abuses in West Bank\n\nThe Oct 7 attack badly tarnished the reputation of the Israeli military and intelligence services, previously seen as virtually unbeatable by armed Palestinian groups like Hamas.\nIn the early hours of the morning, following an intense rocket barrage, thousands of fighters from Hamas and other groups broke through security barriers around Gaza, surprising Israeli forces and rampaging through communities in southern Israel.\nSome 1,200 Israelis and foreigners were killed in the attack, most of them civilians, and around 250 were taken into captivity in Gaza, where 133 remain as hostages, according to Israeli tallies.\nThe head of the armed forces, Lieutenant-General Herzi Halevi, and the head of the domestic intelligence agency Shin Bet, Ronen Bar, both accepted responsibility in the aftermath of the attack but have stayed on while the war in Gaza has continued.\nBy contrast, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has so far not accepted responsibility for the Oct 7 attack, although surveys indicate that most Israelis blame him for failing to do enough to prevent or defend against it.\nIn response to the attack, Israel launched an offensive against Gaza that has so far killed more than 34,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, and left the densely populated enclave in ruins.\nUS sanctions\nThe United States appears close to sanctioning an Israeli military unit over alleged human rights violations in the West Bank, a move the Israeli prime minister angrily denounced as \u201cthe height of absurdity\u201d.\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken hinted at such steps when asked by a reporter in Italy about reports that his department had recommended cuts in military aid to an Israeli unit involved in violent incidents in the West Bank.\nBlinken, without providing details, said his department was conducting investigations under a law that prohibits sending military aid to foreign security units that violate human rights with impunity.\nHe then added: \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that you\u2019ll see results very soon. I\u2019ve made determinations; you can expect to see them in the days ahead.\u201d\nIn late 2022, the State Department directed embassy staff in Israel to investigate alleged abuses in the West Bank by the army\u2019s ultra-Orthodox Netzach Yehuda battalion.\nThat included a January 2022 incident when a 78-year-old Palestinian American died of a heart attack after being detained.\nAlthough the allegations precede the Hamas attacks and Israel\u2019s retaliatory war in Gaza, the suggestion of any sanctions against Israeli forces drew an angry response from PM Netanyahu.\n\u201cIn recent weeks, I have been working against the imposition of sanctions on Israeli citizens, including in my conversations with senior American government officials,\u201d he posted late on Saturday on social media platform X.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAt a time when our soldiers are fighting the monsters of terror, the intention to impose a sanction on a unit in the IDF is the height of absurdity and a moral low. The government headed by me will act by all means against these moves.\u201d\nIsraeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant similarly slammed the possibility of sanctions, after discussing the issue with army chief Herzi Halevi.\nHe urged Washington \u201cto withdraw its intention to impose sanctions\u201d on the battalion.\nThe Axios website, citing three US sources with knowledge of the matter, reported Saturday that Blinken was expected to announce sanctions against the battalion \u201cwithin days.\u201d\n"

            "Text": "BERLIN: Germany and Britain on Monday both swooped on suspected spies accused of passing on secret information to China, as concern deepens in the West over aggressive Chinese espionage.\nIn Germany, investigators arrested three German nationals in the west of the country suspected of sharing information on maritime technology, prosecutors said in a statement.\nThe trio, named as Herwig F., Ina F. and Thomas R., are accused of taking part in an information-gathering project funded by Chinese state agencies, as well as illegally exporting a laser to China.\nIn Britain, two men were charged with handing over  \u201carticles, notes, documents or information\u201d to China between 2021 and last year. Police named the men as Christopher Berry, 32, and Christoper Cash, 29, who previously worked at the UK parliament as a researcher.\n\nBeijing rejects espionage accusations\n\nThe German arrests and British charges come amid repeated Western warnings of Chinese intelligence services targeting advanced technologies. German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser warned of the  \u201cconsiderable danger posed by Chinese espionage in business, industry and science\u201d.\n\u201cThe area affected in the current case \u2014 innovative technologies from Germany that can be used for military purposes \u2014 is particularly sensitive,\u201d Faeser said.\nDefaming China\nChina  firmly rejects accusations that it carried out spying activities in  Germany, its embassy in Berlin said on Monday, after three Germans were  arrested on suspicion of working with the Chinese secret service.\n\u201cWe  call on Germany to desist from exploiting the espionage accusation to  politically manipulate the image of China and defame China,\u201d a  spokesperson for the embassy said in an emailed statement.\nThe  arrests came a week after Chancellor Olaf Scholz travelled to China to  press Beijing on its support for Russia\u2019s wartime economy and to raise  issues of intellectual property theft and fair market access.Germany\u2019s first national security strategy, unveiled last year, was noticeably tough on China and accused Beijing of repeatedly acting against Berlin\u2019s interests.\n\u2018Extensive business\u2019\nIn its 2023 annual report, the German military\u2019s counter-intelligence service (MAD) also warned against potential espionage as China seeks to become a technological world leader by 2049. In particular, it mentioned joint projects with the German armed forces as a major risk.\nGerman domestic intelligence chief Thomas Haldenwang said the security authorities were  \u201cvery vigilant\u201d on the issue of Chinese espionage. Although he did not want to call the latest case the  \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d, Haldenwang said it was  \u201ccertainly part of a very extensive business\u201d.\nOne of the suspects in the German case, Thomas R., is accused of working as an agent for an employee of the Chinese ministry of state security (MSS). \nHe is said to have established contact with Herwig F. and his wife Ina F., who ran a company in Duesseldorf with expertise in technologies that could be used for military purposes.\n"

The new target set by the two leaders looks highly ambitious given that the trade between the two countries last year stood at about $2.3 billion despite a significant boost in trade after the two countries signed MoUs for facilitating bilateral trade in Jan 2023.\nLater in August, the two sides chalked out a five-year trade plan for realising the 2021 goal of increasing trade to $5 billion.\nSince 2005, the two countries have been operating under a preferential trade agreement and have been negotiating a free trade agreement, which many anticipated would be concluded during the Iranian president\u2019s visit.\nSeveral factors have impeded trade growth between Iran and Pakistan, including international sanctions on Iran, security issues in border regions, and inadequate border infrastructure as well as economic misalignment.\nMoreover, banking and payment issues due to the lack of direct banking channels and the necessity to comply with international financial regulations hinder smooth economic interactions.\nFluctuating political and diplomatic relations influenced by external geopolitical pressures also affect the execution of bilateral trade agreements. The two sides, which share nearly 900km of border, are specifically eyeing the development of border markets to increase trade.\nBorder trade\n\n\nIranian President Dr Seyyed Ebrahim Raisi speaks to President Asif Ali Zardari during a meeting at Aiwan-i-Sadr. \u2014APP / White Star\n\n \nIn his media remarks, Mr Raisi highlighted the long border between the two neighbouring countries as a significant opportunity for enhancing bilateral relations. He acknowledged that some measures have already been taken to facilitate border trade, but described these efforts as \u201cinsufficient\u201d.\nEmphasising the need for further action, he advocated for additional steps to \u201cactivate trade and business in border areas\u201d. President Raisi expressed that increasing commercial activity along the border would not only improve security but also boost the welfare of the communities residing in these regions.\nPakistan and Iran had in May last year inaugurated the Mand-Pishin market, one of the planned six border markets that are to be jointly constructed by the two countries.\nSeparately, in a meeting bet\u00adween Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and his Iranian counterpart Dr Ahmad Vahidi, both agreed on a joint plan of action to deal with the menace of terrorism by further improving mutual support and exchange of intelligence information. Both sides also resolved to sign a security agreement in this regard.\nIt was also decided to provide all possible facilities to the Pakistani pilgrims on the occasion of Arba\u2019een. The Iranian interior minister extended an invitation to his Pakistani counterpart to visit Iran in that regard where the Iraqi counterpart would also be invited.\nPak-Iran gas pipeline\nIt was widely expected that the leaders of both countries would in their meetings discuss the fate of the stalled Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline especially after Islamabad earlier this year decided to construct an 80km line within its territory to pre-empt Tehran from initiating arbitration in international courts that could potentially lead to a penalty of $18 billion.\n\u201cProbably, you can find some individuals who do not favour expansion and promotion of good bilateral relations between Iran and Pakistan but who cares? It is not important,\u201d Mr Raisi said referring to the critics of Pak-Iran ties.\nA PMO statement also mentioned a commitment by both leaders to expanding cooperation in the energy sector, but did not specify any project.\nSecurity along Pak-Iran border\n\n\nThe Iranian leader inspects a guard of honour on his arrival at the PM House, on Monday.\u2014APP / White Star\n\n \nBorder security also remains a significant area of contention between the two countries. This region has become a breeding ground for drug trafficking, smuggling, and the movement of militant groups.\nTensions escalated in January when Iran struck suspected militant hideouts inside Pakis\u00adtan. In response, Pakistan targeted sanctuaries of suspected Baloch separatists in Iran, leading to a temporary downgrade of diplomatic ties. However, both countries quickly acted to mend the rift.\nMr Raisi cursorily touched on the issue noting the commonality of views on fighting terrori\u00ad\u00adsm, organised crime, narco-trafficking and other manifestations of instability. According to the PMO statement, PM Shehbaz and President Raisi agreed to \u201cdevelop joint approaches to confront common challenges including the threat of terrorism.\u201d\nMeeting with army chief\nIn another meeting President Raisi discussed regional stability and border security with Chief of Army Staff Gen Asim Munir.\nAccording to an ISPR statement, both sides concurred on the necessity to bolster bilateral cooperation while jointly striving for regional stability and economic prosperity.\nGen Munir emphasised the need to improve coordination along the border to prevent terrorists from jeopardising the longstanding relations between the two neighboring countries, ISPR said.\nGaza crisis\nBoth PM Shehbaz and President Raisi in their comments expressed strong and unequivocal condemnation of the ongoing genocide in Gaza by Israel and reiterated the call for international efforts to an immediate and unconditional ceasefire.\nThough PM Shehbaz reminded Mr Raisi of Iran\u2019s support for the Kashmir cause, the Iranian leader avoided mentioning that in his comments.\nSeparately, Foreign Minis\u00adter Ishaq Dar called on Mr Raisi after his arrival at the Nur Khan Airbase. He also met President Asif Zardari. President Raisi will also travel to Lahore and Karachi.\nEight MoUs signed\nPakistan and Iran signed eight MoUs aimed at enhancing bilateral cooperation across a broad spectrum of areas.\nThese agreements, signed in the presence of PM Shehbaz and President Raisi, included a security cooperation agreement to bolster mutual security measures and an agreement on judicial assistance focusing on civil matters to enhance legal collaboration.\nAdditionally, an agreement to promote film exchange and cooperation in the audio-visual sectors was established, marking a significant step towards cultural exchange.\n"

He also submitted a booklet about the security protocol for cipher and apprised the court that the booklet was issued for \u2018official use only\u2019.\nEarlier on Jan 18, only weeks before the Feb 8 general elections, former principal secretary Azam Khan testified before the special court that the cipher never returned to his office.\nThe former bureaucurat claimed he had intimated the then prime minister, his military secretary as well as the relevant staff numerous times.\nFour days later, former foreign secretary Sohail Mehmood appeared before the trial court, claiming that the copy sent to ex-PM Khan was never returned while Mr Qureshi said he returned the copy to the ministry and the ex-secretary replied in the affirmative.\nOn the other hand, Mr Khan had claimed that the cipher was still with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and he had received only a rephrased version of the diplomatic cable.\nHowever, the FIA special prosecutor told the IHC bench on Monday that the original copy of cipher remained in the custody of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the transcript was sent to the designated offices, adding that those copies were destroyed upon return.\nThe court adjourned further hearing till Tuesday (today).\n"

In its April 3 order, the SC called for proposals from the main stakeholders in the judicial system and the independence of judiciary, namely the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC), Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), high courts and the federal government.\n\nProposals to be submitted to apex court may be finalised by 25th\n\n\u201cThey should suggest what should be the institutional response and mechanism to address the issues like the ones raised in the letter [of IHC judges] and ensure that such issues do not arise in future and, if they do, to fix liability and proceed against those responsible,\u201d the order stated. In any such process, it added, the idea was to empower the high courts and their chief justices to deal with issues relating to the judges.\nSince the apex court had sought the proposal by April 25, sources said the IHC registrar office circulated the apex court order among the judges and sought their final proposal by the deadline. The IHC administration will then file a consolidated report to the SC.\nInitially, a seven-member larger SC bench had conducted a hearing on the suo motu proceedings.\nJustice Yahya Afridi, however, recused himself from hearing this case, stating: \u201cThis may affect the functioning of the worthy chief justice and judges in their discharge of judicial functions, and would to my mind amount to interference in the independence of high courts.\u201d\n\u201cTo proceed on the proposed action of suo motu would negate the lessons moved into action by public sentiments no matter how pressing the issue may appear,\u201d Justice Afridi emphasised, adding that one must also not ignore that the high courts under the Constitution were independent establishments envisaged to regulate not only their administrative functions, but also provide security to and safeguard the judicial officers in the discharge of their judicial functions.\u201c\nIn their letter, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Justice Babar Sattar, Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, Justice Arbab Mohammad Tahir and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz had hinted at the alleged involvement of ISI in judicial matters.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: In a surprise display of conciliation in the National Assembly, opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) on Monday offered \u201ccooperation and constructive engagement\u201d in the parliamentary proceedings, as the government made a significant goodwill gesture by withdrawing suspension of the two PTI lawmakers whose entry had been banned by the speaker due to their rowdy behaviour during the joint sitting of parliament last week.\nThe motion seeking the withdrawal of the suspension order against PTI MNAs Jamshed Dasti and Moham\u00admad Iqbal Khan was moved by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar and it was readily app\u00adroved by the assembly through a voice vote after reconciliatory speeches by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.\nSpeaker Ayaz Sadiq had suspended the membership of the two lawmakers for the remainder of the current session for \u201ceroding the sanctity\u201d of the assembly by \u201cindulging in rowdy behaviour\u201d during President Asif Zardari\u2019s address to the joint sitting of parliament on April 18.\nThe speaker had given his ruling after seeking the house approval on a motion through a voice vote and he repeated the same action on Monday for withdrawal of his previous order.\n\nGovt moves motion to restore PTI MNAs\u2019 membership; opposition agrees to join house business advisory committee\n\nThis unexpected thaw in relations sparked some optimism among lawmakers, paving the way for a more harmonious and productive parliamentary session. However, the speech of fiery PTI MNA from Karak Shahid Khattak indicated that this cooperation might not last long or perhaps was part of a strategic move ahead of the formation of the standing committees.\nShortly before the adjournment of the sitting till Tuesday evening, Mr Khattak while speaking on a point of order categorically announced they would not let this house run till the release of their founding chairman Imran Khan from the jail.\n\u201cWe are being given Bhaashan (lectures) that we want to run this house. If Imran Khan is not released, we will not let this house run,\u201d declared MNA Khattak. He said if it was a sin to call \u201cmandate thieves and vote thieves\u201d to those who had come to the power through rigging, then he would continue to repeat it.\nPPP lawmaker Shazia Marri, who took the floor after his speech, said it seemed there were some lawmakers who did not want this assembly to discuss the issues being faced by the people. She termed it inappropriate to link parliament\u2019s functioning with someone\u2019s release. She also castigated the opposition members for their noisy protest during the oath-taking of Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, reminding the house that some members had attempted to \u201csabotage the constitutional process\u201d of oath-taking.\nAt the outset, leader of the opposition Omar Ayub Khan requested the speaker to review decision of suspending the two PTI lawmakers as per his commitment during a meeting with the opposition members\u2019 delegation in his chamber.\nThe PTI leader then raised the issue of alleged rigging in by-polls, held on April 21.\nPTI\u2019s chief whip Aamir Dogar said that recording their protest in parliament was their democratic right and they would continue to do so. He recalled that in the previous assembly, the opposition members also brought whistles and trumpets during the protests, but the then speaker Asad Qaiser showed patience and did not take any action against them.\nMr Dogar asked the speaker to withdraw the suspension orders of both legislators, stating that the opposition members were ready to become a part of the house business advisory committee to discuss the ways and means to improve the atmosphere in the assembly. He expressed the hope that the speaker would take steps to take the members from both sides on board in order to improve the environment.\nThe chief whip of the opposition party also welcomed the visiting Iranian president and lauded Iran for giving a \u201cbefitting response\u201d to Israel that, he said, was \u201cthe biggest terrorist\u201d in the world.\nSpeaker Ayaz Sadiq expla\u00adined that when he received an invitation from the Iranian president for a meeting, he told them that he would come with a parliamentary delegation representing all the parties. He expressed his pleasure that both the government and the opposition members gave a \u2018positive message\u2019 to the Iranian president that despite having differences within themselves, they were united for the cause of Pakistan and to give honour to the guests.\nPPP\u2019s Naveed Qamar and Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar of the PML-N welcomed the opposition\u2019s offer for cooperation and endorsed its demand that the disciplinary action taken against the two PTI MNAs should be withdrawn.\nJUI-F lawmaker\nEarlier, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (Fazl) lawmaker Aliya Kamran while speaking on a point of order asked the speaker to expel MNA Sadaf Ihsan from the house after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision of suspending the Peshawar High Court\u2019s verdict in her favour. She said the JUI-F had actually given ticket to another woman with the same name, but she could not submit her nomination papers.\nShe alleged that taking advantage of the situation, Ms Ihsan \u201cfraudulently\u201d managed to seek the NA seat on the JUI-F reserved seat.\nThe JUI-F member, sitting on the opposition benches, asked the speaker to declare her \u201calien\u201d and order her expulsion from the house.\nHowever, Ms Ihsan, who was sitting on the treasury benches, claimed she had been awarded the ticket by Maulana Fazlur Rehman himself. She said she had come to the assembly for the cause of Pakistan and her constituency, Lakki Marwat.\n"

He believes in resolution of issues through dialogue,\u201d he said.\nMr Gandapur said law-enforcement agencies in KP, especially police, were targetted by militants in Dera Ismail Khan, Mardan, and Swabi.\nHe said had the police not checked the advances of militants in KP, the latter would have reached Dera Ghazi Khan, Bhakkar, Islamabad, and Rawalpindi.\n"

The closed down branches include Drassun in Upper Chitral, which was established as early as in 1964, and Koghuzi and Ashrait in Lower Chitral.\nThe residents of the three villages have demanded of the prime minister to take notice of the closure of post offices, which they said played a pivotal role in their lives. They said the postmaster general of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa should be asked as to why he had taken such a \u2018punitive\u2019 decision.\nDuring a protest meeting held in Drassun area on Monday, the speakers, including village chairman Abdur Rafi and elders Hamid Jalal, Mubarak Shah and others said closure of the facility would create multiple issues for the residents as Pakistan Post was the only available agency here to send and receive letters and other consignments.\nThey said that thousands of students registered with different universities under the distant learning system would have to discontinue their studies. They said call letters from various public and private sector organisations were always delivered by the Pakistan Post.\nThe residents said that the British rulers had established a post office in Mastuj town of Upper Chitral in 1896 after annexing Chitral an year earlier due to the significance of the facility and in doing so, they did not consider its profitability as it linked the people with the government.\nThey alleged that the high-ups of Pakistan Post had taken the arbitrary step of closing down the post offices to conceal their wrongdoings in the recruitment process last year when people from Dir, Swat and Buner districts were appointed to the posts of mail runner and postman.\nThe residents said the post offices were being closed down in Chitral so the non-local employees could be posted to their home districts.\n"

On the pointation of the accused Sadiq, a laborer, the body was recovered from Tarnol and shifted to the District Headquarters Hospital for postmortem. The relatives of the deceased identified the body, police said.\nThe SSP Operations said that the deceased left his house to visit his friend, one ofd the suspects, on the morning of second day of Eidul Fitr but did not return.\nHe said that preliminary investigation revealed that Rehmatullah died the same day. However, the real cause of his death was yet to be established because the suspects had been claiming that he died of cardiac arrest and was buried in a graveyard near Tarnol. Later, the kidnappers went to Chiniot and made a phone call to the family of Rehmatullah and demanded Rs10 million ransom.\n\u201cSince the kidnappers knew that Rehmatullah had enough money, they detained him and later demanded Rs10 million from his family,\u201d SSP Kamran said.\nHe said the arrest of the main accused Sadiq came about after the police took the CCTV footage from an ATM booth which led to his arrest. Otherwise, the police teams had been searching for the kidnappers in Chiniot in the wake of a threat call they had made from there to mislead the police.\nInitially, he said, Sadiq was detained who revealed that Waheed Gul, Abdullah and Mohammad Bahadur were also accompanying him. Later, they were arrested by the police, he said.\nYes, the DNA test on the body will also be conducted, the accused were friends of the deceased and one of the accused was the owner of the room, the deceased had been using.\nMohammad Shafiq, a resident of Dhoke Syedan Kamalabad, brother-in-law of the victim lodged an FIR with the R.A. Bazaar police two days after his brother-in-law Rehmatullah went missing.\nHe said in the FIR that Rehmatullah left his house on Friday at 11:30am saying that he was going to visit his friends and he would be back in the evening. But he did not return and neither had he responded to calls made on his mobile phone repeatedly.\n"

The war that lasted decades not only destroyed its big hospitals but also forced medics to go abroad for employment. Now, the [Afghan] people are banking on Pakistani hospitals for specialised healthcare,\u201d a doctor told Dawn.\nHe said the majority of Afghans visited the SKMCH&RC for chemotherapy and other services that weren\u2019t available in their own country.\nVisa curbs have badly hit private hospitals as well, many of which have established special desks to cater for Afghans coming over with Persian-speaking attendants, according to doctors.\n\u201cThis is bad for both Afghan patients and hospitals. Authorities should allow patients entry to Pakistan after checking hospital documents,\u201d a senior surgeon at a private medical centre told Dawn.\nHe said lower patient arrivals had financial implications for the hospitals.\nThe surgeon said while strengthening security checks, the government should allow the Afghans badly in need of treatment.\nAnother private hospital\u2019s administrator told Dawn that visa restrictions for Afghan nationals were a loss to the national economy.\n\u201cNot only are new curbs massive suffering for Afghan patients, but they\u2019re a lost opportunity for our economy,\u201d he said.\nThe administrator said children suffering from minor health issues developed complications due to delayed diagnosis and treatment.\nHe said Afghan nationals used to cross the border for medical examination and treatment in hospitals without hindrance, but the imposition of visa restrictions had caused serious issues for them.\nThe doctors said Afghan patients were screened in Jalalabad before departure for the border crossing, where they were checked by medics of the Pak-Afghan Dosti Hospital.\nThey said those patients were examined by X-ray and ECG machines and underwent lab testing and security checking before being sent to Pakistani hospitals.\nThe doctors said Peshawar hospitals received Afghans with heart, liver, kidney, stroke, orthopedics, diabetes, and eye, psychological, gynecological, and acute emergency issues.\n"

On the pointation of the accused Sadiq, a laborer, the body was recovered from Tarnol and shifted to the District Headquarters Hospital for postmortem. The relatives of the deceased identified the body, police said.\nThe SSP Operations said that the deceased left his house to visit his friend, one ofd the suspects, on the morning of second day of Eidul Fitr but did not return.\n\nBody recovered from graveyard in Tarnol\n\nHe said that preliminary investigation revealed that Rehmatullah died the same day. However, the real cause of his death was yet to be established because the suspects had been claiming that he died of cardiac arrest and was buried in a graveyard near Tarnol. Later, the kidnappers went to Chiniot and made a phone call to the family of Rehmatullah and demanded Rs10 million ransom.\n\u201cSince the kidnappers knew that Rehmatullah had enough money, they detained him and later demanded Rs10 million from his family,\u201d SSP Kamran said.\nHe said the arrest of the main accused Sadiq came about after the police took the CCTV footage from an ATM booth which led to his arrest. Otherwise, the police teams had been searching for the kidnappers in Chiniot in the wake of a threat call they had made from there to mislead the police.\nInitially, he said, Sadiq was detained who revealed that Waheed Gul, Abdullah and Mohammad Bahadur were also accompanying him. Later, they were arrested by the police, he said.\nYes, the DNA test on the body will also be conducted, the accused were friends of the deceased and one of the accused was the owner of the room, the deceased had been using.\nMohammad Shafiq, a resident of Dhoke Syedan Kamalabad, brother-in-law of the victim lodged an FIR with the R.A. Bazaar police two days after his brother-in-law Rehmatullah went missing.\nHe said in the FIR that Rehmatullah left his house on Friday at 11:30am saying that he was going to visit his friends and he would be back in the evening. But he did not return and neither had he responded to calls made on his mobile phone repeatedly.\nHe further said that Rehmat\u2019s mobile phone was switched off due to which his family got worried. After failing to find his clue, his family sought police help and lodged an FIR with the R.A Bazaar police.\nAccording to sources, the family of the victim had reportedly received threatening calls as the kidnappers have been demanding Rs10 million ransom for the release of Rehmatullah.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: A six-member committee formed to probe the blaze at a petrol pump in Blue Area has revealed that the oil tanker caught fire due to an \u201celectric spark\u201d from a water cooler installed on the premises, officials told Dawn.\nThe incident occurred at a PSO site near Beverly Centre, Blue Area, on April 19 during the decanting of petrol from the oil tanker. Initially, the petrol pump\u2019s staff succeeded in handling the fire, and the oil tanker driver efficiently drove the fire-hit vehicle away from the premises.\nSubsequently, the district rescue teams arrived at the location to extinguish the fire and the petrol pump was sealed until clearance from relevant authorities to initiate operations.\nSubsequently, District Magistrate Irfan Nawaz Memon ordered an inquiry to determine the cause of the fire and whether or not the SOP for unloading the supply from the tanker to the pump was followed. In this regard, a six-member committee was constituted to probe the matter comprising officials of the capital administration, the Capital Development Authority, and the police along with an employee of the PSO.\n\nInquiry reveals fire \u2018probably\u2019 spread on wider span due to spill-over from oil tanker\n\nThe inquiry report said at the preliminary stage of inquiry, the petrol pump\u2019s CCTV footage was examined and it was found that the vehicle was offloading petrol into the petrol pump\u2019s oil tank when an electric spark occurred at a water cooler adjacent to it. As the fire broke out, the nozzles of the oil tanker also caught fire.\nThe inquiry also found a live electricity connection adjacent to the underground petrol tanks (the unloading area). As it is against the SOPs regarding unloading petrol at petrol pumps, the petrol pump\u2019s management tried to conceal the presence of live electric wire at the said location.\nThis committee was also verbally informed that a complete audit of this site was recently conducted by the PSO inspection team from Islamabad. However, the availability of the electric current near the petrol unloading site was ignored.\nA perusal of the CCTV footage also showed that the probable cause of the spreading of fire on a wider span was the spillover of petrol from the oil tanker. \u201cHowever, this possibility needs further probe,\u201d it added.\n\u201cUnfortunately, there is no back-up electricity connection for the CCTV cameras, and as soon as the main electric switch of the petrol pump was turned off, there was a complete blackout as far as the further footage is concerned.\u201d\nIt is pertinent to mention that the petrol pump is located right next to Beverly Centre, which houses a large number of offices, shops and restaurants. It is frequented by thousands of citizens, in addition to employees of businesses during the day.\nOn the day of the incident, had the fire not been controlled in time through the swift action by the rescue teams, there could have been a \u201cmore severe eventuality\u201d for not just the petrol pump, but also the Beverly Centre.\n\u201cIt is therefore recommended that a complete audit in all respects (technical, fire etc.) be carried out of the PSO petrol pump in question, and generally of all PSO petrol pumps in Islamabad to avoid a similar incident in future,\u201d the report said. \u201cOnce the PSO petrol pump in question fulfils the SOPs set out by PSO (as OMC) after completion of the audit, it may be de-sealed under intimation of the city assistant commissioner.\u201d\n"

First Lady Aseefa Bhutto Zardari and Zamurad Khan are also present. \u2014 White Star & INP\n\n \nISLAMABAD: Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday jointly inaugurated the newly-constructed portion of 11th Avenue after renaming it as Iran Avenue.\nIslamabad already has several roads named after foreign dignitaries. These include Faisal Avenue after former Saudi king Shah Faisal, Attaturk Avenue after Turkish hero Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. Roads were also named after Chinese leader Zhou Enlai and former Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser while there is also Japan Road.\nEarlier on Sunday, the federal government renamed 11the Avenue as Iran Avenue. This road has two portions \u2013 one from D-12 to E-11 which has been constructed and the remaining seven km from E-11 to Karnal Sher Khan Avenue (formerly I.J. Principal Road) is yet to be constructed. But the entire road has been named as Iran Avenue. President Raisi and Mr Sharif at a function held at the PM Office opened the plaque of Iran Avenue.\nSources said the federal government had directed the Capital Development Authority (CDA) to start work on the remaining portion of the road as soon as possible. The engineering wing on Monday decided to take up the matter with the CDA board in its meeting to be held on Tuesday (today) for its approval to hire a consultant.\n\nCDA directed to start work on incomplete portion of road; Iranian president\u2019s wife visits Numl, awarded honorary PhD degree\n\nThe consultant will prepare the design of the road and then the civic agency will go for floating tenders. The portion 5.5km portion of the road, which was inaugurated on Monday, is linked with Margalla Road near D-12 and E-11 and the interchange of E-11 is also part of the project. \nAs per its alignment, 11th Avenue starts from Karnal Sher Khan Avenue and culminates at its linking point of Margalla Road.\nWork on the 5.5km road worth around Rs4 billion, including an interchange, was started in December 2022 and expected to complete by January 31 this year. However, its completion saw some delay and has been completed now. \nIranian president\u2019s wife visits Numl\nDr Jamileh-Sadat Alamolhoda, wife of the Iranian president, visited National University of Modern Languages (Numl).\nNuml Rector retired Maj Gen Shahid Mahmood Kayani, the university\u2019s director general Brig Shahzad Munir, pro-rector, deans, directors and a large number of students were present on the occasion. \nDuring her visit, the Numl rector awarded an honorary PhD degree in educational sciences to Dr Jamileh.\nIn her address, Dr Jamileh said Islam had enlightened the whole world with its teachings about knowledge 1,400 years ago, and knowledge without ethics had no value. She said during colonial era religious leaders of Iran and this part of the region played a significant role to keep the nations united. She admired the role of the great poet of the east Allama Iqbal and his invaluable role in preserving the Islamic message of knowledge and ethics.\nDr Jamileh also spoke at the launch of her own book \u2018The Art of Living Femininely\u2019 and said her book was being translated into Urdu as well. \nShe praised Numl\u2019s role in knowledge production and dissemination and also desired to explore the possibilities of mutual academic collaboration in the fields of science and technology and languages.\nShe also inaugurated a cultural festival at the university and visited national and international stalls showcasing various cultures and their traditions. \nSpeaking on the occasion, the Numl rector said Pakistan and Iran were enjoying historic, brotherly and mutually trusted relations and both countries had deep-rooted people-to-people relations.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: After the passage of several weeks, the new inspector general of the Islamabad police, Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi, arrived at the Central Police Office to assume charge of the top office.\nAs expected, three senior police officers \u2013 DIG Security, DIG Headquarters, and Safe City Director General \u2013 did not attend the ceremony to welcome their new boss, who is junior to them.\nAlthough all four officers have the same 20-grade (DIG), DIG Security Awais Ahmed and DIG Headquarters Hassan Raza are from CTP-29 and Safe City Authority DG Mohammad Shoaib is from CTP-30. IGP Rizvi is from CTP-31.\nSources told Dawn that the DIG Headquarters did not come to work on Monday apparently to avoid saluting the new police chief, since the offices of the IGP and the DIG were located on the same floor at the CPO.\nOn the other hand, Safe City DG Shoaib, whose office in the Safe City Authority Building is merely 400 metres from the CPO, remained at his office and did not appear at the CPO, apparently for the same reason. The DIG Security also did not attend the ceremony for the very same reason, the insiders claimed.\nSyed Ali Nasir Rizvi was appointed the IGP on March 29 whereas then-IGP Akbar Nasir Khan relinquished the charge on March 30 in a ceremony in which IGP Rizvi was slated to assume the charge. These three DIGs did not attend that ceremony as well and instead went on a five-day leave approved by the outgoing IGP. These officials also approached the Islamabad chief commissioner for a 15-day leave, which was turned down.\nIn light of the appointment of the new IGP, these three officers are marking efforts to get them transferred from the Islamabad police as they do not want to \u201cserve\u201d under a junior officer, sources said, adding that if they have to appear before the new chief, they will not wear their uniform cap to avoid saluting him. Under the rules, an officer not wearing a cap will not salute the senior officer.\nThe police PRO confirmed that the DIG Headquarters did not attend his office, while the DG Safe City remained in his office and did not appear in the ceremony and later before the IGP. The DIG Security was busy with the security measures for the visiting foreign delegation. The PRO expressed ignorance about the DIGs\u2019 alleged efforts to seek leave or transfer from the capital police. He also did not know if the DIG Headquarters was on leave as he did not attend the office on Monday.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) has consented to an application seeking an end to criminal proceedings against President Asif Ali Zardari.\nIn a written reply submitted to the accountability court in the Toshakhana vehicle reference, the prosecution of NAB stated that President Zardari enjoys constitutional immunity. NAB earlier last week cleared former prime minister Nawaz Sharif in the reference.\n \n \n\nAccording to the reference, President Zardari and Mr Sharif had obtained luxury cars from Toshakhana by paying only 15 per cent of the prices.\nNAB alleged that ex-PM and the incumbent chairman Senate Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani facilitated the allotment of the vehicles to Mr Zardari and Mr Sharif by \u2018dishonestly\u2019 and \u2018illegally\u2019 relaxing the procedure for the acceptance and disposal of gifts vide a cabinet division memorandum of 2007.\nThe prosecution of NAB contended in the report that the vehicle concerned was gifted to then PM Nawaz by the government of Saudi Arabia and deposited in Toshakhana.\nIt added that later the car was included in the federal transport pool. In 2008, then PM Gilani offered Nawaz to buy the car at which the latter did so from the federal transport pool and not the Toshakhana, the NAB report said.\n\u201cThis case may attract any other offence but has no relevancy with the benefit of Toshakhana as the subject vehicle when purchased was not part of Toshakhana rather was part of the federal transport pool,\u201d it said.\nIt stated that Mr Sharif had not made the payment for the vehicle from a fake bank account, reiterating that the car was not part of the Toshakhana valuables when he bought it.\nPresident Zardari claimed immunity as provided in Article 248 of the constitution against criminal proceedings.\nAdvocate Farooq H. Naek filed the application on behalf of Mr Zardari.\nIt claimed presidential immunity in Toshakhana vehicles, Park Lane estate, Thatta water supply and fake bank accounts references.\nArticle 248(1) of the constitution says: \u201cThe President, a Governor, the Prime Minister, a Federal Minister, a Minister of State, a Chief Minister, and a Provincial Minister shall not be answerable to any court for the exercise of powers and performance of functions of their respective offices or for any act done or purported to be done, in the performance of those functions\u201d.\nArticle 248(2) says, \u201cNo criminal proceedings whatsoever shall be instituted or pursued against the president or a governor during his term of office\u201d.\nArticle 248(3) adds that \u201cno process for arrest or imprisonment of the president or a governor shall issue from any court during his term of office\u201d.\nIn the Park Lane case, NAB had accused Mr Zardari of being involved \u201cin extending loan and its misappropriation by M/s Parthenon Private Limited, M/s Park Lane Estate Private Limited and others\u201d. NAB alleged that Park Lane company had received a loan of Rs1.5 billion, which later increased to Rs2.8bn, from a joint venture of the National Bank of Pakistan and Summit Bank. The company later defaulted to this amount.\nThatta water supply reference alleged that the accused had illegally awarded different contracts to private contractors.\nMr Zardari and Ijaz Khan, Hassan Ally Memon, who headed the committee responsible for procurements related to the water supply scheme, Omni Group CEO Khawaja Abdul Ghani Majeed, Menahel Majeed and nine others are among the accused persons.\nThe fake bank accounts case has been transferred from the accountability court Islamabad to the banking court Karachi.\nMr Zardari, his sister Faryal Talpur and others are facing charges related to the opening of fake bank accounts and engaging in illegal transactions amounting to billions of rupees.\n"

The gunmen abducted them from a Taftan-bound bus based on their ethnicity and dumped their bodies under a bridge in a hilly area of Noshki.\nIn a similar attack possibly by the same gunmen, an\u00adother two people were killed after they attem\u00adp\u00adted to escape the cordon set up by the assailants on N-40, the Quetta-Noshki Highway.\nA spokesperson for the banned Balochistan Libe\u00adr\u00ada\u00adtion Army claimed respo\u00adnsibility for the killings.\n \n \n\nAccording to officials, armed men blocked the highway and started intercepting the vehicles. Soon, they intercepted a passenger coach on its way to Taftan from Quetta and looted the belongings of passengers, including cash and mobile phones.\nAfter checking the identity cards of the passengers, the gunmen separa\u00adted nine passengers \u2014 who had Punjab as their residential address \u2014 and took them away at gunpoint.\nAccording to the national identity cards, the victims hailed from Wazirabad, Gujranwala, and Mandi Bahauddin.\nUpon receiving the information, law enforcement agencies launched a search operation to rec\u00adover the kidnapped passengers \u2014 most of them in their early 20s. However, they were tipped off about the presence of bullet-riddled bodies under a bridge in the hilly terrain of Noshki.\n\u201cAll the nine people had received multiple bullet injuries on their bodies and were shot at a close range by the abductors,\u201d senior police official Asad Men\u00adgal, deployed at the Noshki police station, told Dawn.\n\u201cThe victims were travelling in the passenger coach on their way to Taftan,\u201d Habibullah Mus\u00ada\u00adkhail, Noshki deputy com\u00admissioner told Dawn. He added that 10 to 12 armed men blocked the highway, abducted nine people and later killed them.\nAbout the two other deaths, the officials said the two people died in the firing in the same Sultan hilly area of Noshki.\nThey said a car that tried to force its way through the gunmen\u2019s cordon was fired upon, killing one passenger and injuring four others in the car.\n\u201cWhen the car did not stop, the armed men opened fire at the vehicle, bursting its tyres. As a result, the car turned turtle, Mr Mengal said, adding that two local people were killed in the second attack. One of the car\u2019s passengers was a brother of provincial assembly member Ghulam Dastagir Badini.\nThe bodies were shifted to Quetta and their funeral prayers were held at Police Lines.\n\u2018Plans to enter Europe\u2019\nThe nine slain men hailed from different towns of central Punjab and were on their way to Iran from where they were planning to enter Europe via Turkiye.\nSources close to their families told Dawn that the victims had been booked by a Gujranwala-based agent for travel to Iran and Iraq.\nThey said the victims had valid visas for Iraq and Iran \u2014 a fact confirmed by the official sources.\nThe young men who left their towns on April 7 with visas stamped for Iran and Iraq had no plans to stay in these countries. Locals told Dawn that their actual destination was Europe, which they wanted to reach via Turkiye.\nThey claimed that the victim had procured valid visas for Iraq and Iran to avoid Iranian immigration authorities.\nBy pretending to be pilgrims going to holy sites in the two countries, they wanted to avoid the scrutiny of the Iranian border officials who often consider young Pakistanis as illegal immigrants trying to enter Europe via Turkiye, which borders Iran.\nOut of the nine victims, six hail from the same village of Chak Fateh Shah in Mandi Bahauddin. Their names were Tanzeel Nasir, 20; Muhammad Qasim, 22; Sajid Imran, 23; Abu Bakar, 23; Muzamil Hussain, 22; and Mazhar Iqbal, 21.\nOne victim from Chora village of Wazirabad was 17-year-old Wasiq, while Rana Shahzeb from Gujranwala and Javed Shahzed of Afzalpur were also among the slain.\nWasiq\u2019s friends told the media that he had left the village hoping for a bright future in Europe, but lost his life instead. Sources in the families of victims said that the agent had initially received a sum of Rs260,000 per person and more had to be paid after reaching the destination in Europe.\nZahid Imran Butt, however, was the lucky one who survived. He said he survived because he was sitting with \u201ca local family from Balochistan\u201d. He said his nine companions \u2014 including six friends from Mandi Bahauddin \u2014 were offloaded by two armed men who had initially asked all Punjabis to get off the bus. He confirmed that he along with his friends were going abroad hoping for employment\n \n \n\nGujrat, Mandi Bahauddin, Gujranwala, Wazirabad and Bhimbher in Azad Jammu and Kashmir are known as profitable areas for illegal human trafficking networks across the globe. Last year, scores of Pakistanis were killed on their way to Europe after their boat capsized.\nSecurity plan\nVowing that the culprits would not go unpunished, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti said the government would revive the security checkpoints on national highways to protect passengers.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalking to the media after attending the funeral prayers of the nine victims, he said those involved in the horrific killing \u201care not Baloch but terrorists, and they should be called terrorists\u201d.\nThe CM said the government would probe the Noshki incident and fix the responsibility.\nCM Bugti said they would not negotiate on the killing of innocents and the government would undertake a comprehensive review of the security plan in the province.\n\u201cNational highways are the most important routes, and we will protect them. We will formulate a security plan again in the province, establishing checkpoints with joint patrolling of the police, Levies, and the FC [Frontier Corps],\u201d he said.\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also condemned the attack and sought a report on the incident. He extended his condolences to the victims\u2019 families, saying: \u201cWe stand with the bereaved families in this hour of grief.\u201d\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        },
        "Details": {
            "Text": "\n\n\n \nTo begin with, we must acknowledge two indisputable facts that encompass our daily diet and Pakistan\u2019s agricultural landscape. \nFirst, fruits are an invaluable source of essential vitamins, minerals, fibre, and antioxidants. However, in Pakistan, the current availability of fruits and vegetables is around 100 grams and 53 grams per capita per day, respectively. This underscores the need for policy intervention to enhance access, affordability, and consumption. \nSecond, Pakistan\u2019s diverse agro-climatic conditions support cultivating a wide variety of fruits, ranging from temperate to subtropical and tropical. In addition, fertile soil, diverse topography, and good-quality groundwater and canal water offer conducive conditions for cultivating 29 types of fruits.\nThe Ministry of National Food Security and Research\u2019s Fruits, Vegetables, and Condiments Statistics indicate that over the last ten years, despite such enabling factors, the total area cropped under fruits has shrunk from 0.8 million hectares in the fiscal year 2012-2013 to 0.7m hectares in FY23, reflecting a staggering 10.9 per cent decrease. \n\nCultivation declines as farmers favour high-return field crops over fruits\n\nOver the stated period, the areas cultivated for citrus and mango \u2014 the top two fruits of Pakistan \u2014 have experienced a decline of 19.5pc and 9.3pc, respectively. Likewise, the apple-growing area has seen a reduction of 27pc, while the pomegranate area has decreased by 43pc, guava by 18pc, plum by 13pc, apricot by 49pc, and almond by 26pc. \nRecent statistics from the last five years (2018-2023) also indicate a declining trend in the area cropped for dates \u2014 the country\u2019s third largest fruit by area. The exceptions to this downward trend are bananas, grapes, and melons, which have short to medium gestation periods.\nThe decline in the fruit-growing area can be attributed to a range of factors, including the encroachment of housing colonies upon fertile agricultural land and fruit orchards, diminished rainfall due to climate change in certain areas of Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and reduced availability of irrigation water. \nAdditionally, in recent years, factors such as increased cropping intensity, higher crop yields, and improved crop prices have collectively enhanced the profitability of agronomic crops, incentivising farmers to replace fruit orchards with field crops. \nAdding to the challenge, the burgeoning population has led to land fragmentation across generations. Small orchards, typically less than 10 acres in size, often struggle to remain economically viable due to limited market access for their produce, especially when located outside the major fruit-growing clusters.\nWhat\u2019s amazing is, despite the substantial reduction in fruit-growing area, the country\u2019s fruit production increased from 6.5m tonnes in FY13 to 8.7m tonnes in FY23 \u2014 a phenomenal rise of 34pc. \nHowever, setting aside concerns regarding the reliability and authenticity of the government statistics, the possible explanation for this surge can be attributed to two factors. \nFirstly, there has been a phenomenal increase in yields. For instance, statistics indicate that apple yields have increased from 5.4 tonnes per hectare in FY13 to 10.4 tonnes per hectare in FY23 \u2014 an impressive but somewhat unbelievable increase of around 93pc. Similarly, citrus, pomegranate, guava, and apricot have experienced incredible yield increases of 38pc, 67pc, 100pc, and 123pc, respectively.\nSecondly, melons and bananas have seen a remarkable increase in their area and production. Interestingly, while the area under melon cultivation has increased by 33pc, the production has skyrocketed by a remarkable 230pc \u2014 constituting around 22pc of the country\u2019s total fruit production. Likewise, banana cultivation has witnessed a 46pc increase in area and a staggering 178pc rise in production over the past decade. \nThe crux of the problem is that orchard farmers face dwindling financial returns compared to alternative crops. Without an increase in these returns, all efforts to persuade farmers to prioritise fruit cultivation will likely be in vain, especially for fruits with a long gestation period. \nProduction cost needs to be reduced by improving the effectiveness and efficiency of inputs through technology upgrades, farmers\u2019 training, and better-quality extension service. Given the frequent watering requirements of fruit orchards and price hikes in diesel and electricity, significant reductions in production costs can be achieved by providing a one-time subsidy for solar-powered tube wells and high-efficiency irrigation solutions, irrespective of orchard size.\nThus far, our primary focus has largely been increasing yields and enhancing fruit quality, both of which have their own merits. However, in the present landscape, high losses occurring at production, harvests, and post-harvest stages, to the tune of around 40pc to 50pc, have become increasingly paramount. Therefore, there exists a pressing need to increase net yield \u2014 total yield after accounting for these losses \u2014 by improving orchard management practices and upgrading harvest and post-harvest technologies. After all, farmers will be the ultimate beneficiary of a reduction in such losses. \nThere is a pressing need to narrow the gap between farm gate values and retail prices. During periods of market oversupply, fruit prices often plummet to levels that fail to cover even the harvesting and packaging costs incurred by the farmer. Despite this, retail prices in cities remain high, benefiting multiple intermediaries the most. \nIn conclusion, the multi-dimensional challenge of shrinking fruit-growing areas requires targeted interventions at policy and operational levels. However, despite the rollout of numerous horticulture development projects at the federal and provincial levels during previous years, the continued decline in area signals an urgent need for a revaluation of our conventional approaches. \nKhalid Wattoo is a farmer and a development professional, and Dr Waqar Ahmad is a former Associate Professor at the University of Agriculture, Faisalabad\n"

            "Text": "Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar\u2019s recent statement about consultations with stakeholders on the resumption of trade ties with India marks a significant stride towards revitalising the economy and fostering peace in the region.\nFor decades, it has been evident that major political parties on both sides have advocated for normalising trade relations, but some important stakeholders had reservations. However, the National Security Policy (NSP) announced in 2021 indicated that Pakistan is prepared to move on and prioritise geoeconomics over geopolitics.\nWe need to recognise the importance of time and make smart choices for our future. Pakistan\u2019s economy has not been doing well: in FY23, it shrank by 0.6 per cent, and it\u2019s predicted to grow only by 2pc in FY24 against a population growth of 2.6pc.\nPoverty is already a big problem, affecting about 40pc of people, and it\u2019s getting worse due to high inflation and low growth.\n\nEstablishing a bilateral trading relationship could boost Pakistan\u2019s exports by 80pc or $25bn\n\nWe need a proactive approach to getting out of such a hopeless situation, and normalising trade with India can bring us many benefits.\n \n \n\nFirst, let\u2019s consider the potential for total international trade growth. According to the World Bank, if we establish a normal trading relationship with India, our exports could increase by a staggering 80pc, or about $25 billion. This could be a game-changer for Pakistan \u2014 enhancing our exports, easing our shortage of foreign exchange, and boosting our GDP growth.\nSecond, this is the shortest route to easing inflation pressure, which has been stubbornly high since the closure of direct trade. To keep inflation under control, the State Bank has to keep the interest rate high. At 22pc, the private sector has stopped borrowing, seriously hurting industrial and GDP growth.\nThird, we will save precious foreign exchange, which is currently spent rerouting goods through third countries. Much of this occurs via the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which is currently India\u2019s second-largest export market and Pakistan\u2019s second-largest import market. Some studies suggest that with freight and eliminating other expenses involved with rerouting through third parties, Pakistan could save over $1bn annually.\nThe cessation of bilateral trade has disproportionately affected our small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). For instance, date farmers in Khairpur are forced to sell their produce to middlemen who export their goods via Dubai, significantly reducing their profits. Resuming normal trade with India would offer substantial advantages to economically disadvantaged sections of our society, making regional trade more accessible than exporting to distant countries.\nFinally, Pakistan is losing out on new industries being relocated from China to diversify supply chains. Investors look for locations to source raw materials and quickly export to the regional markets. Since India is a major source of industrial raw materials and a big export market, not allowing trade makes goods manufactured in Pakistan uncompetitive.\nWe\u2019re also missing the chance to grow our trade share through global value chains that make up 70pc of world trade but only 5pc of Pakistan\u2019s.\nSome argue that we should not normalise trade relations unless the Kashmir issue is resolved. However, many countries, including China and India, China and Taiwan, and Israel and Arab countries, have border disputes yet continue trading. Pakistan has had this border dispute since independence, yet the founding fathers of both countries did not resort to closing trade.\nSome individuals also oppose opening up trade, fearing that India\u2019s potential to export more than Pakistan could worsen our trade deficit. It is crucial to recognise that importing goods from India could replace more expensive imports from other sources and thus reduce our overall trade deficit.\nFor instance, India\u2019s trade deficit with China amounts to approximately $100bn, and Bangladesh\u2019s deficit with India is around $14bn. Despite these significant trade imbalances, both countries continue this trade as they realise that importing these goods elsewhere would cost more.\nSince Pakistan has banned imports from India, it could take the first step of lifting the ban. Of course, India would need to reciprocate by removing extra duties imposed on Pakistani imports. Contrary to the misperception that both countries will have to negotiate a new trade agreement, the Agreement on South Asian Free Trade Area framework already exists.\nPerhaps the only complication is the forthcoming elections in India, which will start later this month and continue until June. In the meantime, our government could do some homework on building consensus and make a roadmap on how it intends to proceed.\nThe writer is a senior fellow at the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics.

            "Text": "The new fiscal year brings a unique political combination to Sindh, especially Karachi. The same political party manages the province and city. Some optimists believe that Karachi\u2019s fate will now change as all the tiers of government are politically aligned. This may translate into the allocation of more funds for Karachi in the forthcoming budgets. \nIt is an oversimplification to link the problems that Karachi faces to the proportion of budgetary sums earmarked for development projects. The metropolis is experiencing three distinct ranges of problems that merit a dispassionate review and redressal. These include non-democratic decision-making that fails to address mass issues, progressive decay in municipal institutions\u2019 service delivery capacity, and an overemphasis on project-based development. \nIt is not that Karachi has not received budgetary allocations in the past \u2014 the city received project finances of sizable magnitude during the past two decades. However, most of these projects were of little benefit to the locality and sector of performance where they were initiated. \nPresent-day Karachi and its residents are victims of many development decisions and consequent implementation works that were initiated without considering the impacts and benefits for the masses. \nTake, for example, the Lyari Expressway, a transportation project launched some two decades ago, which was completed after significant delays and several cost escalations. The project wreaked havoc on the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, evicting them to extend relief to a few thousand vehicle operators. \n\nCostly and superficial development projects continue to disappoint citizens \n\nThe whole undertaking was mired in non-transparent, technically inappropriate choices, components of which were investigated by a federal entity. Over Rs23 billion were spent on the Lyari Expressway and another over Rs10bn on re-settling evicted residents. With such a sum, a comprehensive road repairs and maintenance programme for the entire city could have been initiated to benefit millions of commuters. \nWithout drawing any lessons from this venture, a Malir Expressway has been launched at a higher price tag of Rs39bn, though in a public-private partnership mode. It is common sense that the project has nothing to offer to the common Karachi commuter \u2014 it is being initiated to enhance the connectivity of large-scale private real estate developments.\nLittle real-time benefit is expected to flow down to ordinary city residents. If one inquires about the needs of ordinary Karachi commuters who travel in snail-paced tri-wheelers, rickety buses and mini-buses, they would demand upgrading this fleet of buses and mini-buses with better options. \nFacilitation of private operators through innovatively designed credit schemes for procuring and operating buses/mini-buses, regulating and upscaling the dial-a-ride bus services, allocation of serviced parking and workshop facilities, and conducting driver and vehicle staff training programmes to raise operational efficiency are the most desired interventions. These can be done at far less cost than the sanctioned expressways for the city.\nThe declining state of urban service delivery is another common observation in Karachi. Urban sanitation, especially solid waste collection, is a case in point. Getting the better of the 18th Constitutional Amendment, the Sindh administration cleverly acquired control of solid waste management, which was traditionally a responsibility of local bodies. \nThe Sindh Solid Waste Management Board (SSWMB) now manages much of the city\u2019s waste management tasks. Some months ago, the Municipal Workers Trade Union Alliance raised serious concerns about the overall performance, including the poor operation and maintenance practices adopted by the SSWMB contractor. \nScores of private hospitals and healthcare facilities have opened up across the city, generating hospital waste of a very hazardous nature. Expansion in the usage of electronic gadgets has given rise to electronic waste. Rubber, plastic, paper, garden, industrial and biological waste of different volumes, contents and characteristics is generated as a natural outcome. \nWhile normal municipal waste is hardly removed, the new formats of waste dumps are lying unattended to a great extent. After collection, the waste is temporarily dumped in various sites termed as garbage transfer stations and finally taken to the two dumping sites at Jam Chakro near Surjani Town and Govind Pass near Hub. \nTime and again, garbage is burnt to reduce its volume and make room for fresh disposal. For more than three decades, these sites have been waiting for transformation into properly designed and managed sanitary landfill facilities with a scientific monitoring mechanism. \nIn terms of project and programme finances, the optics of allocated spending on various projects in Karachi appear very impressive. The Karachi Water and Sanitation Improvement Programme (KWSSIP) \u2014 supported by the World Bank \u2014 plans to invest $1.6bn in a four-phased plan over 12 years. The Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Red Line project \u2014 funded by Asian Development Bank and other donors \u2014 is a $503 million proposition. Similarly, the BRT Yellow Line (Karachi Mobility Project) will cost $428m. \nThere are many more on the list, but it must be kept in mind that all of these \u2018high-sounding, high-spending\u2019 projects will bring negligible relief in the life of the ordinary.\nThis brings us to the conclusion that isolated decisions about development spending seldom bring real relief to service users. People-friendly and democratically ratified choices of development and urban management must be identified to obtain the best value for taxpayers\u2019 money.\nThe writer is an academic and researcher based in Karachi\n"

            "Text": "Beyond conventional diplomatic efforts, Pakistan has yet to undertake a comprehensive national-level initiative to meticulously monitor, analyse and prepare for the potential ramifications of the escalating cycle of retaliation in the Middle East.\nThese potential effects encompass a surge in oil prices, displacement of the Pakistani workforce in the Middle East, deferment of work on the already-delayed Iran-Pakistan (IP) pipeline project, flight of investors from the region, supply chain disruptions and an increase in the logistic costs of trade.\nThe hierarchy in the ministries of commerce, finance, planning, and foreign affairs was approached to shed light on the country\u2019s strategy to mitigate the economic repercussions of the unfolding situation in the Middle East. Given the challenges faced by Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif\u2019s government in maintaining stability, curbing inflation, and stimulating growth, this insight was deemed crucial.\nOfficials from the relevant ministries appeared reluctant to provide insight, as they lacked calculated projections regarding the potential impact on trade, investment sentiment, remittances, balance of trade, currency valuation and industry in the event of supply chain disruptions. Some indicated, by phone from Islamabad, that they were unaware if the government had assigned anyone to research the subject.\n\nGiven its reliance on energy imports and large expatriate population, Pakistan stands to suffer more than other Asian countries as tensions in the Middle East rise\n\nIn its formal response, the spokesperson\u2019s office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated, \u201cThe question regarding the economic impact of the escalating Middle East crisis on Pakistan falls under the purview of the Ministry of Commerce, and they may be consulted for further clarity.\u201d\nThe global oil market initially surged but quickly stabilised following Iran\u2019s retaliatory attack on Israel, suggesting that global efforts to prevent further escalation might be effective. However, some analysts caution that crude oil prices could still surpass the $100 per barrel mark soon, with current prices hovering around $83 per barrel and Brent at $87 per barrel. Such an increase could have grave implications for Pakistan\u2019s balance of account and inflation.\nMiddle East conflicts have disrupted the mobility of both people and goods. Shipping sources indicate that sea and air freight rates and insurance costs for commercial containers may rise by five to 10 per cent. This increase is attributed to commercial liners opting for longer routes and higher insurance premiums due to elevated risks.\nBabar Badat, former president and current board member of International Federation of Freight Forwarders Association and a recognised logistic expert, was not surprised at the inaction. \u201cVarious governments in Pakistan, irrespective of the leadership, have not been able to address the subject of international logistic capabilities, including shipping capacity.\n\u201cThere is no national plan nor strategy to develop this area, and when we face rising freight costs, we spring into action post-event. Eventually, the nation ends up paying the price,\u201d Mr Badat said, commenting on the lack of preparedness to deal with the unfolding situation.\nHe anticipated another freight cost increase that would impact Pakistan\u2019s trade, both imports and exports. He couldn\u2019t rule out supply chain disruptions, which could harm Pakistan\u2019s economy, given its heavy reliance on imported raw materials and parts for most industries. He lamented the government\u2019s lack of interest in the crucial logistic sector, especially shipping.\n\u201cCan you name any other country as large as Pakistan with a 1,100km coastline without a single container ship? Today 95pc of trade (excluding bulk) is carried in containers. Pakistan\u2019s trade, therefore, is 100pc dependent on foreign carriers.\u201d\nTalking about cross border trucking he said, \u201cWhile our national fleet may be around 3,00,000 trucks, internationally compliant trucking fleet is very small. Besides, most countries have a significant (40-60pc) portion of their exports within their region. Our regional trade stands at barely 6pc. The lack of a regionally compliant trucking fleet inhibits the potential for trade growth in the region.\u201d\n\u201cPakistan is one of the few countries which does not have transport and logistics ministry, therefore lacks a focal forum to bring these issues to the fore,\u201d he added.\nAccording to media reports, 77pc of Pakistani expats (4.7 million) reside in the Middle East. In an extreme scenario, war fears could trigger reverse migration. Even in less dire circumstances, unrest, growing market anxieties and suppressed economic activity may reduce the quantum of remittances from the region \u2014 a crucial resource for Pakistan\u2019s foreign exchange reserves, the current account and rupee valuation. Over half of the country\u2019s nearly $30 billion annual remittances originate from the Middle East.\nAmid threats of tougher Western sanctions on Iran following recent strikes, the fate of the IP project, seen as a major step towards achieving energy security, is likely to be deferred once more to steer clear of the pitfalls of collaborating with a nation sanctioned by the West.\nFurthermore, footloose investors and fund holders are reportedly weighing the risk of further retaliations, with many opting for more secured options in stable locations. The more apprehensive investors are moving funds to safe havens \u2014 hard currencies, government securities and gold.\nWithout prior background research, the topic of debate regarding the strategy was not even raised in official and business circles. While many analysts and fund managers downplayed the potential threats to Pakistan\u2019s economy, a few indicated that the situation could once again thrust Pakistan in the global spotlight. They referenced the Soviet Union\u2019s 1979 Afghanistan invasion and the 2001 United States terrorist attack in this regard.\n\u201cIf the government strategically leverages Pakistan\u2019s unique position adjacent to Iran and holds influence in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, it could potentially assume a diplomatic role in the troubled region on behalf of the developed world. This could yield rich dividends for Pakistan,\u201d suggested a keen watcher who preferred to remain anonymous.\nMost business bodies expressed discomfort with the government\u2019s apparent lack of foresight regarding the escalating regional crisis. They fear that Pakistan, due to its geography and close commercial and diplomatic ties in the region, maybe more adversely impacted than other Asian nations.\nAbdul Aleem, Secretary General of the Overseas Chamber of Commerce and Industries, highlighted the impact saying, \u201cGiven Pakistan\u2019s heavy reliance on energy imports from the region, any disruption in oil could lead to higher domestic energy prices, affecting industries, transportation, and overall economic activity.\n\u201cAdditionally, the presence of a significant number of Pakistani expatriates working in Gulf countries means escalating tensions may jeopardise job security and remittance inflows.\n\u201cMoreover, regional peace is crucial for attracting foreign direct investment (FDI), and any disturbance could negatively impact FDI inflows across the region, with implications for the balance of payments and exchange rate stability.\u201d\nEhsan Malik, CEO of Pakistan Business Council, echoed similar sentiments, stating, \u201cThe anticipated rapid decline in inflation, followed by a reduction in the policy rate, may be tempered by the rising cost of oil due to the recent escalation of tensions in the Middle East.\u201d\nThe background research for this story unveiled a fresh cycle of volatility and uncertainty in global markets following Iran\u2019s pre-announced direct strikes on Israel.\n"

            "Text": "Even though Israel and Iran have signalled their intention to walk back down the escalation ladder following their limited but direct \u2018tit-for-tat\u2019 strikes against each other since April 13, the world remains on edge due to concerns about the conflict swarming the entire Middle East.\nA crucial energy supplier and a key shipping passageway, the region has been in the headlines since the beginning of Israel\u2019s assault on Gaza after Hamas attacked the Jewish state on Oct 7.\nEver since, Israel has laid a siege on the Gaza Strip and massacred more than 34,000 Palestinians, including thousands of children, besides causing widespread devastation and hunger. Half of the Gaza population \u201cis experiencing catastrophic hunger as the threat of famine looms\u201d, the United Nations (UN) says, with Israel planning a ground operation in Rafah.\nThe chances of the immediate escalation between Israel and Iran into a full-scale war seem to be diminishing for the time being. Still, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres painted a dark picture of the situation in the Middle East a day before the retaliatory Israeli attack on Isfahan on Friday, warning that spiralling tensions over the conflict in Gaza and conflict between Iran and Israel could devolve into a \u201cfull-scale regional conflict\u201d.\n\u201cThe Middle East is on a precipice. In recent days, we have seen a perilous escalation in words and deeds. One miscalculation, one miscommunication, one mistake, could lead to the unthinkable \u2014 a full-scale regional conflict that would be devastating for all involved,\u201d he said, calling on all parties to exercise \u201cmaximum restraint\u201d.\n\n\u2018A crisis in the Middle East adds to complications, potentially requiring the State Bank to increase the interest rate\u2019\n\nHence, the prospects of a wider regional conflict have forced many countries grappling to contain inflation to mull measures in recent weeks to mitigate the potential economic fallout from such an eventuality as traders speculate possible ramifications of escalation for commodities.\nThe ongoing conflict in Gaza has only had a limited impact on oil prices, leading to significant shipping delays and rerouting. An escalation, however, would lead to a significant spike in oil prices and disrupt supply. Oil prices have already risen due to the incorporation of risk insurance premiums and higher shipping costs.\nA Chase Securities note for its investors notes that \u201cThe spike in oil prices holds profound implications for Pakistan\u2019s economy, especially concerning inflation dynamics and the precarious balance of the current account. These developments underscore the critical need for astute economic management and strategic planning.\u201d\nThe impact of higher oil prices will extend beyond the energy sector, exerting inflationary pressure on the national economy. It would also further push out the prospect of an interest rate cut in response to volatile market conditions.\nLikewise, the potential supply-chain disruptions in the Red Sea and the Strait of Hormuz would pose additional risks to trade and economic stability, according to economic and trade analysts. They say the impact would also be felt on inflation and growth projections.\nAhmed Jamal Pirzada, a University of Bristol economist, notes that an escalation of conflict in the Middle East will predominantly affect Pakistan\u2019s economy through its effect on energy prices and what it would mean for monetary policy in advanced economies.\n\u201cThe recent economic news both in the US and the UK already suggests that it may take longer than what was previously expected for the central banks in these countries to cut interest rates by enough. Yields on US government bonds increased this week after inflation numbers turned out to be higher than expected \u2014 up from 3.1 per cent in January to 3.5pc in March,\u201d he points out.\nMr Pirzada says that these developments are not encouraging for Pakistan as these make any decision to cut the interest rate in response to the recent decline in inflation all the more complicated.\n\u201cIf monetary policy deviates too much from the trend in advanced economies, it would once again bring the exchange rate under pressure, thus reversing the decline in inflation. A crisis in the Middle East will further add to this complication, potentially requiring the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to even increase the interest rate,\u201d he noted.\nMoreover, Mr Pirzada believes that such events will also have implications for economic growth and, as a result, debt sustainability. \u201cThe SBP data already shows a contraction in the industrial sector and a stagnation in the services sector during the second quarter of FY24. The growth in GDP of only one person cent is due to improved performance in the agriculture sector.\n\u201cAny disruption in the global economy, which affects international commodity prices and turns the policy environment even more contractionary, may result in another year of negative growth. As the International Monetary Fund (IMF) itself underscores, slower economic growth will undermine its own assessment that Pakistan\u2019s debt is sustainable,\u201d he concludes.\nPakistan\u2019s economy contracted by 0.2pc during the last fiscal year and is projected to grow by 2pc this year. The multilateral lenders say the country\u2019s growth would remain subdued to below 3.5pc over the next few years. This low growth scenario depends on a new IMF programme and the implementation of structural reforms.\nPakistan\u2019s economy is vulnerable as it scrambles to recover from soaring inflation exacerbated by uncontrolled fiscal deficit and balance of payments troubles. In its World Economic Outlook report, the IMF adjusted Pakistan\u2019s inflation forecast upward to 24.8pc for this fiscal year and 12.7pc for the next.\nThough the current account deficit has shrunk to just 1pc of the economy, it is achieved at the cost of economic growth and jobs to advertise a possible default. A recent IMF report on the Middle East and North Africa region has clubbed Pakistan with six nations facing serious conflicts this year\nand said that conflicts and tight macroeconomic policy conditions would affect their economic outputs.\n\u201cBeyond West Bank and Gaza, six economies \u2014 Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen \u2014 faced conflicts at the beginning of 2024,\u201d reads the report, released on the sidelines of the World Bank-IMF spring meetings.\nThe report adds that the conflict in Gaza and Israel had worsened an already challenging environment, and disruptions to shipping through the Red Sea had added to uncertainty.\nIt also underlines that an uneven recovery against a backdrop of armed conflicts, hydrocarbon dependence, and persistent structural challenges characterised the economic growth outlook for the region and Pakistan.\n\u201cThe situation is fluid, and the full impact on the country\u2019s economy, international trade, inflation, and prices is yet to be seen. However, what is clear is that the ongoing conflict and disruptions have significant implications for the economy,\u201d Haroon Sharif, a former investment minister, says.\nThe Middle East conflict follows the biggest shock to commodity markets in recent years \u2014 the Ukraine war \u2014 which spiked global energy and commodity prices and drained the meagre Forex reserves of Pakistan and other similar economies in the last two years.\n\u201cThe initial worry about the economic consequences of the deteriorating situation in the Middle East is likely to be focused on energy (as the region heavily influences global oil and gas production),\u201d Mr Sharif notes.\nFurthermore, the escalating conflict in the Middle East would have negative implications for the current account balance, quicken inflation, introduce fresh uncertainty and challenges for rate cuts, affect international trade, and affect the fragile GDP growth prospects, he adds. Besides, the uncertain conditions will force Saudi Arabia \u2014 and others \u2014 to cancel their recently announced investment plans in Pakistan.\n"

            "Text": "The situation of street crimes in Karachi is better than Washington and Paris, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon boasted last week. Quoting updates from the International Crime Index, he said at a presser that Karachi ranked 78th out of 333 cities in various countries, according to a Dawn report.\nHad the staff of the learned minister looked at the right page of Numbeo.Com (the one that displays current ratings), he would have been more pleasantly surprised to know that Karachi, in fact, ranks 82nd out of 345 cities in various countries. (The minister\u2019s staff apparently gleaned information from the page that displayed historical indices). But that\u2019s beside the point.\nNow, let\u2019s revisit Numbeo.com and look at the current ratings. There, we find that Rawalpindi, Lahore and Islamabad have far better rankings \u2014 131st, 235th and 270th, respectively. Businessmen in Karachi must grow wiser now and move their businesses to these three cities.\nThis is a classic example of how government officials downplay the existence of a serious problem. The law and order situation in Karachi is a perennial problem that, along with poor road and transport infrastructure and lack of proper water and sanitation systems, continues to block fresh local and foreign investment in the city \u2014 Pakistan\u2019s commercial and industrial hub.\n\nAuthorities, quick to celebrate hollow victories, must wake up and deal with the realities of current law, order, governance, and economic situation to improve\n\nOne hopes that the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), jointly run by the civil and military leadership, will show more seriousness than our learned provincial minister in helping Sindh improve Karachi\u2019s law and order situation. This has become imperative as the SIFC has now started making big achievements in attracting foreign investment \u2014 at least in terms of initial pledges.\nDuring the visit of Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal Bin Farhan Al-Saud to Pakistan last week, Pakistan pitched 25 projects with an estimated potential foreign investment of $32 billion to the high-powered Saudi delegation. There is a fair chance that Saudi Arabia will agree to pour billions of dollars into at least some of the identified projects in the mining, energy, and agriculture sectors, as well as in computer chip manufacturing and railways and water dam construction.\nPakistan\u2019s economy is projected to grow this fiscal year at two per cent at best, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the unemployment rate is expected to remain 8pc. Even in the next year starting from July the GDP, growth has been forecast at 3.5pc with unemployment rate as high as 7.5pc.\nUnder these circumstances, quick and massive inflows of foreign investment are a must for a country that has been struggling to manage its balance of payments (BoP) as both the stocks of external debts and their servicing costs grow, plunging the country deeper into a debt trap.\nExports and remittances have started rising, but together, they are just enough to finance the overall deficit in merchandise and services trade. This means the country must arrange foreign exchange from other sources for external debt servicing.\nFinance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb presented a strong case for Pakistan\u2019s needs and eligibility for a long-term IMF loan before the Fund during his recent visit to Washington. The current $3bn short-term loan will expire this month after the release of the last tranche of $1.1bn.\nThe security situation in the Middle East after Iran\u2019s first-ever direct attack on Israel in retaliation for the April 1 attack on its Consulate in Damascus, Israel, is no less than explosive. The region may soon find itself engulfed in a wider, multi-frontal military conflict if a full-scale war between Tehran and Tel Aviv breaks out.\nOne can imagine its negative fallouts on global trade and investment. For a country like Pakistan facing an acute shortage of foreign exchange, seeking BoP support from the IMF and additional development funding from the World Bank may become more challenging and perhaps unofficially tied to its position in the hourly-unfolding Iran-Israel conflict.\nIt is time for our federal and provincial governments to accept disturbing facts about law, order and governance as they are and work harder to address them as efficiently as possible. It is time for them to win the hearts of the business community and overseas Pakistanis to ensure that the growth momentum seen recently in exports and remittances is not lost. Over nine months of this fiscal year, goods\u2019 exports grew about 9pc to $22.9bn, and remittances increased by about 1pc to $21bn.\nIt is heartening to note that the stage is being set for attracting huge foreign investment from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Cooperation Council countries, as well as from China and the US. The government and SIFC deserve due credit for this.\nHowever, it is equally important to address the genuine grievances of the local business community to whatever extent it is possible rather than telling them that the street crime situation in Karachi is better than in Paris and Washington. It\u2019s always unfair to match apples with oranges, isn\u2019t it? And it is outright naive to downplay a serious problem by quoting data from crowd-sourced online databases like Numbeo.com.\nPakistan\u2019s fiscal position is so tight that meeting the demands of local businessmen regarding subsidies and financial support is just too difficult. During 9MFY24, between July 1, 2023, and March 29, 2024, the federal government\u2019s bank borrowings for budgetary support (on a cash basis) swelled to Rs3.6 trillion from only Rs1.9tr in the same period last year.\nThis happened even though the Federal Board of Revenue not only met its July-March FY24 revenue collection target of Rs6.7tr but rather surpassed it by a few billion.\n"

We know what to do. It is time for us to move on.\u201d\nPakistan needed \u201ctimely decisions, [and] timely execution \u2026 no strategy works without execution. We need two to three years of structural reforms,\u201d he added.\nLater, Mr Aurangzeb said Pakistan would request a minimum three-year economic reform programme while initiating discussions with the IMF for a new loan agreement \u201cbecause that\u2019s what we need \u2026 to help execute the structural reform agenda\u201d.\nTo ease external sector pressures, on April 15, the government decided to convert all imported coal-fired power plants to local coal to save an estimated $800 million on costs and reduce end-consumer rates by about Rs3 per unit.\nRelated news is that the World Bank will provide $1 billion for the 2,160-megawatt Dasu hydropower project that would produce cheaper electricity and save dollars spent on imported fuel.\nAmong the reported projects identified for the $5bn Saudi package is the Diamer-Bhasha dam. Pakistan is seeking $1.2bn of Saudi equity investment in the project. The building of the dam has been long delayed for want of funds, among other factors.\n\u201cThe creation of jobs, side businesses, wealth generation, income distribution and tax revenues are the guaranteed benefits of localisation,\u201d argues industrialist Syed Raza Hussain in his article \u2018Make in Pakistan\u2019.\n\u201cThe government along with stakeholders should develop a five-year economic localisation plan, with a roadmap for achieving self-sufficiency to transform an economy of $375bn,\u201d suggests Mr Hussain.\nSome business segments have already started taking steps in this direction. Decades earlier, the former chairman of Atlas Group of Companies, the late Yusuf Hussain Shirazi, had advocated to \u201cthink globally and act locally\u201d.\nThe IMF\u2019s short-term tariff-led approach has rendered the production sector uncompetitive in exports, resulting in negative consequences on the external account, said the Pakistan Business Council (PBC) \u2014 a business policy advisory platform \u2014 in a letter to the finance minister.\n\u201cThat surely is not the IMF\u2019s objective,\u201d wrote Ehsan Malik, PBC\u2019s CEO.\nThe manufacturing sector posted a negative growth of 0.5pc during July-February compared to the same period last fiscal year.\nThe letter was written on the eve of the finance minister\u2019s departure for talks on a new, larger and longer deal with the Fund in Washington. The PBC has been actively advocating the need for a \u2018Make in Pakistan\u2019 policy.\nImports were expected to expand during FY24 as domestic demand strengthened and the stabilisation of the currency market made it easier for firms to import inputs, according to current month\u2019s \u2018Asian Development Outlook\u2019 by the Asian Development Bank (ADB).\nThe study adds that the current account deficit (CAD) is projected to widen to 1.5pc of GDP in 2024. Indeed, the IMF sees the CAD increasing to 1.1pc from 0.7pc of GDP of last year.\nThe ADB report pointed out that Pakistan would continue to face challenges from substantial new external financing requirements and the rollover of old debts, exacerbated by tight global financial conditions. One may add that the fears of a lingering debt default have not fully subsided.\nFlagging issues that Pakistan needs to address on April 14, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva highlighted, \u201cThe tax base, how the richer part of society contributes to the economy, the way public spending is being directed and of course\u2026 creating a more transparent environment.\u201d\nThough recent efforts to diversify foreign trade have yielded positive results, they are still far from their real potential. Exports to the seven regional countries \u2014 these include Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives and China, which topped the list \u2014 rose by 20.6pc in the first eight months of the current fiscal year compared to the same period last year.\nAnd the value of exports to the five central Asian countries \u2014 Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan \u2014 rose by 21.2pc during July-February 2024 compared to the same period last year. Simultaneously, exports to the Middle East rose 35.8pc when compared with the eight months of last year.\nMoreover, imports from the region have declined, resulting in a reduction in the trade deficit. The trade deficit with the Middle East narrowed by 22.6pc due to a drop in imports of petroleum products.\nPakistan\u2019s economy is projected to grow by 2pc according to IMF\u2019s World Economic Outlook 2024, which is lower than the global growth forecast of 3.2pc this year.\n"

            "Text": "\n\n\n \nALLAMA Iqbal\u2019s two Persian masnavis, or kind of long poems, Asraar-i-Khudi (1915) and Rumooz-i-Bekhudi (1918), were later on published in one volume (1923) and are often jointly referred to as Asraar-o-Rumooz.\nBoth Asraar-i-Khudi and Rumooz-i-Bekhudi sparked great interest among the poetry buffs and scholars alike. Aside from a controversy that lasted for quite long, both the masnavis were well-received and translated into several languages. Here is a brief intro to the translated versions.\nAccording to Rafiuddin Hashmi, Iqbal\u2019s Urdu and Persian works have been translated into 41 different languages of the world. Asraar-i-Khudi and Rumooz-i-Bekhudi, too, were rendered into many languages, wholly or partially. But here we would list only the complete translations:\nEnglish: Prof Reynold A. Nicholson (1868-1945), a renowned English scholar of Islamic mysticism and Islamic literature, translated Asraar-i-Khudi in 1920, titled The Secrets of the Self. Interestingly, Allama Iqbal pointed out many errors or misconceptions and corrected the translation. Nicholson accepted the corrections, except for a few. The second revised edition was published in 1940 and many editions of the corrected version appeared from Lahore. Saeed Akhter Durrani discovered the original copy that had Iqbal\u2019s corrections and its facsimile was published by University of Karachi in 2001.\nProf A. J. Arberry, another renowned orientalist, translated Rumooz-i-Bekhudi under the title The Mysteries of Selflessness. It was published from London in 1953. Other English translations include the ones by Abdur Rahman Tariq and Maqbool Ilahi.\nArabic: Aside from other works by Iqbal, Abdul Wahab Azzaam published versified Arabic translation of Asraar-o-Rumooz from Cairo in 1956. Sameer Abdul Hameed Ibrahim published its another Arabic translation from Cairo in 2005.\nBengali: Syed Abdul Mannan translated Asraar-i-Khudi into Bengali, published from Dhaka in 1940. Mirza Sultan Ahmed translated Asraar-i-Khudi and Rumooz-i-Bekhudi and separately published them from Dhaka in 1954.\nBhasha Indonesia: Bahrum Rangkuti translated Asraar-i-Khudi into Bhasha Indonesia and published it from Jakarta in 1976.\nChinese: Liu Shuxiong rendered Asraar-i-Khudi into Chinese and it was published from Peking (now Beijing) in 1999.\nFrench: Jamshed Murtazvi and Meyerovitch translated Asraar-o-Rumooz into French and it appeared from Paris in 1989.\nKashmiri: Ghulam Ahmed Kulgami translated Asraar-i-Khudi into his native Kashmiri and it was published from Karachi in 1969.\nMalayalam: Abdul Qadir translated Asraar-i-Khudi into Malayalam and Cochin\u2019s Iqbal Library published it in 1941.\nPashto: Samandar Khan Samandar translated Asraar-i-Khudi (1954) and Rumooz-i-Bekhudi (1952) into Pashto and both were published from Karachi.\nPunjabi: Ahmed Husain Qureshi Qaladari rendered Asraar-i-Khudi into Punjabi and in 1976 Lahore\u2019s Meri Library published it. A year earlier, Khalil Aatish had translated Asraar-o-Rumooz into Punjabi and Sang-i-Meel was the publisher.\nSindhi: Lutfullah Badvi rendered Asraar-i-Khudi and Rumooz-i-Bekhudi, separately, into Sindhi and both were published in 1956 from Karachi. Muhammad Baksh Vaasif, also translated Asraar-i-Khudi, and Rumooz-i-Bekhudi separately and both were published from Karachi (year not mentioned).\nTurkish: Ali Nihad Tarlan rendered Asraar-i-Khudi and Rumooz-i-Bekhudi, both were published from Istanbul in 1958. Ali Yuksel rendered Asraar-i-Khudi into Turkish and published it from Ankara in 1990.\nUrdu: Aside from partial translations, complete translations into Urdu include the ones by: Dr Hamid Husain, Asraar-i-Khudi (Bhopal, 1978); Ahmed Isaar, Asraar-o-Rumooz (Bangalore, 2008); Asraar-i-Khudi, versified translation, Iqbal Husain Mehdi Rizvi (Muradabad, 1975); Khwaja Hameed Yazdani, Rumooz-i-Bekhudi (Lahore, 1994); Justice S.A. Rahman, versified Urdu translation of Asraar-i-Khudi, (Lahore, 1967); Ismat Javed versified translation of Asraar-i-Khudi (Delhi, 1991) and versified translation of Rumooz-i-Bekhudi (Delhi, 1998); Ghulam Dastgeer Shahab, Asraar-i-Khudi (Poona, 1989) and Rumooz-i-Bekhudi (Poona, 1991); Abdur Rasheeed Faazil, versified translation of both Asraar-i-Khudi (Karachi, 1956) and Rumooz-i-Bekhudi (Karachi 1984); Mehr Taqvi Jaipuri, versified translation of Rumooz-i-Bekhudi (Hyderabad, Sindh, 1962).\nRecently, a translation of Asraar-o-Rumooz has been published from Lahore. Though published earlier, this new edition has been recomposed and elegantly produced. The translator has used easy to understand Urdu and the meanings have been made quite clear. Its translator Mian Abdur Rasheed was a prominent scholar who translated several of Iqbal\u2019s works and they include Urdu translations of: Armaghaan-i-Hijaz, Pas Che Bayad Kard Aye Aqvaame-i-Mashriq, Payam-i-Mashriq, Javed Nama, Zuboor-i-Ajam, Kulliyaat-i-Iqbal Farsi and Asraar-o-Rumooz. These books have run to several editions over a long period of time.\nMian Abdur Rasheed was born on Jan 1, 1915, in a village near Gujranwala, Punjab. Having passed his BA from Lahore in 1935, he worked as reporter at Punjab Legislative Assembly. Mian Abdur Rasheed wrote regular columns in Nawa-i-Waqt and Pakistan Times. He also broadcast a weekly programme from Radio Pakistan. Mian Abdur Rasheed died in September 1991.\nMost of the info contained in this piece is derived from Kitabiyaat-i-Iqbal, a work by Prof Dr Rafiuddin Hashmi. Hashmi Sahib, considered Pakistan\u2019s foremost expert on Iqbal, died on Jan 25, 2024, in Lahore. Though barely few newspapers reported his demise, a tribute to this great scholar of Iqbal Studies is well in order while remembering Iqbal on his death anniversary, which fell on April 21.\ndrraufparekh@yahoo.com\n"

The official revealed that Mr Akhundzada was a leader of the Afghan Taliban but had been living in Nawan Killi, a human settlement on Quetta\u2019s outskirts, for more than 13 years.\nBefore his assassination, he had succeeded his father as the prayer leader at the same mosque. He was around 55 years old, a holder of a Pakistani national identity card, and owned a house in the area.\nZabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Afghan Taliban government, posted on the social media platform X that Mr Akhundzada was a senior religious scholar and had previously taught at a Taliban-run madrassa in Kandahar. He was also a member of the Afghan Taliban\u2019s oversight committee.\nQuetta police have initiated an investigation into the killing. \u201cWe are investigating the killing of Molvi Mohammad Omar Jan but were unaware of his status within the Taliban government in Afghanistan,\u201d a senior police officer said. He added that more details would be shared after the investigation is concluded.\nAccording to sources, Mr Akhundzada had moved to Quetta about 13 years ago following disagreements with the Afghan Taliban, living with his father, who also resided in Nawan Killi. However, his family has denied any links with the Taliban government.\nSources also said that Mr Akhundzada was close to Taliban supreme leader Mullah Hibatullah Akhundzada, who had also served as a prayer leader in a mosque in Kuchlak before leading the Afghan Taliban.\nPolice officials in Quetta said no individual or group immediately claimed responsibility for the killing of Molvi Mohammad Omar Jan.\n"

His passing was announced by prominent politician and relative, Mushahid Hussain Sayed.\n\u201cHe lived a full life of service to Pakistan during our most tumultuous period plus post retirement: pioneered Environmental Protection for Islamabad, authored books and became bold activist for democracy and human rights! Truly a unique, multifaceted personality of our times! He will be missed by his countless admirers!\u201d he posted on X.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Khan is survived by five sons and a daughter. He was laid to rest at the H-11 graveyard, and his funeral was attended by a number of prominent individuals, including Afrasiab Khattak, Wasim Sajjad, Raja Zafarul Haq, Ashraf Jehangir Qazi, Riaz Muhammad Khan, Faisal Javed and others.\nA storied career\nAn alumnus of Lahore\u2019s Forman Christian (FC) College and the Aligarh Muslim University, Mr Khan joined the Pakistan Administrative Service in 1949.\nIn the Ayub Khan-era, he served as deputy commissioner in Peshawar and was later the commissioner of Karachi from 1963 to 1965, around the time the capital was being shifted to Islamabad.\nMr Khan served as the head of Pakistan Television during the historic 1970 election under Yahya Khan. Then, under Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, he served as the federal secretary of tourism department. Under General Ziaul Haq, he became the federal interior secretary between 1978 and 1988.\nWhen that tenure came to an end, Mr Khan was appointed secretary general of the interior ministry by his friend and long-time colleague, Ghulam Ishaq Khan. When he finally quit the civil service, Roedad Khan was immediately appointed the minister of accountability during Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif\u2019s first tenure in power, in 1990.\nBut Mr Khan did not dwell much on the controversial subjects of civil-military relations, the abuse of power by bureaucracy and corruption within its ranks. His book, A Dream Gone Sour, as the title suggests, was about wasted opportunities that Pakistan could have availed to prosper as a peaceful country.\nHe blamed \u201cadventurous military rulers and insecure politicians such as Zulfikar Ali Bhutto\u201d but was quick to defend any real or imagined role he had. \u201cI was in civil service. I had to serve. I didn\u2019t do anything wrong,\u201d he insisted in an interview with the Herald in 2014.\nIt was also claimed that he was the man who signed Z.A. Bhutto\u2019s execution order \u2014 in his capacity as interior secretary \u2014 but he disputed the claim. \u201cI never signed the execution order. The Central Jail Rawalpindi comes under the home secretary of Punjab, not the federal interior secretary\u2026 The black warrant came from Lahore,\u201d he told the Herald in 2014.\nLife after retirement\nBut even after his retirement, the storied bureaucrat continued to be an active member of civil society.\nAccording to Mushahid Hussain, Mr Khan joined the ANP for some time after his retirement. At the time, his brother Abdul Khaliq Khan was the number two man in the party.\nMr Hussain recalled how, in 1988, both he (in his capacity as journalist) and Roedad Khan (as a member of ANP) attended the funeral of Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan \u2014 popularly known as Bacha Khan \u2014 in Jalalabad.\nRoedad Khan had joined the PTI around five years ago.\n\u201cHe was the founding president of Margalla Hills Society and filed a case in the Supreme Court against the proposed tunnel in Margalla Hills, which he won. He also played an active role in the movement for the restoration of the judiciary in 2007,\u201d Mushahid Hussain told Dawn.\nMr Hussain also recalled the \u2018Saturday Club\u2019, which saw retired generals, judges, bureaucrats, diplomats and other prominent personalities congregating at Mr Khan\u2019s residence to talk about all things under the sun.\nWriting for the Herald in 2015, Aurangzaib Khan described one such meeting thus: \u201cThe sunlight winks through the soaring pine-heads in a street off Islamabad\u2019s Margalla Road. Inside, a select group of mandarins, former bureaucrats, retired diplomats, ex-judges is engaged in a heated discussion on current affairs.\u201d\n\u201cAll eyes are set on Roedad Khan, who seems like a ghost from the past \u2014 gaunt, frail and yet imposing in his warm tweed jacket\u2026 He raises and moves his thin index finger to moderate the discussion. There is no agenda, he says of the gathering that takes place with clockwork regularity at his home, \u2018just people with enormous experience and background letting their hair down.\u2019\nReporters still muse how they would even get story tips from those gatherings.\n"

The campaign to clean garbage dumps and open all blocked drains has been accelerated to transform Quetta into a clean city.\nHe also urged citizens to maintain environmental cleanliness and remove encroachments on nullahs. Sewerage lines are causing a massive stench, and the disposal of plastic bags and other solid waste leads to the blockage of the smooth flow of nullah water.\n"

            "Text": "LAHORE: Punjab Chief Secretary Zahid Akhtar Zaman has issued an order for the launch of an \u2018internal inquiry\u2019 after a retired Navy captain alleged that the Lahore police had detained his young son illegally for 10 days.\nOn the other hand, police claimed that the boy was a member of a gang involved in the illegal business of luxury non-custom-paid vehicles.\nThe inquiry was launched following the police reports that a group of people, including some serving officers of the Punjab Excise and Taxation Department, were involved in the business of luxury non-custom paid cars.\nIdentified as Sheharyar Ahmad, the youngster, a student of BBA, was released on the order of the Lahore High Court when his father Ammad Hassan, a retired captain of the Pakistan Navy, filed a writ petition. He alleged, in the petition, that his son was taken into custody by police in a raid on his house in Cantt after registration of a fake/forged robbery case.\n\u201cIt has been observed that he was shown as arrested in a case lodged on Dec 25, 2022 under section 392 of the PPC at Police Station Chuhng following an incident reported on Dec 24, 2022 against unknown accused,\u201d reads the LHC order.\n\nAlleges son illegally detained in fabricated case; police claim youngster was a member of gang including govt officers\n\nThe LHC judge declared that during that period, police had neither submitted an interim report before the court nor resorted to file an untraced report because no accused was ever arrested in this case.\nThe high court ordered SP Saddar Division Sydrah Khan to conduct a detailed inquiry into the matter and submit a report with the court. However, the police inquiry finalised on the court order declared Sheharyar guilty.\nSpecial Protection Unit (SPU) DIG Imran Kishwar told Dawn the findings of the inquiry conducted by SP Sydrah Khan had been submitted with the LHC. He alleged that Sheharyar was one of the key players of the network behind the sale and purchase of illegal non-custom paid luxury cars.\n\u201cDuring the inquiry many more stunning revelations have been made as it has been suspected that the number of non-custom paid vehicles sold so far may be over 100,\u201d the DIG said. He added that it was an organised gang, including the Punjab Excise and Taxation Department officials, who were behind the illegal sale and purchase of non-custom paid cars. A data entry operator of the department was also among them besides some other senior officers, he said.\nAbout BBA student Sheharyar\u2019s involvement in the robbery case as was alleged by his father, Mr Kishwar said inquiries were also being conducted in this respect. He said police had launched action against Sheharyar when he mediated a deal of a non-custom paid car, which was purchased by another Pakistani student in the USA.\nThe USA student had deposited an amount Rs50m in a bank through a \u2018pay order\u2019 and presented some documents as evidence, he said. After this, police had expanded the scope of investigation to detect and trace other members of the network, the DIG SPU said, adding that 25 luxury non-paid custom vehicles had been traced so far.\n\u201cThe USA student is still struggling to get his payment back,\u201d Imran Kishwar said.\nTo a question, he confirmed that a high level internal inquiry had also been initiated on the directions of the chief secretary to further expand the scope of the investigations when it appeared that some excise and taxation department officers were also a part of the gang. On the other hand, Ammad Hassan told Dawn that police had arrested his son in a fake case at the behest of PML-N political leader Chaudhry Iqbal Gujjar.\nDIG Kishwar denied the allegation of Hassan that police had arrested him at the behest of PML-N leader Chaudhry Iqbal Gujjar. He claimed that during the inquiry it appeared that Gujjar\u2019s son was also one of the affectees whom the non-custom paid car was sold. Hassan said his son had just facilitated Gujjar\u2019s son in the purchase of a luxury vehicle being his friend some two years back and the vehicle later was reported to be non-custom paid.\n\u201cMy son Sheharyar had nothing to do with the business of non-custom paid vehicles as he was just assisting Chaudhry Iqbal\u2019s son being his close friend,\u201d Ammad Hassan stressed.\nHe added that as Chaudhry Iqbal Gujjar was having connections with the PML-N rulers in Punjab, he used his influence in the police department to involve Sheharyar in the fabricated case.\nAmmad alleged that the CIA police tortured his son in the presence of the PML-N leader\u2019s son during custody. About the inquiry report of SP Sydrah Khan, he said he had not been informed about its findings or that it had been submitted to the court.\n"

He has also suggested organising a sit-in at Regal Chowk (PP-147) and Baidian Road (PP-158).\nMr Azhar stated in a tweet on X, that the February 8 general elections stood as the most rigged and manipulated election in history to date. However, he stated, the April 21 by-election has broken that record with ballot stuffing, pre-signed statements of counts (Form 45), and unlawful arrests. \n\u201cThis is a shameful mockery of the democratic process,\u201d he commented.\nThe PTI leader also expressed grave concern over the torture of polling agents.\nMeanwhile, PTI leader Salman Akram Raja tweeted that the presence of candidates and election agents at the office of the ROs during consolidation has been barred everywhere. \n\u201cThis is part of the rigging plan along with the shutdown of the internet. This has set the scene for the use of pre-signed and fictitiously filled-up forms 45,\u201d he added.\nPosting a handwritten request from a presiding officer of a polling station for PP-158 (Lahore) by-election, PTI leader Moonis Elahi, who is contesting from this constituency, stated that the presiding officer did not carry Form-45 and she informed the returning officer of the PP-158 by-election. Mr Elahi also posted several videos explaining the scale of rigging unleashed by the establishment.\n"

Now in its 26th year, the puppet festival has become a hallmark of cultural heritage and artistic expression in Pakistan.\nTo date, RPTW has hosted 85 festivals, each contributing to the rich tapestry of performing arts in the region and reinforcing our commitment to cultural preservation and innovation, says Pirzada.\nThe festival also included the traditional folklore puppet shows and a vibrant Rafi Peer Puppet Parade, all designed to entertain, educate, and inspire audiences of all ages.\nSet in the majestic surroundings of Lahore Fort, the festival not only offered a feast for the senses, but also delved into the cultural stories of Pakistan. Each performance intricately weaves tales of folklore, myth, and modern-day narratives, bringing them to life through the unique charm and creativity that puppetry allows.\n\u201cOur partnership with the Walled City of Lahore Authority highlights a shared dedication to utilising cultural events as a platform for education and community engagement. Together, we aim to create an environment that celebrates the rich historical legacy of Lahore while showcasing the innovative spirit of contemporary puppetry arts\u201d, says Pirzada.\nThe festival featured a lively lineup of puppet performances, storytelling sessions, mascot parades, puppet-making workshops, and much more, making it a perfect place to experience the vibrant spirit of Lahore with people from different walks of life attending the event.\n"

Requiring six runs from the final over, and three off the last ball, a boundary off an outside edge from Karishma Ramharack sealed the dramatic win for the side, shattering Pakistan\u2019s hopes.\nInitially cruising at 180-3 in 41 overs, West Indies were sent into a tailspin by Nida\u2019s exceptional bowling performance. Nida, who reached the milestone by dismissing opener Rashada Williams, dismantled the middle order by accounting for Chedean Nation, Aaliyah Alleyne, and Chinelle Henry, leaving West Indies struggling at 219-7 after 49 overs.\nDespite a valiant effort by pacer Fatima Sana, who conceded only two runs off the first five balls and claimed the wicket of Afy Fletcher, her disappointment was palpable as the ball found the boundary off Ramharack\u2019s bat.\nNida finished with remarkable figures of 4-52 runs in nine overs, while Umm-e-Hani secured two wickets for 38. Sadia Iqbal and Fatima also chipped in with a wicket each.\nStefanie Taylor was instrumental in West Indies\u2019 victory, crafting a composed 73 off 90 balls with nine boundaries before falling to Sadia. This marked her 41st career half-century in 156 matches.\nTaylor, a former top-ranked batter, forged an 88-run partnership for the third wicket with Shemaine Campbelle, who contributed a solid 52 off 73 balls with four fours.\nCampbelle had earlier partnered with skipper Hayley Matthews, adding 39 runs for the second wicket before Matthews was caught by substitute Diana Baig after scoring 44 off 63 balls with three fours.\nEarlier, Bismah Maroof and Sidra Ameen propelled Pakistan to a total of 223 in 48.5 overs. Bismah scored a patient 65 off 105 balls, her 21st half-century in 135 matches, while Sidra struck a brisk 50 off 70 balls, her eighth half-century in 65 matches, with four boundaries. The duo stitched together an 80-run partnership for the second wicket.\nThe only other notable partnership came for the seventh wicket, as Bismah and Najiha Alvi added 31 runs off 27 balls. Sadia and Najiha contributed a further 22 runs for the last wicket.\nChinelle Henry led the bowling attack for the West Indies, claiming three wickets for 37 runs, followed by Karishma Ramharack with three for 48, and Afy Fletcher with two for 46 runs.\nScores in brief:\nPAKISTAN 223 in 48.5 overs (Bismah Maroof 65, Sidra Ameen 50, Najiha Alvi 25; Chinelle Henry 3-37, Karishma Ramharack 3-48, Afy Fletcher 2-46); WEST INDIES 225-8 in 50 overs (Stafanie Taylor 73, Shemaine Campbelle 52, Hayley Matthews 44, Chinelle Henry 23; Nida Dar 4-52, Umm-e-Hani 2-38).\n"

He knitted an 88-run partnership with Dean Foxcroft, who played a supporting role in the heist.\nNew Zealand had managed 59 in the powerplay, before openers Tim Siefert and Tim Robinson were castled by Pakistan pacers Naseem Shah and Abbas Afridi.\nPakistan could have made further inroads had Naseem taken an easy catch at short fine-leg off Shadab Khan\u2019s bowling to dismiss Chapman when he was batting at 16.\nHe survived to take the visitors to 80-1 by the halfway stage along with Foxcroft and started making Pakistan regret the dropped chance with a clean hit through the covers off Abbas in the 11th over before lofting Iftikhar Ahmed\u2019s off-spin over the bowler\u2019s head for his first six.\nChapman was dropped again in the 13th over, this time by Usman Khan \u2014 although it was a tough chance \u2014 and celebrated his second reprieve, carting leg-spinner Abrar Ahmed over deep fine for another boundary.\nThe southpaw cleared long-off off Shadab in the next over for his second maximum and took a couple of runs to bring up his half-century in 29 balls.\nChapman stole two consecutive boundaries off Shaheen Shah Afridi before Foxcroft joined the party with a powerful pull for six against the pacer, who gave away 17 runs in the 15th over. \nChapman was equally hostile towards Naseem, smacking him for two fours and as many sixes as New Zealand added 23 more to the total in the over, also bringing up the 100-run partnership between Chapman and Foxcroft.\nWhen a wicket finally came \u2014 with Abbas dismissing Foxcroft for 31 off 29 \u2014 New Zealand needed just nine more to win, and Chapman took them over the line with ease.\nEarlier, a late onslaught by Shadab and Irfan Khan pulled Pakistan out of trouble following a short middle-order crisis, which started with Mohammad Rizwan walking off the field due to injury.\nThe pair, which got together with almost seven overs, amassed 62 off just 34 balls, with Shadab hitting two sixes and four fours for his 41 off 20. Irfan, meanwhile, stayed unbeaten 30 off 20 balls, launching a six and three fours throughout the course of his knock. \nAn explosive start by Pakistan openers Babar Azam and Saim Ayub boosted the hosts to 54-0 in the powerplay, with Babar bringing up Pakistan\u2019s 50 with a gorgeous hit over long-on off his counterpart Michael Bracewell\u2019s off-break. \nThe Pakistan skipper, however, was less of an aggressor than Saim in the first six overs, with the left-hander smashing a six and five fours in the period. But on the first delivery he faced after the powerplay overs was his last, as he became leg-spinner Ish Sodhi and New Zealand\u2019s opening breakthrough.\nBabar did not let that break Pakistan\u2019s rhythm, and with the incoming Rizwan, took the side to 84-1 by the halfway stage, only to spoon Bracewell to Jacob Duffy at point to depart for 37 off 29.\nPakistan brought up their 100 by the end of the 12th over, with Rizwan and Usman in the middle. But it went haywire for Pakistan all of a sudden after that, as Rizwan pulled a cramp to get retired hurt and Usman holed Sodhi out to Duffy at long-off two balls later, leaving Pakistan at 105-3.\nBut once Shadab and Irfan got going, Pakistan regained their lost momentum and more than made up for the time lost. After Irfan punished a Sodhi half-tracker for his first boundary, Shadab launched Duffy\u2019s pace high and long over midwicket to tee off his fireworks. \nIrfan\u2019s first six was a handsome hit over long-on off Bracewell on the next ball before Shadab smacked the spinner straight down the ground for a humungous six and lifted him through the covers for four more. The former Pakistan vice-captain was undone by Duffy eight balls later, but by that point he had done the damage.\nIrfan crafted two more boundaries off Zakary Foulkes\u2019 pace in the last over to drive Pakistan to what proved to be an easy target to chase for New Zealand. \nSCOREBOARD\nPAKISTAN: \nSaim Ayub c Neesham b Sodhi 32 \nBabar Azam c Duffy b Bracewell  37 \nMohammad Rizwan retired hurt    22 \nUsman Khan c Duffy b Sodhi  5 \nIrfan Khan not out  30 \nShadab Khan c Chapman b Duffy   41 \nIftikhar Ahmed not out  2 \nEXTRAS (B-1, LB-1, NB-3, W-4)   9 \nTOTAL (for four wickets, 20)    178\nFALL OF WICKETS: 1-55 (Saim), 2-84 (Babar), 3-104 (Usman), 4-166 (Shadab)\nDID NOT BAT: Shaheen Shah Afridi, Naseem Shah, Abbas Afridi, Abrar Ahmed \nBOWLING: Foulkes 4-0-39-0 (2w), Duffy 4-0-39-1(1w), Bracewell 4-0-40-1 (1w), O\u2019Rourke 4-0-33-0 (3nb), Sodhi 4-0-25-2\nNEW ZEALAND: \nT.

            "Text": "BERLIN: Harry Kane claimed his 33rd league goal of the season and Thomas Muller scored twice as Bayern Munich thrashed Union Berlin 5-1 away in the Bundesliga on Saturday.\nJust a week after Xabi Alonso\u2019s Bayer Leverkusen broke Bayern\u2019s 11-year title run, the visitors were dominant and clinical in the German capital.\nKane curled in an excellent free-kick and laid on a second-half goal for Mathys Tel. The England captain is eight shy of Robert Lewandowski\u2019s single-season Bundesliga goals record with four games remaining.\nBayern rested Jamal Musiala after Wednesday\u2019s 1-0 win over Arsenal sent them through to the Champions League semi-finals but they had no difficulty creating chances against Union.\n\u201cWe\u2019re happy \u2014 it was a perfect week. It was by no means guaranteed that we\u2019d win like that,\u201d said Bayern coach Thomas Tuchel.\nHanded a rare start, French teenager Tel set up Leon Goretzka\u2019s 29th-minute opener, with Kane doubling the lead in first-half stoppage time.\nMuellr, playing his 470th Bundesliga game for Bayern, scored both of his goals in the second half, either side of a strike from Tel.Union, who faced Real Madrid and Napoli in the Champions League this season, pulled one back late through Yorbe Vertessen, have now won just one of their past eight and sit three points clear of the relegation places.\nEarlier, RB Leipzig tightened their grip on fourth place, the final guaranteed Champions League spot, with a 2-1 win at Heidenheim as Lois Openda scored his 23rd goal of the season.\nLeipzig striker Benjamin Sesko opened the scoring shortly before half-time, pouncing on some disorganised defending from the home side for his 10th league goal this term.\nHeidenheim struck back with 20 minutes remaining, Nikola Dovedan heading in following a free-kick.\nLeipzig grabbed the winner with five minutes remaining when Openda tapped in a Mohamed Simakan pass.Meanwhile, a hat-trick from Borussia Moenchengladbach\u2019s Robin Hack was not enough as his side lost 4-3 at Hoffenheim.\nHoffenheim led 3-1 midway through the second half before Hack scored twice in 11 minutes to level the score with just a minute remaining, but Anton Stach scored in stoppage time for the home side to snatch victory.\nElsewhere, bottom side Darmstadt won their first league match since October, beating second-last Cologne 2-0 thanks to goals from Oscar Vilhelmsson and Cristoph Klarer.\nDespite the win, Darmstadt remain 10 points from safety with four games remaining.\nCologne\u2019s chances of beating the drop are falling fast. They are five points away from 15th-placed Bochum, the final safe spot.\nBochum lost 1-0 at VfL Wolfsburg, with Ralph Hasenhuettl\u2019s side winning thanks to a goal from Jonas Wind.\nWind\u2019s goal deepened Bochum\u2019s woes a week after sacking coach Thomas Letsch, with the side just one point clear of the relegation spots.\n"

All weekend I think we were incredibly quick. It was just enjoyable to drive,\u201d said the 26-year-old who took the chequered flag 13.773 seconds clear of Norris. \u201cThe car was basically on rails and I could do whatever I wanted to with it.\u201d\nTeam boss Christian Horner summed up the situation by describing Verstappen, who has won all the races he has finished this year, as a man driving  \u201con another planet\u201d.\nRed Bull are now 44 points clear of Ferrari in the constructors\u2019 standings.\nNorris ensured China was the season\u2019s first race without one team finishing first and second \u2014 Ferrari having taken the one-two in Australia and Red Bull the rest \u2014 with his 15th career podium and eighth second place.\n\u201cI just wasn\u2019t expecting today at all,\u201d said the Briton, who started fourth on the grid and was voted Driver of the Day. \u201cI got everything ready to go home early and not be on the podium, so it\u2019s a pleasant surprise.\u201d\nHis only wrong moves came after the finish when Norris returned to the pit lane rather than parking up alongside Verstappen and Perez on the straight, and later when he picked up the cap for third-placed driver.\nChina\u2019s first and only driver Zhou Guanyu, in his first home race, had the honour of parking behind the Red Bulls and crouched in tears before saluting the crowd. The Sauber driver finished 14th.\nMcLaren\u2019s Oscar Piastri finished eighth, with Mercedes\u2019s seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton going from 18th on the grid to ninth and Nico Hulkenberg taking the final point for Haas.\nThe safety car was deployed twice in the 56-lap race, first on lap 23 when Sauber\u2019s Valtteri Bottas parked up with a failed engine and marshals struggled to shift the car which was stuck in gear.\nSecond at the lap 27 re-start when there was mayhem with Aston Martin\u2019s Lance Stroll ploughing into the back of Daniel Ricciardo\u2019s RB, the Australian in turn shunted into compatriot Oscar Piastri\u2019s McLaren.\nHaas\u2019s Kevin Magnussen and RB\u2019s Yuki Tsunoda also tangled, with the Japanese retiring and the Dane limping back to the pits with a damaged and sparking car.\nStroll and Magnussen were both given 10-second penalties for causing a collision while Williams\u2019s Logan Sargeant collected the same sanction for a safety car infringement. Ricciardo retired in the pits on lap 34.\n"

However, before the start of the event a heavy contingent of police cordoned off the area and made the event almost impossible.\nA PTI spokesperson, Moha\u00admmed Ali Bozdar, claimed that the police detained over 20 workers from Hassan Square, Sachal, Korangi, Gulistan-i-Jauhar, Sharea Faisal and other areas. \nHowever, police sources denied arrest of any PTI worker. \nA senior official, who wished not to be named, said that they just \u2018prevented\u2019 the activists from taking out the rally from Insaf House as they did not have any permission from the district administration.\nIt all started in the second half of the day when PTI leaders led by its Sindh chapter president Haleem Adil Sheikh and senior vice president Sher Afzal Marwat, who landed in Karachi specially to attend the event, assembled at Insaf House to find heavy contingent of police surrounding the area. \nWithin next few minutes, the police blocked both tracks of Sharea Faisal to stop the rally from taking off, which caused a gridlock on the key thoroughfare. \nHowever, PTI workers defied police arrangements, upon which the police detained a number of activists promoting strong protest from the party on main Sharea Faisal. \n\u201cWe had announced the rally several days ago,\u201d said Haleem Adil Sheikh while talking to reporters. \n\u201cAll of a sudden the police jumped in and placed hurdles on our route without mentioning any reason. They harassed our workers, arrested them and moved them to Baloch Colony police station. What kind of democracy is this? It\u2019s worse than dictatorship. But let me be very clear. We won\u2019t stop. Peaceful protest is our right and we will exercise it at every cost.\u201d \nThe protest followed talks between police authorities and PTI leaders that led to release of party workers, a PTI spokesman said. \nFinally, the rally started from Sharea Faisal and reached its destination by sunset, during which it was joined by number of other rallies form other parts of the city. \nAddressing the rally, the leaders vowed to continue their struggle for a \u2018true democratic state\u2019 with rule of law and where people \u201cwould be free to choose their rulers\u201d. \n\u201cThe people of Karachi have proved again that they\u2019re only with Imran Khan and they can\u2019t be scared off such illegal tactics,\u201d said Mr Marwat while addressing the rally. \n\u201cThe mandate of Karachi and entire Pakistan belongs to Imran Khan and anyone who wishes to minus Imran Khan from the country\u2019s politics actually lives in fool\u2019s paradise. Today\u2019s massive rally and this sea of people is message to all those forces that they can no more keep Imran Khan behind the bars.\u201d \nHaleem Adil in his address said that the Sunday\u2019s event was only a \u2018trailer\u2019 for the upcoming power show on April 28 in Karachi. \n\u201cThe people of Karachi would come out again on April 28 for another massive rally which would be in Bagh-i-Jinnah,\u201d he said. \n\u201cKarachi\u2019s residents have consistently supported the PTI. In 2024 elections, the people witnessed massive rigging through which all of our Karachi seats were taken away. The people now demand accountability for the theft of mandate. This forthcoming rally in Karachi will be monumental.\u201d\n"

            "Text": "KARACHI: While the Punjab government has reduced roti prices in order to provide relief to its people, citizens are awaiting a drop in prices of naan after a sharp reduction in prices of different varieties of flour in Sindh. \nA week ago, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had cut the rate of roti and naan, fixing the price of a 100 gram roti at Rs16 and of 120g naan at Rs20.\nHowever, the Sindh government and the Karachi commissioner have yet to take  notice of delay in price reduction of various roti varieties. \nWhile millers have slashed the prices of flour No2.5, Maida (super fine flour)  and fine flour, tandoor operators appear to be not ready to pass on the benefit of reduction in flour prices to people after a bumper wheat crop and its massive import in the country.\n\nPrice of flour No2.5 reduced to Rs96 per kg from Rs122 a kilo\n\nAmid inaction from the government, consumers are paying high prices of chapatti, which is selling at Rs15-20 per piece, Naan at Rs25-30, and Sheermal and Taftaan at Rs80-90. \nSpeaking to Dawn, most consumers criticise the performance of the commissioner regarding outright profiteering by retailers of fruit, grocery, vegetables, bakery and confectionery items during Ramazan.  \nThey say they are expecting a massive reduction in roti prices after a drop throughout the country.  \nOn the other hand, tandoor owners in various areas warn that if the government tries to enforce any kind of pressure on them to sell roti varieties at reduced rates without any homework on \u201csoaring production cost\u201d, they may shut down their operations in protest.  \nFlour prices \nMillers have slashed the prices of flour No2.5, Maida (super fine flour) and fine flour to Rs96 per kg, Rs123 and Rs124 from Rs122, Rs136 and Rs140 per kg prevailing in February 2024, respectively.  \nSimilarly, the wholesale prices of flour No.2.5 is now Rs97 per kg as against Rs123 per kg while Maida and fine flour are selling at Rs122 instead of Rs133 per kg.  \nChairman of Karachi Wholesalers Grocers Association Rauf Ibrahim has expressed surprise as to why the commissioner of Karachi is still reluctant to issue new revised rates of various flour varieties after downward trajectory in their ex-mill and wholesale rates.  \nHe has also said that the commissioner seems unaware that the wheat flour rate has plunged below the commissioner Karachi\u2019s wholesale and retail rates of Rs123 and Rs128 per kg.  \nThe delay in revising down the flour rates is encouraging retailers to easily charge extra rupees from consumers based on higher official rates.  \nLack of interest by the price regulator has also given a free hand to bakery and confectionary item makers to continue to charge high rates from consumers on items in which Maida and fine flour are extensively used.  \nRauf Ibrahim says market retailers are selling chakki flour at Rs150-160 per kg while its price should come down to Rs135 per kg.  \nShopkeepers are still demanding Rs130-150 per kg for flour No.2.5, Maida and fine flour.  \nThe chairman of wholesalers and grocers body also says that low weight tandoori Naan should be sold at Rs15-16 per piece, while higher weight Naan should be available at Rs20 per piece and Chapati price should not exceed Rs12 depending on the weight after the price cut in flour.  \nIt is also seen that most consumers also do not bother about the weight of roti which provides opportunity to tandoors to sell lesser weight roti at higher rate.   \nTandoor owners claim that chapati is 80-90 grams while Naan carries a weight of 160-170 grams.  \nThey say that it is true that the price of flour has come down, but the issue of non-availability of subsidised natural gas has forced them to opt for costly liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), whose price is Rs260 per kg.  \nOne can calculate the price of filling a 45kg LPG cylinder at this rate.  \nThey say the price of electricity has more than doubled in the last few years.  \nA number of tandoor owners are using white paper to wrap roti, which costs Rs300 per kg instead of old newspapers which are cheaper.  \nThey say the price of plastic shopping bag is Rs350-450 per kg depending on quality, while labour charges and sugar rates have also been increased.  \nMany tandoors are operating on rental spaces whose prices have also touched the roof.  \nThey say that many tandoor operators are using generators in the event of loadshedding, which are run on petrol and diesel whose rates have also gone up.  \nThey have urged the government to first take stock of the situation regarding production cost and other rising expenses in running tandoors before making any \u2018unilateral\u2019 decision of announcing any cut in Roti rates.  \nWheat price after massive import \nA huge import of wheat of around 3.5 million tonnes costing one billion dollars from September-March 2024 by the private sector has brought down wheat rate to Rs8,200-8,300 per 100kg bag from Rs10,800 a few months back thus making a strong case for price cut in flour varieties.  \nBesides Sindh wheat crop is also available at Rs8,500 per 100kg bag as compared to Rs9,500 earlier in the month.  \nHowever, the millers have taken too much time to reduce the rates of flour despite import of cheaper wheat from Ukraine and Russia followed by strong rupee against the dollar in the above period, making landed cost of imported grain lower.  \nChairman of Cereal Association of Pakistan Muzammil Chappal said the government\u2019s timely decision to allow import of wheat by the private sector without involving any subsidy had kept wheat prices stable in local markets besides averting any grain shortage.  \nHe said Pakistan had to import wheat due to a low wheat crop of 27 million tonnes in 2023 as against the consumption of 31mn tonnes.  \nWheat import was allowed till February 2024 but later on, the government had extended till March 2024 due to some disturbances in the Red and Black Sea, he added.\n"

            "Text": "Z A BUKHARI was a broadcasting giant and a noteworthy poet. A celebrity of in his own right, he introduced and trained a decent number of artists at Radio Pakistan where he worked for a long stretch of time. On April 22, 1974 it was reported that Z A Bukhari had returned to Karachi from the United Kingdom after receiving treatment at a clinic in London. The former director-general of Radio Pakistan had a heart attack on Jan 2 and was taken to the Cardiovascular Disease Hospital in the city. He was subsequently flown to London for a specialist treatment where he stayed for almost eight weeks.\nBukhari sahib was also well versed in the art of public speaking. In those days, the spirit of activism and the ability to speak well in public could be found in individuals belonging to professions related to the well-being of mankind. On April 24, Karachi\u2019s journalists at a meeting resolved to fight against imperialism and colonialism in order to establish a progressive socioeconomic order. In a resolution adopted on the occasion of celebrating the 11th anniversary of the Afro-Asian Journalists Association, the Karachi Union of Journalists (KUJ) reaffirmed its determination to struggle against imperialism in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Shen Pe-wen of the Consulate of the People\u2019s Republic of China was the chief guest at the meeting. The speakers included: Zafar Rizvi, Abdul Habib Khan Ghouri, Abdul Hameed Chapra, Inam Durrani and Hasan Abidi.\nThe question of \u2018resolve\u2019, albeit in a different manner, came under scrutiny on April 23 as well when the Karachi Municipal Corporation (KMC) waged an \u2018air-attack\u2019 on mosquitoes on an experimental basis by spraying insecticides from a light aircraft over three main mosquito-breeding grounds in the city. It was the first ever aerial spray in the metropolis which was carried out in the morning covering Mahmoodabad, PECHS Block 6 (from Baloch Colony to Korangi Road) and Defence Housing Society. The campaign cost the KMC Rs20,000 for 500 acres apart from the expenditure on field operations. The KMC believed if 80 per cent of the desired results were achieved, it would be a good investment since it was not possible to go for spraying manually from the ground.\nTwo days later, on April 25, satisfactory results were claimed by the KMC from aerial spraying of insecticides. According to a report, 80pc of mosquito-larvae were killed and mortality among adult mosquitoes was encouraging, too. The effect of the drive on the first day was not high but on the second day the percentage increased considerably. However, an examination of several ponds in residential areas showed that the campaign was ineffective because of the high velocity of the wind.\nSpeaking of numbers, on April 27, more than 1500 students of Karachi College for Women boycotted classes as a protest against the transfer of seven lecturers of the institution. They gathered on college premises where they expressed their resentment at the order of transfer issued to the teachers. They appealed to the chief minister of Sindh, Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi, to intervene and direct the Education Department to withdraw the order.\n"

They also claimed to have rescued two hostages and recovered two snatched cars during the actions.\nShikarpur SSP Irfarn Ali Samoo told Dawn over phone that police had received information that a gang of dacoits was travelling by a car, which was passing through a section of the Dakhan link road within the limits of the Madeji police station. He said that police rushed to the specified spot and challenged the gangsters but they opened fire, which was returned. During the encounter, two dacoits were killed on the spot, he said, adding that the weapons and car used by the outlaws were taken into custody after the encounter.\nThe bodies were shifted to the taluka hospital for a postmortem examination.\n\nTwo hostages freed in other police operations \n\nLater, the deceased outlaws were identified as Ali Jan Sabzoi and Rafique alias Rafu Jafferi, believed to be associated with Nisar Sabzoi and Arslan Sabzoi gangs, the SSP said.\nThe police officer said that in the kutcha area of Garhi Tegho, a police team gunned down a dreaded dacoit, \u2018SP Tegho\u2019, who carried Rs2m head money.\nIt was an intelligence-based targeted action, the SSP said, pointing out that such actions were under way against criminal gangs and their facilitators in the riverine areas.\nLocal reporters, however, claimed that SP Tegho and a passer-by, Amjad, were killed in a clash between two rival communities of the Garhi Tegho riverine area. Five other persons were wounded in the gun battle during which sophisticated heavy weapons were used by both sides, they said.\nIn yet another encounter, two dacoits, Nawab Teghani and Aijaz, were wounded in a similar action, the SSP said.\nTwo hostages recovered\nSSP Samoon said that the Naparkot police safely rescued two hostages, Imran Pahor and Channesar Pahor, who were kidnaped about a month ago from the Karampur Laro (turning) in Kandhkot.\nThey were escorted to the area\u2019s police station and would be handed over to their families after legal formalities, he said.\nMeanwhile, Kandhkot police and Rangers personnel killed a dacoit in a joint operation during which several hideouts of the outlaws were torched and destroyed in the riverine area of Khair Shah, within the limits of the B-Section police on Saturday night and Sunday. Several snatched motorcycles were recovered during the operation, they said.\nThe Kandhkot police said the wanted dacoit, Sanwal Mohammadani, was wounded in the action and transported to the taluka hospital, where doctors referred him to the Sukkur Civil Hospital due to his precarious condition.

Dr Inayatullah Rajpar, Dean of Faculty of Crop Production,  discussed swift global recognition of various indigenous products and  critical role of GI registration in maintaining their quality and standards. \n\u201cWe must play a positive role in earning global acclaim for  countless indigenous products in Sindh, including Sindhri mango from  Mirpurkhas, henna from Mehar and Tharo Shah, Kunri\u2019s chilies, Mehar  city\u2019s barfi, Hyderabad\u2019s bangles, Khairpur\u2019s dates, Larkana\u2019s  guava etc,\u201d he added. \nPeter Damary, international consultant for Sindhri mango GI  project, highlighted merits of geographical indication registration for  numerous Pakistani products including those from Sindh.  \nHe said that establishing a \u201cMade in Pakistan\u201d standard for the  indigenous products could serve as a potential economic tool for  promoting and boosting both national and international trade, enabling  Pakistani products to be marketed at premium prices. \nNational consultant for the project, Ms Noor Asfia,  said that over 200 products were ideal for global branding. \u201cIt is  imperative for us to consider how rest of the world is progressing  rapidly.

Traders and members of the business community of Hyderabad are already protesting against Hesco\u2019s performance,\u201d he said, adding that they had been burdened with fuel price adjustment charges and other taxes, besides electricity tariff. A decline in industrial activities was being caused by power distribution companies (Discos) and it was right time the federal government introduced reforms in the companies to ensure promotion of industrial activities, he said.\nMr Siddiqui said that unannounced loadshedding was imposed routinely due to \u201ccriminal negligence\u201d of Hesco staff and management which had a bad impact on industrial growth.  \nBesides, he said, bona fide consumers who were good paymasters were slapped with detection bills. In addition to these issues Hesco had started overbilling to the tune of 30 to 100 units in each bill for industrial and commercial sectors as well as poor consumers every month. According to a safe estimate, industrial and commercial sector consumers would have to bear the burden of billions of electricity units, he said. \nHe said that the situation was leading to serious unrest among business community members.

A serious mental disorder, schizophrenia can cause hallucinations, delusions and disordered behaviour. It requires lifelong treatment.\nNew South Wales police commissioner Karen Webb said it was  \u201cobvious\u201d to her and detectives that the 40-year-old Cauchi had targeted women and avoided men, sparking a media debate about misogyny in Australia.\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese described the gender breakdown among the victims as  \u201cconcerning\u201d and vowed to do more to combat violence against women, citing a toll of one woman dying at the hands of a man they knew every week.\n\u201cBut we will never know what was in the mind of the perpetrator of these acts,\u201d said professor Ian Hickie, co-director of health and policy at the University of Sydney\u2019s Brain and Mind Centre. \u201cOrdinary people are trying to impose a rational explanation,\u201d he said.\n"

Arif / White Star\n\n\u2022 Initial, unconfirmed results indicate ruling party leading on nearly all Punjab seats\n\u2022 Lone Sindh seat goes to PPP; PTI grabs two more seats in KP; PML-N and BNP-M set to bag one seat each in Balochistan\n\u2022 Polling day marred by multiple incidents of violence across country; one killed in Narowal\nISLAMABAD: The ruling PML-N seemed to be in a commanding position after the close of polling, as by-elections were held in 21 constituencies across the country, initial and unofficial results showed on Sunday.\nIn Punjab, the election was held on 12 provincial and two national assembly seats, in Khyber Pakh\u00adtunkhwa, the election was held on four seats, two seats in Balo\u00adchistan, and one National Assembly seat in Sindh was also up for grabs.\nAs per a preliminary count, the PML-N appeared to be leading in all constituencies in Punjab, except Rahim Yar Khan.\nIn Sindh, the PPP candidate was the likely winner whereas in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, PTI-backed candidates were leading on two seats in D.I. Khan and Kohat, with PTI-backed Faisal Amin Khan Gandapur securing victory in NA-44, as per the unofficial result released by the returning officer in D.I. Khan.\nAlthough parts of Punjab and KP saw across-the-board suspension of mobile and internet services and the army was deployed for security purposes along with police and civil armed forces, the by-polls witnessed multiple incidents of violence, leading to the death of a PML-N supporter in a clash outside a Narowal polling station.\nIn Sheikhupura, four people were wounded whereas PML-N and PPP supporters clashed in Rahim Yar Khan.\nPunjab\nThe NA seats on which by-elections took place included NA-119 (Lahore) and NA-132 (Kasur), while the Punjab Assembly seats for which the by-polls took place included PP-22 (Chakwal), PP-32 (Gujrat), PP-36 (Wazirabad), PP-54 (Narowal), PP-93 (Bhakkar), PP-139 (Sheikh\u00adupura), PP-147, PP-149, PP-158, and PP-164 (Lahore), PP-266 (Rahim Yar Khan) and PP-290 (Dera Ghazi Khan).\nIn Punjab, the turnout was low as key leaders stayed away from electioneering. However, the polling exercise was marred by allegations of rigging, with the PTI claiming to be at the receiving end.\nA supposed \u2018confession\u2019 by a presiding officer at a polling station in Lahore was circulated with the claim that he had obtained the signatures of agents before the end of polling, while a video clip supposedly showing irregularities at a Wazirabad polling station also circulated on Sunday.\nThe PTI alleged that the presiding officer for polling station-127 in Lahore\u2019s PP-149 had made polling agents sign the Form-45 before the culmination of the polling and the officer was quoted as \u201cadmitting\u201d the irregularity arguing that \u201che had done so to save time\u201d. PTI-SIC candidate Zeshan Rashid staged a sit-in at the polling station to protest this transgression.\nIn Gujrat, former Punjab chief minister Parvez Elahi\u2019s wife Sumera Elahi alleged that ballot papers were snatched and stuffed into ballot boxes in favour of PML-Q\u2019s Musa Elahi, a nephew of ex-CM Parvez, at the Kathala polling station while the police ignored this practice. PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and opposition leader in the national assembly Omar Ayub Khan along with other party leaders also reached Gujrat to monitor the situation.\nThe Lahore police also arrested former PTI MPA Shabbir Gujjar from the Valencia Town polling station apparently without any charge.\nLikewise, a video clip showed the recovery of dozens of ballot papers purportedly from the presiding officer of a polling station in PP-36 Wazirabad. In Rahim Yar Khan, the PPP workers alleged that PML-N supporters attacked them with batons to push them away from the polling stations where the PPP  candidate was winning.\nThey claimed that a female polling agent of the PPP was also \u201ckidnapped by the ruling party supporters\u201d. By the filing of this report at 11pm, the ruling PML-N was leading all the electoral contests except in Rahim Yar Khan.\nBalochistan\nIn Balochistan, elections were held on PB-22 (Lasbela) and PB-20 (Wadh), whereas re-polling was held in PB-50 (Qila Abdullah) amid some reports of violence.\nAccording to the unofficial result, PML-N\u2019s Nawab\u00adzada Zareen Magsi won from Lasbela with 49,777 votes while independent candidate Shahn\u00adawaz Hassan got 3,869 votes. In Wadh, Mir Jahanzeb Mengal obtained 30,455 votes while Shafiq Mengal got 14,311 votes.\nIn Lasbela, Mir Hassan Jamote who was contesting the by-election on the PPP ticket withdrew from the contest in favour of Zareen Magsi on the directive of President Asif Ali Zardari. Nawabzada Zareen Magsi is son of Mir Aamir Magsi, a leader of PPP Sindh and son-in-law of ex-CM Jam Kamal.\nIn Qila Abdullah, armed men barged into polling stations during the re-polling, prompting a notice from the ECP chief, Sikandar Sultan Raja who asked the police chief to submit a report in this regard. \u201cStrict action should be taken against those who are responsible for entering the polling stations,\u201d he told the Balochistan IGP.\nIn a press conference, Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) leader Abdul Rahim Ziaratwal claimed that armed men entered polling stations and took hostages.\nThe Awami National Party leaders shifted the blame and said the PkMAP was behind this incident. However, the polling continued.\nThe Supreme Court had ordered re-polling in the constituency when the election commission\u2019s decision regarding re-polling in 12 polling stations was challenged. The apex court rejected the decision of the election commission and ordered re-election in the entire constituency.\nEngineer Zamrak Khan Piralizai of the ANP and Mirwais Achakzai of the PkMAP were vying for this seat. On February 8, the former was elected to this seat for the fourth time.\nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa\nIn KP, by-elections were held in NA-8 (Bajaur), NA-44 (D.I. Khan), PK-22 (Bajaur) and PK-91 (Kohat). The situation largely remained peaceful barring minor altercations at some polling stations. Voters and supporters of various candidates complained about sudden changes to some polling stations in Khar and Sadiqabad areas of the Bajaur district.\nWorkers of different political parties, however, said the turnout was lower than expected, while the participation of women voters was even lower. Polling staff at several polling stations for women told Dawn the number of women voters was \u201cvery low\u201d.\nIn NA-8, the competition acc\u00ado\u00adrding to the unofficial initial results, seemed to be between PTI-backed Gul Zafar Khan and the independent candidate Mubarak Zeb Khan, younger brother of the slain PTI leader Rehan Zeb Khan. Mubarak Zeb Khan was reportedly the winner in PK-22 as well.\nThe NA-44 seat became vacant when Faisal Amin\u2019s brother and Chief Minister Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Sardar Ali Amin Khan Gandapur vacated it.\nAccording to unofficial results of all 358 polling stations issued by the Returning Officer, PTI-backed Faisal Amin Khan Gandapur secured 66,332 votes while his runner up candidate Abdur Rasheed Khan Kundi of PPP bagged 21,972 votes.\nThe overall voter turn out remained quite low which was 24.40 per cent.\nSindh\nIn Sindh, PPP\u2019s Khursheed Ahmed Junejo was ahead with 15,932 votes from 65 polling stations according to the unofficial results from NA-196 in Shahdadkot. Mr Junejo bagged 15,932 votes from 65 polling stations out of the total 303 polling stations in Shahdadkot.\nOur correspondents in Bajaur, D.I. Khan and Kohat also contributed to this report\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: In the run-up to the finalisation of the federal budget for 2024-25, the Ministry of Finance has asked all ministries, divisions, departments, and self-governing entities to surrender by May 15 the funds that they think cannot be utilised within the current fiscal year, ending June 30, 2024.\nUnder the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA) of 2019, all entities established or operated with public funds are required to surrender their surplus funds each year by May 31 for the closing of fiscal year books. This surrender of funds serves as the basis for the approval and allocation of funds for the subsequent fiscal year.\nHowever, the Accounting Policies and Procedures Manual (APPM) of the federal government requires that such un-utilised funds or those anticipated to remain un-utilised should be surrendered latest by May 15 each year. Therefore, the finance secretary has instructed all counterparts in other ministries to adhere to the APPM for greater clarity.\nAs a result, the deadline for surrendering unutilised funds has been advanced to May 15, in view of upcoming negotiations with the Inter\u00adnational Monetary Fund (IMF) for a 24th bailout programme. The allocations for both development and non-development expenditures for the next fiscal year will be based on actual expenditures in the current year.\n\nIMF negotiations prompt deadline shift to surrender unused funds\n\nIn an order, the finance ministry has asked all the principal accounting officers \u201cto ensure that all surrender orders are issued and communicated to\u201d the director of budget computerisation latest by May 15 for entry into the central budget software system, SAP. The order applies to all ministries, divisions, their attached departments and subordinate offices, and autonomous organisations as required under Section 12 of the PFMA.\nUnder the financial rules and PFMA 2019, an amount included in the original approved budget is required to be given back to the Ministry of Finance as the custodian of the federal finances \u201cbecause it has not or will not be spent in the financial year by the entity\u201d.\nSection 12 of the PFMA 2019 binds that \u201call ministries, divisions, their atta\u00adched departments, and sub-ordinate offices and autonomous organisations shall surrender to the Finance Divi\u00adsion [by thirty-first day of May each year], all anticipated savings in the grants or assignment accounts, or grant-in-aid controlled by them\u201d.\nIn an exceptional case of exigency, the Finance Division has the power to extend the prescribed time limit before the close of the financial year. The Finance Division is also required, under the section to communicate the acceptance of such surrenders before close of the financial year and where requirement is justified, shall provide for equivalent amount in the next financial year\u2019s budget.\nUnder the APPM, any spending entity required to undertake work or incur expenditure on behalf of another must exercise proper bud\u00adg\u00adetary control over the funds provided by the principal authority.\nIt is mandatory for the entity incurring the expenditure to ensure that the funds provided by the principal entity are not exceeded, the money is spent for the intended purpose, and any anticipated savings are promptly surrendered back to the principal entity. The principal entity is then required to communicate the grant within which expenditure may be incurred to the concerned spending entity and issue the required approval for expenditure to be incurred by a nominated authority in that entity.\nAPPM\u2019s Section 3.3.12.6 binds all such entities to surrender all anticipated savings to the government immediately as they are foreseen, but no later than May 15 each year.\n\u201cSavings from funds provided after May 15 must be surrendered no later than 30 June,\u201d it reads, instructing the principal accounting officers to exercise stringent controls in the spending of all potential or actual savings.\nUnder these rules, no savings could \u201cbe held in reserve for possible future excesses\u201d, and expenditure postponed could not be reallocated to meet new items of expenditure, or expenditure must not be incurred simply because funds may be available within a particular grant. \u201cGrants that cannot be properly utilised must be surrendered,\u201d it said.\nEarlier last year, as required under the PFMA 2019, the government compelled all ministries, divisions, the four provinces, Azad Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan to immediately surrender their working capital and surplus funds kept for investment, and deposit the money into the single treasury account of the federation.\nArticle 78 of the Constitution stipulates that all funds received by or on behalf of the federal government are deposited either as part of the Federal Consolidated Fund (FCF) or the Public Account of the Federation (PAF). The cash balances of both FCF and PAF are mai\u00adntained under central account No.1 (non-food) at the State Bank of Pakistan, while Article 79 requires the custody and payment of moneys from and to the central account to be regulated by an act of parliament.\nThe Public Finance Mana\u00adgement Act (PFMA), passed by the parliament in 2019 at the requirement of lending agencies, now governs all matters related to the FCF and PAF. It requires the operations of the FCF and PAF to vest in the finance division under the overall supervision of the federal government.\nFurthermore, Section 23(2) of the Act also \u201crequires that no authority shall transfer public moneys for investment or deposit from the government account, including the assignment accounts, to any other bank account without prior approval of the federal government\u201d.\nOn top of that, Section 45 of the Act provides overriding effect over all other laws, and any law inconsistent with this Act, while Rule 4(4) of Cash Management and Treasury Single Account Rules 2020 stipulate that no authority shall transfer public money in contravention of sub-section (2) of Section 23.\n"

He will also visit Lahore and Karachi and meet with the provincial leadership.\n\u201cThe two sides will have a wide-ranging agenda to further strengthen Pakistan-Iran ties and enhance cooperation in diverse fields including trade, connectivity, energy, agriculture, and people-to-people contacts,\u201d the Foreign Office said.\n\u201cThey will also discuss regi\u00adonal and global developments and bilateral cooperation to combat the common threat of terrorism,\u201d it said, adding that the two countries enjoy strong bilateral ties anchored in history, culture and religion. \u201cThis visit provides an important opportunity to further strengthen Pakistan-Iran relations,\u201d it said.\nMr Raisi\u2019s visit to Pakistan had been in doubt as Middle East tensions rose after Iran launched an unprecedented missile and drone attack on Israel a week ago in retaliation for an airstrike on the Iranian consular building in Damascus earlier this month. Then, on Friday, central Iran received what was presumed to be an Israeli attack.\nTehran has played down the apparent Israeli attack and indicated it had no plans for retaliation, a response that appeared gauged towards keeping the Gaza war from expan\u00adding to a regionwide conflict.\nPakistan has called on all parties in the Middle East to \u201cexercise utmost restraint and move towards de-escalation\u201d.\nCross-border strikes\nMr Raisi\u2019s visit is also significant as Pakistan and Iran seek to mend ties after tit-for-tat missile strikes in January. The cross-border strikes stoked regional tensions already inflamed by the Gaza war.\nTehran carried out the strikes against an anti-Iran group in Pakistan the same week it targeted Iraq and Syria. Pakistan responded with a raid on \u201cmilitant targets\u201d in  Sistan-Balochistan province.\nBoth countries have accused each other of sheltering militants in the past.\nIran-Pakistan pipeline\nPakistan is also counting on a joint gas project with Iran to solve a long-running power crisis that has sapped its economic growth.\nA $7.5 billion Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline intended to feed Pakistani power plants was inaugurated with great fanfare in March 2013. But the project immediately stagnated following international sanctions on Iran.\nTehran has built its own section of the 1,800-kilometre pipeline, which should eventually link its South Pars gas fields to Nawabshah.\nIn February, the outgoing caretaker government in Pakistan approved the construction of an 80km section of the pipeline, primarily to avoid the payment of billions of dollars in penalties to Iran due to years of delays.\nWashington has warned that Pakistan could face US sanctions, saying it does not support the pipeline going forward.\n"

            "Text": "\u2022 Says bids for flag carrier to come in two to three weeks\n\u2022 Islamabad airport will be next, followed by Karachi, Lahore\nWASHINGTON: Finance Minister Muhammad Aurang\u00adzeb has stated that the process of privatising PIA will be finalised by the end of June or early July, with Islamabad airport potentially following suit shortly after.\n\u201cThe government has no business being in business,\u201d the minister declared at a Saturday afternoon news briefing, explaining the government\u2019s plan to divest from state-owned enterprises (SOEs).\n\u201cWe expect the bids for PIA to come in the next two to three weeks, and by the end of June or early July, we can move it to the investors,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Islamabad airport would be the next,\u201d he added, \u201cfollowed by the airports in Karachi and Lahore.\u201d\nMr Aurangzeb did not respond when asked if Pakistan was also selling its skies to the bidders.\nAirlines pay overflight fees to the governments of each country they fly over on their routes. This covers the use of air traffic control and other navigation services.\nThe minister did not explain if the government would retain some shares in PIA after privatisation or sell all its shares.\nMr Aurangzeb concluded his visit to Washington on Sunday with a busy week of 62 meetings \u2014 explaining decisions, making pledges, and seeking understanding with multilateral and bilateral donors.\nThe finance minister and his team were in Washington this week to attend the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. They also conducted a series of bilateral meetings with visiting finance ministers, heads of financial institutions, and senior US officials.\nHis meeting with US Assistant Secretary of State Donald Lu drew significant attention in Pakistan, as former prime minister Imran Khan accuses Mr Lu of toppling his government. When asked about this particular meeting, Mr Aurangzeb, however, pointed out that visitors do not determine whom they meet; rather, it is the hosts who decide.\nAt his news conference at the Pakistan Embassy, Mr Aurangzeb reiterated his position that Pakistan did not need new prescriptions to fix its economy, stating, \u201cWe need to implement the plans we make.\u201d\nHe highlighted three main planks of his economic strategy: expanding the tax net, implementing energy reforms, and privatising the SOEs.\nThe government, he said, had prepared short, medium, and long-term strategies for expanding the tax net.\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite clear that there\u2019s a gap between policies and implementation,\u201d remarked Mr Aurangzeb when asked why Pakistan has failed to resolve this long-standing issue.\n\u201cFor instance, litigation in the tribunals, manned by the FBR and the law ministry, took forever,\u201d he added.\n\u201cWe have asked them to make decisions in the next three or four months, even if it goes against us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have also shortlisted consultants for end-to-end digitalisation, which would definitely improve tax collection.\u201d\nHe said the government was also expediting the process for identifying people who lived beyond their means, and they would soon be brought under the tax net.\nHe stressed that providing energy \u2014 petrol, gas, electricity \u2014 to both domestic and commercial consumers was necessary for uplifting the economy. \u201cIf we cannot get this right, we cannot increase our exports,\u201d he said.\nMr Aurangzeb said the government was already taking steps to stop leakages and theft of electricity and to move distribution into the private sector. \u201cThe direction is very clear,\u201d he declared.\n"

They added that such teachers were unable to teach in colleges.\nThey said that principals of government degree colleges had also reservations over wrong postings as it caused academic losses to students.\n"

            "Text": "PESHAWAR: The provincial government is likely to remove the existing board of governors of medical teaching institutions (MTIs) this week, according to sources.\n\u201cThe provincial government is expected to identify the existing BoGs of MTIs and announce new ones by Tuesday. The government is facing bureaucratic hurdles in removing boards,\u201d Prof Nausherwan Burki told Dawn.\nHe said that he was waiting for replacement of BoGs by the government but it was delayed due to health department\u2019s laxity to deal with bureaucratic obstacles.\nProf Burki, the architect of Medical Teaching Institutions Reforms Act (MTIRA) passed by the provincial assembly in 2015, said that he was in contact with the government and soon new BoGs would be announced after which he would come to resume work on his unfinished agenda of reforms in health sector.\n\nProf Nausherwan says bureaucratic hurdles delay removal of boards\n\nThe PTI-led coalition government enforced MTIRA in 2015 at Lady Reading Hospital Peshawar and kept it extending to the teaching hospitals and their affiliated medical and dental colleges in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\nSo far, the law has been implemented in 10 medical teaching institutions of the province to grant financial and administrative autonomy to them and free them from the bureaucratic and political control. The law is also meant to improve patient care at hospitals and develop medical education in the province.\nInitially, government officers were made members of BoGs along with private individuals but later on only private members ran the respective MTIs. As per law, BoGs have powers to receive one-line budget from the provincial government and spend the same in accordance with their needs. These boards are authorised to demolish any post, create new one and re-designate positions due to which the provincial bureaucrats has lost their control over MTIs and only BoGs run the show.\nKeeping in view the vast powers enjoyed by BoGs, the caretaker government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa first tried to do away with MTIRA and revive the old system and give control of the MTI-covered hospitals and colleges back to health department.\nHowever, the caretakers were informed by legal experts that the law could be reversed only through provincial assembly, which had passed it. Subsequently, the provincial cabinet in March last year removed the BoGs and appointed new ones. These BoGs are still in place in the teaching hospitals of the province.\nSources said that health department was facing pressure from the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf to replace the boards. They said that health department was not able to remove the current BoGs of medical teaching institutions appointed by caretakers but issued two warnings to them to stay away from taking major decisions.\nHowever, these directives of the health department have fallen on deaf ears as lately BoGs of MTIs Abbottabad and Bannu have made major decisions in violation of the orders.\n\u201cSuch situation is the source of embarrassment for those, who initiated the reform process. Therefore, we want to appoint our own BoGs and resume work,\u201d a senior PTI leader told this scribe.\nHe said that there was no point in delaying the replacement of boards as PTI had vast majority in the assembly and there was virtually no opposition.\nHe said that Prof Nausherwan Burki would likely assume the roles of MTI-Policy Board chief and chairman of BoG of LRH while some other people, who remained part of the PTI-era BoGs, would be selected again.\n\u201cWe have also complained to PTI\u2019s founder Imran Khan in jail to issue directives to Ali Amin Khan Gandapur, the chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, to replace the BoGs. We are not sure if Imran Khan has issued directives to CM or not,\u201d said the PTI leader.\n"

He added that in that petition, the court granted interim relief to them and directed that the petitioners should be called for interviews at their own cost and risk.\nHe argued that the inclusion of the petitioners in the interview turned out to be eyewash as persons having lesser qualification than they were appointed as Class-IV employees.\nHe contended that the appointment of the four respondents by the department was pre-planned and for benefitting them the list of candidates provided to the department was changed by the employment exchange.\nThe director general of mines and minerals opposed the contention of the petitioners and stated that they were called for interview in accordance with the order of the court.\nIn his comments, he said that the interviews were conducted by a departmental selection committee, which selected the most suitable candidates for the posts.\n"

The teenage singer has recently has launched a Pashto album titled \u2018a tribute to Ustad Khial Mohammad\u2019 that received an overwhelming response of more than 40 million people for his velvety voice.\n\u201cThe Afghan duo - Suhrab Latif and Subhan Latif -- sang oldies of the livening legend Khial Mohammad and broke record of Pashto music chart,\u201d said Dr Rashid Ahmad Khan, the director of Angaaze Music Production at Bacha Khan Trust.\nSubhan Latif recently performed at musical concert under the auspices of Angaaze Music Production (AMUP) where senior musicians, folk singers and local artists turned up. The event was organised with an objective to pay a tribute to ghazal maestro Khial Mohammad and also adore his classic Pashto music.\n\nSubhan Latif wants to launch YouTube channel and get foreign scholarship\n\nMessage of peace and tolerance could be transmitted through musical diversity in a befitting manner as music had no boundary and it was an effective weapon to counter hatred in all its manifestations, said the rising vocalist. However, he sought financial assistance for trumpeting the cause of Pashto music.\nNazir Latif, the father of Subhan Latif, told this scribe that music had been in their veins for more than 200 years as he hailed from a classic Afghan music family and trained his two teenage sons Suhrab Latif and Subhan Latif in classical melodies.\nThe two brothers were in 7th grade in a Kabul school during the regime change but continued education with a private tutor alongside music training. They have learnt playing tabla, harmonium and basics of music including classical and modern music. The rising rock star belonged to fourth generation of renowned Ustad Nabi Gul associated with King Zahir Shah during 50s and 60s.\n\u201cI can sing Persian, Pashto, Urdu and English numbers but lack modern digital gadgets like laptop, smart phone, home studio and several other accessories. If get a foreign scholarship, I and my brother will conduct research on comparative study of classical and modern Afghan Pashto music,\u201d said Subhan Latif.\nHe said that Ustad Khial Mohammad had always been his ideal because he had influenced several generations of folk artists and even set trends in light ghazal and folk singing. Subhan Latif has recently attracted millions of audience on social media following release of his album.\n\u201cAtif Aslam, Haroon Bacha, Justin Beiber and Gul Panra are my favourite singers. I wish we could do an album with rock star Nehal Naseem and do some Urdu remixes. I can play guitar, keyboard and almost all the traditional instruments. I feel more at ease with harmonium as I love Mehdi Hasan, Ghulam Ali and Shah Wali Afghan, who left an indelible mark on my mind,\u201d said the artist.\nAbout his future plans, he said that he and his brother planned their own YouTube channel \u2018Aahang-i-Afghan\u2019 through which diverse musical trends would be introduced provided they could get financial support.\n\u201cI want to launch YouTube channel, grab a foreign scholarship and get the relevant digital paraphernalia. Presently our family members live at a rented house in Peshawar feeling safer,\u201d he said.\n"

Recognising its historical value, we felt the urgent need for its conservation,\u201d Swat-based cultural activist Usman Ulasyar told Dawn.\nHe appreciated the initiative to conserve the mosque.\nAmjad Ali, a cultural activist in Swat, said protecting the past meant protecting one\u2019s identity, and the heritage sites, including the oldest mosque in the region, were the identity of early Muslims here.\n\nHighlight significance of Mahmood Ghaznavi Mosque\n\n\u201cPreserving Swat\u2019s cultural heritage is not just about protecting buildings. It\u2019s about safeguarding our identity, stories, and roots for future generations,\u201d he said.\nCultural activists said Swat had a rich archeological and heritage history, with hundreds of sites still existing in different areas.\n\u201cOur heritage is a testament to the rich tapestry of our history and civilisations that have flourished here. By conserving it, we honour our past and pave the way for a more enlightened future,\u201d said local heritage preservation advocate Ali Shah.\nDr Abdul Samad, the director of archaeology and museum in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, highlighted the significance of the Sultan Mahmood Ghaznavi Mosque in Udigram and said it was one of the oldest mosques in northern Pakistan, dating back to 1044 AD.\nHe said the ongoing conservation and preservation efforts were led by the Directorate of Archaeology and Museums and supported by the World Bank through the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Integrated Tourism Development Project.\n\u201cThe Mehmood Ghaznavi Mosque in Udigram is a venerable monument in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, tracing its roots to 1044 AD. It holds immense historical and scenic value as an archaeological gem in the Swat Valley. The provincial government is committed to promoting religious tourism in KP and undertaking various conservation projects across the province,\u201d he said.\nHe said those efforts not only focused on Buddhist, Hindu, and Sikh heritage sites but also covered four historical mosques, Pishmal, Kalam Mosque, Udigram Mosque, and Masjid Mohabat Khan Mosque in Peshawar.\nArcheologists said the Mehmood Ghaznavi Mosque was built in the former Hindu royal capital of Udigram shortly after the defeat. Dating back to 1048\u201349 CE, the mosque was built on an early artificial terrace with remains of Gandharan masonry. It has a splendid design of old Muslim architecture.\nThey said the most striking aspects of the mosque were traces of 30-foot-high walls, a graveyard, common rooms, student rooms, and a water mill.\nThe residential area to the west of the mosque was already abandoned and was being used as a cemetery by the end of the 12th century. The mosque is about three kilometres from Udigram town on the main Barikot-Mingora Road in Swat. It was built with stones during the Ghaznavid period.\nThe mosque is an essential landmark in the archaeological treasure of Swat, dating back to the period of Mahmud or his grandson Mawdud (1041\u20131050 AD). In 1984, an inscription in Arabic engraved on a block of marble was found by chance on the hill\u2019s northern slope that rises above the mosque.\nThe mosque is named after Sultan Mahmood Ghaznavi, who is believed to have brought Islam to Swat in the 11th century. Historians said the mosque was proof of the advent of Islam in Swat and was a significant historical and archaeological site in the country.\n"

            "Text": "\u2022 Faculty members say rector was appointed on temporary basis and supposed to run day-to-day affairs only\n\u2022 University official says changes to statute were made by senate, not by rector\nISLAMABAD: Comsats University Islamabad (CUI), which has been functioning under an interim arrangement, is embroiled in an alleged controversy as a clause of its statute was recently changed by the university syndicate headed by the rector who is working on a look-after basis.\nIn July last year, following the acceptance of the resignation of rector Dr Mohammad T. Afzal, chancellor of the university, the then president Dr Arif Alvi, gave the look-after charge to senior Dean Prof Dr Sajid Qamar till the appointment of a regular rector.\nMoreover, offices of the registrar, treasurer and controller are also being run under the interim arrangement while the position of pro-rector was never filled.\nMeanwhile, a group of faculty members have leveled allegations of favoritism against the rector.\nTalking to Dawn, they claimed that the look-after rector had been making blatant violations of rules and ignoring merit.\nRequesting not to be named, they said Dr Sajid Qamar in order to accommodate his blue-eyed faculty members last month made changes to the statute regarding appointment of heads of departments.\nAs per the existing rules, a head of department (HOD) is appointed from amongst three senior professors and as many associate professors. The faculty members said the syndicate last month changed the rule and increased the number to 10 senior most professors out of whom one would be picked as the HOD.\nIn other universities, the senior most faculty member is appointed as the HOD. At CUI, the clause was already questionable under which the HOD would be appointed from amongst three professors and three associate professors.\n\u201cThis has been done to accommodate the rector\u2019s chosen ones,\u201d they alleged.\nThe group said Prof Qamar was supposed to deal with day-to-day affairs only, alleging that making an amendment to the rules was beyond his mandate.\nTo support their claim, the faculty members cited Establishment Division\u2019s letter dated April 9, 2021, regarding look-after charge. They added that the university senate was the competent authority to give financial and administrative powers to anyone and in case of a look-after rector, he was appointed by the chancellor.\nThe faculty members also alleged that Prof Waqas Masood was appointed the head of the Physics Department on June 18, 2021 for a period of three years, but was replaced by a junior professor in violation of rules by the rector last year.\nThey said when the matter reached Islamabad High Court, the rector had to reverse the appointment. But instead of appointing a senior professor, he picked an associate professor in February this year as the new head (though as per rules the appointment of an associate professor as the HOD is legitimate).\nThe faculty members also alleged that CUI in violation of rules allowed the transfer of a student of the Department of Computer Science at the Wah campus to the same department at the Islamabad campus. They also alleged that there had been two harassment cases against a faculty member, who was close to the look-after rector. The cases were supposed to be decided by the university\u2019s harassment committee which was formed in 2023 for a two-year term, but all of a sudden the convener and a member of the committee were removed last month.\nThey alleged that the rector had been using a PhD student to teach courses originally assigned to him (rector) in bachelor\u2019s course of Physics. \u201cStudents filed a complaint against this violation of their rights with the HOD on Jan 13, 2024. Despite several reminders, their complaint has not been taken up,\u201d they added.\nComsat Institute became Comsats University in 2018 under an Act which has not yet been fully implemented.\nRegistrar Prof Dr Sajjad A. Madani is running the office for the last over five years on a temporary basis whereas treasurer Mohammad Azam was appointed in 2018 for three years when Comsats was an institute, but he is still dealing with finances of the university.\nOfficial version of Comsats\nGeneral Manager of Rector Secretariat Naveed Ahmed Khan rejected all allegations of the group and said the incumbent rector took all decisions in accordance with rules and regulations and had full authority to run the affairs of the university like previous interim rector.\n\u201cHe [rector] has authority to chair meeting of syndicate and take decisions in interest of the university,\u201d he said and added that the syndicate, not the rector, approved changes to the statute related to appointment of HODs subject to approval of the university senate.\nHe said shifting of a student from Wah to Islamabad was legal and a routine matter.\nTo a query, he said in the past a selection committee had recommended approval to the appointment of the current registrar for three-year term, but the senate did not approve the same because of an issue, which was later settled down.\nMeanwhile, the registrar completed the three years and now his case will be referred to the senate to decide whether he should continue or fresh advertisement should be floated, he said.\nHe said a regular rector would be hired soon as a search committee was going to start interviews from Monday.\n\u201cThe treasurer was appointed in 2017 when it was Comsats Institute and the treasurer\u2019s position was in grade OG-IV and the Act says no person will be lowered in rank after passing of the Act from parliament.\u201d He added that the convener and a member of the harassment committee were changed because of a delay on their part in finalising inquiries.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Environment Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) has called for a public hearing in the coming week, inviting possible public concerns on degradation of the environment from the planned construction of a 132KV grid station and its feeding transmission line at the Cabinet Division Housing Society.\nThe public hearing, which is scheduled to be held on April 25, would allow residents to share their concerns about the physical, ecological, socio-economic and cultural environment of the construction of the grid station and deliberate on mitigation measures to minimise environmental degradation.\nPak-EPA said it would be concerned with soil-related issues such as land clearing, soil contamination from fuel, oil or chemical spillage and leakage, inappropriate waste disposal, and excavation, filling and construction activities.\nThe environment protection agency said the noise and vibration would be generated by construction machinery and vehicles, besides contamination of groundwater from waste and sewage disposal, maintenance of equipment and machinery and campsite sanitation facilities.\nThe watchdog was more concerned with the loss of green cover \u2014 indigenous vegetation \u2014 and the clearing of undergrowth species such as bushes, grass, etc.\nAmong the socio-economic impacts of the construction of the grid station on the free-of-cost 32-kanal land were eye and respiratory diseases from routine exposure of construction workers to dust and exhaust emissions on the project site.\nPak-EPA maintained that the overall impact assessment, more especially the nature and magnitude of the residual environmental impacts identified during the environment impact assessment (EIA), the 132KV grid station, and its 132KV feeding transmission line were likely to cause environmental impacts mainly during its construction phase. Pak-EPA emphasised that the environmental impacts could be mitigated provided the proposed activities were carried out as mentioned in the EIA report.\nSome of the mitigation measures suggested in the report were: minimising soil erosion; construction of temporary walls bordering the construction area to contain debris and soil; septic tanks and soakage pits with adequate capacity; collecting waste oils; and separating recyclable waste.\nThe report also recommended restoring natural vegetation loss, besides a ban on blasting and nighttime construction work and minimising illumination at night.\nIt also recommended a 15-kilometre speed limit for vehicles at the construction site.\nPak-EPA also recommended thorough health screening and training of construction workers, especially to monitor eye and respiratory diseases.\nIn the last month, Pak-EPA has held two public hearings for feedback from residents on the health and environmental impacts of the construction of the Garden Residence project in Sector F-10. The other public hearing was on infrastructure development works for sub-sector G-15/3.\n"

            "Text": "\n\nA visitor looks at fabrics on display at the exhibition in Islamabad. \u2014 Photo by Tanveer Shahzad\n\n \nISLAMABAD: Lovehandmade.co hosted \u2018The Maker\u2019s Muse\u2019, a craft exhibition showcasing exquisite artisanship from Sindh. \nLovehandmade.co is a distinct social enterprise founded in 2020 as a response to economic fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic on female home-based workers (FHBWs).\nLovehandmade.co has worked with approximately a hundred artisans in hard-to-reach areas, nurturing their talents and capabilities, and imparting both soft and hard skills essential for personal and professional growth.\nFounded by Zein Ahmed, who has been tirelessly championing the rights of home-based workers, using her platform and expertise to advocate for fair wages, safe working conditions and economic opportunities, Lovehandmade.co exhibited beautiful, handcrafted products.\nIt has collaborated with the Light-F project, funded by the Japan International Cooperative Agency (JICA) and the Women Development Department of the Sindh government to uplift and fortify female home-based workers in rural Sindh. \nThe Graduation Model by Light-F aims to facilitate the gradual transition of home-based workers to sustainable livelihoods by focusing on three key areas of intervention \u2013 life management capacity development, financial access promotion and income generation support. \nZein Ahmed said: \u201cAt Lovehandmade.co, we believe economic empowerment is just one thread in the tapestry of a woman\u2019s potential. By providing skills, resources and a platform, we empower artisans to not just survive, but thrive. \nTheir journey of growth transforms not only their lives, but their families and communities, creating a ripple effect of positive change.\u201d \nOn display were exquisite Ajrak products \u2013 kurtis, pouches, masks, kitchen sets, chaddars, scarves \u2013 using natural dyes and combining traditional skills and patterns with innovations in motifs and placements. The Ajrak serves as a symbol of cultural richness and Sindhi heritage.\nPit loom scarves, shawls and towels, used a technique that traces back centuries, where the loom is set in a pit on the ground, ensuring utmost precision in every weave. The products reflected a blend of age-old craftsmanship and contemporary style. \nThe most expansive collection was that of exquisite Ralli blankets, using various techniques such as patchwork, barcode, evil eye, Rang Diamond, J Ralli with borders, et cetera. Each stitch told vibrant tales of Sindh craftsmanship, weaving a symphony of tradition and allure. \nDulais, an age-old favourite in summer coverings, had some lovely motifs and were stuffed with 100pc pure cotton, as was the tradition. Also crafted were some Amigurumi key chains, with small, stuffed elephants. \nSpeaking on the occasion, British High Commissioner Jane Marriott said: \u201cI absolutely adore the Lovehandmade range. Stylish and smart, and helping empower Pakistan\u2019s female rural artisans. I\u2019m also pleased that the UK could support the early phases of this start up. People from London to Islamabad have stopped me to ask where my Lovehandmade tote bag is from.\u201d\nMyriam Chaudron said: \u201cToday we were lucky enough to visit a beautiful exhibition organised by Zein, a particularly generous and gifted woman who gives a lot of her time to empower poor Pakistani women through handicrafts.\u201d\nShe said this exhibition of multicoloured Pakistani handicrafts was a testament to the beautiful traditions of Sindh and the incredible talent and resilience of the women artisans. \n\u201cThe work of these women, which came into being thanks to Zein, not only preserves cultural heritage but also uplifts entire families, offering them sustainable livelihoods and brighter futures. By supporting this exhibition, we not only acquire beautiful crafts but also contribute to a positive cycle of empowerment and economic growth,\u201d she added.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: While every year 600,000 children die in the emergency room (ER) across the country, the number can be reduced by 50 per cent by pumping just a nominal amount of money (Rs2,000 per child) to improve the emergency response.\nChildLife Foundation Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Dr Ahsan Rabbani made these remarks in a conversation with Dawn.\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that the number of children who die in the ER is more than the number of deaths due to cancer and a number of other lethal diseases in Pakistan. We can reduce the deaths of children in ER by pumping a nominal amount in ER,\u201d he said.\nWhile sharing the details, he said: \u201cThe foundation gets 60 per cent funding from the government and arranges 40pc remaining amount from philanthropists. We have been working across the country and providing treatment to children up to 14 years of age at ERs. We don\u2019t leave those children after providing treatment at the ER, then children are sent to the ward for observation. Once we believe that children are out of danger, we suggest their parents shift them to some other/public sector hospital so that some other deserving children would be adjusted to those beds. However, a majority of them don\u2019t need further hospitalisation.\u201d\n\u201cWe have been mostly operating in the premises of public sector hospitals as the federal and provincial government have given us premises to support them in the noble cause of saving lives,\u201d Dr Rabbani said while he was at the Children\u2019s Emergency Room at Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims). He said that the new children\u2019s emergency room at Pims managed by ChildLife Foundation, has successfully treated 200,000 children, since its establishment in August 2022.\n\u201cThis milestone marks a significant achievement in combating child mortality rates in Pakistan, with the survival rate of critically ill children notably on the rise. Pakistan faces a critical issue as almost 2,000 children succumb to various illnesses daily, making it imperative to address the high mortality rates among children in the country. Recognising this challenge, the foundation has implemented a solution-focused approach, emphasising the importance of enhancing emergency care to effectively reduce child mortality rates by 50pc,\u201d he said.\nIt is worth mentioning that operating under a public-private partnership with the government, the foundation revitalised the children\u2019s emergency room at Pims in August 2022.\nDr Rabbani said one of the key highlights of the newly revamped emergency room was its pharmacy, which maintained a 45-day stock of essential medicines, including life-saving drugs.\n\u201cThis strategic measure ensures that critical medications are readily available at all times, further enhancing the emergency response capabilities of the facility. \nThe foundation\u2019s impact extends far beyond Pims, with a scalable and cost-effective model operating in 313 hospitals nationwide, including emergency rooms and telemedicine satellite centres. \nServing over 10,000 children every month in ER at Pims, from various regions, including Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Punjab, KP, Gilgit-Baltistan, and AJK,\u201d he said.\nAccording to the website of the foundation, infectious diseases and preventable conditions claim the lives of hundreds of children in low-income countries. According to Unicef, Pakistan has an under-five mortality rate (U5MR) of 74 deaths/1,000 live births. \nThe leading causes of death among children under the age of five are preterm birth complications, pneumonia, diarrhoea, birth asphyxia, and malaria and most of these deaths can be prevented by simple, low-cost interventions. \nAs many as 92,000 children die of pneumonia every year in Pakistan, the illness accounts for 16pc of total child deaths in the country.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: Raw food exports continued to expand in March, with a 16.35 per cent increase to $685.03 million, up from $588.76m in the same month last year, forcing local consumers to pay higher prices across the country. \nWith this upward trend, raw food exports have climbed for the eighth consecutive month this fiscal year, despite the country\u2019s highest food inflation in history, according to data compiled by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics. \nThe commerce ministry lifted the ban on onion exports following Eidul Fitr, despite the fact that the average onion price per kg is more than Rs200. Demand for Pakistani onions has increased as a result of the Indian government\u2019s ban on onion exports to protect the interests of domestic consumers. \nThese unchecked exports drove food inflation to a stunning 16.6pc in March as prices rose, limiting cash-starved people\u2019s access to key goods such as wheat flour, rice, onions, sugar, meat, and vegetables.\n\nNon-textile exports up 10.87pc in eight months\n\nThe new fiscal year began with a negative growth of 7.56pc in the export of raw food products, but it improved to positive growth of 4.07pc in August, while export proceeds grew further by 60.89pc in September, 59.90pc in October, 60.65pc in November, 111.63pc in December, 105.29pc in January, and 35pc in February. \nAnalysts say the surge in food exports can be attributed to the unprecedented rupee depreciation. In addition, persistent disruptions in the supply chain and higher prices in the international market have led to soaring demand for food products. \nThe overall exports of raw food products and non-textile value-added products witnessed a growth of 22.4pc in the first nine months of the current fiscal year to $10.49 billion, up from $8.57bn over the corresponding months of last year.\nThe PBS data showed the country\u2019s rice exports rose by 83.37pc in July-March FY24 led by basmati rice, which had been falling since last year. India\u2019s decision to impose a ban on rice exports to protect the interest of domestic consumers has emerged as a key driver behind the surge in basmati rice exports from Pakistan. \nThe export of basmati rice experienced a notable surge of 36.37pc, reaching $622.34m in July-March FY24 from $456.36m in the corresponding period last year. \nThe export of non-basmati rice rose by 102.15pc to $2.31bn in July-March 2023-24 from $1.14m in the same period last year. \nDue to a sustained surge in export figures over the past two years, the average price of basmati rice has surged to Rs400 per kg from Rs150, restricting buying from domestic consumers.\nPakistan exported $386.93m worth of meat in 9MFY24, up from $301.72m over the same period last year, showing a growth of 28.14pc. The reason for the increase in meat exports is the introduction of new markets like Jordan, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and other Gulf nations, Malaysia, and Uzbekistan. \nFurthermore, one meat exporting company was granted market access for heat-treated meat shipments to China. \nPrices of meat in the domestic market have experienced an unparalleled surge in recent years. In two and a half years, the average price of buffalo meat has jumped from Rs700 per kg to Rs1,300. This increase has caught the attention of market observers and stakeholders alike. The price of chicken has also experienced an unprecedented surge, reaching its highest level over the last two years.\nThe export of all other food products saw an increase of 21.21pc to $876.65m in 9MFY24 from $723.55m in the corresponding months last year. The export of vegetables reached $336.28m against $235.51m over, an increase of 42.79pc. \nFruits\u2019 exports saw a growth of 17.34pc to $265.65m in 8MFY24 against $226.38m over the corresponding months last year.\nOn the other hand, Pakistan imported 691,192 tonnes of wheat in March, up 110.42pc from 328,453 tonnes over the corresponding month last year. The country began importing wheat in September 2023 despite the government\u2019s claims of having a bumper wheat crop.\nIn nine months, the import bill of tea reached $495.22m this year, up 13.86pc from $434.94m over the same period last year.\nNon-textile value-added products\nThe export of engineering goods saw an increase of 10.87pc in 8MFY24 from a year ago. The export of these commodities revived in March, while a few other commodities also saw an increase.\nIn 9MFY24, the export of footwear dropped 11.30pc and leather garments by 7.21pc year-on-year in July-March FY24. The decline was also observed in leather gloves. The exports of raw leather also decreased by 20.55pc during the period under review.\nThe export of surgical instruments also saw a decline of 1.36pc during the months under review. The export of carpets and rugs declined by 21.16pc in 9MFY24. The export of sports goods also declined 6.03pc. The export of gur products (which are not classified under the food category) saw an increase of 19.69pc in 9MFY24 from a year ago.\nThe export of jewellery surged by 22.74pc in 9MFY24, followed by a 4.75pc rise in the export of electric fans. However, the export of gems declined by 7.96pc, furniture 37pc, and handicrafts 68.37pc. Contrary to a slump in FY23, the cement exports jumped 32.51pc in 9MFY24.\n"

The jump was attributed to a $30 per ounce rise in international gold rate to $2,412.\nMohammad Arshad, the Chairman of All Pakistan Jewellers Manufacturers Association (APJMA), said gold markets had been wearing a deserted look after Eidul Fitr despite the start of the marriage season as prices   have gone beyond the reach of most buyers.\nHe said the high gold rate is forcing more and more people towards silver and artificial jewellery, whose prices are also crawling up due to soaring demand.\n\u201cOur workers in the gold jewellery manufacturing units are worried about the dearth of new orders as customers are reluctant to visit shops due to prohibitive prices,\u201d he said.\nQasim Shikarpuri, Chairman of Karachi Bullion Exchange (KBE), said the rates issued by ASSJA were not realistic and the actual sale/purchase of the yellow metal is between Rs242,000 and Rs243,000 per tola instead of Rs252,200.\nHe said a similar situation existed in the country\u2019s north where customers are being charged rates which are lower than ASSJA rates.\n\u201cWe are making efforts to work out realistic rates from the KBE platform. These prices can be applied all over the country,\u201d he said.\nOn Jan 1, the 10 gram and one tola rates were Rs188,357 and Rs219,700, respectively, based on the world market rate of $2,082 per ounce.\nThis means the 10 gram and one tola rates have risen by Rs27,864 and Rs32,500, respectively, since the start of the new year.\nNo change in the rupee-dollar parity has been seen during this period.\nAccording to data compiled by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, the country\u2019s gold import during 9MFY24 plunged to 262kg ($17 million) from 384kg  ($23.4m) in the same period of the last fiscal.\n"

            "Text": "BEIJING: Russia remained China\u2019s top oil supplier in March, data showed on Saturday, as refiners snapped up stranded Sokol shipments. \nChina\u2019s imports from Russia, including supplies via pipelines and sea-borne shipments, jumped 12.5 per cent on the year to 10.81 million tonnes, or 2.55 million barrels per day (bpd) last month, according to data from the General Administration of Customs. \nThat was quite close to the previous monthly record of 2.56m bpd in June 2023. Seven Russian tankers under sanctions offloaded Sokol cargoes in Chinese ports in March, as Russia worked to clear a glut of stranded supply in the wake of tightened US sanctions. More than 10m barrels of the oil supplied by Sakhalin-1, a unit of Rosneft, had been floating in storage over the past three months amid payment difficulties and sanctions on shipping firms and vessels carrying the crude. \nStockpiling of Russian crude for storage in strategic reserves by state-owned CNOOC also boosted imports from Russia. Data from consultancy Kpler forecast sea-borne shipments from Russia hitting a record high of 1.82m bpd, including 440,000 bpd of Sokol and 967,000 of ESPO. \nRussia was China\u2019s top supplier throughout 2023, shipping 2.14m bpd despite Western sanctions and a price cap following the Kremlin\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. In coordination with other Opec+ members, Russia opted to roll forward a voluntary reduction in crude oil output of 300,000 bpd into the first quarter of the year to support energy prices. \nImports from Saudi Arabia, previously China\u2019s largest supplier, totalled 6.3m tonnes in March, or 1.48m bpd, down 29.3pc on the same period last year. Riyadh has said it would extend its voluntary cut of 1m bpd through the end of June, leaving its output at around 9m bpd.\nThe world\u2019s top exporter kept the March official selling price of its flagship Arab Light to Asia at $1.50 over the Oman/Dubai average as the kingdom sought to secure market share. \nJanuary-March imports from Malaysia, a trans-shipment point for sanctioned cargoes from Iran and Venezuela, soared 39.2pc on the year to 13.7m tonnes, or 3.23m bpd.\n"

It was lifted after a series of negotiations between officials of both sides. Earlier, in December 2006, Russia also stopped the import of rice from Pakistan for not meeting food safety standards.\n"

There has never been such a bad situation. The decision to import wheat is wrong,\u201d PPP Punjab Senior Vice President Rana Farooq Saeed and Information Secretary Shahzad Saeed Cheema told a press conference here on Saturday.   \nRana Farooq said that in 2008, the PPP government had given a wheat support price of Rs900 to farmers and left the wheat stock of four years in 2013. He said wheat was being bought in the three provinces and only the farmers of Punjab were being abused.  \nHe said Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz should stop this cruelty and save the farmers, otherwise they would not sow wheat in the future.  He said despite cotton cultivation, the government support price had not been set.\n\u201cAt least Rs11,000 per bale rate should be set. The TCP should buy all the cotton produced in the country and import should be banned,\u201d he said.   \nThe PPP leader also urged President Asif Ali Zardari to take notice of this situation. They said the corn crop had broken the farmer\u2019s back. \u201cMills, traders and investors have lost their confidence. Give subsidy on green tubewells and electricity.\u201d   \nThe PPP said the Punjab government had not bought a grain of wheat in the market till now.  Shahzad Cheema said the investor was buying wheat at Rs2,900. The government should not make a policy of importing wheat and start exporting it, he added. \n"

            "Text": "LAHORE: A mesmerising musical evening featuring classical French guitarist Thibault Cauvin was organised by the French Cultural Centre at the Alhamra Art Centre, The Mall, on Saturday.  \nThibault Cauvin, the most awarded classical guitarists of the world, who is also cultural ambassador of Bordeaux, came all the way from France to perform here in Pakistan. Though the renowned guitarist has performed in over 120 countries, it was his first performance in Pakistan.\nThe Hall 2 of Alhamra had a fairly good audience, including Lahore Arts Council Board of Governors\u2019 Chairman Razi Ahmed.\nCauvin spellbound the audience by playing different music pieces on the guitar, including South American, Brazilian and French, he had composed while travelling around the world.  \nThe guitarist also did a fusion piece with two Pakistani instrumentalists -- Muhammad Hassan Pappu, who played the flute and Kashif Ali Dani on the Tabla.\nThe composition they performed together under the title, \u2018Lahore\u2019, will also be included in Cauvin\u2019s new album to be released in Paris soon. \nSpeaking on the occasion, French Cultural Centre Director Fabrice Disdier said he was thankful to the Lahore Arts Council and its chairman for organising this event. He also specially thanked Deputy Commissioner Rafia Haider who extended help in organising the concert.  \nThrowing light on the musical journey of the celebrated guitarist, Mr Disdier said Cauvin was born into a family of musicians in Bordeaux, France, and by the age of 20 he had won 36 international prizes, including 13 first prizes. \nHe is from the generation of the most accomplished classical guitarists. In the past 20 years, the guitarist has given more than 1,500 performances in more than 120 countries.\nHe said Cauvin has released more than 10 albums. In his latest album, he revisits the works of the towering German composer of late Baroque period, Johan Sebastian Bach.\nCauvin has performed on different prestigious stages, including New York\u2019s Carnegie Hall, Moscow\u2019s Tchaikovsky Hall and London\u2019s Queen Elizabeth Hall.\n"

            "Text": "LAHORE: The agriculture is again facing hard times as farming community is experiencing a double jeopardy; on the one hand, cost of production has doubled since 2023 and, on the other, commodity prices of major crops (wheat, cotton and maize) have slid by 25 per cent on an average basis.\nKhalid Mahmood Khokhar, president of Pakistan Kissan Ittehad (PKI), said this here on Saturday, issuing SOS (save our souls) calls for the sector. Cumulatively, both these factors have rendered farming business totally unviable.\nDuring 2023, he says, farmers paid a huge amount of Rs300 billion (over and above to the MRPs, prescribed by the fertiliser industry) to the market exploiters on account of black marketing of urea. Despite continuous hue and cry by the farmers, the government failed to implement its writ and ensure availability of urea on prescribed rates. Despite these failures, farmers put in their best to ensure national food security by increasing area under wheat and per acre productivity, thus ensuring total national production of over 29 million tonnes \u2013 a record high production.\nKeeping in view all these \u2018adversaries\u2019, farmers were expecting relief from the government through an increase in the support price of wheat \u2013 minimum of Rs4,000 per 40kg. However, instead of addressing the farmers\u2019 agony, the government took a surprising step of importing huge quantities of wheat just ahead of the harvest, which caused a crash in wheat price in market from Rs3,900 to Rs3,000 per 40kg. Secondly, the government delivered another unprecedented blow to the farmers by increasing gas prices, causing an increase of urea price by around Rs1,000 per bag. This step shows policymakers have used the black-marketing tool as an opportunity by assuming that growers may absorb this hike in urea price, he says.  \n\nPKI demands cut in urea price, expeditious wheat procurement\n\nThe current situation does not reveal a viable preposition for the farming business. The grievances of the farmers are piling up with the passage of every cropping season. If not addressed timely, this may pose a serious challenge to the national food security and economic prosperity of the country. Cotton contributes more than 60pc to the total national exports and is under serious threat as farmers are not able to invest to cultivate cotton in the current cropping season.\nKhokhar recommends that the federal and provincial governments immediately start buying two million tonnes of wheat at the declared rate to help stabilise the market. Punjab contributes more than 75pc to the national wheat production.\nThe federal government should intervene to ensure urea at maximum rate of Rs4,000 per bag across the country instead of current market price of around Rs5,000 per bag.\nTo avoid foreseeable protests by the farmers, Pakistan Kissan Ittehad urges provincial and federal governments to take immediate actions to address the genuine issues of current wheat support price and availability of urea at affordable price throughout the country.  \nKhokhar says the urea pricing issue has been pending since long with the federal government and now hurting farmers beyond redemption.\n"

            "Text": "With the defeat of the armies of the Lahore Darbar in 1849, the East India Company (EIC) took over in March of that year. In the Shahi Hammam inside Delhi Gate they set up their first court. Their three priorities were firstly, security, then agriculture, and then education.  \nThis piece concentrates on just how they tackled education in Lahore, and the Punjab. The EIC and colonial British rulers were not geared for education. But their traditional British education was then, and still largely remains, dependent on Christian missionaries. But first a few words about pre-EIC rule and education.\nFamed educationalist, Dr G.W. Leitner, in his amazing research titled \u201cHistory of Indigenous Education in the Punjab\u201d, tells us of the Punjab having lost about a third of its native educational capacity, from 330,000 pupil or student places, before 1857, to about 190,000, in 1880. The basic education of girls and women was also apparently surprisingly catered for, with 18 formal schools for girls in Lahore alone. Cunningham\u2019s \u2018History of the Sikhs\u2019 claim that women had a better basic education then men.  \nThe reason for this was that Maharaja Ranjit Singh loved to receive letters. To communicate one had to send him a letter. Thus, he made it compulsory for everyone to be able to write a letter, leading to a policy where \u2018every village in the Punjab, through the tehsildar, had an ample supply of the Punjabi \u2018Qaida\u2019, which was compulsory for females\u2019. Thus, almost every Punjabi woman was literate in the sense that she could read and write the \u2018Lunde\u2019 form of Gurmukhi.\nCome the British and the Punjabi-educated elite virtually disappeared, largely because of attempts to introduce English to the elite and Urdu for the masses.  \nProf. Leitner wrote: \u201cAs a result of British actions, \u2018the true education of the Punjab was crippled, checked and nearly destroyed.\u2019\u201d\nIn such circumstances the very first English-medium school in the whole of the northern sub-continent was set up by two American missionaries named Charles William Forman and John Newton on Dec 19, 1849 as Lahore Mission School. It was the first English-medium school in northern India at the time of its establishment, and the first classes of the school were started under a tree with three students.  \nThe EIC informed the priests that Punjabi was not to be taught, a stricture they initially ignored.\nVery soon the number of students grew to seven and as the classes expanded under the tree, the two Americans just could not stand the heat of the sun. In 1850 with record heat of the EIC soldiers then quartered in the Lahore Fort, almost 10 per cent of them died of heat stroke and malaria. Newton returned to recover in America, while Forman decided to live in the tomb of Nusrat Khan in Mughalpura.\nThe school was later shifted to Haveli Rang Mahal in 1852, in a huge mansion previously owned by Saadullah Khan, a wazir of Emperor Shah Jahan. It was officially acquired by the mission to establish a school, named the Rang Mahal Mission School.\nThis very first English-medium school of Lahore, and the Punjab, started off under the administration of the Presbyterian Education Trust. Forman decided that only good scientific education would be of use, and he ordered $600 worth of scientific equipment. So Rang Mahal School had the Punjab\u2019s finest scientific laboratory.\nBy 1854 the school had become famous and with its amazing science laboratory it had 200 students. Along with mathematics all students had to study the Bible. In the spirit of fairness, the Rang Mahal School got printed the very first Punjabi dictionary. This was to meet the linguistic needs of the local population.\nIn those day the Company clerks from Delhi and Bengal had not yet asserted their Urdu influence. The missionaries also translated a lot of European books into Hindi, Urdu and Persian. In 1864 the American missionaries set up the Forman Christian College (FCC) at the Rang Mahal school building, but then shifted it to Napier Road in 1889, and then to its current location alongside the Lahore Canal in 1940.\nParallel to this missionary effort the British rulers decided that it was best that the finest British government educational institutions be tapped to set up in Lahore. Towards that end they advertised for a scholar to set up Lahore\u2019s Government College, and in 1864 Prof G.W. Leitner, an outstanding linguist was selected from Kings College London to: \u2018educate Indian students to serve the colonial administration in important positions\u2019.\nThe Government College was set up in 1864 in the Haveli of Dhian Singh inside the walled city of Lahore. In 1873 it shifted to the \u2018kothi\u2019 of Rahim Khan. In 1876 it moved to its present building, which was built next to the Ranjit Singh \u2018horse coach\u2019 building that today is known as the college\u2019s gymnasium. Prof. G.W. Leitner was the first principal.  \nSo, we see that the American Presbyterian missionaries of the USA launched the very first English-medium school of Lahore, as also of the Punjab as also of the whole of northern sub-continent. These missionaries went on to set up the very first English-language college, which they still manage.\nThe British rulers believed that a much more neutral college was needed, and so Prof G.W. Leitner set off founding not only the Government College of Lahore, but also the Oriental College and then in 1882 the Punjab University. He was the university\u2019s first registrar.\nA year later a school named the Central Model School was opened, initially in Anarkali, but later a building to one side of the Central Training College became the present school in 1891. Parallel to this government effort, another Catholic school, the St. Anthony\u2019s High School, was set up in 1892 by the Capuchin Friars from Belgium whose patron saint was St. Anthony of Padua. It started with three students on Empress Road where Don Bosco is today. In 1900 it shifted to its present Lawrence Road site. In 1978 it was handed over to the Irish Marist Fathers.\nProf. Leitner was able to achieve his reforms largely because he was considered an outsider, for he was a white European of Hungarian origin. He was able to speak 50 languages, and while travelling through Muslim countries he named himself as \u2018Abdur Rashid Sayyah\u2019. He learnt the Quran by heart and wrote three books on Islam which are considered masterpieces.  \nAt this point let me narrate an incident in which this column suggested that \u2018Katchery Road\u2019 be rename Leitner Road, for on both sides of the road are his creations, they are the GC Lahore, the Oriental College, and the Punjab University.  \nIn the Punjab Assembly Rana Sanaullah opposed the suggestion claiming he has nothing to do with Islam. This columnist retorted that Britain\u2019s first mosque \u2013 the Woking Mosque \u2013 was built by Prof. Leitner, and our column suggested that he should read the scholarly book \u2018History of Islam\u2019 by Leitner. The Rana went silent. One hopes he has read those amazing books.  \nSo, while the pioneering first English-language school at Rang Mahal, and its off-shoot the Forman Christian College, stuck to its English medium way of education, the Government College Lahore under Leitner concentrated on languages and literature, and later in sciences, it reflected the days to come.\nLeitner believed the best learning comes about if local languages and its culture are central to all educational efforts. He said: \u201cWe must raise the spirit of self-reliance among the Natives\u201d. This the British rulers did not like who were bent on eradicating the Punjabi language. That effort the colonial-trained bureaucrats of a free Pakistan continue to follow.  \nFrom the first English-language school set up by American missionaries in the year that the Sikh rule ended in 1849 to today 175 years later we have more \u2018madressah\u2019 schools teaching Arabic as given in the Quran. There is not a single local language school. Women are discouraged from reading any \u2018Qaida\u2019. The original Mission School of Rang Mahal now run by the government, has only 10 teachers and a handful of students. The tragedy is clear.\n"

            "Text": "SAHIWAL: Rang Shah police killed a man in an encounter who was allegedly involved in the triple murder of an old woman and her two sons in Abadi Bagi Bahri, Chak Shafi. \nReports said villagers spotted a house that was locked and noticed a stinking smell on March 29. Rang Shah police broke into the house and found three bodies. Someone had slaughtered a woman and her two sons with a sharp knife and locked the house from the outside. At that time, the IG took notice of the incident and directed the Sahiwal RPO and Pakpattan DPO to arrest the suspect.  \nPolice had announced a reward for providing any clue on social media.  \nRang Shah police claimed that on a tip-off they raided a village 59/SP. On seeing the police, three men started firing which continued for 30 minutes. Later, police found a body which was identified as of Irfan Odah, a resident of Kasur.  \nPolice claimed Irfan\u2019s other two accomplices managed their escape.  \nThose, who were allegedly killed by Irfan include Sardara Bibi (62) and her two sons Rafaqat (35) and Liaquat (42). \narrested: Harappa police arrested a man for allegedly harassing, torturing and physically abusing his ex-wife after a video of the incident went viral on Friday.  \nReports said suspect Zeeshan (30) pressured his ex-wife to quit her paramedic profession and maintain contact with him.  \nZeeshan was charged under FIR 406/24, registered under sections 354, 506, and 341 of Pakistan Penal Code based on a complaint filed by Ayesha Bibi.\nAyesha, a resident of Madina Town in Harappa, had married Zeeshan of Village 10/1-L, a few years back. The marriage resulted in the birth of their daughter.  \nAyesha worked as a nurse in a private hospital to support herself. Owing to sour relations, Ayesha opted for divorce (khula) from Zeeshan.  \nFollowing the divorce, she assumed responsibility for caring for her elderly mother and son, as her father had passed away. She stated that her ex-husband had repeatedly stopped her on her way to workplace and threatened her with physical harm over the phone. She claimed that he sought to seize her father\u2019s property in Madina Town.\nOn Friday, as Ayesha was en route to work, Zeeshan started beating her with bamboo and sticks.

We can still have some fun even if we are starting from P18.\u201d\nSainz is the only driver apart from Verstappen to win a Grand Prix in 2024 and he survived a huge scare in Q2.\nThe Spaniard ran wide at the final bend and span across the start-finish straight to lose his nose cone in the barriers.\nIt brought out the red flags but Sainz was able to limp back to the pits and make it to the top 10 shootout.\n\u201cI had a big moment there, touching the gravel,\u201d Sainz said.  \u201cFrom then on, a tough quali. I just don\u2019t think we have been very quick this weekend. It\u2019s a difficult track for us.\u201d\nHuge crowds turned out to see Shanghai native Zhou Guanyu, China\u2019s first Formula One driver, on the first Chinese Grand Prix weekend since 2019.\nThe fans had plenty to cheer Friday when Zhou propelled his Sauber into the top 10 in a wet sprint qualifying but he narrowly missed out on scoring a sprint point by finishing ninth.\nZhou failed to make it out of Q1, to groans from the packed grandstands, and will start 16th on the grid.\n"

            "Text": "RAWALPINDI: Shaheen Shah Afridi seemed to be back to his devastating best. Mohammad Amir, bowling in his first international match after three and a half years, looked as if he\u2019d never been away. Newcomer Abrar Ahmed added zip and guile to the spin bowling department. Ahead of the Twenty20 World Cup, Pakistan\u2019s bowling attack looked complete and New Zealand had no answer.\nPakistan\u2019s pacers and spinners turned up the style to lead their side to victory over New Zealand in the second Twenty20 International at the Pindi Cricket Stadium on Saturday.\nIn front of a partisan crowd, fast bowlers Shaheen (3-13), Amir (2-13) and Naseem Shah (1-27) picked up six wickets among them while spinners Abrar (2-15) and Shadab Khan (2-15) equally shared four wickets as Pakistan shot down a New Zealand side missing several first-team regulars for 90 in 18.2 overs after skipper Babar Azam had elected to field.\nPakistan, though, didn\u2019t cruise towards the paltry target, losing three wickets before Mohammad Rizwan (45 not out) and Irfan Khan Niazi (18 not out) carried them past New Zealand with 7.5 overs to spare. Rizwan, who hit the winning boundary over square leg, smashed a six and four fours in his 33-ball knock while Irfan\u2019s run-a-ball effort featured a six and a four.\nUnlike the rain-hit first game where New Zealand saw Tim Robinson bowled by Shaheen on the second and last ball, the visitors negotiated the first two overs without any damage.\nBut Shaheen made the breakthrough soon after with Shadab diving to his right at backward point to pouch Tim Seifert (12).\nAmir, who has come back into the side after taking back his international retirement, then enjoyed a stunning return with just the second delivery he bowled, a slower one deceiving Robinson (four) who gave Iftikhar Ahmed an easy catch at short cover.\nAnother change in pace gave Amir his second wicket, Dean Foxcroft (13) departing after holing to Babar at mid-off, having hit a six off the pacer two balls earlier; New Zealand ending the powerplay at 35-3.\nAbrar broke the spine of New Zealand\u2019s batting lineup with two wickets in the first over he bowled. First, he had Mark Chapman, who made 19 with three boundaries, caught at deep square leg and then had James Neesham caught at short mid-wicket two deliveries later.\nShadab then accounted for Michael Bracewell, the New Zealand skipper undone by a quicker one to leave the tourists at 59-6. The Black Caps resisted further losses for a brief period but Shaheen returned to clean up Cole McConchie (15) with a searing yorker and Ish Sodhi\u2019s attempt to go big saw him fall lbw to Shadab soon after. \nNaseem got his only wicket when Ben Sears found Babar at mid-off and Shaheen ended New Zealand\u2019s innings with another sizzling yorker that hit Ben Lister\u2019s off-stump.\nLister gave New Zealand some hope when he removed Pakistan opener Saim Ayub (four) with a brilliant, diving return catch early on. \nAfter a tentative start, Rizwan and Babar opened their arms in the fourth over as Sears was smacked for a six and four by the former and a boundary by the Pakistan skipper. \nIn the next over, Rizwan and Babar added a four each of Bracewell but the spinner hit back against his Pakistan counterpart, getting him stumped for 14 as the hosts finished the powerplay at 48-2.\nUsman Khan, another newcomer to the side ahead of the World Cup in the United States and West Indies, made seven before he dragged a Sodhi delivery onto his stumps.\nBut Rizwan and Irfan, who was one of three debutants for Pakistan alongside Usman and Abrar in the last game, ensured there was no further damage.\nSCOREBOARD\nNEW ZEALAND:\nT.

However, another attacker was identified as Sohail Ahmed, a resident of Panjgur, who had reportedly joined the outlawed Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) in 2021. The sources said the law enforcers were focusing on \u2018facilitators\u2019 of the killed militants.\nInspector Abid Farooq of the Bomb Disposal Squad, who had examined the blast site and submitted a report to authorities, told Dawn when the bomber blew himself up, a Suzuki van carrying freshly baked bread came in the middle of the road and absorbed most of the impact of the blast.\nHe said that bomber was wearing a suicide jacket containing around four to five kilogrammes of explosives. It contained a significant number of small metal balls of ball bearings but much of the metal balls hit the lower portion of the van.\nHe said the young driver of van remained safe while the vehicle was damaged.\nAll five foreigners traveling in the Hiace remained safe, but their private security guard Noor Mohammed suffered injuries and died during treatment at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre.\nThe deceased, father of a child, belonged to Sanghar district where his coffin was taken for burial.\nAlthough the bomber\u2019s accomplice, Sohail Ahmed, resorted to indiscriminate firing after taking shelter in cement blocks and gravel lying there on the road, none of the three victims suffered bullet wounds.\nPolice Surgeon Summaiya Syed said that the security guard died due to the shrapnel wounds to his skull.\nSimilarly, the two other injured people Langar Khan, 40, and Salman, 25, suffered bomb shrapnel injuries on different parts of their bodies.\nThe police surgeon said that Langar Khan was discharged after treatment from the JPMC while Salman, who worked at Port Qasim Authority, was taken to Aga Khan University Hospital for further treatment by his employers. Dr Summaiya Syed said both injured persons were stable.\n"

            "Text": "KARACHI: Reverend Father Melito Dias, the oldest priest in Pakistan, who had passed away peacefully at the Holy Family Hospital on Thursday at the age of 97, was laid to rest at the Christian Cemetery here on Saturday.\nThe priest\u2019s funeral at the St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral, led by the Archbishop of Karachi Benny Mario Travas, was attended by Cardinal Joseph Coutts, priests, nuns, his family, religious friends and a large number of people whose lives he touched throughout his 69 years of priestly ministry. During this while he also served in the educational institutions of the Archdiocese of Karachi with important posts and responsibilities.\nBorn in Karachi on February 27, 1927 to Maria Amata and Joseph Edward Dias, he was the fifth among nine children. From an early age his mother had a great influence on his religious upbringing as she was very close to the church and Catholic teachings. His father worked abroad for a UK-based cable and wireless company in Bahrain.\nRev Fr Melito was educated at the St Patrick\u2019s High School in Karachi and was a star of the school\u2019s hockey team. He was also a regular church-goer, never missing the first mass on a daily basis.\nIn 1946, Fr Melito left for the Papal Seminary at Kandy in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) as this part of the world did not have its own seminary at that time. In Kandy, he not only proved to be a good student but also won the hearts of his teachers and fellow students by his dedication to studies and sports.\nHe was ordained on August 24, 1954 at Kandy by Bishop Glennie, an American Jesuit who later became the Bishop of Trincomalee, Ceylon.\nHe returned to Karachi, which by then was part of a new nation \u2014 Pakistan. He came back without a passport as he had left when all areas of the Subcontinent were part of India. His first posting was at the Minor Seminary at Quetta where Rev Fr Joseph Cordeiro was the Rector and was also assigned to St Francis\u2019 Grammar School where he coached the boys in hockey.\nHe then went on to serve the people of Karachi in various parishes. He also served the parish of St Joseph\u2019s, Larkana and was instrumental in the faith formation of many in the area. \nBesides his priestly duties, Fr Melito was also a fine educationist and served many Catholic schools in Karachi such as St Patrick\u2019s, St Paul\u2019s and St Lawrence\u2019s in various capacities. Needless to say, he carried out all his duties with distinction and was known for his kindness, compassion, understanding, friendly nature and humbleness. He also possessed a great sense of subtle humour.\nLately, Fr Melito had been in-and-out of the hospital. He came back to the presbytery in February where he celebrated his 97th birthday in a simple yet joyous atmosphere where he fully enjoyed himself.\n"

Police took almost five hours to change the original account of the incident in order to save the political leader who owned the Vego, they said.\nThey said that police had in fact tried to cover up the case by lodging the case against the seven suspects, who were produced in a Shikarpur antiterrorism court on Saturday.\nJacobabad police officials said that the seven suspects identified as Zakir Bhayo, Akhtiar Lashari, Nabeel Ahmed Bhayo, Taufique Ahmed Gujjar, ASI Imtiaz Ali Bhayo, constables Sanaullah Manganhar and Baqaullah Unnar were booked under relevant sections of Anti-Terrorism Act on a complaint lodged by SHO Ishtiaq Pathan at Mauladad police station.\nThey said that the ATC judge had granted physical remand of the suspects in police custody for five days.\nAccording to the police\u2019s press release, Jacobabad police with the help intelligence agencies intercepted the vehicle and the police mobile van and recovered one G-3 rifle with 17 magazines and one submachine gun with three magazines and 2,350 bullets of different calibers. The seven suspects were trafficking the arms, said the release.\n"

            "Text": "HYDERABAD: The day-long \u2018Sindh National Conference \u2013 Threats and Challenges\u2019 organised by the Sindh United Party (SUP) in a local hotel on Saturday adopted a set of resolutions calling for changing the policies that were weakening provinces\u2019 bond with the federation and depriving Sindh of its rights and resources. It apprehended that Sindh\u2019s remaining resources would also be taken away gradually if the policies continued to be pursued.  \nLeaders of a host of political and nationalist parties, as well as eminent analysts, economists, agriculture experts and civil society activists, expressed their views at the conference. They included Qaumi Awami Tehreek President Ayaz Latif Palijo, Awami Tehreek President Lal Jarwar, Grand Democratic Alliance Secretary General Safdar Abbasi, Jeay Sindh Mahaz-Riaz Chairman Riaz Chandio, Sindh Taraqqi-pasand Party\u2019s Hyder Shahani, Awami Jamhoori Party\u2019s Lal Shah, Jeay Sindh Qaumi Mahaz Chairman Aslam Khairpuri, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl\u2019s Taj Mohammad Nahiyoon, Pakistan Muslim League-Functional\u2019s Rafiq Magsi, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf\u2019s Nazish Fatima, Prof Majeed Chandio, Zain Daudpota, Naseer Memon and Prof Mushtaq Mirani.\nThe resolutions adopted by the conference called for sovereignty for federating units in line with the 1940 Resolution; reviewing [the decision of setting up] the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC); handing over of the lands, previously given to federal government and not now in its use, to Sindh; shelving of all water projects and new canal projects connected with Indus; implementation of Article 172 of the Constitution to allow provinces to manage their [respective] natural resources; reviewing the Article 15 and 23 of the Constitution which allow settling of people anywhere in the country and repatriation of those settled after 1954; a transparent investigation into rigging in the Feb 8 general elections and punishment to responsible politicians; and revamping of Sindh police, judiciary and administrative units to ensure rule of law.\nPresiding over the conference, SUP President Syed Zain Shah observed that the Feb 8 general elections had thrown new challenges to Sindh. There had been people, though a few, who had always been raising the \u2018national question\u2019 ever since inception of the country but, unfortunately, there was none in 2022 when Sindh government decided to hand over its authority to federal government, he remarked. He noted with concern that the Sindh Assembly had surrendered its authority by accepting SIFC, which was empowered to take decisions on certain provincial matters without seeking permission from provinces.\n\nParticipants oppose all projects detrimental to Sindh\u2019s interests\n\nHe claimed that all cantonments had become commercial entities. He alleged that \u201cestablishment controls elections to bring selected people and parties [to power]\u201d. He also claimed that there was evidence that people were told to join PPP, MQM-P or PML-N.\nGDA secretary general Safdar Abbasi agreed with a speaker, academic Inam Sheikh, that PPP had established a vicious circle and Sindh\u2019s institutions had been destroyed. In the last 15 years, no qualitative change could be seen, he said. He pointed out that Asif Ali Zardari was not a neutral head of state because he still headed the Pakistan Peoples Party-Parliamentarians.\nAT chief Lal Jarwar said problems were being created for Sindhi people, who now ought to organise themselves. He deplored that Sindh\u2019s lands had been doled out for corporate farming. The PPP government took decisions that undermined Sindh\u2019s interests like the passage of maritime law.\nQAT President Ayaz Palijo said Sindhi society needed self-introspection. He noted that people of Kandhkot-Kashmore, Shikarpur and Ghotki districts were fighting for survival. He claimed that the PPP was supported by federation, establishment and judiciary. \u201cPPP is ready to hand over everything for powers,\u201d he remarked.\nJSM-R chairman Riaz Chandio said Sindh was heading to a point where it would lose its existence. He said Sindh\u2019s resources were being usurped and its lands occupied in the name of projects bound to convert Sindhis into a minority within their own province. Karachi\u2019s population figures showed that future results would put Sindhis into a minority permanently and this was being facilitated by PPP, he added.\nSindh Abadgar Board (SAB) president Mahmood Nawaz Shah told the participants that people should think over whether the 18th Constitutional Amendment benefited Sindh in terms of agriculture sector, which was a 100pc devolved subject. In so many areas, there is no need for resources. This sector has rescued economy in difficult times like [Covid-19] pandemic. \nIn his concluding remarks, Syed Zain Shah said he foresaw an international agenda behind the Feb 8 general election results which had made Pakistan a laughing stock in the world. \nHe said the Indus River System Authority had failed to implement the 1991 Water Accord, and observed that the proposed amendment to the Irsa Act had become a challenge to Sindh. He apprehended that in the next 20 years, more lands would be given to the SIFC although it was a provincial subject. He deplored that Sindh\u2019s collective ownership was being snatched, and feared that no voice would be raised in the Sindh Assembly against these \u201cdangerous plans\u201d which would, rather, be approved in a phased manner.\n"

The caretaker government was formed in August 2023 when Mr Shah had left the office of the CM. He resumed the same responsibility again following after his election as the leader of the house in March this year.\nA press statement issued from the CM House said that the BoR had a target of Rs55.218bn tax collection during the current financial year and the nine-month target came to Rs41.414bn against which it recovered 33.57 per cent, or Rs13.901bn, showing a shortfall of Rs27.514bn.\n\nMurad dissatisfied with performance of two organisations; asks to improve recovery collection\n\nSimilarly, the excise department also could not meet its target of Rs107.455bn showing a shortfall of Rs19.977bn as it collected Rs87.487bn during the financial year 2023-24.\nThe overall performance of the two tax collection arms during the past three years has been unsatisfactory as it continued to fail in achieving its recovery targets.\nWhile government official claimed that the recovery targets of the BoR and excise department were not achieved due to abolishment and devolution of some taxes to the local government, insiders said that the rampant corruption and leakage in the revenue collection system in the two tax collection arms of the provincial government were the main cause of shortfall in revenue collection.\nThe press statement said that the meeting was told that the BoR during the last three years \u2014 2020-21 to 2022-23 \u2014 was given a revenue recovery target of Rs100.640bn against which it could recover Rs48.526bn, showing a shortfall of Rs52.114bn.\nThe CM directed the BoR to propose revival of abolished taxes and improve e-stamping regime so that recoveries could be improved.\nExcise Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon, Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah, Senior Member BoR Baqaullah Unar, Finance Secretary Fayaz Jatoi and others attended the meeting.\nPresiding over the meeting of the excise and taxation department, the chief minister found there was a shortfall of Rs19.77bn in their revenue recoveries during the nine months of the current financial year 2023-24.\nHe expressed his disappointment and directed the excise department to focus on improving their recoveries. He also advised them to explore new taxation regimes, improve the old tax rates, and concentrate on professional tax and provincial excise.\nThe taxes and fees included Professional Tax, Provincial Excise Duty, Motor Vehicles Tax, Cotton Fee, Infrastructure Cess, Entertainment Duty, and others. \nIt is worth mentioning that the property tax has been devolved to local councils.\n"

The administration urges both chambers of the Congress to quickly send this supplemental funding package to the president\u2019s desk.\u201d\nSome hardline Republicans have voiced strong opposition to further Ukraine aid, with some arguing the US can ill afford it given its rising $34 trillion national debt.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the perfect legislation, it\u2019s not the legislation that we would write if Republicans were in charge of both the House, the Senate, and the White House,\u201d Johnson told reporters on Friday.\nRepresentative Bob Good, chair of the hardline House Freedom Caucus, told reporters on Friday that the bills represent a \u201cslide down into the abyss of greater fiscal crisis\u201d.\n"

A woman stroked a dead boy\u2019s forehead as planes rumbled overhead.\n\n10 killed in West Bank attack; Erdogan urges Palestinian unity after meeting Hamas chief\n\n\u201cPeople were sleeping peacefully,\u201d said neighbour Abu Mohammed Ziyadah.\n\u201cAs you can see, there were no militants, not even male adults, except for the head of the family. They were all women and children.\u201d\nThe Israeli army killed 10 Palestinians in an ongoing raid around Nur Shams, a refugee camp in the north of the occupied West Bank.\nJournalists heard gunshots and saw houses hit by blasts as Israeli drones flew overhead and armoured vehicles moved through the camp.\nThe Israeli army said that over more than 40 hours it had eliminated 10 fighters and made eight arrests around Nur Shams. It said eight soldiers and a police officer were wounded.\nThe Palestinian health ministry said it had confirmed 11 wounded in the Israeli raid, seven of them \u201cwounded by live gunshots\u201d. It said a paramedic shot while trying to get to the wounded was among them.\nErdogan-Haniyeh meeting\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan urged Palestinians to unite amid Israel\u2019s war in Gaza following hours-long talks with Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh in Istanbul on Saturday, his office said.\nErdogan said Palestinian unity was \u201cvital\u201d following the talks at the Dolmabahce palace on the banks of the Bosphorus strait, which Turkish media reports said lasted more than two and a half hours.\n\u201cThe strongest response to Israel and the path to victory lie in unity and integrity,\u201d Erdogan said, according to a Turkish presidency statement.\nAs fears of a wider regional war grow, Erdogan said recent events between Iran and Israel should not allow Israel to \u201cgain ground and that it is important to act in a way that keeps attention on Gaza\u201d.\nWith Qatar saying it will reassess its role as a mediator between Hamas and Israel, Erdogan sent Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan to Doha on Wednesday in a new sign that he wants a role.\n\u201cEven if only I, Tayyip Erdogan, remain, I will continue as long as God gives me my life, to defend the Palestinian struggle and to be the voice of the oppressed Palestinian people,\u201d the president said on Wednesday when he announced Haniyeh\u2019s visit.\nFidan on Saturday held talks with visiting Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, with both men emphasising the need to deliver more humanitarian aid to devastated Gaza where the threat of famine looms.\nTurkey is one of Gaza\u2019s main humanitarian aid partners, sending 45,000 tonnes of supplies and medicine in the region.\nLast year, Erdogan likened the tactics of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to those of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and called Israel a \u201cterrorist state\u201d because of its offensive against Hamas after the group\u2019s October 7 attacks on Israel.\n"

Furthermore, any individuals or entities with ownership, directly or indirectly, of 50 per cent or more by the designated persons are also subject to these sanctions. \nThese measures prohibit transactions involving any property or interests in property of designated or blocked persons unless authorised by the Office of Foreign Assets Control or exempt. This includes contributions and provision of funds, goods, or services to or from any blocked person.\nMoreover, the entry of designated individuals into the United States has been suspended under Presidential Proclamation 8693.\nThe US government explained that \u201cthe integrity of these sanctions lies not only in the ability to designate and add persons to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List, but also in the willingness to remove persons from the list in accordance with the law\u201d.\nFollowing the sanctions, FO spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch issued a statement, saying: \u201cWe reject political use of export controls. It is well known that the same jurisdictions, which claim strict adherence to non-proliferation controls, have waived off licensing requirements for advanced military technologies for some countries.\u201d\nShe added that \u201csuch discriminatory approaches and double standards\u201d undermine the credibility of non-proliferation regimes and also the objectives of regional and global peace and security by \u201caccentuating military asymmetries\u201d.\nMs Baloch said that such listings of commercial entities took place in the past as well on allegations of links to Pakistan\u2019s ballistic missile programme \u201cwithout sharing any evidence whatsoever\u201d.\nWashington alleged that it had sanctioned Minsk Wheel Tractor Plant for supplying special vehicle chassis used as launch support equipment for ballistic missiles.\nXi\u2019an Longde Technology Development Company Limited, the US claimed, supplied equipment including a filament winding machine. The winding machine is said to be essential for producing rocket motor cases.\nTianjin Creative Source International Trade Co Ltd is accused of providing stir welding equipment and a linear accelerator system, technologies assessed by the United States as pivotal in manufacturing propellant tanks and inspecting solid rocket motors, respectively. These items were suspected by US to be intended for Pakistan\u2019s Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco), which develops and produces MTCR Category I ballistic missiles.\nGranpect Company Limited is alleged to have supplied to both Suparco and NDC testing equipment for large diameter rocket motors, which are crucial for the missile development process.\nThe spokesperson said Pakistan was ready to discuss end-use and end-user verification mechanisms so that legitimate commercial users were not hurt by the \u201cdiscriminatory application\u201d of export controls.\n\u2018Carrot & stick policy\u2019\nShuja Nawaz, a fellow at the South Asia Center of the Atlantic Council in Washington, told Dawn that \u201cthe nub of US sanctions on four entities allegedly supplying missile technology to Pakistan is captured in its stated aim: the ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behaviour.\u201d But he also noted that the sanctions directly punished Pakistan for pursuing the development of missiles.\nMr Nawaz suggested that Pakistani authorities should also \u201cask themselves who inside Pakistan provided the information to American authorities?\u201d\n"

We will start getting into granularity of the programme by mid-May,\u201d he added.\nAddressing journalists at the Pakistan Embassy, Mr Aurangzeb expressed the hope that the IMF\u2019s board of governors would convene to consider the last tranche of the current programme by the end of this month, with the final installment released shortly thereafter.\n \n \n\nPakistan is seeking a $6-8 billion new loan package from the end. In earlier statements, he said Pakistan would prefer a long-term, preferably a three-year programme.\n\nAura\u00adngzeb says debts can be repaid only after CPEC-II\n\nBut when asked at Satur\u00adday\u2019s briefing, Mr Aurangzeb said he would not speculate the size or the duration of the programme yet.\nSecond phase of CPEC\nEarlier, Mr Aurangzeb informed a Chinese television audience that Pakistan can repay its debt to China only after completing the second phase of CPEC.\nThe minister\u2019s candid remarks followed discussions with key financial institutions like the IMF and World Bank, alongside senior US  officials in Washington this week.\nExplaining his stance on this sensitive issue, Mr Aurangzeb said: \u201cCPEC was a champion project for Pakistan, and a lot of infrastructure was created during its first phase. Now, what\u2019s supposed to happen was for us to go into CPEC Phase 2, which was and remains the way we monetise that infrastructure because  that\u2019s where the special economic zones come in.\u201d\nThe minister elabora\u00adt\u00ad\u00aded that through these special economic zones, Pak\u00adi\u00ad\u00ad\u00ads\u00adtan was to attract further Chinese investment.\nEmphasising the necessity of completing this process, the  minister stated: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of discussion about how you are going to  repay the debt, that\u2019s how it was supposed to happen.\u201d\nHe expressed gratitude to the Chinese government and banks for their assistance in debt servicing, noting, \u201cBut ultimately, these debts have to be paid. And that\u2019s only going to be there when we get phase 2  going in real earnestness.\u201d\nIn an earlier meeting with Chinese Finance Minister Lan Fo\u2019an in  Washington, Mr Aurang\u00adzeb commended China\u2019s invaluable contribution to  Pakistan\u2019s development through initiatives like CPEC.\nHe discussed Phase-I\u2019s focus on infrastructure-building and  Phase-II\u2019s emphasis on special economic zones and relocation of Chinese private-owned companies, as per a statement issued by his office.\nMr Aurangzeb expres\u00adsed gratitude for Chinese support,  particularly its SAFE deposits. He informed his Chinese counterpart about Pakistan\u2019s broader IMF programme and its interest in accessing the Chinese bond market with a Panda Bond.\n \n \n\nOn Saturday, the finance minister met representatives from S&P Global and Fitch Ratings, sharing the country\u2019s positive indicators under the IMF\u2019s SBA.\nHe also highlighted the ongoing reforms in taxation, energy, and privatisation across short-, medium-, and long-term horizons.\nAdditionally, the minister discussed the alignment of the World Bank\u2019s agenda with government priorities, including climate change and digitalisation.\nHe mentioned potential Saudi investments and addressed concerns from rating agencies regarding the external side, inflation,  primary balance, and interest rates.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: In his second letter to the top judge, former prime minister Imran Khan has urged Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa to take notice of the \u201cexcesses\u201d of the state and ensure the supremacy of the Constitution. \nThe PTI founder, who is incarcerated in Adiala Jail, listed several issues that, according to him, required the CJP\u2019s intervention. These include the letter of the high court judges claiming meddling by intelligence officials in the judicial affairs, the May 9 cases against PTI supporters, a face-off bet\u00adween the army and police officials in Bahawalnagar, non-allocation of reserved seats to the PTI, the Toshakhana case against ex-PM Nawaz Sharif, and the rigging allegations levelled by the former Rawalpindi commissioner, Liaquat Chatha.\n\u201cInaction on your part and that of the Supreme Court in the face of each of the aforementioned matters of grave importance would exacerbate the constitutional crisis the country is already faced with and push it closer and closer to the abyss,\u201d the letter stated.\nThis was the second letter by Imran Khan to CJP Isa since November last year. In his previous letter, he requested the top judge to protect the party\u2019s fundamental rights. CJP Qazi Faez Isa, in response, through a press release from his office stated that he would \u201cneither be pressurised nor favour anyone\u201d.\nIn the fresh letter, Mr Khan said the \u201cnew lows to which the state of the rule of law and supremacy of the Constitution has fallen in Pakistan have caused the gradual emergence of the law of the jungle and the enactment of the primitive doctrine that might is right\u201d.\n\u201cI have no doubt that if our Superior Judiciary, with your good-self at its helm, would not meaningfully intervene as the custodian of the Constitution and the ultimate arbiter of justice, and if the foregoing situation were to prevail, it would be fatal to any civilised order in the world,\u201d Mr Khan feared.\nAbout the May 9 cases, Mr Khan claimed that \u201cthe State, however, is acting as judge, jury and executioner in all these trials; first, directly through military courts, on the constitutionality of which the Supreme Court has been dragging its feet for longer than it should, and, secondly, in an indirect manner, by holding guns to the heads of the subordinate court judges who are conducting the trials.\u201d\n\u201cAs, what I believe to be the majority of our populace, faces the wrath of the State, now is the time for you to prove whether your declared belief in the principles and values espoused by Pakistan\u2019s founding fathers, and your proclamation of the supremacy of the Constitution, are for real or were mere hollow rhetoric,\u201d Mr Khan said.\nHe also reminded the CJP about the reference filed against him in the Supreme Judicial Council. \n\u201cWhen, a few years ago, you [CJP] were faced with the wrath of the State in the form of a reference in the Supreme Judicial Council, you waxed eloquent on various forums about how your late father was a close associate of Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, and how the two historic figures espoused the same principles and values.  Similarly, last year, while speaking in the joint sitting of parliament\u2026you held the Constitution in your hand in full public view, and proclaimed that this book was your guiding light after the Holy Quran and the Sunnah of the Holy Prophet (PBUH),\u201d he stated.\nHe ended the letter with a quote from scientist Albert Einstein: \u201cThe world is a dangerous place, not because of those who do evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.\u201d\nBushra Bibi\u2019s medical\nIn a related development, Bushra Bibi\u2019s medical was held at Shifa International Hospital Islamabad. \nThe PTI alleged that the former first lady was \u2018poisoned\u2019 as shown by the check-up.\nA representative of the hospital, however, said that it \u201cdoes not share\u201d information about patients because of privacy concerns.\n"

            "Text": "Ninety per cent of Gandhara sites in the country are located in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.\nThe soon-to-be-introduced \u201cGandhara Corridor Bill 2024\u201d in the NA is seen as a blatant attempt to capture KP\u2019s resources. The province is rich in natural and historic resources, with hydroelectric power, mines and minerals, and tourism ranking highly in generating income for the province.\nThough KP has repeatedly been urging the centre to release its royalty on net hydel profit and natural gas royalty, amounting to billions in unpaid dues, the latest assault on its resources comes from the aforementioned bill set to be tabled in the National Assembly.\nThe bill is craftily designed to appropriate remnants of KP\u2019s Gandhara Civilisation and divert the profits from KP\u2019s Buddhist religious tourism to the centre.\nThe proponent of the bill is Mr Ramesh Kumar Vankwani, an MNA from Sindh, who made a similar attempt in the past that was rejected by the Senate Standing Committee on National Heritage and Culture.\n \n \n\nLast year, he introduced the Gandhara Cultural Authority Act, 2023, which was deferred by the standing committee. Now, he has reintroduced a similar bill, this time with the deceptive name of \u201cGandhara Corridor Bill, 2024.\u201d Evidently, he is positioning himself for its chairman\u2019s slot. Is he merely a front man acting at the behest of behind-the-scenes planners? This is the question on everyone\u2019s mind in KP.\nConstitutionally, this controversial bill violates the 18th Constitutional Amendment as the subject pertaining to the affairs of \u2018Ancient and Historic Monuments, Archaeological Sites, and Remains\u2019 was transferred to respective provinces after the abolition of the concurrent list.\nIt is also a redundant piece of legislation and directly encroaches upon the province\u2019s institutions and existing laws that govern Gandharan sites in KP.\nThe proposed bill outlines the acquisition of property, both movable and immovable, containing Gandharan remains in the possession of KP. Financial earnings from KP\u2019s sites, as well as grants and donor funding, are mandated to be deposited into the Gandhara Corridor Account, according to the proposed legislation.\nThe Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation (PTDC), a federal body, was bypassed and not consulted regarding the proposed law. The PTDC is mandated to support and facilitate the provinces under its charter.\nBy establishing a parallel organisation within the federal government, this bill, after enactment, shall render the PTDC\u2019s role useless, stifling its existence.\nInstead, efforts should be made to open a religious tourism facilitation centre inside the PTDC for international tourists coming to Pakistan. Assisting them with NOCs will help market Pakistan as a destination for religious tourism internationally more effectively.\nThe chief minister of KP has vehemently opposed the bill and condemned its contents in the strongest terms. A cross-section of politicians from various parties in the province and heritage experts have also criticised it in unison. Legal experts from KP have insisted that the bill is flawed.\n\u2014 The writer is a tourism expert based in Peshawar. alijan98@gmail.com\n"

They said extreme weather events, once rare, now ravaged communities in Chitral, Lower and Upper Dir and other northern parts of KP with increasing frequency, leaving devastation in their wake. \nSome metropolitan journalists also highlighted the pressing issues of noise and air pollution in Peshawar city, pointing out the multifaceted environmental challenges faced by communities in the city area.\nThe participants also brought to the attention of the lead trainer a media report indicating that more than 210 forest fires in KP had ravaged 14,430 acres of land. Alarmingly, the report revealed that 55 of these fires were deliberately started by locals as reported by the provincial forest department.\nAt the end of the session, Afia Salam stressed the need to amplify environmental stories for greater public awareness and spur policy interventions.\n"

It is suitable only for 4x4 vehicles or small cars in good condition, with big vehicles unable to traverse the road. They said that the residents of Kalam relied on tourism and agriculture, both of which necessitated a well-maintained road infrastructure.\nA meeting was also held between Kalam Hotel Action Committee and army officials that decided to commence regular restoration work on Kalam Road through National Highway Authority (NHA) on Monday.\nThe meeting decided that strict measures would be taken against people preading negative information on social media regarding the upcoming project.

He said that despite financial constraints, the government was not only committed but going all out to bring about positive change in the life of people in merged districts.\n\u201cHowever, we need to have special attention and more concerted efforts to bring those districts into the national mainstream, because the war against terrorism has badly affected the infrastructure in these areas,\u201d said the chief minister.\nHe said that there was a need to construct farm-to-market roads to accelerate economic activities in the tribal districts. He said that government was planning to build small dams to ensure food security in the province.\nThe chief minister said introducing other technologies including tunnel farming was also under-consideration to develop agriculture sector on modern lines in addition to establishment of food testing laboratories in the province. He added that it would ensure quality of food commodities in the markets.\n\u201cSimilarly, we further need to effectively utilise available water resources for producing hydropower and ensuring self-sufficiency in agricultural products. We also need to have foreign investment in order to materialise all these plans,\u201d said Mr Gnadapur. He added that investors would be provided with all kinds of support and facilities.\nHe said that those efforts would pave way for sustainable development and prosperity by capitalising the untapped advantages and stabilising local economy.\nTalking on the occasion, Ms Coco Ushiyama said that WFP was currently working with the provincial government on various public welfare projects including provision of educational stipends to 30,000 girls in merged districts.\n\u201cWFP is also willing to further expand its collaboration with the provincial government in various public welfare interventions,\u201d she said.\n"

The Public Health Reference Lab at Khyber Medical University is collaborating with the World Health Organisation for the identification of the virus and an effective response,\u201d he said.\nThe director said a multi-sectoral strategy would be adopted under which efforts, in coordination with the relevant departments, would be made to eliminate stagnant water and other breeding grounds for mosquitoes.\nHe said the communication and works department would be taken on board to ensure the elimination of water pools near construction sites, while district administrations and tehsil municipal administrations would be involved to prevent the accumulation of water in and outside houses.\n\u201cOur women staff members will visit houses and inform the women on how to protect them from dengue through safe water storage and draining of water to avoid pools, while outside the house, our male staff will inform the community regarding the dangers posed by standing water and persuade them to eliminate those pools to prevent the production of mosquitoes,\u201d he said.\nDr Roghani said residents were infected with dengue almost every year as the province was endemic, but during the last two years, the work of health workers against dengue has been excellent.\nHe said the province recorded 22,000 dengue cases and 18 deaths in 2022, but the number of cases came down to just 747 cases next year.\n\u201cWe hope the incidence will go down further,\u201d he said.\nThe director said dengue was \u201ccompletely\u201d preventable through the elimination of water pools, which the department was ensuring, while training programmes were also arranged for doctors, nurses, and paramedics to manage dengue cases at the local level.\nHe said awareness was key to dengue prevention, and therefore, the department would spread messages at the community level to inculcate a sense of fear and woo the people towards measures aiming to eliminate breeding points.\n\u201cA dengue control room will be established at the offices of the DG (health services) to evaluate activities in districts and intervene if the need arises,\u201d he said.\nDr Roghani said the health department had decided to reserve 1,240 beds for dengue patients in public sector hospitals, including 300 in Peshawar-based health facilities.\n\u201cEvery medical teaching institution will allocate one ward exclusively for dengue patients,\u201dhe said.\n"

            "Text": "PESHAWAR: Opposition leader in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly Dr Ibadullah Khan has formally requested Speaker of the provincial legislature Babar Saleem Swati to call a sitting of the house for the swearing-in of the members elected to the seats reserved for women and non-Muslims.\nIn a letter, the opposition leader urged the speaker to take \u201cnecessary action\u201d for calling the session to implement the orders of the Peshawar High Court.\nAs the provincial government refused to call the sitting, the opposition moved the high court, which has directed the provincial chief minister and cabinet to convene the assembly\u2019s sitting within a fortnight to ensure that those elected on reserved seats take oath.\nThe orders were issued by a division bench comprising Justice Syed Mohammad Attique Shah and Justice Shakeel Ahmad on Friday in a detailed judgement on three identical petitions filed by around 20 MPAs-elect of the opposition.\n\nGovt says it has no objections to PHC\u2019s orders for sitting\n\nThe bench also directed the speaker to administer oaths to those lawmakers in the session to be requisitioned in accordance with its orders.\nIn its March 27 short order, it didn\u2019t issue such orders to the CM and the provincial cabinet.\nHowever, the detailed judgement declared that both the CM and the cabinet should \u201ctake all material steps in terms of Article 109 along with all enabling provisions of the Constitution for summoning the session of the provincial assembly within a fortnight positively, after receipt of this judgement, so that the oath is administered to the petitioners in terms of Article 65 of the Constitution before the Senate election.\u201d\nWhen contacted, spokesman for the provincial government Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif said the government had \u201cno objections\u201d to the court\u2019s orders.\nHe, however, said it was the prerogative of the assembly\u2019s speaker to \u201cformulate the agenda for the session and call it.\nMr Saif also told Dawn that under Article 69 of the Constitution, it was beyond the mandate of the judiciary to call a sitting of the provincial legislature.\nLast month, provincial Governor Ghulam Ali called an assembly session on March 22 for the swearing-in of members elected to the reserved and minority seats and notified by the Election Commission of Pakistan on March 4.\nThe move caused a tiff between the governor and the newly-elected government, which declared it against the rules as well as the Constitution.\nThe office of Speaker Babar Saleem Swati also sought the opinion of the law department about whether the governor\u2019s order in question was in line with the Constitution.\nThe government\u2019s refusal to call the sitting on March 22 led to a protest by opposition members, who alleged that the government wanted to deprive the members elected to reserved seats of the right to cast votes in the Senate polls.\nOpposition leader Dr Ibadullah Khan of the PML-N insisted that the government\u2019s move to block the swearing-in of members was meant to \u201cclaim four extra seats\u201d in the Senate polls.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The Capital Development Authority (CDA) on Saturday demolished some structures at a tennis club \u2013 named after slain prime minister Benazir Bhutto \u2013 located on Embassy Road, prompting a strong response from the PPP which claimed that the civic body violated the stay order of the court.\nThe civic agency claimed that as per the directions of the Islamabad High Court, construction could not be allowed in parks. The CDA said the tennis court was not \u201cremoved at all\u201d and only a few structures built at the tennis court were removed by the civic body to facilitate residents. The CDA also cancelled the lease of the tennis court.\nAccording to documents, Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad (MCI) Sports, Culture and Tourism Director Abeera Dilawar in an April 8 letter informed the secretary of the interior ministry\u2019s staff welfare society that the \u201cletter of April and May 2004 regarding the Tennis Court G-6 Community Ground were withdrawn/cancelled\u201d.\nAccording to another document dated April 19 this year, Civil Judge Humaira Afzal issued a stay order restraining the CDA from dispossessing the plaintiffs from the property till the next date of hearing on May 11.\n\nPPP takes offence to move, terms it violation of court order\n\nPPP stalwart Farhatullah Babar said the cancellation of the lease was \u201cmischievous\u201d. He said for the past decade, international and national tournaments were being organised at the club.\n\u201cCancellation of the lease is\u2026an attack on the institution named after Benazir Bhutto,\u201d he claimed, adding that the CDA bulldozed the structures in the ground, alleging that the civic agency \u201ctore\u201d the stay order issued by the court.\n\u201cInitially a conspiracy was hatched to abolish the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) and then the lease has been cancelled\u2026 [it]is an example of the bias and hate against the slain leader,\u201d he said.\nA CDA official on the condition of anonymity said it was unfortunate to involve the name of Benazir Bhutto in the episode.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if any court has issued a stay order but we have clear orders from the IHC that construction cannot be allowed in the parks. The fact is that there is a long green strip along Embassy Road on which there is a park named \u2018Sukh Chayn\u2019 and then there is a tennis court which has been fenced. The third part of the green belt is under the control of the CDA. We have just removed the fence and the tennis court is very much intact,\u201d he claimed.\nThe decision was taken to provide the residents with ample walking space which was being hindered by the fence installed around the tennis court.\n\u201cWe have just removed the fence and some of the structures/rooms which were being used by some people for \u2018inappropriate\u2019 activities,\u201d he claimed.\nThe official claimed that an individual allegedly connected to the tennis court tried to damage the structure. \u201cHe wanted to give an impression that CDA has taken action against the tennis court which is not correct at all,\u201d he said.\nThe CDA also shared a video in which it was claimed that only structures were removed during the operation and the tennis court was \u201cvery much intact\u201d.\n"

Mr Abbas, however, retained his National Assembly seat and vacated PP-22.\nAccording to sources in the PML-N, Mr Abbas wanted the PP-22 ticket for his younger brother but the party instead awarded ticket to Malik Falak Sher Awan, a businessman from Talagang.\nA PML-N leader on condition of anonymity told Dawn: \u201cThe party did not want to award a ticket to Malik Falak Sher Awan but it had to choose him as he had a strong backing of the powers that be.\u201d\nThe PTI had alleged that as per Form-45, its candidate, Hakeem Nisar Ahmed, had defeated Malik Ghulam Abbas in the Feb 8 polls.\nIn Sunday\u2019s by-election, the main contest is once again between Hakeem Nisar Ahmed and PML-N\u2019s Malik Falak Sher Awan. However Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan\u2019s candidate Mohammad Adrees and an independent candidate, Malik Ikram Abbas, are also in the running.In the Feb general elections, Mr Adrees had obtained 9,113 votes as per Form-47.\nIkram Abbas who was an active member of the PML-N and also a former chairman of Maingan Union Council, had sought party ticket for PP-22 constituency, but when the party awarded the ticket to Mr Awan, he decided to contest the election as an independent candidate.\nThe PML-N has two MNAs and three MPAs in Chakwal and Talagang who are actively campaigning for Malik Falak Sher Awan while PTI\u2019s Sher Afzal Marwat has also attended a public meeting in Talagang.\nPP-22 constituency comprises tehsils Chakwal, Kallar Kahar and Talagang. There are 290,122 registered voters out of which 146,798 are males and 143,324 females. As many as 215 polling stations have been set up in the constituency.\nThe Election Commission of Pakistan and the district administration have made foolproof arrangements for holding peaceful elections. Rangers have also been called to avert any untoward situation. According to a handout of the Punjab government, internet and mobile service would remain suspended in the area.\n"

            "Text": "As a prolonged spell of rain delays wheat harvest in the Potohar region, farmers have complained about an unprecedented rise in the cost of harvest, saying it has increased twofold on the back of an increase in the price of petroleum products compared to the previous year.\nThough the harvest has begun in some parts of the plateau, farmers are worried that the untimely rains will harm the yield. They also fret about the rise in the cost of petroleum products, electricity, labour and agricultural machinery.\nChaudhry Rab Nawaz, a farmer in Gujar Khan, said the recent rains had delayed the harvest and he was waiting for clear skies to kick-start the harvest on his 60-acre land. He feared that the yield quality and quantity could be affected if the rain spell continued for a few more days.\nRaja Sohail Janjua echoed similar sentiments, as he complained about the rise in labour costs. Last year, labourers would charge Rs1,000 for a day but now their daily wages have increased to Rs1,500, he said, adding that a \u201ccan of engine oil\u201d for tractors that was available in the market for up to Rs4,500 during the previous season had also skyrocketed to Rs5,500. Similarly, a new oil filter cost him Rs950 instead of Rs150 a year ago.\nMr Janjua is also worried about rates thresher owners would charge him this year. Last year, the machine owners used to provide services for up to Rs4,000 per hour but this year there is uncertainty about their price since the harvesting season has yet to kick-start due to untimely rains. He feared torrential rains and hailstorms could affect the crop\u2019s yield.\n \n\nRains have forced farmers to leave crop bundles in the fields.\n\nRaja Zainul Abideen, another farmer in the tehsil, told Dawn that small agriculturalists were badly hit by the rising cost of agriculture. He said small landowners could not afford urea, DAP, or till their land as many as five times to make the land suitable for sowing due to inflation.\nDue to an increase in the cost of fuel and tractors\u2019 rent, they could not properly cater to their fields, adversely impacting the produce, he said, adding that a well-ploughed land fed with fertilisers would have a higher yield compared to a less-ploughed one.\nAbout urea prices, Mr Nawaz told Dawn that the 50kg bag of DAP fertiliser cost Rs7,000 in 2022 compared to Rs15,000-16,000 in 2023. He added that the bag of urea that was available for Rs2,000-2,200 in 2022 was sold at Rs6,000 in 2023. He disclosed that the farmers had to produce these products from the \u2018black market\u2019, forcing many to refrain from using urea due to its non-affordability and shortage.\nAmid these factors, Raja Zain urged the government to set the per mound (40/kg) price of wheat at about Rs5,000, which would be the minimum cost to cover their expenses as well as earn some profit.\nHe lamented that no subsidy was available to the farmers of the tehsil while the performance of the agriculture department was also disappointing. He said the survival of farmers had become \u201cnext to impossible due to the skyrocketing cost of living in the country\u201d, and called upon the government to bring reforms for their uplift.\nProcurement target\nAccording to the sources in the food department, the government has set a minimum support price of Rs3,900/40kg, and has set a target of procuring up to two million metric tonnes of wheat during the scheme year 2024-25.\n \n\nA boy participates in wheat harvesting in his father\u2019s field.\n\nRawalpindi Food Department Deputy Director Mahar Abbas Haral said the spell of rain was causing harvest delays, adding that the \u201cmoisture content in wheat is counterproductive\u201d. He added that heavy rains and storms could cause \u201cpartial damage\u201d to wheat.\nMr Haral said that the quality and quantity of the crop may be affected, adding that climate change was impacting harvesting patterns.\nRawalpindi division Agriculture Director Syed Iftikhar Bokhari said he also noticed the suspension of harvesting due to rains. He, however, claimed that temperature would rise in the next few days allowing the farmers to expedite the harvest.\n \n\nWheat crop is ready for harvest. If the weather remains dry, a bumper yield of the cash crop is expected. \u2014 Photos by the writer\n\nThough the recent rains posed difficulties for farmers, it was fortunate that they were not accompanied by strong winds due to \u201clodging (fall) of crops stems was minimal,\u201d he added.\nThe director said the farmers should get \u201cmaximum advantage of the expected hotter and dry week\u201d to harvest the crop.\n"

As a result, price discrimination for the same homogeneous product (gas) has been created in the fertiliser industry.\nAn official of the affected stakeholders says that this is a missed opportunity for the government, leading to a revenue loss of up to Rs100 billion due to delayed gas reforms that would have standardised gas pricing for all fertiliser manufacturers.\nAccording to him, the only long-term solution to stabilizing urea prices is to eliminate this anomaly in gas pricing among manufacturers. Instability in the fertiliser market also results in excessive profiteering, hoarding, and frustration for the farmer.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: Pitching for decade-long political stability and continuity of policies for sustainable economic results, the government on Tuesday promised a series of bold reforms for cheaper and more affordable power rates. It expected official foreign exchange reserves to touch $10bn by June from less than $8bn now.\nSpeaking at a business conference, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the foreign exchange reserves were expected to cross $9bn as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) released its last tranche in a week and move closer to $10bn by the end of the fiscal year in June\u2014enough for two months of import cover against a low of $3.4bn or 15-day import cover last year.\nHe said he had already initiated talks with the IMF for a longer and larger programme to bring permanence to macroeconomic stability and execute a key economic structural reform agenda. \u201cWe don\u2019t need policy prescriptions; we know the what and why for a long time, we just don\u2019t do it,\u201d he said and promised the execution of outstanding reforms and their sustainability, particularly in the priority areas of power and petroleum sectors and taxation.\nOn the taxation side, the finance minister pointed out that the gap between policy and enforcement and the large under-taxed and untaxed sectors must be brought into the tax net. He also noted over Rs1.7 trillion worth of tax proceeds pending litigation.\n\nEyes forex reserves close to $10bn by end-June\n\nHe highlighted the importance of timely decisions on these litigations and closer cooperation between the centre and the provinces to bring the untaxed sectors into the tax net. At the same time, he stressed the need to bring most of the state-owned entities (SOEs) to the privatisation counter and sought the wholehearted support of all the line ministries concerned instead of dragging their feet.\nThe finance minister hoped the Staff-Level Agreement (SLA) with the IMF over the next bailout programme by the end of June or early July and said the fund mission would be arriving in the middle of next month for talks.\nPower Minister Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari promised bold reforms leading to an affordable, fair, and cheaper energy supply for all without burdening a few with subsidising others. In this regard, he said the government had started a process for converting imported coal-based power plants to local coal to contain foreign exchange loss, and discussions had also begun with all stakeholders on the weighted average cost of gas.\nHe said the government was also working on regional incentive packages to spur electricity demand as consumers had started moving out of the grid. He said the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) had been stopped from entering direct power purchase contracts and would now be replaced with a competitive power procurement system.\nNational Transmission & Despatch Company (NTDC) would be institutionally restructured quickly, and its role would be changed to power system operator. NTDC\u2019s inefficiencies were causing tremendous loss to the nation, as multiple projects were being delayed for years due to mishandling.\nThe government is also working on pre-privatisation initiatives for the policy and regulatory framework and minimising the role of power companies in tax collection. If Discos were to work as a tax collection network, then what would the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) do?\nThe government has no appetite to control Discos and instead would put them in the hands of competent, efficient, and independent boards of directors through a transparent process. Some of the better-managed entities would be given to the private sector through privatisation, and others would be given on long-term concession agreements for improvement.\nThe private sector has to take its leadership role through participation in the power sector, particularly the distribution system and the government had asked the Pakistan Business Council to give a few experts on how to phase out distribution companies as they had helped at the time of privatisation of PTCL which opened up the sector and earned hundreds of billions of annual revenue to the government against about Rs20bn or so profit then earned by the PTCL.\nMr Leghari said it would not be logical to hamper the growth of the industrial sector just because certain items needed to be subsidised for all classes. The government must be bold enough to accept social responsibility while fostering industrial growth. One \u201cneeds to balance supporting industrial development and ensuring that essential items remain affordable for all segments of society. Also, the government is taking measures to restructure electricity tariffs, and he pointed out that cross-subsidies from the industry were unsustainable.\nAt one of the sessions, Planning and Development Minister Ahsan Iqbal said peace, stability, and continuity of policies were critical for at least a decade to ensure sustainable economic results. He said Pakistan needed about $70bn repayments over the next three years, and increasing exports to $100bn in eight years would help the country take off economically.\n"

At the same time, the second-shift labour could not reach the industries.\n\u201cI have checked that these road blockades have kept production activities and export shipments at only 40 per cent,\u201d he said.\nValue Added Textile Forum Chief Coordinator Jawed Bilwani said more than half of the units were closed in the Site area and also in other industrial areas.\n\u201cOur production and export shipments suffered a drop of 60pc on Tuesday in the name of security measures,\u201d he said, adding that one can estimate the production and export loss in Karachi, which holds a 54pc share in the country\u2019s total exports.\nSimilar reports of partial activities were also coming from Lahore due to the local holiday announced to provide security to the visiting Iranian president. \u201cLahore enjoys a share of 20pc in the country\u2019s total exports,\u201d he claimed.\n\u201cWhat can exporters do in such a situation? I do not know what is going on in the country,\u201d he said, referring to the closure of the city\u2019s main arteries, forcing labourer living in far-flung areas to stay at their homes.\nFaisal Anis Majeed, a commodity importer/exporter, said some 15-20pc shops were open in the Dandia Bazaar as traders and labourers failed to reach due to the closure of the M.A. Jinnah Road and Sharea Faisal, followed by traffic gridlocks. Some traders had also kept their offices closed.\nKorangi Association of Trade and Industry (KATI) President Johar Qandhari, while extending a warm welcome to the Iranian president\u2019s visit to Pakistan, expressed optimism that the visit would not only mend past tensions but also enhance trade and brotherly relations between the two nations.\nHe highlighted the untapped trade opportunities between Pakistan and Iran and stressed the need for a concerted effort to bolster economic cooperation.\n"

He, however, said the government was resolute in not relinquishing its water rights, emphasising that any alteration to the Indus Water Treaty necessitated mutual consent from both Pakistan and India.\n\nLaw minister says Pakistan can\u2019t agitate issue of India\u2019s barrage on Ravi; finance czar calls for \u2018tax culture\u2019\n\nThe minister claimed that India wanted to revoke the treaty as it wanted to impose a war, but the WB was not permitting New Delhi to do so. He reiterated that the treaty stood immutable unless both Pakistan and India reach a consensus for modification.\nMr Tarar said in the past Pakistan had taken up the issues of Indian violation of the treaty to the WB and got relief in some cases. He gave the example of Kishan Ganga Dam in this regard.\nPTI\u2019s Zartaj Gul criticised the minister for saying Pakistan could not agitate the issue, expressing the fear the BJP government would revoke the Indus Water Treaty after winning the elections this time.\nEconomy\nIn a policy statement on the economic situation, Finance Minister Mohammad Aurangzeb called for creating tax culture in the country and improving tax-GDP ratio. He said imposing more taxes on tax payers would not resolve the issue.\nStating that the IMF programme could only provide stability and not development, the minister said agriculture and information technology sectors held the potential to contribute significantly to economic growth. He stressed the government\u2019s commitment to facilitating the two sectors and expressed optimism that IT exports would surpass the $3.3bn mark during this financial year.\nHe stressed the importance of promoting agricultural growth to achieve a rate of five to six per cent annually, in addition to harnessing the potential of the local livestock sector.\nThe minister asserted that the country\u2019s economic situation had improved compared to the previous year. Regarding economic indicators, he highlighted a 74pc decrease in the current account deficit, which reached $1bn as compared to $3.9bn previously.\nHe outlined the government\u2019s focus on three key areas for transformation: tax, energy sectors, and reforms in the state-owned enterprises.\nMr Aurangzeb, who had recently returned from the US, affirmed the support of friendly countries both domestically and internationally for Pakistan\u2019s economic growth. He said the inflation had come down to 20.7pc from 38pc and it would drop to 5pc to 7pc by September 2025.\nThe NA also passed a resolution urging the government to \u201ctake immediate steps to ensure the payment of the minimum wages announced by the government in the government-run departments as well as the private enterprises.\u201d\n"

Imran Khan clearly said that no one had contacted him,\u201d Mr Gohar said while speaking to media persons outside Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi.\nHe said no one had even contacted him  for dialogue, nor had he received any message for talks from anyone.\n\u201cSame is the case with the other party leadership. Even if we receive any message from anyone for dialogues, we will inform the media,\u201d he said.\n\nDemands Bushra Bibi be shifted to Shaukat Khanum Hospital forthwith\n\nHe made it clear that whenever PTI is interested in dialogues, they  would be held openly and the media would be informed about it.\nIn reply to a question, he said Mr Khan did not believe in sharing power and would not make an alliance with any party which has stolen the mandate of the PTI.  However, he said, the party would continue efforts and struggle for the rights of the people of Pakistan.\nBushra Bibi\u2019s health\nExpressing serious concerns over the health of Bushra Bibi, the wife of former prime minister Imran Khan, after a team of doctors with an ambulance visited Banigala overnight to examine her, the PTI leadership on Tuesday warned that the rulers would be held responsible if anything happened to her.\nSpeaking at a press conference, the PTI leaders warned that Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif, jail superintendent and other authorities would be held responsible if anything happened to Ms Bibi, alleging that the current regime had crossed all boundaries of \u201cfascism and inhumane acts\u201d.\nAccompanied by PTI Senator Dr Humayun Mohmand, Naeem Hai\u00adder Panjutha and party\u2019s Women Wing president Kanwal Shauzab, central information secretary Raoof Hasan dema\u00adnded that Mr Khan\u2019s wife be immediately transferred to Shaukat Khanum Hospital and treated by doctors of her and her husband\u2019s choice.\nPTI Senator Mohmand questioned the credibility of medical ass\u00ade\u00adssment reports of Bushra Bibi, alleging that her medical examination had been delayed for two months. He said that if tests were not conducted in a specific period of time, their results could be different.\nHe said if Ms Bibi was allowed to undergo medical tests when she complained about health deterioration, only then they could accept the test results, adding that she needed a clinical evaluation because here medical examination diagnosed that her stomach layer was inflamed and digestive canal was damaged.\nThat was the reason doctors suggested a better diet for her and, therefore, the chances of her being poisoned could not be ruled out, he claimed.\nMr Hasan alleged that all st\u00adate institutions badly failed to per\u00adform their legal and constitutional duties. He said the chief justice inaction and sil\u00ad\u00adence on human rights violations in the country raised many eyebrows.\nMr Panjutha said Ms Bibi had no health issues before her detention and the issue of her medical examination had been dragged for two months with \u201cmalicious\u201d intent.\nMs Shauzab said that after the \u201cregime change conspiracy\u201d, a new but alarming tradition had emerged in the country to specifically target women.\n"

            "Text": "LAHORE: After a gap of a few years, a think tank of serving and retired ranker police officers from Punjab has again launched a move for the creation of the Provincial Police Service (PPS) to challenge the \u2018dominance\u2019 of the Police Service of Pakistan (PSPs) across the province.\nThe prime objective of the think tank is to reclaim the reserved posts which the officers argue, have been occupied by the PSPs in violation of the rules and regulations.\nIn the initial phase, the group has planned a baithak (seminar) at a hotel in Lahore on Wednesday (today) under the auspices of Republic Policy Organisation, inviting the police officials and others from all the ranks to attend, shed light on the longstanding issue and submit recommendations in order to \u2018reform\u2019 the police in Punjab.  \nA retired superintendent of police (SP) Tahir Maqsood Chheena is leading the move while many serving provincial police officers, who have joined the initiative, include SPs Syed Mohammad Abbas, Khalid Mahmood Afzal and Dr Mustansar Atta Bajwa.\nThe event has been organised two years after some provincial service police officers in 2022 brought a matter to the notice of the then chief secretary that the PSP officers were occupying \u201cillegally\u201d nearly 200 seats reserved for the provincial cadre and the matter was shelved for an indefinite period as no progress was made in this respect so far.  \nThrough a letter, they had pointed out [at that time] that according to the schedule and the Inter-provincial Coordination Committee minutes of the meeting, only 162 out of 362 sanctioned posts were allocated to the Federal Services of Pakistan strength on a \u2018sharing basis\u2019, while the remaining posts were reserved for the provincial service.\n\u201cWe are going to join heads at a historic occasion to discuss decades-old issue in today\u2019s seminar\u201d, Mr Tahir, who is also president of the organisation, told Dawn here on Tuesday. He said they wanted creation of the PPS on the pattern of the Provincial Management Service (PMS) in Punjab for the rights of provincial police service.\nIn Pakistan, Mr Tahir said, policing has undergone devolution, especially, in the wake of the 18th amendment to the Constitution.\n\u201cHowever, the federal police service/Police Service of Pakistan still controls policing at the provincial and district levels despite constitutional obligations\u201d, the retired SP said.He said under Article 240 (b) and the PCS Acts, policing falls within the purview of provincial authority, necessitating the development of the provincial police service for effective policing in Punjab. \nAdditionally, Mr Tahir said the district police service plays a significant role as policing is always devolved to the most localised tier. \nHe went on saying that this system guaranteed that the policing is tailored to each district\u2019s needs and challenges.\n\u201cSo, creating the provincial police service in line with the provincial management service has become a critical subject for executing an exclusive provincial subject of policing\u201d, the retired SP said.\nIf created, the PPS shall only be answerable to the province contrary to the PSPs who have nothing to do with the province and represent only the federal government, the SP said.\n"

            "Text": "RAHIM YAR KHAN: Wheat growers in the district are finding it hard to sell their wheat crop at the official support price announced by the Punjab government and have serious reservations with regard to the procurement policy and the \u2018Bradana App\u2019 meant for supplying them gunny bags.  \nAccording to farmers, despite increasing the wheat cultivation target for the district, the government has drastically cut the procurement target, which will force them to sell their yield in the open market at lower rates.    \nThey argue that according to Punjab Agriculture Department (PAD), total wheat cultivation in the district was on 685,000 acres last year, while this year wheat had been cultivated on 714,000 acres.\nAs per the Punjab Food Department (PFD), last year the wheat procurement for the three tehsils of the RYK district \u2013 Liaqatpur, Rahim Yar Khan and Sadiqabad \u2013 was 140,000 matric tons, while in tehsil Khanpur Pakistan Agriculture Storage and Services Corporation (PASSCO) had been assigned the task of wheat purchase. But, procurement target in the district for this year is only 60,000 matric tons, they point out.  \n\nTheir unfamiliarity with PITB app is a hurdle in getting gunny bags\n\nThey apprehend that this discrepancy will leave them at the mercy of private buyers and they won\u2019t be getting the official rate for their crop this year.   \nSimilarly, Punjab government had announced that farmers could apply for empty bags (bardana) from April 13 to April 17, through their android cell phones using the Punjab Information Technology Board (PITB\u2019s) \u2018Bardana App\u2019. It had said the bags would be released to farmers on April 19, while the procurement will start from April 22.\nHowever, most of the farmers in the district can\u2019t use android mobiles to benefit from the PITB app.  \nOn Wednesday, many farmers from adjoining areas gathered at District Food  Controller (DFC) office, complaining that the \u2018Bardana App\u2019 was \u201cnot active\u201d.\nThey were told by the officials to got to the wheat procurement centres with written applications for gunny bags and relevant land record documents.\nA  farmer of Chak 88-P, Pull Sunny, Bashir Ahmed, alleged that neither any  telephone number of DFC office helpline, nor of Lahore PFD  helpline, was responding for filing of complaints.  \nNarrating their plight, Jam Mushtaq Ahmed, a farmer of Kuba Lal Pir in Taranda Sawaye Khan area, and another of Chowk Sureli of Mao Mubarak said farmers had been forced to purchase costly inputs, including urea fertilizer at Rs4,800 per bag, while the government control rate was Rs3,600. Similarly, they say that they had to buy DAP for Rs14,000 per bag, while its control rate was Rs11,500. Besides these heads, they also had to spend heavily on other inputs, including cultivation, pesticides and tube-well\u2019s electricity bills per acre.\nThey also lamented that substandard and fake fertilizers and pesticides are sold to them by unscrupulous elements. Despite facing all these hardships, the farmers were not getting official rates for their crop, they deplored. \nAnother farmer of Chack 140-P, Zulfiqar Ali, criticised the wheat procurement policy, saying the food department was releasing bags at a ratio of only 16 maunds per acre, while the actual average yield per acre was more than 50 maunds. He said that this means that farmers will be forced to sell the remaining wheat to private traders at lesser rates.Meanwhile, On Wednesday, the rate of wheat crop in the open market was Rs3,250 per maund.\nWhen contacted, DFC Abdul Majid Khan told Dawn that Bardana App will help curb the corruption in food department. He said that policy of wheat procurement was made at secretary level and then approved by provincial cabinet level, so it was beyond his official capacity to address the problems and grievances of farmers.\nHe said that the 60,000 matric tons target of wheat procurement had not been finalised yet.\nAbout Bardana App he said it won\u2019t close on April 17 and will continue to function \u201cin different phases\u201d.\nHe admitted that this season the farmer won\u2019t be able to sell all their crop at the support price of Rs3,900 per maund because of the limit of provision of gunny bags for six acres at the ratio of 15 maunds per acre.\n"

The next day, his brother Zeshan received a call from Haroonabad City police that his brother had met with an accident and was lying injured at the police station.\nLater, the family came to know that SI Muhammad Umar along with five unknown City police officials had subjected Junaid to brutal torture, broke his cell phone and took out Rs5,000 from his pocket.\nThe police officials ordered the victim\u2019s family to remain silent on the matter and threatened them with dire consequences in case of any complaint. The policemen instructed the family to call the above matter an accident and took a signature from the family on a blank paper.\nWhen the family tried to approach the DPO over the matter, the cops threatened to implicate them in criminal cases.\nOn Monday, the family contacted the district police officer at an open court held at DPO office, narrated all the event in a written complaint and sought justice. Responding to it, the DPO took notice, investigated the matter on the spot and ordered to book the policemen after they were found guilty in the probe. A departmental inquiry was also initiated against them.\nWhen contacted, Bahawalnagar DPO Naseebullah Khan confirmed that a case had been registered against six officials under section 342 of Pakistan Penal Code and 156D Police Order 2002.

Each of them took at least one wicket, with Matthews, Alleyne and Taylor taking two scalps each.\nThe ODI series will be followed by five T20Is starting from April 26 .\n"

            "Text": "NEW DELHI: Austra\u00adlia\u2019s David Warner says the T20 World Cup in the United States and West Indies will not see the same mammoth scores built on flat pitches in this year\u2019s Indian Premier League.\nThe current edition of the world\u2019s richest cricket tournament has seen monumental totals, including Sunrisers Hyderabad twice breaking IPL records with 277 and 287.\nWarner\u2019s Delhi Cap\u00aditals were at the receiving end of another run-fest when Hyderabad posted 266-7 at the weekend, courtesy of a 32-ball 89 by fellow Australian Travis Head.\nBut veteran opening batsman Warner said the pitches in the West Indies will have something for the bowlers when T20\u2019s showpiece global event begins on June 1.\n\u201cThey can be slower and they\u2019re gonna turn a bit,\u201d Warner, 37, told reporters, leaning on his experience in the Cari\u00adbbean Premier League. \u201cThe wickets tend to get a little bit lower and slower.\u201d\nAustralian batters Head and up-and-coming Jake Fraser-McGurk have scored at strike-rates of 216 and up to pummel the opposition IPL bowlers.\nWarner has not been at his best with 167 runs for the season so far at a strike-rate of 135.77, but he said the anchor role will be key in the West Indies.\n\u201cEven when we played there in the 2010 World Cup, the pitches weren\u2019t high-scoring,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s when you did need an anchor, someone like Mike Hussey came out and scored runs for us. He had to come and sort of knock it around.\u201d\nWarner added:  \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be completely different there. Add the natural elements as well. They\u2019re going to be predominantly day games, I think, because of the timings. So that plays a big factor.\u201d\nHyderabad, who won the IPL in 2016 under Warner, and their batsmen have redefined T20 scoring with their ability to hit nearly every ball out of the park.\nTwice this year the team have hit a match-record 22 sixes and at Delhi\u2019s Feroz Shah Kotla ground they hammered an IPL-record 125 runs in the first six overs.\n\u201cThe wickets have been very good. They\u2019ve been very flat, very compact and very high-scoring,\u201d said Warner. \n\u201cAnd when you\u2019ve got small boundaries, you\u2019re going to see very high scores.\n\u201cBack in the day there used to be turn and you couldn\u2019t get those scores,\u201d he added. \n\u201cAlso, the lacquer on the ball is staying longer and hence it\u2019s not getting chewed up, and hence very little turn on offer.\u201d\n"

However, a large number of people employed with public and private  organisations under the control of the federal government, including  banks, faced hardship in reaching to their workplaces due to heightened  security.\nThe spokesperson said that 345 officers and employees were stationed in district East, 164 in West and more than 300 in district South. Additionally, 1,500 traffic policemen and over 300 officials of the Special Branch were assigned security duties.\nTo enhance security measures, snipers were strategically positioned at sensitive locations throughout the city, he added.\nHighlighting the commitment of the Karachi police to uphold safety standards, the spokesperson emphasised that every possible measure was being taken to fulfil their duties effectively in safeguarding the visiting delegations.\n\u201cThe rigorous security arrangements underscore Karachi\u2019s dedication to hosting foreign dignitaries in a safe and secure environment, reflecting the city\u2019s ongoing efforts to bolster best relations with foreign dignitaries,\u201d the spokesperson stated.\n"

The DG replied that he had to check the status of the land in question first.\nThe chief justice observed that amenity land could not be used for any purpose other than public services and deplored that the KDA DG was unaware about the status of the land and had no idea about utilisation of such plot. He directed the DG to file a report about the status of the subject plot.\n"

            "Text": "KARACHI: An investigation officer (IO) on Tuesday informed a judicial magistrate about the need to arrest former SP of Clifton Nayyar ul Haq as he was seen in CCTV footage of the Dharkhshan police station following the arrest and death of Moiz Naseem, a suspect who had died in police custody.  \nMeanwhile, the IO also brought Sub-Inspector Sanaullah \u2014 who had apprehended Junaid, a son of the deceased in an extortion case \u2014 along with other held suspects, Darkhshan SHO Ali Raza Leghari and head moharrir Faisal Leghari, before Judicial Magistrate Mazhar Ali, seeking an extension in their custody for further questioning.  \nAfter the proceeding held inside the judge\u2019s chamber, the IO told Dawn that he had submitted the digital video recorder (DVR) in court of the Darkhshan police station, and the footage was played before the judge.  \nIn the footage obtained from the Dharkhshan police station, IO told that it could be seen that first, the suspect Junaid, and then subsequently his father, were brought into the police station with blindfolds over their eyes. A few moments later, former SP of Clifton arrived at the station. The IO further explained that there was no footage available while the suspects were allegedly taken out of the station.  \n\nCCTV footage from Darkhshan police station played before judge  \n\nThe IO requested the court to extend the physical custody of the suspects as he needed to check the criminal record and photo forensic analyses, adding that it was necessary to arrest former SP Clifton and other unknown suspects.  \nUpon IO\u2019s request, the court extended two-day police remand and directed the IO to produce the suspects on April 25 along with case diaries and progress report.  \nBarrister Zainul Abideen, representing the legal heirs of the deceased, told Dawn that during the hearing, he had highlighted before the court that the former SP visited Naseem\u2019s house multiple times on the nights of April 14 and 15.  \nHowever, the barrister also claimed that the former SP took along with him the DVR of the CCTV camera installed at the neighbour\u2019s house, adding that the IO admitted in the court that although he had contacted the neighbours for their statements, they refused to testify due to fear.  \nBarrister Zain said that the court had directed the IO to incorporate the neighbour\u2019s statements in the record.  \nOn the other hand, the counsel for the SHO, Advocate Zakir Hussain Bughio, told Dawn that he apprised the court that on April 14 the duty officer and head moharrir of the station were on duty near Seaview.  \nEarlier, Additional District and Sessions Judge Ihsan Ali Malik (South) had granted post-arrest bail to Junaid, 19, a son of the deceased Naseem, against a surety bond of the sum of Rs50,000.  \nIn its order, the court highlighted that the sections included in the FIR were non-congnizable in nature, however, the accused was arrested without taking permission from the magistrate.  \nDuring the proceedings, complainant Abdul Basit of an extortion case did not appear before the court, while the state prosecutor opposed the bail plea.  \nOn the other hand, Barrister Zain contended that due to the complainant\u2019s \u2018influential family\u2019 background, the police had implicated his client, Junaid, and deceased Naseem in a \u2018bogus\u2019 case.  \nHe further contended that on April 14, the applicant, Junaid, was apprehended with his friend near DHA phase 8 without an arrest warrant, and on the same day, his father was allegedly picked up from his residence.   \nHowever, the police did not present him before the judicial magistrate the following day.  \nInstead, the investigation officer informed the court of the need to arrest Naseem for an alleged offence, the counsel argued.\n"

A representative delegation of the group had recently visited Islamabad and Lahore before arriving in Karachi, he added.\nAbout the health projects, Ayaz Jarral representing the NRP and NCHW said they included the establishment of healthcare givers\u2019 workforce in Pakistan trained on the international standards. This would open up opportunities for the local workforce in the emerging markets of the US, Canada, UK and the Middle East.\nAccording to him, there is also a project for establishing a network of health community centres that would be interconnected with smart mobile health vans to cover rural and urban slum areas, mainly in Punjab and other provinces.\n\u201cThe first pilot project of NRP in Pakistan is in the health sector because there is a growing demand for healthcare givers globally.

            "Text": "HYDERABAD: The consultant firms \u2014 Nespak and ACE \u2014 working for the implementation of the modernisation plan for Akram Wah (a major canal), have advised some fundamental changes in the project. Differing with previous consultants\u2019 expert opinion, they have recommended lining of the canal, instead of retaining its wall.\nThe consultants have submitted their review report on feasibility study of Akram Wah with the Sindh Irrigation and Drainage Authority (Sida), which has administrative control of the canal. The feasibility report of the project was first prepared by different consultants under the Water Sector Improvement Project (WSIP). The review report is now being discussed by Sida, irrigation department and World Bank.\nOne such discussion was held recently at a meeting chaired by Sindh Irrigation Minister Jam Khan Shoro. It was attended by WB team\u2019s technical delegation. A full mission of WB is due in Sindh in April\u2019s last week and it would also discuss the review report with the stakeholders.\nThe previous consultants had suggested retaining construction of the canal\u2019s wall till RD-36 and earthen channel post-RD-36 length. \nA major irrigation channel\nAkram Wah is perhaps the only channel in Sindh, a considerable length of which was lined in 50s. It emanates from the left side of Kotri Barrage. The channel supplies water to lower Sindh districts of Tando Mohammad Khan, Badin and parts of Hyderabad rural area with a cultivable command area of 0.49m acres and gross command area of 0.59m acres. A considerable stretch passes through Hyderabad city as well.\nThe estimated cost of the canal\u2019s lining project is Rs18.5bn.\nThe cost factor\n\u201cExpenses of Rs8.5bn will be made on retaining wall construction from RD-0 to RD-36. It means almost 40pc of project\u2019s cost will be utilised for raising the retaining wall alone. Besides, another Rs3bn will be needed for building roads in the very RDs (RD-0 to RD-36) as the canal passes through the [Hyderabad] city\u2019s limits and this expenditure will take the total cost to roughly Rs21.5bn,\u201d said Irrigation Secretary Zarif Khero.\nDamaged in 1956 floods \nRecord shows Akram Wah was operationalised in 1951 and was badly damaged in the 1956 floods. Kotri Barrage had passed 981,000 cusecs. The canal was repaired for Rs0.6m and it started feeding perennial supplies to the Gaja area in 1957. It became operational again around 1958 after construction of Kotri Barrage. The channel was partly lined and partly earthen when it was built.\nBut it had a chronic issue as it did not achieve its designed discharge of 4,300 cusecs which was increased from 3,714 in 1960 at its head for decades. \n\u201cWe are going through the review report and a final decision will be taken after due consultation with Sida, irrigation department and WB officials,\u201d Jam Khan Shoro told Dawn. He said experts were discussing all proposals including those from implementation consultants that retaining wall should be dropped and canal should be lined up to RD-190, where Matli area of Badin district begins. He said apparently after 70 years, the idea of canal reverting back to earthen structure, at a time when demands of lining of canals in Sindh\u2019s irrigation network are growing, did not look logical.\nThe recent consultation was also attended by the Hyderabad mayor because the irrigation minister wanted to apprise him of road cutting issue in the light of previous feasibility study report. Roads would have been cut and rebuilt which would obviously lead to traffic gridlock issues until canal works in the city\u2019s area are completed.\nZarif Khero\u2019s view is that in previous consultants\u2019 proposal cost of road construction and use of special-graded soil behind retaining wall which is around Rs3bn was not included while suggesting construction of retaining wall up to RD-36. This Rs3bn expense would take overall cost from Rs18.5bn to Rs21.5bn but canal would remain unlined. \u201cIf new proposal in review report of consultants for lining the canal up to RD-190 is given effect, instead of retaining wall, the cost of Rs21.5bn will be same,\u201d he remarked.\nMajor change in project design\nAccording to Sida Managing Director Pritam Das, present consultants Nespak and ACE have reviewed the report which carried several options and an alternative proposal. \u201cAs per alternative proposal, implementation consultants have suggested a major change in canal\u2019s design \u2013 lining the canal till RD-190 instead of building retaining wall from RD-0 to RD-36. Deliberations are under way and the minister is on board as well. We will share our input with WB\u2019s full mission whose visit is scheduled for April\u2019s last week,\u201d he told Dawn while answering a question. As per the previous feasibility report, he said, post-RD-36 remaining length may be lined while present consultants have suggested lining coupled with some precautions that were missed when the canal was first built.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The number of proscribed outfits has swelled to 79 after the first addition in the list of terrorist organisations in four years.  \nThe latest addition to the list, the Zainebiyoun Brigade (ZB), is a militant group which was designated by the US State Department as a terrorist organisation in 2019. \nThe decision to ban Zainebiyoun Brigade was notified after escalation of  tensions with Iran in January and implemented on March 29. \nSeen by observers as a move by Islamabad to appease Washington, while others speculate this was done to win favour with Riyadh, whose foreign minister visited Pakistan recently.  \nAccording to security analyst Mohammad Amir Rana, the Zainebiyoun Brigade is believed to have been involved in supplying weapons to the IRGC in the Middle East. \nLast month, reports emerged of alleged Zainebiyoun members of Pakistani origin being apprehended in international waters for carrying weapons to be given to the IRGC in the Middle East. \nIn another incident, the death of a Pakistan-origin commander in Syria affiliated with the group paved the way for Pakistan to ban it. Pakistani law-enforcement agencies are believed to have sufficient proof of the Zainebiyoun Brigade`s involvement in sectarian violence in the country and recruitment for the Iraq and Syria conflict, but the government had not acted earlier because of circumstances linked to the alleged presence of Baloch insurgents on Iranian soil.\nThe loyalty of its members, who prioritise ideological affiliations over national ties, also remains a major challenge for security institutions.\nFormed by Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) after a civil  war broke out in Syria in 2011, the Zainebiyoun Brigade, also known as  Liwa Zainebiyoun, is charged with mobilising Pakistani Shias to fight  forces opposed to Syrian ruler Bashar Al Assad, a close ally of Tehran  and Moscow. \nThe Brigade has acknowledged ties with the Quds Force since around the 2001 US invasion of Afghanistan, and its formation was announced in 2014 during the conflict in Syria. It recently pledged its readiness to follow orders from the IRGC.\nThe process of maintaining a list of proscribed organisations started on Aug 14, 2001, when Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and Sipah-i-Mohammad Pakistan were outlawed. \nLater, the government banned Jaish-e-Mohammad, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Sipah-i-Sahaba Pakistan, Tehreek-i-Islami and Tehreek-i-Nifaz Shariat-i-Mohammadi on Jan 14, 2002.\n"

Climate change exacerbated the frequency and severity of such events, profoundly impacting societies, economies, and, most importantly, human lives and the environment that we live in,\u201d she said. \nThe State of the Climate in Asia 2023 report highlighted the accelerating rate of key climate change indicators such as surface temperature, glacier retreat and sea level rise, saying they would have serious repercussions for societies, economies and ecosystems in the region.\n\u201cAsia remained the world\u2019s most disaster-hit region from weather, climate and water-related hazards in 2023,\u201d the WMO stated.\nHeat, melting and floods \nThe annual mean near-surface temperature over Asia in 2023 was the second highest on record, at 0.91 degrees Celsius above the 1991-2020 average, and 1.87 degrees above the 1961-90 average.\nParticularly high average temperatures were recorded from western Siberia to central Asia, and from eastern China to Japan, the report said, with Japan having its hottest summer on record.\nAs for precipitation, it was below normal in the Himalayas and in the Hindu Kush mountain range in Pakistan and Afghanistan.\nMeanwhile southwest China suffered from a drought, with below-normal precipitation levels in nearly every month of the last year.\nThe High-Mountain Asia region, centred on the Tibetan Plateau, contains the largest volume of ice outside of the polar regions.\nOver the last several decades, most of these glaciers have been retreating, and at an accelerating rate, the WMO said, with 20 out of 22 monitored glaciers in the region showing continued mass loss last year.\nThe report said 2023 sea-surface temperatures in the northwest Pacific Ocean were the highest on record.\n\u2018Urgency\u2019 for action \nLast year, 79 disasters associated with water-related weather hazards were reported in Asia. Of those, more than 80 per cent were floods and storms, with more than 2,000 deaths and nine million people directly affected.\n\u201cFloods were the leading cause of death in reported events in 2023 by a substantial margin,\u201d the WMO said, noting the continuing high level of vulnerability of Asia to natural hazard events.\nHong Kong recorded 158.1 millimetres of rainfall in one hour on Sept 7 \u2014 the highest since records began in 1884, as a result of a typhoon.\nThe WMO said there was an urgent need for national weather services across the region to improve tailored information to officials working on reducing disaster risks.\n\u201cIt is imperative that our actions and strategies mirror the urgency of these times,\u201d said Saulo. \u201cReducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to the evolving climate is not merely an option, but a fundamental necessity.\u201d\n"

            "Text": "SYDNEY: Elon Musk on Tuesday vowed to challenge Australian demands that his social media platform X take down videos of a recent Sydney church stabbing.\nAustralia\u2019s Federal Court on Monday gave the platform 24 hours to remove videos of an Assyrian bishop being slashed in the head during a recent attack. Australia\u2019s eSafety Commission had sought the court injunction saying X ignored earlier removal notices.\nMusk lashed out at the watchdog on Tuesday, saying the content had already been removed for users in Australia.\n\u201cWe have already censored the content in question for Australia, pending legal appeal, and it is stored only on servers in the USA.\u201d As the deadline approached, the videos were not available to users in Australia, except for those using a VPN or other location-masking service. Musk claimed Australia was trying to enforce a global ban.\n\u201cOur concern is that if ANY country is allowed to censor content for ALL countries, which is what the Australian \u2018eSafety Commissar\u2019 is demanding, then what is to stop any country from controlling the entire Internet,\u201d the billionaire posted on X.\n\u2018Absolutely disgusting\u2019\nThe matter will return to court this week, where a judge will decide whether to extend the interim injunction. A third hearing will follow where eSafety Commission lawyers will seek a permanent injunction and civil penalties against X, a spokesperson said. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese lashed out at Musk, who he described as an  \u201carrogant billionaire\u201d who  \u201cthinks he\u2019s above the law\u201d.\n\u201cThe idea that someone would go to court for the right to put up violent content on a platform shows how out-of-touch Mr Musk is,\u201d Albanese told public broadcaster ABC.\nTasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie called for Musk to be thrown in prison, saying he had  \u201cno conscience\u201d and his behaviour was  \u201cabsolutely disgusting\u201d. \u201cQuite frankly the bloke should be jailed,\u201d she said.\n\u2018Toxicity and hate\u2019\nBishop Mar Mari Emmanuel was allegedly slashed in the head and chest by a 16-year-old suspect last week, sparking a riot by followers of the Assyrian Christian church in western Sydney.\nVideo of the bloody attack, which spread widely on social media platforms, has been blamed by Australian authorities for feeding tensions in the community. Many of Sydney\u2019s small Assyrian community fled persecution and war in Iraq and Syria.\nAustralia has spearheaded efforts to hold the tech giants accountable for what their users post online, under its groundbreaking  \u201cOnline Safety Act\u201d passed in 2021.\neSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant \u2014 a former Twitter employee \u2014 has been fighting a series of legal skirmishes with X, attempting to hold the platform accountable for violent and disturbing content. She has raised concerns in the past about a spike in  \u201ctoxicity and hate\u201d on the platform following Musk\u2019s takeover.\nA spokesperson for the commission said it had also asked other companies, including Google, Snap and TikTok, to remove the footage \u2014 which they had done.\n"

The freedom to negotiate and settle the terms by the bride, therefore, becomes crucial.\u201d\nBride\u2019s consent\nJustice Minalllah regretted that society\u2019s \u201cpaternal tendencies\u201d and \u201cdominance of the male members\u201d in deciding the terms and conditions on behalf of the bride has generally been accepted as a cultural and social norm. \u201cIt places a bride in a disadvantageous position, inevitably adversely affecting her capacity to execute the contract with free consent\u201d.\nThe bench held that a Nikahnama \u201cis the deed of marriage contract\u201d entered into by two parties, and its clauses are to be interpreted \u201cin the light of the intention of the parties\u201d.\n\u201cThe headings, therefore, are not sufficient to determine the intention of the two parties to the [Nikahnama].\u201d\n\u201cThe courts, while interpreting the contents and terms and conditions of a [Nikahnama], also have to take into consideration the factor of free consent of the bride and her freedom to settle the terms and conditions as a person having an informed understanding of her rights.\u201d\nThe judgement added that in case of any ambiguity in the terms of Nikahnama, \u201cthe benefit ought to go in favour of the wife\u201d if it was established that she wasn\u2019t informed of her rights at the time of the Nikah.\nThe bench dismissed the husband\u2019s appeal on the grounds of correct interpretation of the Nikahnama by the LHC.\n"

It was not attended by the IHC registrar due to the sensitivity of the matter.\nThe meeting started at about 2:30pm and continued for over two hours. A statement subsequently issued by the registrar said the judges expressed their views on the matter in a \u201cpleasant manner\u201d and the \u201cunanimous view\u201d of the judges would be submitted to the Supreme Court in the suo motu case.\nSenior puisne judge Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Justice Minagul Hassan Aurangzeb, Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Jus\u00adtice Babar Sattar, Justice Sardar Ejza Ishaq Khan, Justice Arbab Mohammad Tahir and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz attended the meeting.\nSources privy to the meeting told Dawn all the high court judges were unanimous that they would not tolerate interference by any intelligence agency in the proceedings of the high court, district courts, and the special courts.

The judges also proposed that the Practice and Procedure Act which regulates the bench of the Supreme Court may be followed by the high court so that power to form benches could be shared among the three senior-most judges. The IHC also agreed to give an \u201cinstitutional response\u201d in future.\nOne of the participants dispelled any impression of division among the judges and said that all the judges were unanimous regarding the independence of the judiciary and countering the involvement of the intelligence agencies in judicial affairs at all costs.\nAccording to sources, the judges pointed out ins\u00adtances in which the intelligence agencies\u2019 operatives attempted to manipulate the pending litigation in some high-profile cases.\nDue to the full court me\u00ade\u00adting, the proceedings of the cipher case were adjo\u00adu\u00adrned till Wednesday (today).\nSuo motu\nThe Supreme Court has already initiated suo motu action on the letter written by the six judges of the IHC.

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: Low voter turnout, procedural irregularities and restrictions on independent obse\u00adr\u00advation in two provincial constituencies in Punjab overshadowed the improved results management and lower numbers of ballots excluded from the count during April 21 elections in 22 national and provincial assembly constituencies, the Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen) said in its report, released on Tuesday.\nPolling station establishment, voter identification, and counting at polling stations were observed to have been largely compliant with law and procedures. However, instances of omissions in ballot iss\u00aduance requirements by Assistant Presiding Officers (APOs) were reported from around 14 per cent of the observed polling stations.\nWhile polling agents and accre\u00addited observers generally had acc\u00adess to voting and counting process, security officials or presiding offi\u00adcers barred Fafen observers from observing the election process at 19 polling stations in PP-36 Wazi\u00adr\u00adabad and PP-22 Chakwal-cum-Tal\u00ada\u00adgang. In PP-22, the accreditation process of Fafen observers was also delayed until the midday on the polling day causing last-minute changes in the observation scope.\nNearly 36pc registered voters cast their votes on polling day \u2014 9pc less than the turnout in 18 of these constituencies during the Feb 8 general elections. Votes polled by women decreased by 12pc, while votes polled by men declined by 9pc, despite an increase of 75,640 registered voters, including 37,684 men and 37,956 women compared to the general elections.\n\nReport says observers barred from their duties at 19 polling stations in two Punjab constituencies\n\nSharpest decline\nLahore\u2019s five constituencies rec\u00ado\u00adrded the sha\u00adr\u00adpest decline in the vo\u00adter turnout with PP-147 rep\u00ador\u00adt\u00ading a mere 14pc as against 35pc on Feb 8. Similarly, NA-119 Lahore registered a 19pc turnout against 39pc on Feb 8. However, the voter turnout in Gujrat and Khuzdar co\u00adn\u00adstituencies recorded an incr\u00adease compared to general elections.\nThe declining turnout was accompanied by a reduction in the number of ballots excluded from the count during the by-elections, almost halved (35,574) as compared to the number of invalid ballots (72,472) during the general elections.\nThe Election Comm\u00adission of Pakistan issued provisional results for all the constituencies by the legal deadline of 10am on the next day of election, despite suspension of cellular data services in the constituencies in Balochistan, Punjab and Sindh, though KP constituencies did not report any such disruption.\nThe parties that won during the general elections retained their seats in the by-elections, except in PP-36 Wazirabad and PP-93 Bhakkar. In these constituencies, PTI-backed candidate and an independent candidate had won during the general elections, but PML-N candidates emer\u00adged successful in the by-elections. These two were among the four constituencies where the margin of victory has decreased as compared to the Feb 8 general elections unlike the rest where the margin of victory has increased.\nThe by-polls were necessitated due to the death of candidates in four constituencies and vacation of seats by wining candidates in 19 constituencies. PB-50 Killa Abdullah, however, went to re-poll only after a Supreme Court verdict. Of these 24, the ECP notified uncontested returned candidates in NA-207 Shaheed Benazi\u00adrabad-I and PS-80 Dadu-I.\nA PTI-backed independent candidate for NA-207 moved court seeking nullification of the uncontested elections claiming that his nomination was wrongly rejected by the RO.\nThe ECP had set up 4,238 polling stations \u2014 935 for male voters, 899 for female voters and 2,404 combined \u2014 comprising 13,811 polling booths to cater to more than 6.3 million registered voters.\nFafen deployed 259 election day observers to observe the voting and counting processes at 1,036 polling stations in five National Assembly and 17 provincial assembly constituencies (12 in Punjab, three in Balochistan and two in Khyber Pakht\u00adunkhwa).\nThis report is based on the observations received on the election day from 532 polling stations through Fafen\u2019s election day observation mobile app.\n"

            "Text": "\u2022 Pakistan receives $9.8bn in July-March, against annual target of $17.4bn\n\u2022 Low inflows mainly due to adverse global environment, poor credit rating\nISLAMABAD: Pakis\u00adtan received only about $9.8 billion in foreign loans and grants in the first nine months (July-March) of the current fiscal year, far behind the annual target of $17.4bn, amid major slippages in raising international financial support.\nThe disbursements app\u00ade\u00adared to be slowing down as the country rec\u00adeived less than $204 million in foreign loans in March compared to $318m in February, acc\u00adording to official data.\nThe Ministry of Econ\u00ado\u00admic Affairs (MEA) on Tuesday said the government could materialise about $6.899bn in foreign economic assista\u00adnce (FEA) in the first nine months of the current fiscal year, almost 39pc of the annual budget target, amid limited borro\u00adwing avenues in the wake of poor credit rating and adverse conditions in the global financial markets des\u00adpite the support of the Interna\u00adtional Monetary Fund (IMF).\nThis FEA is in addition to $1.9bn released by the IMF out of the $3bn Stand-By Arrange\u00adment (SBA) and $1bn by the United Arab Emir\u00adates that is separately accounted for by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). Thus, total foreign inflows, including from the IMF and the UAE, amounted to $9.799bn in nine months. This generally works out to be almost 55.6pc of the full-year targeted inflows.\nHowever, the authorities now claim that better debt and trade management have reduced the current year\u2019s foreign assistance requirements. Therefore, its target is now tentatively revised to around $11bn instead of the $17.62bn set in the 2023-24 budget for FEA. They are now predicting the current account deficit to be around $2bn instead of about $6bn budget estimate.\nIn its monthly FEA report for March, the MEA said the country received $6.899bn in the July-March period against its annual target of $17.62bn. This meant foreign inflows were over 11pc lower than the $7.8bn of the same period last fiscal year, which was otherwise a very tough period given the challenging relationship with the IMF.\nThe low inflows were mainly due to the adv\u00aderse international environment and Pakistan\u2019s poor credit rating, which make international capital markets a no-go area for Pakistan. Therefore, Pakistan has deferred its plan to launch a $1.5bn Eurobond beca\u00aduse of higher interest rates in the internatio\u00adnal capital markets and the country\u2019s low credit rating. The Economic Affairs Division (EAD) report showed that besi\u00addes the $1.5bn in fresh bonds, the government had also budgeted an\u00adother $4.5bn in foreign commercial loans for the current fiscal year.\nTotal inflows recorded by the EAD in March came in at $218m compared to $333m each in January and February and $1.62m in December.\nDecember 2023 saw three larger disbursements by three major multilaterals \u2014 $638m by the World Bank, $469m by the Asian Development Bank, and $255m by Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).\nThe country received $318m in foreign inflows in October and $321m in September. Major FEA during the first nine months flowed in at $2.89bn in July 2023 soon after Pakistan reached an agreement with the IMF for a fresh short-term programme.\nStrangely, the EAD had accounted $1.16bn receipt from the IMF in the last fiscal year into its FEA inflows but did not depict similar $1.9bn inflows this year. Interestingly, the EAD had projected $3bn from IMF last year but only $1.16bn could be materialised following the derailment of its programme soon after the exit of former finance minister Miftah Ismail.\nFor the current year, the Economic Affairs Division had budgeted $2.4bn from the IMF which later actually committed $3bn in the wake of signing of the SBA, which is ending later this month. The Fund has now already disbursed about $1.9bn, leaving behind only $1.1bn to be released this month.\nThe bulk, or $2.63bn, of foreign loans reported by the EAD in July-March came from Saudi Arabia as a time deposit and oil facility, followed by $1.428bn from the World Bank, $665m from the ADB and a $508m guaranteed loan to Pakistan Air Force (PAF) by China National Aero-Technology Import and Export Corporation. Total inflows from multilaterals, excluding IMF, stood at $2.738bn in the nine months compared to $4bn a year ago.\nInflows from all bilateral lenders, excluding Saudi Arabia, stood at $964m in the nine months. Another $781.5m flowed in from overseas Pakistanis in Naya Pakistan Certificates.\nThe government has estimated about $17.62bn in foreign assistance in the budget for the current fiscal year, \nincluding $17.385bn in loans and the remaining $235m in grants. As such, total loan disbursements in the first nine months stood at $6.899bn and $123m in grants.\nThe EAD said that out of $6.899bn, the bulk of $4.7bn was received for budgetary support or programme loans and about $2.174bn as project aid.\nDuring the last fiscal (FY23), the government had budgeted $22.8bn foreign assistance but could materialise only $10.8bn throughout the year \u2014 about 46pc of the target \u2014 because of the suspension of the IMF programme, leaving a $11.8bn slippage, resulting in depletion of foreign exchange reserves.\nUnlike previous years, Pakistan could tap only three major sources of foreign inflows during the last fiscal year, and the trend continued in the first eight months of the current fiscal year as well. These included bilateral and multilateral lenders and overseas Pakistanis through Naya Pakistan Certificates.\nThis also showed that private commercial banks that had shied away in the absence of the IMF programme last year had not returned to Pakistan so far, as the eight-month inflows remained zero against the full-year budgetary target of $4.5bn.\n"

With a large motorcade, the Iranian president was then driven to the Quaid-i-Azam mausoleum where he offered Fateha.\nAhead of his visit, the provincial government had closed all major road links, suspended cellular services in many city districts, and deployed heavy contingency of police and Rangers all across the metropolis. Since the authorities had already announced a public holiday, business activities were badly hit by the security arrangements convincing traders, transporters, and other segments of the community to stay away from routine operations The arrangements \u201calmost paralysed\u201d the entire traffic system of the city as all major arteries connecting to major thoroughfares were blocked with containers. With helicopters hovering over the city throughout the day as part of security arrangements, almost 4,000 policemen backed by the paramilitary Pakistan Rangers squad were mobilised on the ground to ensure \u201cpeace and tranquillity and security of the foreign dignitaries\u201d.\nLahore visit\nPresident Raisi arrived in the port city after visiting Lahore, where Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz received him. The Iranian president appreciated the \u201ccultural contributions\u201d and \u201cbeauty\u201d of the provincial capital of Punjab.\nHere, President Raisi expressed a desire for enhanced people-to-people contacts with the people of Pakistan, as CM Maryam said that the government wanted to take exchanges with Iran in industry and agriculture to \u201cnew heights\u201d.\nIn a meeting with President Raisi and First Lady Jamila Alamul Huda at the Governor\u2019s House, CM Maryam said, \u201cWe are willing to work with Iran on economic projects to eradicate poverty. We will also welcome Iran\u2019s investment in Punjab\u2019s value-added livestock market.\u201d\nDuring his short stay in Lahore, he visited the mausoleum of Allama Iqbal, Governor\u2019s House, and Government College University. Mr Raisi said: \u201cI do not feel like a stranger at all. There are special emotions and connections with Pakistani people that keep the two nations connected. I wanted that a public rally be held so I could address the public but due to some reasons, the conditionalities were such that it could not be made possible.\u201d\nMr Raisi further said on behalf of the supreme leader of Iran, \u201cI say my greetings to the people of Pakistan and Lahore.\u201d He said he appreciated the revolutionary spirit present in the people here, adding that Allama Iqbal was \u201can extremely important personality for Iran as he was a very inspirational person\u201d.\n\u2018Zionist regime\u2019\nHe also praised Pakistan for taking a strong stance against Zionist forces. \u201cI praise the Pakistani people and government for the stance taken with us (Iran) in a strong manner against Zionist forces,\u201d he said.\nPunjab Governor Balighur Rehman also held a meeting with the Iranian president at the Governor\u2019s House.\nAccording to Reuters, which quoted Iran\u2019s official IRNA news agency, the Iranian president said that an Israeli attack on Iranian territory would bring about a complete change of \u201ccircumstances\u201d.\n\u201cRaisi, who is visiting Pakistan, was quoted as saying such an attack could possibly result in there be nothing left of the \u2018Zionist regime\u2019,\u201d according to Reuters.\n\u2018Beware of sanctions\u2019\nThe US State Department, separately, warned that anyone considering business deals with Iran should be aware of the potential risks of US sanctions, as Washington \u2018forbids\u2019 commercial ties with Tehran.\n\u201cLet me say broadly we advise anyone considering business deals with Iran to be aware of the potential risk of sanctions,\u201d said the department\u2019s Prin\u00adcipal Deputy Spokes\u00adperson Vedant Patel, when asked about efforts to expand trade ties between Pakistan and Iran.\n\u201cBut ultimately, the government of Pakistan can speak to their own foreign policy pursuits,\u201d the US official added.\nAt Tuesday\u2019s briefing, Mr Patel also spoke about a US decision last week to sanction three Chinese and one Belarusian firm for allegedly supplying missile components to Pakistan. \u201cThe sanctions were made because these were entities that were proliferators of weapons of mass destruction and because of the means of their delivery,\u201d he said.\nAnwar Iqbal in Washington contributed to this report\n"

            "Text": "PESHAWAR: Public sector hospitals have started receiving their unpaid amount in lieu of free healthcare services on Sehat Card Plus from State Life Insurance Corporation after release of funds by the government.\n\u201cSince last month, the insurer has paid Rs4 billion to public sector hospitals after receiving Rs5 billion from government. All the main hospitals are treating patients now,\u201d said officials.\nThey said that SLIC, which implemented SCP in the province, had stopped payment to hospitals after stoppage of funds by the caretaker government. However, the incumbent provincial government of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf started payment to the insurance firm, which started full-fledged free treatment services on March 12 in the province.\nOfficials said that caretakers had stopped the programme and allowed only three emergency treatments, citing financial constraints. Public sector hospitals had also stopped receiving patients on SCP due to non-payment of their dues by the insurer. The province\u2019s biggest Lady Reading Hospital had Rs2 billion, Peshawar Institute of Cardiology Rs1.5 billion, Hayatabad Medical Complex Rs600 million and Khyber Teaching Hospital Rs500 million in addition to the outstanding amount of district headquarters hospitals and other medical teaching institutions in districts other than Peshawar.\n\nGovt has to pay Rs20bn to insurance firm for running the programme\n\nOfficials said that government had to pay a total of Rs20 billion to SLIC due to which it had stopped free treatment services. The government is likely to pay another instalment of Rs2.5 billion to the firm within few days for the month of April. Public hospitals would continue to receive the amount on a monthly basis and keep continue services, they added.\nThey said that government wanted to focus on public hospitals for treatment of patients on SCP with a view to strengthen the infrastructure as well as benefit doctors and other staff.\n\u201cThe government has also restricted seven surgeries to public sector hospitals on SCP to put brakes on malpractices by private health facilities,\u201d said officials. Only government hospitals are allowed to carry out common surgeries including caesarean delivery, tonsillectomy, cholecystectomy, appendectomy, cataract, angiography and septoplasty and submucosal resection (SMR).\nPrivate hospitals have been barred from carrying out these procedures to stop malpractices and save the public money as well as health of people. \u201cIn some cases, it has come to the fore that private hospitals have conducted these procedures and surgeries unnecessarily due to which they have stopped them,\u201d said officials.\nThey said that they removed 71 private hospitals from the list of empanelled health facilities for the programme. \u201cThere are now 118 empanelled hospitals including 60 public and 58 private. SLIC will pay to hospitals only when it gets funds from government. Earlier, the insurer paid the hospitals despite non-payment by the government,\u201d they added.\nWith the decrease in number of empanelled hospitals in private sector and restricting common procedures to government hospitals, officials said, monthly cost of the programme would come down from Rs3 billion to 2.5 billion. \u201cIt is a major step towards sustainability of the programme. More private hospitals will lose empanelment as the criteria for selection for treatment of SCP has been tightened to ensure that the people get quality services,\u201d they added.\nHowever, public hospitals were required to provide prompt services to patients so that people don\u2019t go to private hospitals for major treatments.\n"

They, too, were challenged by Mr Gandapur.\nLawyer Adenzai requested that the court declare that the ECP had no jurisdiction to hear the case. He said the petitions filed with the ECP were not maintainable.\nThe petitioners told the ECP that the chief minister had made a misstatement before the returning officer regarding some of his properties, and therefore, he was neither sadiq (truthful) nor amen (righteous), according to him.\nThe lawyer said Mr Gandapur was declared a returned candidate from PK-113 Dera Ismail Khan in the Feb 8 general elections, and a gazette notification was also issued by the ECP in this regard.\nHe said the petitioners before the ECP had sought his disqualification under the Constitution\u2019s Articles 218(3) and 62(1)(F) and different provisions of the Elections Act, 2017.\nThe counsel contended that after the Feb 8 general elections were over and the gazette notification of the successful candidates was issued, the ECP couldn\u2019t deal with the election-related matters, so the petitions of the respondents were \u2018incompetent and not maintainable.\nThey argued that as Mr Gandapur had been elected chief minister, the ECP had overstepped its powers by entertaining the petition.\nThe lawyers said after the notification of election tribunals, the ECP couldn\u2019t hear the matter.\nREPLY SOUGHT: A high court bench consisting of Justice Shakeel Ahmad and Justice Sahibzada Asadullah has sought a reply from the federal government to the petition of PTI leader and MNA Asif Khan against the placing of his name on the provisional national identification list (PNIL) by the Federal Investigation Agency.\nIt adjourned hearing into the petition to May 8, directing the government to inform the court on what grounds the petitioner\u2019s name was placed in the PNIL.\nThe petitioner\u2019s counsel, Syed Sikandar Hayat Shah, argued that his client was elected a member of the National Assembly from Peshawar and that he belonged to a respectable family.\nThe lawyer contended that the petitioner was a law-abiding citizen and couldn\u2019t travel abroad as he came to know about his name in the PNIL.\nHe argued that there was no justification for the government to place the name of the petitioner on that list and deny him the constitutional right to free movement.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The Capital Development Authority\u2019s (CDA) board has approved a new policy regarding commercial plots, enhancing the floor area ratio (FAR) and duration of the payment plan for such pieces of land from one to two years.\nThe board, which met at the CDA headquarters with Chairman Anwarul Haq in the chair on Tuesday approved the said policy besides other decisions. It decided that instead of the full payment, the investors would get possession of the plots after paying only 50pc of the amount, which would allow them to start construction (without rights and registration of 3rd party with the CDA). It was also decided that the CDA would approve the building plan after receiving 25pc payment.\nIn the case of instant payment, the investors will get a 15pc rebate instead of the existing 10pc while those paying in US dollars will get a 20pc rebate. According to the sources, the new policy has increased the FAR to 1:10 from 1:9 for plots measuring 3,000 to 4,999 square yards.\nSimilarly, plots measuring 5,000 sq yards and above would have 1:12 FAR instead of existing 1:10. The board also decided that investors would also be allowed to have underground parking in the \u201cright of way of roads\u201d to meet the requirement at their own cost.\n\nPayment plan enhanced from one to two years; work on Iran Avenue to begin soon\n\nSpeaking to Dawn, one of the committee members elaborated that the building owners would be allowed to have underground parking on the right of way if they had a minimum of three basements reserved for parking. Since the fourth floor for a parking lot is not feasible the developers will be given the option to meet their parking requirement through an underground parking facility in the right of way. \u201cBut first they will need to have three basements for parking,\u201d he said.\nThe board decided that hotel plots measuring 10,000 sq yards would be allowed 1:8 FAR instead of 1:6, with 10pc of permissible FAR for commercial/business centres (inward oriented). Similarly, they will need to allocate 20 per cent of \u201croom areas for serviced apartments\u201d.\nA board member said that the new policy is applicable across Islamabad. If the developers want to enhance the FAR of their existing buildings, they will have to pay the CDA for additional floors. The new rates will be worked out by the finance wing.\nThe CDA board also decided that the work on the remaining portion of 7.5 km of Iran Avenue (formerly 11th Avenue) should be started as soon as possible.\nThe board approved a summary of the engineering wing for hiring the services of a consultant for the design work of the said road before floating tenders for construction. The federal cabinet changed the name of the road from 11th Avenue to Iran Avenue.\nIts first phase from D-12 (where it links with Margalla Road) to E-11 is already constructed and inaugurated by Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday. Its second phase, which is yet to be built, starts from E-11 and would culminate at Karnal Sher Khan Road, formerly I.J.P Road.\n"

The initiative, in collaboration with Murree Brewery, Attock Oil Refinery and the National Cleaner Production Centre aims to promote environmental protection measures.\nThe function was attended by Deputy Director Environment Protection Agency Maria Safeer, along with assistant directors Anza Niazi, Namra Tariq, Romaisa Babar and Inspector Inamul Haq.\nThemed \u2018Plastic vs. Earth\u2019, this year\u2019s Earth Day campaign seeks to tackle the pressing issue of plastic pollution. The EPA Rawalpindi team has distributed cloth bags to children and shops across the city to encourage the use of eco-friendly alternatives. Banners advocating against plastic usage adorned prominent locations in the city to raise awareness among the people.\nIn alignment with the Punjab government regulations, a comprehensive ban has been imposed not only on the sale of plastic bags less than 75 microns but also on various plastic items, including disposables and multi-layer packaging plastic products listed in Schedules 1 and 2 of the Punjab Single-Use Plastic Products Regulation 2023. Stringent penalties and imprisonment await violators.\nMoreover, all plastic manufacturers, collectors and recyclers throughout the province are mandated to register with the Punjab Environment Protection and Climate Change Department to ensure accountability and regulation.\nPlastic pollution poses a significant threat to land, water and air quality, exacerbating environmental degradation. Its adverse effects on human health, including cancer and the ingestion of microplastics present in food, underscore the urgency of addressing this issue.\nThe deputy director emphasised the individual responsibility to opt for cloth bags over plastic ones and choose steel or other environmentally friendly alternatives for food consumption.\n"

They had offered Rs3,000 to the constable to let them enter the zone the next day because their visit to the Thailand embassy had been unfruitful.\nWhen the constable approached the entry section to inquire about the issue, he was told to let them go since they had permission to enter the enclave, sources said, adding that the same men appeared at Gate No.2 the next day and their names were found on the entry list. \nSubsequently, the constable discovered that their names were allegedly added to the list by the personal assistant of the SSP Security Division.\nThe complaint said the constable went on a five-day leave and upon his return, he discovered that he had been removed from duty through a \u201cwireless message\u201d. \nHe subsequently informed the SSP about the matter who appointed an inspector to probe the issue. The next day he was summoned by the inquiry officer to his office and was threatened with dire consequences, the sources said, adding that the constable was further told that there would be no inquiry over the matter.\n\u2018Two-month ordeal\u2019\nLater, the inquiry officer got him deployed at the National Police Club through the OSI (orderly sub-inspector) Security Division, they said, adding that later the OSI called him to the OSI branch and informed him that he was transferred to the Police Lines Headquarters from the Security Division and gave him the order report.\nWhen the constable reached the OSI branch of the headquarters he was informed by the in-charge that he was yet to be transferred and asked him to report to the Security Division. He reported to the OSI branch of the Security Division from where he was sent to the Special Branch. After a few days, he was again asked to report to the Headquarters, only to be told that he was yet to be transferred.\nAfter a two-month ordeal, the constable approached the IGP office last month and an inquiry was ordered, which still needs to be completed.\nAccording to sources, an official can only be transferred to another division under the orders of the division\u2019s head, i.e. the DIG. \nSimilarly, the offices of the SP Diplomatic Enclave and SSP Security Division monitor the entry of vehicles to the enclave, they claimed.\nThe police PRO confirmed the incident. He said the constable was reinstated to the Security Division, adding that those mentioned in the complaint were transferred \u201cand closed to the Police Lines Headquarters for further legal action\u201d. \nHe said that the assistant inspector general of police (operations) was conducting an inquiry to fix the responsibility, which is still in progress.\nHe also confirmed that without the order of the respective DIG, an official cannot be transferred to another division. \nThe constable was allegedly transferred to the headquarters through the in-charge of the OSI branch of the Security Division under the orders of the SSP Security Division. \nHe also confirmed that the entry list of private vehicles to the Diplomatic Enclave was monitored by the SSP Security and SP Security and compiled by their offices.\n"

Fadil, who called on him on Tuesday. \nThe meeting was attended by Secretary Education Mohyuddin Ahmed Wani and other senior officials.\nMr Siddiqui acknowledged the services of Unicef in the education sector of Pakistan and appreciated its role in helping the country create equal access to quality education for the citizens.\nHe said the ministry of education was working on a holistic plan to create a \u2018National Education Framework\u2019 under which the federation and the provinces would be equal stakeholders.\nThis policy would be launched within a month, he said, adding that all provinces along with donor partners would be taken on board to create a national consensus.\nThe minister said the feudalisation of education needs to end, adding it was high time that every Pakistani can attain their right to education irrespective of their background. \nMr Fadil said Unicef has been present in Pakistan since 1948. He said it supports efforts to increase access to quality education for all children in Pakistan with a focus on marginalised and vulnerable populations.\n\u201cThis includes initiatives to improve school enrollment, retention and learning outcomes as well as promoting inclusive and child-friendly learning environments,\u201d he said, adding Unicef spent $150 million from 2018\u20132013 on its education programme in Pakistan and that this budget had been increased to about $250 million for the next five years. He said that the forum of Foundational Learning Alliance which included all the major donors in Pakistan would be keen to join the concerted effort under the banner of the National Education Policy.\nThe education secretary said the federal government will pledge support for the underprivileged areas of the provinces such as slums to ensure broader inclusiveness under the National Education Policy.\nThe ministry has also launched a national nutritional strategy under which meals were being provided to underprivileged students in Islamabad to ensure their attendance in schools. He also said early childhood development (ECD) was a key priority area whose scope needs to be expanded.\nThe Unicef representative acknowledged its importance and committed to launching a pilot project of ECD in Islamabad.\n"

The Islamabad Club auditorium provided a decent setting for this type of performance where the audience witnessed a master at work, and be part of an evening filled with stunning musicianship and captivating melodies.\nPeople were treated to a journey through musical landscapes as Thibault Cauvin showcased his mastery on the classical guitar. \nDrawing inspiration from South America, his initial compositions set the stage for a captivating performance. As the evening progressed, Cauvin mesmerised listeners with pieces influenced by movies he encountered during his travels, each note carrying the essence of his experiences.\nOne particular composition, inspired by a tale from Turkey, transported the audience to a realm of beauty and complexity inherent in classical guitar. However, it was the grand finale that truly stole the show. Collaborating with flute and tabla players from Lahore, Cauvin delved into a mesmerising exploration of the guitar\u2019s boundless expressive capabilities, paying homage to the rich cultural tapestry of the city.\nThibault Cauvin\u2019s father was himself a musician, therefore he followed the natural path. \nHe first studied at the Bordeaux Conservatoire and later at the Paris Conservatoire National Superieur, graduating with honours. He won 36 international prizes, including 13 first prizes. At the age of 20, he became the most successful guitarist in the world.\nSince then, Thibault has traveled to more than 120 countries for nearly 1,500 performances, from the most prestigious stages to the most atypical places, from New York\u2019s Carnegie Hall to the Eiffel Tower, from Moscow\u2019s Tchaikovsky Hall to Beijing\u2019s Forbidden City, from London\u2019s Queen Elizabeth Hall to Carthage\u2019s Acropollium. \nThibault\u2019s guitar has no borders, no limits, one evening 40,000 people could hear him on the beach of Royan in France, two days later he played in a ruined temple in Ecuador for as few as 200 privileged people.\n"

            "Text": "MUZAFFARABAD: The Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) government has accorded approval to provision of Rs411 million to 10 district councils and five municipal corporations to help them carry out developmental activities in accordance with the laid down procedure.\nThrough the second tranche, which would also be released soon, the remaining LG institutions would also be accommodated on the same pattern, said AJK minister for local government and rural development (LG&RD) Faisal Mumtaz Rathore at a press talk here on Tuesday.\nLG&RD secretary Syed Shahid Mohyiddin Qadri and information and forest secretary Ansar Yaqoob were also present on the occasion.\nThe local government (LG) elections were held in AJK in 2022 in three phases after a gap of more than three decades. However, the elected councillors had been continually expressing dissatisfaction that neither did they possess fiscal resources nor administrative authority to come up to the expectations of their electorate.\nLast year, the government had constituted a committee, headed by Mr Rathore, to find a practicable solution to the issue in keeping with the fiscal position of the state.\nMr Rathore said the committee had unanimously recommended to the government to allocate development funds for the LG institutions following which it was decided to spare Rs819 million from \u201cblock provision for new initiatives\u201d \u2013 a head in the annual development programme of the LG&RD department \u2013 for the purpose.\nUnder the first tranche, 133 wards of the five municipal corporations of state - Muzaffarabad, Bagh, Rawalakot, Kotli and Mirpur - and 278 union councils (UC) of all 10 district councils would get Rs1 million each grant for development purpose at the discretion of the elected councillor concerned.\nThe next tranche of Rs408 million would disburse Rs1 million each to 278 union councils, 77 wards of 14 municipal committees and 53 wards of 12 town committees, to be spent at the discretion of the UC chairman and municipal and town committee councillors, respectively, Mr Rathore said.\n\u201cThis is a big initiative whose credit must be given to the present government,\u201d he said.\nThe LG&RD minister expressed the hope that the councillors would make best possible utilisation of these funds in accordance with the laid down procedure.\nHe advised the LG institutions to set a benchmark whereby no scheme worth less than Rs100,000 should be entertained and approved.\n\u201cI will also advise the LG institutions not to remain dependent on aid from the government. Instead, they should generate their own resources to meet their needs,\u201d he said.\nResponding to a question, Mr Rathore said the government had also prepared a mechanism to put to rest a widely prevailing impression that the LG&RD schemes were meant to accommodate political workers, instead of being executed on the ground.\n\u201cNow funds would be disbursed on the basis of \u2018work done\u2019 in a visible contrast to the earlier practice of advance withdrawal of funds,\u201d he said, adding a mobile phone application would also help the higher authorities to conduct physical verification of schemes.\n"

Targets for other crops such as mung, mash, and chilies were also fixed.\nChaired by Minister for National Food Security and Research, Rana Tanveer Hussain, the committee meeting, attended by provincial agricultural departments and key stakeholders, noted that water availability in canals will remain at 63.61 million acre-feet (MAF), compared to last year\u2019s 61.85 MAF.

Disbursements up to February 2023 reached Rs1,073.5bn, which is 59 per cent of the overall annual target of Rs1,819bn and 28.5pc higher than the disbursement of Rs835.3bn made during the previous year.\nThe Meteorological Department informed the FCA meeting that from April to June, normal to slightly above normal precipitation is expected in most parts of the country, particularly over upper Punjab from May to July. \nAbove normal precipitation is likely in August and September 2024. The area-weighted normal rainfall of Pakistan during the monsoon season is 140.8 millimetres. \nWhile reviewing the performance of the outgoing rabi season crops for 2023-24, the committee observed that wheat production is estimated at 29.69m tonnes from an area of 9.6m hectares, a 5.4pc increase over the last year.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The World Bank projects that global commodity prices will fall 3 per cent in 2024, but the conflict in the Middle East could halt the inflationary decline.\n\u201cThe World Bank commodity price index is expected to fall 4pc in 2024, following a projected decline of nearly 24pc in 2023, the sharpest drop since the pandemic\u201d, noted the latest Commodity Markets Outlook (CMO) released on Thursday.\nEnergy prices are expected to decline by almost 5pc in 2024 and remain relatively stable in 2025. Agriculture prices are expected to decline over the forecast period, while metal prices are set to fall in 2024 but see a 6pc uptick in 2025, the CMO forecast assuming that the conflict in the Middle East will have a limited impact on commodity prices, though geopolitical risks remain high.\nOn the other hand, disappointing global growth presented a downside risk, especially for industrial commodities, the CMO said. Additional trade restrictions and intensification of El Ni\u00f1o could push food prices higher, it warned.\n\nWarns ME tensions could hit global progress on inflation\n\nThe report said global commodity prices were now leveling off after a steep descent that played a decisive role in reducing overall inflation last year. This could make it harder for central banks to cut interest rates quickly.\nThe World Bank\u2019s forecasts call for a decline of 3pc in global commodity prices in 2024 and 4pc in 2025. That pace will do little to subdue inflation that remains above central bank targets in most countries. It will keep commodity prices about 38pc higher than they were on average in the five years before the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\u201cGlobal inflation remains undefeated,\u201d said Indermit Gill, the World Bank Group\u2019s Chief Economist and Senior Vice President. \u201cA key force for disinflation \u2014 falling commodity prices \u2014 has essentially hit a wall. That means interest rates could remain higher than currently expected this year and next. The world is at a vulnerable moment: a major energy shock could undermine much of the progress in reducing inflation over the past two years.\u201d\nPersistently high geopolitical tensions over the past two years have propped up the price of oil and many other critical commodities even as global growth has slowed. The price of Brent crude oil, for example, surged to $91 per barrel earlier this month \u2014 nearly $34 per barrel above the 2015-2019 average.\nThe CMO projected that Brent prices will average $84 per barrel in 2024 before declining to an average of $79 in 2025, assuming no conflict-related supply disruptions.\n"

The anticipated demand for the kharif season is approximately 3.442 million tonnes. The available stock in the country stood at approximately 3.192m tonnes. The shortfall will be met by importing 200,000 tonnes, and the rest will be met by increasing production in the local fertiliser plants.\n\u201cAll local urea plants will remain operational at full capacity to meet the demand,\u201d the statement said, adding that the government was ensuring smooth gas supply to the fertiliser industry.\nThe minister said the timely arrival of imported urea would help ensure food security by increasing farmers\u2019 productivity and stabilising local prices.\n"

He recalled that the decision to hold negotiations with the militants was taken during an in-camera joint sitting of parliament which was also attended by the top military officials. \nMr Tarar said following the 18th Amendment, it was the provinces\u2019 responsibility to improve law and order, adding that the federal government was ready to assist them in this regard. \nRaising the issue, MQM\u2019s Nikhat Shakeel regretted that several young people lost their lives during mobile phone snatching incidents in Karachi. If the Sindh police had failed in performing their duties, then what role the federal government was playing, she wondered. \nMNAs Rana Ansar and Sabheen Ghouri asked the federal government to announce a policy of paying compensation to the victims of street crimes. \nSyed Waseem Hussain, an MNA from Hyderabad, said 60 to 70 people lost their lives in three months during street crimes in Karachi. He said in the past, too, they had witnessed the prime ministers\u2019 visits, formation of committees and JITs, but there was no improvement. He said the federal government could not absolve itself by merely declaring it a provincial subject. \nTravel bar \nThe PTI members also protested over the inclusion of party legislators in the exit control list (ECL) and no-fly lists and asked the government to remove their names. They also protested over the information minister\u2019s reply when he asked them for a list so that he could provide information to them. \nPTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan was of the view that instead of seeking the list, the minister should have provided them the required information. \nHe said it was not difficult for the government to search the names of parliamentarians in the lists and remove them. \nThe minister pointed out that the ECL contained the names of 4,842 people whereas 1,926 people had been placed on the PNIL (Provisional National Identification List) and both the lists had been prepared by the departments concerned following the legal procedure. \nThe PTI members accused the government of placing their names on the ECL as part of the alleged ongoing political victimisation. \nDeputy Speaker Ghulam Mustafa Shah was apparently unable to run the house smoothly as on a number of occasions he was found helpless when lawmakers simultaneously started speaking, creating a fuss in the house. \nAt the outset, the treasury and opposition members protested over the absence of ministers, particularly Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, as the house was to take up the issues related to his ministry. \nThe NA will meet again on Friday morning.\n"

Nawaz Sharif did the same when he was in power and CM Maryam has followed him,\u201d Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said in a statement.\nMs Bokhari said that by donning the police uniform, the chief minister had, in fact, increased the res\u00adp\u00adect of the Punjab police, and advised her detractors not to be jealous.\nIn a statement on X (formerly Twitter), the Punjab police shared a copy of the relevant rules that govern how governors and chief ministers can dress on formal occasions.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs per the amended Punjab Police Dress Regulations, \u201cchief minister may wear uniform on formal occasions like review of parades, while addressing police darbars, visiting police establishments or any such occasion as specified, for encouraging the police personnel and troops.\u201d\n\u201cThis has been widely celebrated by the police personnel, who view it as a commendable show of solidarity.  The Central Police Office has received hundreds of messages in which police personnel have lauded this step. Female police officers are celebrating the event and have shared various pictures of Madam CM Punjab in uniform,\u201d the police department tweeted.\nTalking to Dawn, a former inspector general of police also said that the chief minister had not committed any violation of the law by donning the police uniform.\n\u201cThere has been a practice of nominating someone like cricketers, children etc as goodwill ambassadors of police, and that person also wears the uniform. Similarly, a DPO is authorised to declare anyone a special police officer,\u201d he said, adding that only someone was liable for prosecution only if they put on a police uniform with the intention to deceive or defraud.\n"

            "Text": "KARACHI: Former Pakistan women\u2019s team captain Bismah Maroof announced her retirement from all cricket with immediate effect on Thursday.\nBismah\u2019s decision came two days after Pakistan were subjected to a 3-0 One-day International whitewash by a visiting West Indies side here. \nThe two teams are set to take on each other for as many Twenty20 matches from Friday, and Bismah, who was named in the squad for the series initially, is not be available for it anymore. Her replacement is likely to be announced after the first match.\nIn the ODI series, Bismah could manage only 91 runs in the three matches as Pakistan failed to show any sort of resistance against Hayley Matthews\u2019 side.\nThe left-handed batter represented Pakistan in 276 international matches \u2014 the most for any women cricketer from the country \u2014 after making her debut in an ODI against India in 2006. \nShe played her first T20I against Ireland three years later.\nDuring her time as a Pakistan player, she accumulated 6262 runs, including 33 half centuries and bagged 88 wickets with her right-arm leg-spin. \n\u201cI have decided to retire from the game I love the most,\u201d Bismah was quoted as saying in a statement released by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Thursday. \u201cIt has been an incredible journey, filled with challenges, victories, and unforgettable memories. \n\u201cI want to express my gratitude to my family, who has supported me throughout my cricketing journey, from the very beginning until now. \n\u201cI also want to extend my thanks to the Pakistan Cricket Board for believing in me and providing the platform to showcase my talent.\u201d\nBismah was handed the Pakistan T20I captaincy in June 2016 and then the ODI role in September 2017. \nShe took an indefinite break in December 2020 to prepare for the birth of her daughter, Fatima, and then take care of her but returned in January 2022 for the ODI World Cup.\nThe PCB introduced a parental policy to support Bismah as she juggled motherhood with cricket.\n\u201cThe support from the PCB has been invaluable, particularly in implementing the first-ever parental policy for me, which enabled me to represent my country at the highest level while being a mother,\u201d she said.\nBismah was part of the Pakistan side team that won the gold medal twice in the Asian Games, in 2010 and 2014. She also represented the national side in four editions of the ODI World Cup (2009, 2013, 2017, and 2022), captaining the team in the 2022 edition held in New Zealand. \nBismah played eight editions of the T20 World Cup (2009, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2020, and 2023) and led the side in the 2020 and 2023 editions held in Australia and South Africa, respectively.\n"

            "Text": "LAHORE: Silence engulfed the fully-packed Gaddafi Stadium as Ben Sears punched into the air and Fakhar Zaman hung his head, walking dejected towards the pavilion.\nWith notions on the rise that Fakhar\u2019s time as a Pakistan player was over, the left-hander was featuring for the first time in the penultimate of the five-match Twenty20 International series here on Thursday.\nAnd he was standing tall while all his colleagues failed to negotiate with a 179-run target set by a third-string New Zealand side. After Pakistan had fallen to 80-4 by the halfway stage, Fakhar, with Iftikhar Ahmed\u2019s support, had kept the hosts alive with his trademark power-hitting on a slow surface.\nBut soon after Iftikhar lofted a drive into the hands of James Neesham at deep cover to give pacer William O\u2019Rourke his third wicket in the 17th over, Fakhar uncharacteristically flicked Sears directly to Dean Foxcroft at the square-leg boundary to find his dreams of a resurgent win for Pakistan shattered with 61 off 45 balls against his name.\nThere was still hope, but a special effort was required. And was expected from Imad Wasim. The veteran, however, had to see off Abbas Afridi \u2014 to a horrific run-out \u2014 and Usama Mir at the other end.\nWith the four brave boundaries that he hit, all Imad could do was to reduce the distance between Pakistan and a win to four runs. For New Zealand, the victory meant they could not lose the series if not win it. Pakistan, meanwhile, have a plethora of questions as they build up towards the T20 World Cup.\nAfter pacers Abbas and Mohammad Amir had restricted New Zealand from piling up bigger total, Pakistan\u2019s show in the powerplay was poor as they lost three wickets \u2014 those of captain Babar Azam, his opening partner Saim Ayub and Usman Khan \u2014 for 47 runs while the field restrictions prevailed.\nFakhar took up the rescue mission, and the southpaw got going with a towering six over square leg off a half-tracker by leg-spinner Ish Sodhi before placing him intelligently through point for four more in the ninth over. \nBut right when a partnership between Fakhar and Shadab Khan was taking a direction, the latter holed New Zealand captain and off-spinner Michael Bracewell out to Neesham at deep midwicket to leave Pakistan needing 99 to win in the last 10 overs.\nNew Zealand kept it tight with the ball hardly coming onto the bat until in the 14th over, Fakhar launched Bracewell over long-on for six before Iftikhar cleared long-off for another as Pakistan hoped for recovery.\nFakhar lifted Duffy over long-off two overs later to bring up his half-century in 38 balls before losing Iftikhar and then falling himself to effectively kill Pakistan\u2019s hopes. \nPut into bat first on a belter of a surface, New Zealand got off to an explosive start before the Pakistan bowlers put the brakes on the flow of runs in the latter stages of the innings.\nThe major damage from the BlackCaps\u2019 side was caused by openers Tom Blundell and Tim Robinson, who smashed 28 off 15 and 51 off 26 respectively. \nBut then Abbas stood out for Pakistan with three wickets for 20 runs in three overs, while Amir responded to a beating in the first over by conceding only 18 runs in his next three.\nBlundell and Robinson had boosted the visitors to 54-1 by the end of the powerplay, on the last ball of which Blundell fell to Zaman Khan.\nThe incoming Foxcroft was dropped by spinner Imad off his own bowling when he was playing at four. Robinson continued the attack and brought up his 50 in 34 balls at almost the halfway stage, with New Zealand cruising at 93-1.\nThe right-hander, however, gave away his wicket in the very next over, skying a slower one by Abbas for Iftikhar to take a well-judged catch at the long-on boundary.\nNew Zealand were barely moved by Robinson\u2019s dismissal as the incoming Mark Chapman authoritatively cut Abbas for a boundary on the very first ball that he faced before Foxcroft used his feet brilliantly to dispatch Usama for two sixes in the next over.\nAmid the fireworks by the BlackCaps, Shadab pulled up a spectacular fielding effort to dismiss Chapman off Iftikhar\u2019s off-spin. A livewire of a fielder, Shadab dived to his left to take a one-handed catch at cover as the left-hander made room in an attempt to hit Iftikhar. \nPakistan struck again in the next over when Foxcroft holed Usama out to Fakhar at the deep mid-wicket boundary. Bracewell also fell to a decent catch by Iftikhar at the long-on boundary again, becoming Abbas\u2019 second wicket in the penultimate over.\nAbbas followed that up with a perfect yorker to castle Josh Clarkson before Amir took deceived Sodhi to take his only wicket on the last ball of the New Zealand innings.\nSCOREBOARD\nNEW ZEALAND:\nT.

If anybody, including the chief justice, was scared, then they should vacate their premises and sit at home, he further remarked. \nHe also stated that in case of any security threat, such barricades and barriers might be placed inside the premises of respective government offices/buildings, but should not be on the pavements or roads. \nThe CJP remarked that initially, barriers were also placed on the road outside the apex court building by police, but he immediately ordered removal of such obstacles, adding that no one could be allowed to obstruct free movement of the public. \nHe also said that the authorities were asking the citizens/private persons to vacate public spaces, but on the other hand, federal and provincial government entities/officials were themselves occupying public spaces. The CJP made it clear that such double standard would not be tolerated. \nMany roads and pavements in the city had been encroached upon by the government functionaries and if the governments did not abide by law, how could they expect from people to do so, he asked. \nWhen the CJP inquired about the status of the Jinnah Courts, which is housing headquarters of the paramilitary force, the advocate general Sindh replied that the heritage building belonged to the Sindh government and was handed over to Rangers. \nThe bench also expressed resentment over digging of pavement by power utility and said that such ditches were left open, causing inconvenience to the public. It also deplored the dilapidated condition of several thoroughfares of the city. \nThe bench also directed its office to forward that order to federal and provincial authorities and local administrations as well as landowning agencies through the federal and provincial law officers for compliance. \n"

            "Text": "KARACHI: Massive encroachment of storm water drains across the city and lack of a system for their periodic cleaning throughout the year were identified as major reasons for flooding in the city by experts at a programme held on Wednesday. \nThe event on urban flooding was organised at the Climate Action Centre (CAC). \nDuring the discussion, the panellists including experts in hydrology, meteorology and urban planning emphasised that the root causes of Karachi\u2019s flooding must be identified to implement effective prevention strategies. \nSpeaking about climate change, Chief Meteorologist Dr Sardar Sarfaraz said that the rising global temperature by 1.2 degrees Celsius had significantly increased the intensity of floods in the world, especially in vulnerable countries like Pakistan that saw devastating floods in 2022 when one third of the country was submerged. \n\nLikelihood of floods has increased by 30 times due to climate change, meteorologist says \n\n\u201cIn fact, the likelihood of such devastating floods has increased by 30 times due to climate change,\u201d he warned.\nOther speakers highlighted shortcomings in Karachi\u2019s infrastructure and planning that had made the city so vulnerable that a significant section of the city got flooded even by light rain.\nHydrologist Sana Adnan noted that the current practice of cleaning storm drains only before the monsoon season was a major reason for flooded roads, though it\u2019s common knowledge that heavy rains could occur anytime of the year.\nAccording to her, Karachi needs a comprehensive master plan for storm water management including complete separation of storm water drainage from the sewerage system and properly designed storm water system in areas where it doesn\u2019t exist.\n\u201cWe need proper and permanent profiling of all roads to support the overland flows towards drainage nullahs and drains and ensure that all encroaching infrastructures constructed over drains and outfall pathways are removed,\u201d Ms Adnan said.\nShe also emphasised the need for restoring drains and channels to their original capacity, implementing a comprehensive solid waste management system from primary to secondary collection system and then final disposal of waste at landfill sites that should be provided outside the city.\n\u201cKarachi generates 20,000 tonnes of solid waste per day but only 3,000 tonnes to 4,000 tonnes of waste is picked up. The city\u2019s population has grown dramatically but its solid and drainage system hasn\u2019t been upgraded to meet the needs of a growing city,\u201d she said, adding the city had a large unregistered population.Govt plans lack adaptation strategies\nMost participants raised the concern that though the province of Sindh had a separate directorate for climate change as well as a policy on the phenomenon, its manual on planning and development had no mention of climate change adaptation. Hence, the government projects didn\u2019t include strategies and action plans for implementation.\nThat\u2019s why storm water drains, a participant pointed out, were not periodically cleaned and the finance department released funds for the task just before the monsoon season.\nIt was also stated that the city had over 3,000km long network of drainage but the Karachi Water Sewerage Services and Improvement Project would cover only 160km of the system.\nExpert on urban planning Bilal Khalid underscored the urgent need for a well-defined administrative plan based on modern principles.  He stated, \u201cKarachi faces multifaceted challenges and it will remain vulnerable to any climate disaster unless a comprehensive and strategically designed plan is implemented.\u201d\nDirector CAC Yasir Darya also spoke.\n"

He also said that it was heartening to know that the RMAF award was given regardless of nationality, religion and ethnicity. \nThe Ramon Magsaysay Award, Asia\u2019s premier prize and highest honour, recognizes the greatness of spirit shown in selfless service to the people of Asia regardless of race, gender or religion.\nThere have been 13 laureates from Pakistan of the award until now which are Henry Holland and Ronald Holland, Akhter Hameed Khan, Abdul Sattar Edhi and Bilqis Bano Edhi, Shoaib Sultan Khan, Asma Jahangir, Syed Adibul Hasan Rizvi, Tasneem Ahmed Siddiqui, Ruth Pfau, Ibn Abdur Rehman, The Citizens Foundation (TCF) and Muhammad Amjad Saqib.\nThe Chairperson of the RMAF Cecilia Lazaro hailed the Ramon Magsaysay Awardees from Pakistan as true heroes, acknowledging their unwavering dedication to fighting injustice and serving humanity with hope and optimism.\nRMAF President Susanna B. Afan, through an online message emphasised the collective spirit of the awardees. \u201cTheir greatness of spirit is evident to address problems of human development, to forge partnerships, foster collaboration, and amplify their impact on a scale previously unimaginable,\u201d she said.\nAhsan Saleem, chairman of the TCF, shared that it was a non-profit organisation set up in 1995 by a group of citizens.\n\u201cTCF is now one of Pakistan\u2019s leading organisations in the field of education for the less privileged. The TCF model focuses on providing quality education through purpose-built schools. The organisation strives to ensure gender balance in its classrooms. To magnify its impact, and improve enrolment and quality of education, TCF is now adopting government schools across Pakistan,\u201d he said.\n"

He added that the pickup had been impounded and needed to undergo a Motor Vehicle Inspection (MVI).\nThe IO also informed the court that the suspect\u2019s driving license also needed to be verified from Hyderabad.\nHowever, the court granted bail to the suspect against a surety bond in sum of over Rs6.7 million on the grounds that the offences included in the FIR were bailable.\nIn its order, the court said: \u201cThe offences 320 [unintentional murder by rash or negligent driving], 427 [causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees] of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) are bailable in nature as per [second] schedule of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), hence at the first instance the accused asked to furnish solvent surety in the sum of Rs67,57,902, adding that \u201c the amount equivalent to the value of Diyat as prescribed under Section 323 PPC.\u201d\nThe court also ruled that if the suspect failed to furnish a surety bond he would be sent to prison, and directed IO to submit challan report until May 8.\nAccording to the FIR, the case was registered on the complaint of the father of the victim, who stated to police that he had received a phone call from an ambulance driver who informed him that near the Abdullah Shah Gazi shrine, a white car with registration number GPA-883 had been involved in an accident with his son, who was being taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) in critical condition.\nFurthermore, when the victim\u2019s father reached the hospital, he learned that his son\u2019s death was caused by injuries to his head and face when the car had knocked him down.\n"

However, the recommendations outlined in the inquiry report deemed former SP Nayyar responsible for his death.\nAccording to recommendations of an enquiry report compiled by DIG-West Irfan Ali Baloch: \u201cSP Nayyar is responsible not only for the arrest of Moiz, but also for taking him out of the police station overnight during which Moiz died. Later, he (Nayyar) also tried to manage the post-mortem report of the deceased without timely informing the senior command. This puts the responsibility of the murder of Moiz on the shoulders of SP Nayyar who should be included in the investigation in case.\u201d\nThe report also added: \u201cThe SHO of Darakhshan failed to inform seniors about the incident, resulting in the escalation of events, which could have been avoided if the SHO had timely communicated to seniors. Moreover, he was not present at the police station, and left for home instead of probing what was happening at his police station. This makes him liable for a departmental action.\u201d\n"

Mr Rind, in his petition had also sought a stay order against her oath-taking.\nThe petition was originally filed in SHC\u2019s principal seat but was transferred to the Hyderabad circuit and placed before the division bench comprising Justice Khadim Hussain Tunio and Justice Yousuf Ali Sayeed. The bench rejected it through an order authored by Justice Tunio. \nAccording to the order, the petition had been repeated after its \u201cdismissal as not pressed unconditionally\u201d. He prayed the court to set aside the March 29 notification issued by the returning officer concerned.\nMr Rind had also prayed the court to set aside the earlier (March 28) order passed by the Election Tribunal regarding Wapda dues outstanding against him and to reject respondent Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari\u2019s of form-34 for NA-207 issued to her by the returning officer. \nHe sought court\u2019s directive to the returning to accept his nomination papers and enlist his name as contesting candidate [for the Feb 8 elections].\nJustice Tunio observed in his order that the basis of instant and previous petition remained identical. After announcement of Feb 8 general election schedule by Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) the petitioner filed his papers to contest elections from NA-207 Shaheed Benazirabad-I against which objections were filed. \nThe RO considered objections and his nomination papers were rejected. He noted that the petitioner had questioned RO\u2019s order before Election Tribunal which decided it on March 28, directing the RO to accept papers of the petitioner for NA-207 subject to payment of electricity dues by the petitioner.\nSimultaneously, he further noted, the petitioner filed a petition wherein his relief was same and upon election appeal being allowed his counsel under instructions did not press the petition which was dismissed on April 3 with no stipulation or express permission for its re-institution or even for filing of subsequent petition on the same grounds and for the same relief.\nThe court asked petitioner\u2019s counsel to satisfy court how could the petition be entertained after an earlier one had been dismissed and the petitioner had been granted relief conditionally in election appeal by him which he could not avail. \nThe court said: \u201cNo proper answers were given besides grounds available in petition being reiterated which, we may add, were substantiated by no evidence\u201d.\nDeputy Attorney General Parkash Kumar submitted in court that the subsequent petition was not maintainable. \nAdditional Advocate General Allah Bachayo Soomro and Assistant AG Sindh Rafiq Ahmed Dahiri agreed that the petition could not be instituted after the earlier one was dismissed.\nThe court said that respondent-7 [Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari] had already been declared elected unopposed and sole returned candidate by the ECP through a notification dated April 1 and she had taken oath as MNA. \nThe court said after taking remedy from Election Tribunal the petitioner failed to clear his dues and only stated that now that reference number of bill was allegedly incorrect.\n\u201cThis oversight is something he ought to have checked even before going to Election Tribunal which will have been appropriate time to address it as well. Suffice it to say that he slept on the matter until results of election came knocking. More, the petitioner was not accompanied by any proof of any manner to show that reference number of utility bill was incorrect. It is for these reasons that the instant petition is dismissed in limine by us through short order dated April 24,\u201d said order.\n"

            "Text": "WASHINGTON / ISLAMABAD: The US State Department emphatically declared on Thursday that there\u2019s \u2018absolutely no\u2019 undercurrent of discord between the United States and Pakistan, despite recent sanctions imposed on companies allegedly supplying missile components to Islamabad.\nMeanwhile, the Foreign Office on Thursday dismissed the assessment of Pakistan\u2019s human rights situation in the recently launched US State Department\u2019s Human Rights Report as \u201cunfair and politically motivated\u201d and criticised it for lacking objectivity.\n\u201cPakistan continues to be one of our most important partners in the region,\u201d Principal Deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel said, addressing concerns about potential tensions arising from the sanctions, during the daily news briefing.\nResponding to queries, Patel said: \u201cThere continues to be a lot of cooperation that we have with the government of Pakistan, especially in the security space and trade sector.\u201d\n\nForeign Office dismisses US report on human rights situation in Pakistan\n\nHe recalled that the Pakistani finance minister was in Washington last week and held consultations with members of the State Department. \u201cThis is a robust relationship, and we look to continue strengthening it,\u201d he added.\nLast week, the Biden administration imposed sanctions on three Chinese and one Belarusian companies for allegedly supplying dual-use components for Pakistan\u2019s missile programme, a charge Islamabad rejected as incorrect.\nHowever, on Tuesday, Patel clarified during his daily briefing that the sanctions were imposed because these entities were \u201cproliferators of weapons of mass destruction and the means of their delivery\u201d.\nHe said that on October 23, the United States had also designated three Chinese entities for allegedly supplying components to Pakistan\u2019s missile programme.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to disrupt and take actions against proliferation networks and concerning weapons of mass destruction procurement activities wherever they may occur,\u201d he declared.\nFO rejects US report\nThe 2023 US Human Rights Report on Pakistan underscored a concerning status quo in human rights violations, with no notable improvements. The report alleged a range of serious issues, including unlawful killings, enforced disappearances, torture, harsh prison conditions, arbitrary arrests and a lack of fair public trials, all indicative of a broader culture of impunity.\nIn its response on Thursday, the Foreign Office said: \u201cThe US State Department\u2019s annual exercises of preparing such unsolicited reports lack objectivity and remain inherently flawed in their methodology. These reports use domestic social lens to judge human rights in other countries in a politically biased manner.\u201d\nThe report alleges that government forces were frequently implicated in abuses, along with severe restrictions on freedoms of expression, assembly, and media \u2014 manifested through censorship and violence against journalists.\nThe FO criticised the report for exhibiting double standards, arguing that such attitude undermined the discourse on international human rights.\n\u201cIt is deeply concerning that a report purported to highlight human rights situations around the world ignores or downplays the most urgent hotspots of gross human rights violations such as in Gaza and Indian Occupied Jammu & Kashmir,\u201d the FO stated, emphasising that only a report with political motivations could neglect the grave conditions in Gaza, including the weaponisation of humanitarian aid and the killing of over 33,000 civilians.\n"

Subsequently, Justice Isa summoned a full court meeting of the Supreme Court judges.\nAfter a meeting between Justice Isa and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on March 28, the duo decided to form a commission to investigate interference allegations in judicial affairs following the cabinet\u2019s approval.\nHowever, former CJP Tassaduq Hussain Jillani, who was appointed to head the commission, recused himself from the matter, prompting the Supreme Court to take a suo motu notice of the issue.\nOn April 3, Justice Isa asserted that any attack on the judiciary\u2019s independence would not be tolerated as he hinted at forming a full court to hear the suo motu case.\nA six-judge Supreme Court bench will resume the hearing of the case on April 30. Headed by Chief Justice Isa, the bench will also include Justices Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Jamal Khan Mandokhel, Athar Minallah, Musarrat Hilali and Naeem Akhtar Afghan. Earlier, Justice Yahya Afridi recused himself from the bench.\nIn his SHCBA address on Thursday, Justice Isa said the incidents mentioned in the IHC letter were from before his tenure as the top judge began.\n\u201cI would like to say one thing that since I have been chief justice, I have not received a single complaint from any high court judge that there has been any interference in their work,\u201d the chief justice said.\n\u201cNow, if there has been any interference in their work, it has not been reported to me and all the incidents that were mentioned were before my watch, before I took the oath as the CJP,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, this is a thing to bear in mind because interference is not acceptable but at the same time nothing has been reported to me during my watch.\u201d\nJustic Isa also lauded the support extended by the SHCBA for the six IHC judges who wrote the letter. He also appreciated the association for its initiatives for human rights and other such issues.\nNew SC building in Karachi\nIn addition to addressing judicial independence, Justice Isa discussed a significant new development project \u2014 a new building for the Supreme Court\u2019s Karachi registry, opposite the main entrance of the Sindh High Court.\nCovering nearly seven acres and estimated to cost between Rs6 billion and Rs8 billion, the project aims to centralise federal tribunals and special courts in one facility. The federal government has approved this plan, which seeks to reduce recurring expenses and logistical challenges currently faced due to scattered court locations.\nJustice Isa also reminisced about his days practising law in Karachi, pointing out the difficulties with parking and accessing court facilities. He advocated for better record-keeping and the consolidation of federal court functions to improve efficiency and access.\nThe CJP said that he along with Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail met the other day with the apex court building committee and it was noted that the present Supreme Court building in Karachi was iconic and a protected heritage site. The matter about its restoration to its original position as much as possible also came under discussion during the meeting.\n\u201cI also suggested to the provincial government for preservation of other similar buildings located in the city,\u201d Justice Isa added.\nSindh High Court Chief Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi and SHCBA President Rehan Aziz Malik also spoke on the occasion.\n"

You cannot set us aside\u201d, he remarked.\nThe PTI leader claimed that at present, the country had \u201cthe highest number of political prisoners, with 99.9 per cent of them belonging to PTI\u201d.\nHe ended his speech with an offer of reconciliation, underlining the need for collective efforts to address Pakistan\u2019s enormous challenges.\n\u2018Let us work together\u2019\nHis view was endorsed by Leader of the House Ishaq Dar from across the aisle.\n\u201cLet us work together. Let us get Pakistan out of the quagmire\u201d, he said while offering an olive branch to the opposition.\nMr Dar said the task was \u201cdoable\u201d and \u201cit all depends on how we act\u201d.\n\u201cLet us bury the past\u201d, he remarked and underlined the need to bring the blame game to an end and stop the distortion of facts.\nBoth the government and the opposition would have to work together on the privatisation process, energy sector reforms and other issues while sitting in standing committees, Mr Dar added.\nBefore his offer of reconciliation, Mr Dar had chided the PTI for its alleged involvement in May 9 attacks. \u201cYou committed a blunder. You challenged the state itself and endangered it.\u201d\n\u201cYou should not have gone to this extent in politics\u201d, he remarked and asked the PTI leaders to prove their innocence before courts of law.\nThe house leader also rejected criticism over election rigging and questioned: \u201cHow elections were fair in KP and unfair in Punjab?\u201d\nMr Dar also rejected other accusations levelled by the opposition leader, including the delay in the release of funds for general elections.\nHe said that the previous Pakistan Democratic Movement government had \u201creleased every penny\u201d for general elections, as mentioned in the 2023 budget.\nOn the issue of Senate elections in KP, the house leader said it was a matter between the ECP, provincial government and courts.\nFormer caretaker prime minister and now senator Anwaarul Haq Kakar also replied to the opposition leader\u2019s comments about the delay in holding elections.\nHe said the 90-day limit was a constitutional requirement, but so was holding a census every ten years.\nThe caretaker government had no desire to extend its stint but it was a compulsion to carry out fresh delimitation, Mr Kakar reasoned.\n\u2018Generals, judges should sign affidavit\u2019\nMr Vawda, in his first speech on the floor of the house, said the affidavit about dual citizenship submitted by lawmakers should also be submitted by all generals and judges.\nAsserting the supremacy of the parliament, the former PTI leader said the two houses legislate laws, and they should have the right to interpret them as well rather than allowing others to interpret them as per their will.\nNew bills introduced\nThe government also introduced three bills: the Election (Amendment) Bill, 2024, the Motion Pictures (Amendment) Bill, 2023 and the Establishment of Special Court (Overseas Pakistanis Property) Bill, 2023, during the session, APP reported.\nChairman Gillani referred the bills to the standing committees concerned for detailed deliberation.\nSince the standing committee on finance was yet to be formed, the Tax Laws (Amendment) Bill 2024 was referred to a special committee formed earlier by the chairman.\nThe three-member committee comprising Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, PTI\u2019s Barrister Ali Zafar and PPP\u2019s Farooq H. Naek will submit its report to the house on Monday.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: Amid supply chain challenges leading to the closure of refining units and storage constraints, the government has asked the Mini\u00adstry of Interior and the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to start immediate operations against oil smuggling with the support of other stakeholders.\nInformed sources told Dawn the prime minister had also taken up the matter with the defence authorities to extend maximum support to the civil agencies concerned in eradicating smuggling, which causes annual losses of hundreds of billions of rupees and negatively affects the smooth functioning of the petroleum supply chain, including refineries and marketing companies.\nSeparately, the Ministry of Interior and the FBR have been directed to take \u201cappropriate and immediate action to address this critical issue\u201d, according to a communication of the petroleum division based on a complaint by the Oil Companies Advisory Cou\u00adncil (OCAC) to the Special Investment Faci\u00adlitation Council (SIFC) and the Prime Minister\u2019s Office.\nInterestingly, all the five domestic refineries jointly, individually and as part of the OCAC \u2014 an umbrella organisation of about three dozen refineries and petroleum marketing companies \u2014 have been writing almost daily to the petroleum division and the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) about the challenges to their survival and threat to about $6 billion worth of upgradation plans because of the massive influx of smuggled oil products in the market.\nReferring to letters to the SIFC, the petroleum division said the OCAC had highlighted the issue of petroleum smuggling, which posed a grave threat to the forthcoming investments in refinery expansion and upgradation projects under the Oil Refining Policy for Upgradation of Brownfield Refineries, 2023.\n\u201cThis illicit activity not only bleeds the economy but also jeopardises the opportunity for substantial investments in refinery upgradation,\u201d the petroleum division wrote to the interior ministry and the FBR on Thursday. \u201cThe ramifications extend beyond the refinery sector, impacting the profitability of oil marketing companies (OMCs), dealers, and disrupting the white oil pipeline operations.\u201d\nThe petroleum division said the refineries were currently carrying huge stocks of high-speed diesel (HSD) due to the availability of smuggled fuel in the market. This reduced refinery throughput and production of other petroleum products.\n\u201cThis situation is disturbing the entire oil supply chain and needs immediate correction,\u201d the Ministry of Interior and FBR were told.\nOn the same day, the OCAC again reminded Ogra and the petroleum division that HSD stocks had reached a \u201ccritically high\u201d level, enough for 44 days of consumption cover.\nThis posed \u201csignificant challenges to the sustainability of the oil industry. The alarming disparity between the high stocks of HSD (650,000 tonnes in storage) and the persistently low sales (14,700 tonnes against the planned 23,000 tonnes) is primarily attributable to the rampant smuggling of POL (petroleum, oil and lubricant) products from Western borders, has started to exert adverse effects on the refineries and OMCs\u201d, the advisory council said.\nThe OCAC reminded Ogra that extensive deliberations on strategies to address the issue in many monthly product review meetings had been unsuccessful due to the pervasive influence of smuggled products.\n\u201cDemand destruction and surplus inventory have created a vicious circle, wherein the industry is struggling to maintain operational viability.\u201d\nThe oil industry urged Ogra and the petroleum division to \u201crecognise the cascading implications of this challenging situation, exacerbating financial strain throughout the supply chain\u201d.\nWhile the OMCs legitimately sold HSD during the peak agriculture season, suppressed market demand impacted their cash flows, rendering the oil marketing companies unable to fulfil their financial obligations to refineries and simultaneously retire letters of credit (LCs) for imported products.\nConsequently, refineries\u2019 ability to make timely payments for crude oil imports will be compromised. Because of these issues, the oil industry will again face similar challenges as encountered in 2022, when establishing LCs became an uphill task due to the country\u2019s rating in the international market.\nDue to high HSD stock levels, refineries were also constrained from curtailing their throughput, which also impacted the production of petrol and jet fuel.\nThe OCAC called upon the government institutions to \u201ctake immediate and decisive actions to restore market equilibrium and save the refineries, white oil pipeline and OMCs from collapse. The refineries also warned of \u201ca serious threat to the opportunity of huge investment in the country due to the staggering influx of smuggled petroleum products from Iran\u201d.\n\u201cIt would, therefore, be most unfortunate if the planned upgradation projects are dela\u00ady\u00aded or abandoned due to continued illicit activity which is already bleeding the economy and has disrupted the entire supply chain of petroleum products, adversely affecting the refinery health, white oil pipeline operations, and the profitability of oil marketing companies and dealers,\u201d the council warned.\n"

Recently, the temporary courtroom was restructured and the administration raised the height of the partition walls to nine feet.\nInitially, there was no partition and the hall was divided into three parts; one reserved for Mr Khan and his legal team, the second for media persons and the third for the general public. Last Friday, the presiding judge directed jail authorities to remove unnecessary walls erected in the makeshift courtroom inside the jail.\nCipher case\nDuring the hearing of the cipher case, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) observed the government was following \u201cpre-partition\u201d protocols to secure its confidential documents.\nIHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq passed these observations during the hearing of the appeals of former prime minister Imran Khan and Shah Mehmood Qureshi against their conviction in the cipher case.\nA division bench comprising CJ Farooq and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb resumed the hearing on the appeals. Special prosecutors of the FIA Hamid Ali Shah and Syed Zulfiqar Abbas Naqvi appeared before the court. Justice Farooq inquired how old were the codes for the cipher and auxiliary documents.\nThe lawyer responded that some of the documents were from 2003 and a few of dated back to the pre-partition era and amended in 1964. The booklet on cipher was updated in 2003, he said, asking the court to examine the case in the light of security protocols, physical possession of the classified cable, and statement of witnesses.\nThe bench asked whether Mr Qureshi was also facing the charges of misplacing the cipher and asked the prosecutor to explain the case in sequential order.\nAs he explained the requirements for keeping the document in secure custody, the prosecutor argued that Mr Khan did not return the copy. Justice Aurangzeb questioned if the prosecution took any action against those who did not return the cipher on time. The prosecutor replied that he would respond to this question at the next hearing. The court adjourned the hearing till April 30.\n"

The problems are not new,\u201d he said. He added that successive governments never took serious initiatives to improve railways despite the fact it was a part of the country\u2019s defence, welfare and unity of the country.\nSheikh Anwar said that government was reluctant to fill the vacant posts of different categories mainly after the retirement of employees. He said that ban was imposed on recruitments while posts were being eliminated in the name of rationalisation that caused various problems.\nHe said that their salaries and pensions should be taken over by the ministry of finance like other federal institutions to ensure timely payment. He also asked for payment of the medical bills, timely pension and gratuity to employees of railways.\nThe union leader demanded of the government to approve a bailout package of Rs25 billion for rehabilitation of railways. He also asked for restoration of different trains including Khushhal Khan Khattak Express, Bulleh Shah Express, Pakpattan Express, Akbar Bugti Express, Shah Hussain Express and others to overcome the existing problems.\nSheikh Anwar said that allowances should be given to all technical employees of the engineering department without discrimination and all diploma holder sub-engineers should be upgraded to BPS-14 instead of BPS-11 on pattern of other institutions.\n"

Officials of military and civil administration, forest department, local elders and representatives of Samsons Group including Dr Wasifur Rehman, Brig Sajid Akbar, ADC Mohammad Suhail, and Wahidullah attended the ceremony.\nSpeaking on the occasion, they said that current climate models indicated a rise in temperatures intensifying the earth\u2019s water cycle. It led to increased evaporation, they added.\nThis phenomenon is expected to result in more frequent and intense storms besides drying in some land areas. Consequently, regions affected by storms may experience heightened precipitation and an increased risk of flooding. The areas away from storm tracks may face reduced precipitation and an elevated risk of drought.\nThey said that global challenges posed by climate change were evident in the irregular yet frequent rainfall patterns observed worldwide. They said that extensive plantation was vital to address the issue.\nThe speakers lauded Samsons Group for its commitment to combat climate change by expanding forest cover through tree plantation initiatives in the area. They urged all participants to take active part in planting trees to contribute to the success of efforts aimed at mitigating climate challenges.\nThe participants of the ceremony including local elders and students planted trees in Malam Jabba.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: In response to a petition lodged by the naanbai association of the federal capital, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Thursday issued a stay on a notification by the capital administration that reduced the price of Roti and Naan in Islamabad.\nIHC Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri suspended the notification issued by the district administration of Islamabad that cut the price of Roti from Rs20 to Rs16 and Naan from Rs25 to Rs20. He was hearing the petition filed by Sajjad Ali, president of the Naanbais Welfare Association.\nPetitioner\u2019s counsel Barrister Umar Ijaz Gillani adopted before the court that under the law the controller general of prices and supplies of the finance ministry was empowered to issue a notification regarding the increase or decrease in the prices of eatables.\nHe said that the government was required to appoint the controller general prices and the appointment of assistant controllers was required to be made by the authorised officer for fixation of the rates.\n\nJudge says order issued in violation of legal framework\n\nHe, however, this notification was issued by the deputy commissioner without any legal backing. He argued that the deputy commissioner fixed the rates in accordance with the prices set by the Punjab government. He said the price of flour in Islamabad was higher compared to the province.\nThe district administration representative informed the judge that the law had been amended and the deputy commissioner was empowered to issue such notification as per the law. Justice Jahangiri issued a stay order in this matter and sought a detailed reply from the government by May 6.\nAs per the details, the Punjab government issued a notification slashing the price of Roti, followed by a similar notification by the ICT administration. The Islamabad administration\u2019s notification had set the price of Roti and Naan at Rs16 and Rs20, respectively.\nFollowing the price cut, the deputy commissioner directed all the assistant commissioners and magistrates to intensify their efforts to enforce the government rates of Roti/Naan for a standard serving size of 120 grams in the federal capital.\nIn line with these directives, the assistant commissioners imposed a fine of Rs3,000 on each tandoor for violation of the new rates.\nHowever, the naanbais challenged the decision through an association comprising over 3,000 tandoors in Islamabad. During the last hearing, Barrister Gilani submitted that no subsidy mechanism had been implemented in the matter in line with flour prices. In the current scenario, more than 3,000 tandoors in the capital territory are facing financial loss due to a cut in reasonable profit.\nThe counsel further contended that without legal authority, the district magistrate issued the notification on April 15, 2024, while exercising powers under Section 3 of the Price Control and Prevention of Profiteering and Hoarding Act, 1977. He pointed out that Section 3 of the act only authorised the federal government to issue such a notification. Barrister Gilani urged the court to set aside the notification because an \u201cincompetent authority\u201d had issued this order.\n"

Unfortunately, the passenger lost his life in the incident, he said.\nShahid Mehmood, a resident of Azad Kashmir, lodged an FIR with the Kahuta police, stating that he worked as helper with the passenger coaster.\nHe said the coaster had left AJK for Lahore at 4pm on Wednesday. As it was ascending the Kallar Road near Kahuta, the driver found the road blocked with heavy stones.\nHe said as the driver slowed down, four young men carrying weapons surrounded the bus and one of them entered the vehicle and threatened the passengers to give up cash and valuables. He said the robber snatched his mobile phone and Rs60,000 from the driver.\nAs the gunman moved towards the passengers and started snatching their phones and cash, one of the passengers identified as Mohammad Farooq attempted to overpower him, which led to a scuffle between them.\nObserving that their accomplice was in trouble, the robbers waiting outside the coaster opened fire which resulted in injuries to driver Akhtar Khan and Mohammad Farooq. Despite being injured, the driver sped off the bus; however the gunman who had boarded the vehicle jumped out and escaped.\nHe said after covering some distance, the driver could not continue driving and he (helper) took control of the vehicle and drove it to a nearby hospital.\nHowever, Farooq, who was shot and injured, died in the bus whereas the driver was shifted to Rawalpindi by Rescue 1122.\nAfter the incident was reported to the police, SSP operations Hafiz Kamran Asghar and other officials reached the crime scene and recorded the statements of the victims.\nA police team led by DSP Kahuta has been formed to arrest the culprits.\nLater, SP CIA Binish Fatima also visited the crime scene along with other officials.\n"

Amusement means anything that diverts the mind and pleases the mind. Recreation has the meaning of refreshment of the strength and spirits after toil and diversion while pastime connotes to pastime agreeably and in a pleasant manner.\u201d\nJustice Hassan observed that \u201cfailure to provide such basic necessary facilities is not only violative of Article 26 of the Constitution, which deals with the issue of access to places of public entertainment or resort which include a place to rest and take leisure and place for food and prayers.\nIt is also a clear violation of Articles 9, 14, 15, 20 and 38 of the Constitution which speaks about fundamental rights of the citizens of Pakistan such as right to life and liberty (Article 9), right to dignity (Article 14), right to freedom of movement (Article 15), right to food (Article 38), right to water (Article 9) and right to practice and propagate one\u2019s religion (Article 20).\u201c\nThe matter was pending since 2015 regarding construction carried out in the park reserved for children.\nOn Jan 25, 2022, LHC had observed that it was the fundamental right of the petitioners to have access to places of public entertainment or resort as guaranteed under Article 9 read with Article 26 of the Constitution.\nThe counsel for Punjab Housing and Town Planning Agency submitted a report and parawise comments and clarified that the park was being restored to its original condition for which administrative approval had also been obtained from the concerned authority.\nHe said a meeting of the competent authority was also held on Dec 14, 2023, regarding execution of work in the park for improvement of necessary facilities in order to further strengthen the right of petitioners as well as other inhabitants residing in surrounding area of the park.\nJustice Jawad Hassan noted that aforementioned comments clearly depicted that developments at the spot were intended for improvement of the park in question in a bid to accomplish the plan initiated by the government of Punjab under umbrella of duly approved scheme.\n"

Mr Hassan called for a united effort from all stakeholders, including policymakers, civil society organisations, UN agencies, NGOs, communities, and healthcare providers.\n \n \n\nCMU National Coordinator Dr Razia Kaniz Fatima said that the CMU, in collaboration with the provincial programmes and with the support of the Global Fund (GF) and partnership with the Indus Hospital and Health Network (IHHN), was providing free of cost malaria prevention, diagnostic and treatment interventions through more than 5,500 public and private healthcare facilities in remote areas of Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Sindh.\n\nOfficial says country to get rid of mosquito-borne disease by 2035\n\n\u201cWith the GF support, about 11.1 million suspects were tested for malaria, and 2.6 million confirmed cases were successfully treated during last year. Further, 6.1 million insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) were distributed in 20 high-burden districts,\u201d she said.\nDr Luo Dapeng, WHO representative to Pakistan, reaffirmed WHO\u2019s commitment to combat malaria and support initiatives for a malaria-free Pakistan. He lauded the accelerated response of national and provincial programmes to combating malaria outbreaks during floods while presenting an animated video providing a historical overview of the malaria situation.\nDr Shahzad Ali Khan, vice chancellor of the Health Services Academy, emphasised the profound impact of malaria on individuals, families, and communities, urging heightened political and social commitment to alleviate its burden. He commended the efforts of healthcare workers, researchers, policymakers and communities worldwide in the fight against malaria.\nIt is worth mentioning that in 2022, because of floods, Pakistan reported 3.4 million cases of malaria. An official of the health ministry, requesting anonymity, said Pakistan had contacted the WHO in 2020 to start the process of declaring Punjab malaria-free but the move could not be implemented due to Covid-19 and a change of management in the malaria control wing.\nThe floods during the last three years, however, have made it difficult to turn this dream into reality, he added.\n\u201c\u2026the health ministry claims that as per the national malaria strategy, Punjab, AJK, GB and ICT [Islamabad Capital Territory] will be declared malaria-free by 2025, while Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh and Balochistan will reduce their malaria incidence(s) up to 70pc till 2030, and Pakistan will be malaria-free till 2035,\u201d he said.\nAccording to details, at least 42 countries or territories have reached the malaria-free milestone. Last year WHO certified Azerbaijan and Tajikistan for achieving elimination of malaria in their territories. The certification followed a sustained, century-long effort to stamp out the disease by the two countries.\nCertification of malaria elimination is the official recognition by WHO of a country\u2019s malaria-free status. The certification is granted when a country has shown \u2013 with rigorous, credible evidence \u2013 that the chain of indigenous malaria transmission by anopheles mosquitoes has been interrupted nationwide for at least the past three consecutive years. A country must also demonstrate the capacity to prevent the re-establishment of transmission.\n"

            "Text": "TAXILA: A 16 member delegation of tourists from Thailand led by monk Phra Pisit of Hinayan thought of Buddhism pay homage to giant Buddha statues during their visit to Taxila Museum on Thursday.\nThe delegation expressed admiration for the impressive collection at Taxila Museum and lauded the dedicated efforts of the Directorate General of Archaeology, Punjab, in preserving the rich cultural heritage.\nUpon arrival, the delegation was received by the curator of the Taxila Museum Humera Naz, who also briefed them about various artifacts put on display at Taxila Museum.\nShe informed the Thai delegation that there were 4,000 objects, including stone, stucco, terracotta, silver, gold, iron and semiprecious stones, displayed in the museum.\nShe also briefed the visitors about the history of Gandhara civilisation, various stupas, statues and other artifacts in the museum. The Thai delegation took round of the main hall which exhibits more than 70 stories of the life of Buddha i.e. from the time of his birth till death.\nThey also visited the Bodhisattva and Buddha galleries. The envoy was informed that hundreds of monasteries and stupas were built together with Greek and Kushan towns such as Sirkap and Sirsukh, both in Taxila.\n\u201cMainly the display consists of objects from 600 BC to 500 AD,\u201d she said. She said that Gandhara is the second holy land of Buddhism and it is the place from where the religion flourished across the globe. She informed that historians believe that the first statue of Buddha was created in Taxila while several historical archaeological Gandhara sites located in different parts of Pakistan\u2019s cities including Taxila, Peshawar, Mardan, and Swat are sacred holy places in the eyes of Buddhists and have potential to attract international tourists from Thailand and other countries.\nDuring their visit, they witnessed some of the oldest historical archaeological artifacts displayed in the museum. The guests showed interest in the history and development of the Buddhist art of Gandhara.\nThe Thai Monk said that Gandhara tourism is a symbol of the shared Buddhist heritage, and could attract Thai followers of Buddhism.\n\u201cGandhara Civilisation has been in the minds and hearts of Buddhists across the world for thousands of years,\u201d he added.\nHe said that Thailand and Pakistan had deep rooted diplomatic relations and on the cultural front it has gone on fast track during the last couple of years. He said that in January 2023, the ambassador of Thailand to Pakistan Chakkrid Krachaiwon inaugurated gold plated gallery with bullet-proof glasses to display the holy bone relics of the Lord Buddha at Taxila Museum which was gifted by the Thai government as a token for the decade-old cultural and bilateral relations between the two countries.\nHe said that the chief monk of Thailand inaugurated the \u201cbell of peace\u201d in Taxila and Peshawar during his visit to Pakistan in 2019.\nIn July 2022, a 26-member group led by Mr Arayawangso, chief monk of Thailand, and comprising six monks and 20 disciples performed the rituals of \u2018rain retreat\u2019 at the stupa in Taxila. He lauded the Pakistan government for preserving sites related to Buddhism and maintaining Taxila as one of the prominent places for Buddhists.\nIrfan Karim, who was coordinating the delegation said that the visit of these Thai tourists is designed to explore the awe-inspiring Buddhist remains in Pakistan, once home to the incredible faith and centre of learning for monks. He said that several historical archaeological Gandhara sites located in different parts of Pakistan\u2019s cities including Taxila and northern areas are sacred holy places in the eyes of Buddhists and have potential to attract international tourists from Thailand and other countries\n"

In Lahore alone, there were over 7,000 homeless drug users with as many as 120 \u201chotspots\u201d.\n\u201cThere is no specialised treatment centre for women with drug dependence in Pakistan. People who use drugs deserve dignity, respect, and stigma-free care,\u201d said Mr Hussain.\nAmir Munir, additional district and sessions judge, said there was a need to develop a consensus regarding drug policy, particularly its legal aspect which treated substance users as pariahs.\nHe said there was a need to transition from a \u201clegal regime to social regime\u201d in dealing with drug-related cases, advocating a \u201ctherapeutic regime\u201d to promote the well-being of offenders.\nZaved Mahmood, who represents the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs, said there was a need to follow international human rights principles for effective response to drug cases. He said the social stigma surrounding drugs needed to be removed and called for \u201cdecriminalisation\u201d of minor drug charges to encourage rehabilitation. \u201cInternational law says that every human being has the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. This applies in the context of drug law, healthcare, and policies,\u201d he added.\nAdeeba Kamarulzaman, who joined the session via Zoom, also advocated \u201cpragmatic and socially cohesive\u201d approaches to deal with such cases.\nAnother session of the day focused on addressing \u201cdisparities in access to voluntary, evidence-based treatment and highlighting the importance of framing drug policy as a public health intervention\u201d. One of the panelists Giada Girelli, a senior analyst at Harm Reduction International, said that \u201cwe spend 750 times more on punitive drug control measures than we do on life-saving essential harm reduction services\u201d. \u201cThis is a violation of the rights of people who use drugs,\u201d she added.\nSpeaking about the Portuguese experience of placing individuals\u2019 health at the core of the drug policy, MP Ricardo Leite said that \u201cnothing can be copy pasted from one country to another, but there are lessons that can be adapted to any context\u201d.\n"

She said that in today\u2019s interconnected world, Pakistan supports a multilateral diplomatic approach to resolving conflicts and continues its efforts to strive by building bridges and finding common ground. Multilateralism provides the framework to address shared challenges and pursue collective solutions.\nCharles Delogne, Ambassador of Belgium in Pakistan, shared various historic initiatives Belgium took over the years, including being the founding member country of various global multilateral organisations that have substantially contributed to building peace and security worldwide. The ambassador said, \u201cWe can overcome the complex challenges that transcend borders and threaten peace through collaborative efforts and dialogue\u201d.\nDr. Saad S. Khan, President of the ECO Cultural Institute, highlighted the importance of cultural diplomacy in fostering mutual understanding among nations. Dr. Saad said there was a strong need to build and strengthen multilateral institutions, especially through cultural exchange and dialogue, which were powerful tools in promoting peace and harmony.\n\u201cBy embracing diversity and engaging in constructive dialogue, we can build stronger ties and mitigate conflicts,\u201d he remarked. Dr. Rashid Aftab, Director of the Riphah Institute of Public Policy, emphasised the importance of institutional mechanisms in facilitating practical multilateral cooperation and said that institutional frameworks were crucial in enabling coordination and collaboration among nations to resolve challenges.\nDr. Rashid noted that by strengthening institutional capacities, the effectiveness of multilateral initiatives can be enhanced and inclusive participation can be ensured. Earlier, in her opening remarks, Dr. Farhat Asif, President of the IPDS, underscored the significance of peacebuilding efforts within the framework of multilateral cooperation. She also shared the message of United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres on this important international day.\nShe said that through collaborative peacebuilding initiatives, we can address the root causes of conflicts and work towards sustainable peace. She also highlighted the role of IPDS in understanding multilateralism through various initiatives. The seminar brought together diplomats, scholars, policymakers, and students to engage in insightful discussions on multilateralism and its pivotal role in fostering peace and stability worldwide.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Friday criticised the power companies for inefficiencies and the use of expensive power plants despite the availability of cheaper sources but hinted at allowing them to charge another Rs22.8 billion to consumers in the billing month of May.\nAt a public hearing presided over by Nepra Chairman Waseem Mukhtar, it was reported that even though hydropower supply with no fuel cost was actually higher than estimated in the reference tariff, non-utilisation of cheaper plants resulted in a higher average fuel cost. Member Nepra Rafique A. Shaikh expressed concerns over such a state of affairs and noted that cheaper plants remained closed while expensive plants were being operated.\nThe hearing was told that the share of hydropower supply amounted to more than 27pc of the total grid against a target of less than 22.2pc. On the other hand, local coal-based plants supplied only 10.6pc of the national grid supply against a target of almost 15pc. As a result, the cost of coal-based fuel increased to Rs16.78 per unit against a targeted rate of Rs9.39 per unit.\nAnother major factor was the domestic gas-based power generation. In the reference tariff, the gas-based fuel cost for almost 11pc share was assumed at Rs7.92 per unit, which went up to Rs13.69 per unit because of an increase in gas price while its general share was lower than 10pc. Also, the RLNG-based power supply was initially expected to be less than 3pc at Rs23.84 per unit, but its share went beyond 20pc, although at a lower fuel cost of Rs22.2 per unit. Its larger-than-targeted power supply also aggravated the average basked price.\n\nHints at allowing charging Rs23bn more for March \n\nRepresentatives of the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) and Power Division said expensive plants had to be used because of transmission system constraints and a week-long maintenance plan for the transmission system. Power consumption was also continuously declining because of expensive power and the increasing use of solar power. In March, consumption fell by 8pc.\nThe CPPA demanded Rs 2.94 per unit in additional fuel costs to recover from consumers through May 2024 bills. The proposed additional FCA is almost 46pc higher than the pre-fixed fuel cost of Rs6.44 per unit already charged to consumers in March. This calls into question the capabilities of the power sector bureaucracy to forecast fuel costs even for 6-7 months. The additional FCAs have ranged between 50 and 115pc in recent months compared to the pre-determined fuel costs notified at the start of the current fiscal year.\nThis increase in FCA is on top of an about 26pc increase in the annual base tariff and another 10pc hike under the quarterly tariff adjustment currently in place and being charged to consumers at the rate of Rs2.75 per unit. As a result, consumers continue to pay excessive bills despite lower consumption patterns even though more than 79pc of electricity came from local resources. Nepra has accepted the request for a public hearing on April 26.\nIn a petition, the CPPA, acting as a commercial agent of Discos, demanded an additional FCA of Rs2.94 per unit for electricity consumed in March. It claimed that reference fuel cost for March was set at Rs6.44 per unit but actual fuel cost more than doubled to Rs9.38 per unit. The average fuel cost in February also stood at about Rs9.42 per unit. It said about 8,023-gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity was generated at an estimated fuel expenditure of Rs66.7bn (Rs8.3 per unit) in March, of which 7,756 GWh energy was delivered to Discos at the cost of Rs72.67bn (at Rs9.38 per unit).\n"

            "Text": "KARACHI: Mill owners on Friday further reduced the rates of various flour varieties by Rs4 per kg to pass on the impact of huge arrival of cheap imported wheat in the country.\nHowever, despite a persistent drop in flour rates at the wholesale stage, retailers are not fully passing on the benefit of price cut to consumers.\nFormer chairman of the Pakistan Flour Mills Association Chaudhry Mohammad Yousuf said the price of flour No 2.5 had been slashed to Rs92 per kg from Rs96 and that of fine and super fine to Rs120 from Rs123-124. \nIn February, these varieties were available at Rs122 and Rs136-140 per kg. \nMr Yousuf said import of around 3.5 million tonnes of wheat by the private sector from September 2023 to March 2024 amid rupee stability and falling world prices had averted major wheat and flour crises in the country, besides reducing the prices of various flour varieties. \n\nMillers\u2019 demand for export of surplus sugar pushes up local prices\n\nHe said imported wheat is available at Rs8,400-8,500 per 100kg bag while the commodity from Sindh is being sold at Rs8,400 in the open market. He insisted that the millers and private sector cannot be blamed for any crisis for the growers as imports were initiated as per the government\u2019s decision to provide relief to the inflation-hit consumers. \n\u201cI personally think that the private sector has made extra imports as 2.5m tonnes of wheat were enough instead of huge 3.5m tonnes costing one billion dollars,\u201d Mr Yousuf said. \nDisagreeing with the notion that growers are the losers now, he recalled that they had sold the grain at Rs5,000 per 40kg last year instead of the officially rate of Rs3,900. He urged the government to freely open wheat import and export of value-added wheat products, besides linking local flour rates with imported wheat rates. \nConsumers yet to get relief\nDespite a persistent drop in mills flour rates, consumers are not getting a full relief as retailers are slowly passing on the price cut to the consumers. The retailers selling flour No 2.5 at Rs120-130 per kg and fine and super fine at Rs150-160, which otherwise should be below Rs100 per kg. \nKarachi Retail Grocers Group general secretary Farid Qureishi said retailers still held the old stocks purchased at higher rates, while some are facing losses by selling flour at reduced rates despite purchasing the commodity at higher rates. \n\u201cBesides commodities, the government should seriously ponder over the rising power and gas bills and soaring school fees which are eating up the bulk of consumers\u2019 salary and income. Consumers need urgent relief in these areas to offset the rising cost of living,\u201d he said. \nA commodity wholesaler said it appeared that the millers had grinded the entire imported wheat stock in order to avert any losses and clear the stocks in view of arrival of the new crop. \nSugar export \nA spokesman for the Pakistan Sugar Mills Association (Punjab Zone) said sugar prices in the world market are falling and the government should immediately allow export of 1.5 million tonnes of surplus sugar to ensure timely payments to the sugarcane growers and earn more foreign exchange. \nHe said the landed cost of imported sugar came to Rs240 per kg, or $553 per tonne, at Karachi Port, while the ex-mill rates at Jodia Bazaar and south Punjab are Rs134.25 and Rs135.75 per kg, respectively, instead of Rs145-150 as claimed by the market forces. \nThe spokesman claimed that the cost of sugar production is Rs175 per kg due to purchase of sugarcane at Rs425-550 per 40kg from the growers, as compared to Rs300 last year. \n\u201cInput costs like petroleum products, chemicals, interest rates, sales tax and labour have increased manifold.\n"

Similarly, the PBC supported new exporters to be assisted in developing markets abroad.\nOn import substitution, the PBC recommended an industrial policy which promotes import substitution with the objective of feeding into exports. However, import substitution should not be used as an excuse for indefinitely depriving Pakistani exporters and consumers of quality products at competitive prices.\nOpen-ended protection for domestic industry hampers both domestic as well as global competitiveness. Industries currently protected from global competition need to have a sunset clause. \nAt the same time, \nMr Malik called for effective and timely enforcement of anti-dumping duties.\nSmuggling and under-invoicing of imports undermine domestic manufacturing. Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) with China and the UAE needs to be implemented.\n"

He noted that politicians faced ups and downs and governments came and went but they have to leave some traditions and legacy for future generations. \nTalking about reconciliation, he said it was a two-way process. \u201cWe are ready to extend an olive branch to PTI and let us shake hands,\u201d he said and urged the party of ex-prime minister Imran Khan to \u201ccome forward for Pakistan and let us sit together\u201d.  \nReferring to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur\u2019s reported warning that he would \u201cattack\u201d Islamabad in protest, Mr Siddiqui urged PTI to do away with such tone. If PTI can shake hands with its worst political enemies such as Mehmood Khan Achakzai and Maulana Fazlur Rehman, then why it cannot sit with the incumbent government in the interest of the country, he asked.  \nMr Siddiqui said there is no political prisoner in the country at present, explaining that the PTI founder was behind bars after having being convicted in various cases.  \nPTI response \nPTI\u2019s parliamentary leader Senator Ali Zafar stressed that there was dire need of working together while keeping aside political differences or else matters of grave concern would be forgotten and ignored. He said parliament had lost its integrity and become a laughing stock for foreign countries because it was discharging its functions in total negation of the rules of business. \nUnderlining the need for doing away with the practice of \u2018bulldozing of legislation\u2019, he said there were laws that were neither discussed nor referred to any committee or allowed to be reviewed or read by the senators before being passed hastily only for the benefit of a few.  \nHe said such like instances had seriously damaged the prestige of legislature which further culminated in people losing faith in parliament. \nHe said it was the responsibility of the Senate to bring forth, discuss and debate internal and external issues of grave importance so that every member can share his opinion.  \n\u201cBased on these opinions, the government can then arrive at the best possible solutions in the best interest of Pakistan and its people,\u201d he remarked. \nHe said treasury benches should have a heart to bear criticism, assuring that criticism from his party would be based on facts.  \nHe recalled that the Quaid-i-Azam had proposed the structure of Pakistan\u2019s democracy on the basis of four principles \u2014 rule of law, good governance, unity and diversity and, above all, a society built on tolerance. According to the PTI senator, Pakistan has failed in adopting these basic principles.  \nSpeaking about Iran\u2019s attack on Israel, he urged the government to brief the house about the recent visit of Iranian president to Pakistan.  \nHe also blasted the ECP for allegedly trying to throw PTI out of the political process.\n"

Then, Opposition Leader Omar Ayub denounced \u201cthe constant witch-hunting of PTI leaders and activists by the Punjab and Islamabad police on the directives of Mr Naqvi, when he was the caretaker chief minister of Punjab and now when he has assumed the charge of interior minister\u201d.\nPTI Chairman Barrister Gohar also accused the police of disrupting the party\u2019s founding day event in Islamabad on Thursday and demanded an action against those who even took away a cake which the party had arranged for the occasion.\nHowever, Mr Naqvi did not respond to the allegations and kept meeting members who approached him for the resolution of their problems.\n\u201cThe Punjab police have become an indisciplined and mercenary force because of the deeds of Dr Usman [IG Punjab] and Mohsin Naqvi,\u201d said Mr Ayub while \u201ccondemning\u201d the police action against the party workers in various cities on Friday as the party had called for protest against the alleged rigging in the April 21 by-polls.\nHe questioned Mr Naqvi\u2019s election as senator as an independent candidate, stating that earlier he was functioning as an \u201cillegal caretaker chief minister of Punjab\u201d. He used the word \u2018tout\u2019 for the Punjab IGP and called him a \u201ccorrupt person.\u201d\nDeputy Speaker Mustafa Shah, however, expunged the word \u2018tout\u2019 from the proceedings.\nRecalling the Bahawalnagar army-police row, he said it seemed a message was being sent to people that if they saw the police raiding any premises without a warrant, they should treat the cops in the same manner.\nEarlier, Mr Dasti said he had received information that police had surrounded his residence in Muzaffargarh.\n\u201cWe ask the interior minister has he not tired of beating us? Expel us from the country,\u201d said Mr Dasti.\nHe also asked the chair to accept his privilege motion against the Nadra chairman for not responding to his telephone calls.\nBureaucracy under fire Earlier, Speaker Ayaz Sadiq and members expressed anger over the absence of ministers and senior officials from the proceedings.\nAt the outset, lawmakers from both sides of aisle drew the speaker\u2019s attention to the empty front rows and criticised the government for not taking the proceedings seriously.\nBefore taking up a calling attention notice about the petroleum division, the chair inquired if a senior official from the ministry concerned was present.\nUpon learning that a director-level official was present, Mr Sadiq expelled him from the gallery and asked him to send an officer of not less than a joint secretary level, within five minutes.\nSome MNAs, including PTI\u2019s Riaz Fatiana, said they had never seen the interior minister in the house. The speaker responded that he would himself talk to the interior minister and ask him to attend the session.\nThen the speaker started giving floor to members to speak on points of order till the time ministers and senior officials returned to the house.\nThe speaker also admonished a joint secretary of the petroleum ministry when he entered the house some 50 minutes after the start of the session.\n\u201cWe apologise that we bothered you and called you \u2026 we all have been waiting for you. The session started at 11am. Next time, if you want, we will shower flowers on you when you will come here,\u201d the speaker said, sarcastically.\n\u201cIf you take parliament this seriously, then next time secretaries will have to come and [no one] less than secretaries. I am sending letters again that please don\u2019t take parliament non-seriously,\u201d he said.\nAround the same time, the interior minister entered the hall and the speaker asked him to give a hearing to those who had spoken through points of order.\nThe deputy speaker also administered oath to Faisal Amin Gandapur, who won the recent by-election on the seat from D.I. Khan.\nThe National Assembly will now meet on Monday evening.\n"

The officials claimed that the plot belonged to the government and the police had not raided his residence.\n\nPolice directed to produce him in court today\n\nHowever, the PkMAP has alleged that the police raided the house of the party chief who was the presidential candidate without justification and arrested his personal guard.\nPkMAP Central Secretary General Abdul Rahim Ziaratwal said that a heavy police contingent raided his house \u201cwithout any magistrate\u201d in violation of the people\u2019s right to privacy. He alleged the raid came after Achakzai had exposed rigging in the general elections and his nomination as a presidential candidate by the opposition parties.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Friday emphasised the need for making concerted efforts on part of the police force to shift its investigation techniques by introducing and relying on forensic science and accordingly train specialised officers in this field.  \n\u201cThe cornerstone of criminal justice system is the effective functionality of the investigating agency and prosecution since a faulty investigative process will continuously dampen trust and confidence in the criminal justice system,\u201d observed Justice Ayesha A. Malik in a judgement she wrote.  \nJustice Malik was a member of a three-judge SC bench, headed by Justice Mohammad Ali Mazhar, which had taken up an appeal by Mohammad Ramzan against the July 4, 2013 Lahore High Court order acquitting Khizar Hayat of murder charges by not confirming the death sentence awarded to the accused.  \nOn April 28, 2009, then Khushab additional sessions judge had awarded death sentence to Khizar Hayat for murdering Mohammad Hayat. The accused challenged his conviction and got acquittal by the high court.  \n\nSuggests reliance on forensic science to improve prosecution; upholds LHC order acquitting murder accused \n\n\u201cTime has come for the investigation agency to recognise inherent flaws and concerns in its methodology and it needs to work towards specialising its investigative functions by separating the same from other police duties,\u201d emphasised Justice Malik in her judgement.  \nShe observed that the entire case of the prosecution relied on the ocular accounts which were fraught with material contradictions uncorroborated by available evidence. Moreover, she said, the presence of witnesses at the crime scene was highly doubtful and questionable.  \nThe principle of fair trial and due process under Article 10A of the Constitution, Justice Malik emphasised, specifically mandated that the accused be equitably treated, investigated and prosecuted in accordance with the law.  \n\u201cBut in the case at hand, it was revealed that the entire prosecution evidence was marred by inherent improbabilities and material defects, aside from concerns about the credibility of the witnesses,\u201d the judgement regretted.  \n\u201cIt is the duty of the prosecution to establish the guilt against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d it said, adding that the facts and circumstances of the present case clearly cast a shadow of doubt on the prosecution\u2019s case, which had failed to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, which entitled him to the presumption of innocence by law.  \n\u201cIt is essential to emphasise the importance of forensic science in the criminal justice system,\u201d the judgement said, adding that forensic dealt with \u2018the application of scientific techniques to provide objective, circumstantial evidence\u2019.  \n\u201cForensic is a science \u2018of interest to the legal system\u2019 whose objective is to ascertain what happened in the recent past. Forensic science means nothing more than the science which is used in the courts of law for the purposes of detection and prosecution of crime,\u201d the judgement recalled.  \n\u201cThis science plays a significant role in the criminal justice system by providing data that can be used to assess the degree of guilt of a suspect.\u201d  \nIn the present case, the judgement said, the prosecution had not established the motive, adding that the high court\u2019s view was correct in which it stated that in the absence of any corroborating evidence, it did not appear to be a sound and reasonable motive as stated by the prosecution for the commission of the offence.  \nThe apex court dismissed the present criminal petition with an observation that the findings rendered by the LHC did not suffer from any flaw or error.\n"

However, police did not allow the rally due to the imposition of Section 144 in the city.\nLater, the party workers and supporters, carrying party flags and placards, gathered in front of Quetta Press Club, where they chanted slogans against the government and demanded the immediate release of Mr Khan and Mr Qureshi, who, according to PTI supporters, were \u201cunjustly sentenced in fake cases\u201d.\nDuring the event, party leaders including Asif Tareen, former MNA, Munawara Munir, Mahwah, and others, said that the current rulers are so afraid of PTI that they see PTI even in their dreams at night.\n\nDemands release of Imran, Qureshi; rally staged despite ban on gatherings\n\nThey emphasised that in the general elections, the people of Pakistan voted for PTI\u2019s candidates, echoing PTI Chairman\u2019s call, but through rigging and violence, PTI\u2019s mandate was \u201csnatched away\u201d, insulting the people\u2019s votes.

The bench directed NHA officials to submit pre-qualification proposals via tender by May 26, 2024, for the construction of the N-25 Karachi-Quetta-Chaman highway, covering the Karachi-Uthal, Uthal-Kararo, and Wadh-Khuzdar sections.\nOfficials from the Planning and Development Department, Economics Division, Finance Division, Islamabad, and the NHA appeared before the court.\nThe court was told that the government had allocated Rs19bn to the NHA for the Karachi-Quetta-Chaman highway, N-25, but the NHA had failed to utilise this amount. The court considered this to be negligence and incompetence on the part of the department rather than simply the non-utilisation of the allocated funds.\n"

The PTI has become the strongest and  most formidable political force in the country despite all fascism and  coercion.\u201cI believe that once my nation is free in true sense, no one  will be able to stop Pakistan from becoming a great country,\u201d Imran Khan  vowed.\nHowever, Khan said a \u201cking of the jungle was the main  stumbling block and impediment in the path to true freedom, who  established the worst dictatorship in the country by flouting the  constitution and law of the country.\n\u201cThe king of jungle\u2019s  stubbornness and ego to run the country according to his will instead of  the constitution and law of the land became a source of destruction of  the country\u2019s economy, government system and even democracy and the  judiciary,\u201d he was quoted as saying in the central media release.\n\u201cMr  Khan said it was high time that every member of the nation should play  his/her role to stop the ongoing destruction of the country and added  that they should utilise their strength and resources given by Allah for  achieving the true independence of the country.\n\u201cI will render  any sacrifice to achieve Haqeeqi Azadi and will never compromise on my  own freedom as well of the nation come what may,\u201d he asserted in his  message.\nThe PTI founding chairman said the nation should keep in  mind that he had been jailed for the last nine months in absolutely  bogus, false, fabricated and baseless cases.\nRALLIES: PTI staged  peaceful protest demonstrations and rallies in all districts in Punjab  against \u201cworst-ever rigging\u201d in general and by-elections despite an  overnight crackdown on the residences of party leaders and active  workers.\nAccording to reports, police arrested scores of party  workers from their residences as well as from protest rallies in  different parts of the province, including Lahore, Gujranwala, Daska,  Shakargarh, and other districts. Several PTI leaders were put under  house arrest.\nWhile police blocked various roads and set up  pickets, some party MPAs and second-tier leaders brought out small  rallies in their respective constituencies.\nThe protesters  demanded that the public mandate stolen by the incumbent PML-N  government in connivance with the Election Commission of Pakistan be  returned to elected candidates.\nThey demanded that the PTI\u2019s election symbol \u201cBat\u201d as well as its due reserved seats of women and minorities be returned.\nThe  PTI\u2019s main leadership, including almost all leaders nominated in a  committee, constituted to plan and organise protests, were conspicuous  by their absence from the protest rallies.\nSmall isolated rallies  were held in different streets, but Lahore largely remained clam as is  the case since May 9. The small protest activity in Lahore yet again  reminded that that the PTI has no crowd-puller available in Lahore as  they were either incarcerated or in self-proclaimed hiding.\nPTI  Central Punjab secretary general Hammad Azhar, who did not appear at any  protest rally in the province, stated that the party leaders,  legislators, ticket-holders and workers staged protest rallies across  the province to demand and reclaim masses\u2019 stolen mandate. He said the  founder chairman had awakened the masses through his political struggle  and now they were ready to claim their due rights.\nMr Azhar  condemned police raids on party leaders\u2019 residences, outhouses and  offices in a bid to harass them on the instructions of \u201cfake and stolen  mandate\u201d chief minister. He said the IGP would not be able to push PTI  leaders, workers and supporters against the wall.\nPTI Punjab  information secretary Shaukat Basra said the nation had awakened and  would raise its voice at all forums to get its due right.\nAccording  to reports and videos shared by the PTI, police raided thrice the  outhouse of PTI ticket-holder for PP-151 Hammad Ali Awan to block  protests against rigging in the April 21 by-elections. Similarly, police  raided the residence and outhouse of PP-60 MPA Kaleem Ullah Khan and  allegedly misbehaved with women and his employees.\n"

It has been directed to complete the assigned task within 15 days and present its recommendations to the chief minister.\nThe committee members include 14 MPAs, other than the two ministers. The MPAs are, Chaudhry Iftikhar Hussain Chhachhar, Salman Naeem, Muhammad Ahmad Khan Leghari, Ghazali Saleem Butt, Ziaullah Shah, Amjad Ali Javed, Sardar Muhammad Asim Sher Maken, Ahmed Iqbal, Ghazanfar Abbas Cheena, Raees Nabeel, Raja Muhammad Aslam Khan, Ghulam Murtaza, Kanwal Pervaiz Chaudhry and Salma Butt.\nPunjab LG&CD department Secretary Mian Shakeel Ahmad will act as a member and secretary to the committee. He will also ensure administrative and secretariat support to the committee.\nThe law and parliamentary affairs department Secretary Asif Bilal Lodhi, as well as two lawyers \u2013 Moazzam Ali Shah and Usama Khawar Ghumman \u2013 have also been nominated as the committee members.\nThe committee has been constituted on a summary moved by the LG&CD department to look into the existing local government laws, update these for legislation and go for holding of much-awaited elections (of local bodies) in the province.\nThe local government elections are due in the province for the past several years.\nThe PTI government had dissolved the local governments created under the PLGA 2013 on May 4, 2019 as the law was repealed upon the promulgation of the PLGA 2019. Though the PTI government had recreated the local governments and appointed administrators on May 4, 2019 \u2013 some 30 months ahead of the completion of the LG representatives\u2019 tenures, the Supreme Court had declared the PLGA 2019\u2019s Section 3 ultra vires to the Constitution. Later, the PTI\u2019s provincial government had restored the local governments under the PLGA 2013.\nBy February 2022, the PTI government had claimed to have finalised the PLGA 2021 draft and tabled it in the Punjab Assembly, allowing the opposition (PML-N) to express its reservations as a part of democratic process.\nUnder the PLGA draft law prepared in 2022, the PTI government had plans to legislate and hold direct elections to elect mayors in 11 metropolitan corporations (of major cities) and chairmen in districts.\nThe PTI government also wanted to use Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) in the local government elections to eliminate rigging. However, the introduction of EVMs in elections remains a distant dream as the Feb 8 general elections and April 21 by-elections in Punjab were held through manual voting practices. The PTI leaders and workers alleged massive rigging in these elections.\n"

The court directed the police to share the FIR after case registration. \nEarlier, the Pakpattan police said Waqar, along with his two accomplices, looted a resident of Malkan Hans and, while fleeing on a motorcycle, had an encounter with Sadar and Farid Nagar police mobile teams. \nLater, the police registered an FIR at Farid Nagar police station, stating that Waqar, of neighbourhood Faridabad, was injured by his companion\u2019s firing and succumbed to his injuries while being shifted to the Pakpattan District Headquarters Hospital and Sahiwal Teaching Hospital.  \nThe FIR said his two accomplices fled. \nHowever, Waqar\u2019s family and friends denied the police\u2019s narrative. They said Waqar went out for a haircut and was killed by the Sadar police. Even police records showed that Waqar had no criminal history. At that time, the family staged protests at Jamal Chowk, blocking traffic for seven hours.  \nThey placed the body at the DPO office and demanded a case against the police officials involved in the fake encounter.  \nUnder family pressure and protest, DPO Tariq Walayt formed a committee to conduct a judicial inquiry into the incident. After Eid holidays, Rabia Bibi moved the court for the registration of the case. The court declared police report as fabricated. \nOn the other hand, the Farid Nagar police registered a cross version of Rabia Bibi\u2019s complaint in the previous FIR against SHO Ashiq, constables Ahmed Khan, Muhammad Waqas and Liaquat Ali and one unidentified person from Sadar police. The police have yet to arrest anyone.\n"

Over 67,000 polio workers will participate in the campaign, including 60,000 mobile team members.\nMr Khizer urged district officials to ensure full focus on polio during the campaign, optimal utilization of SNIDs, and ensuring that no child is left unvaccinated, especially in vulnerable and priority communities.\nHe inquired about the status of polio team members\u2019 training and expressed displeasure about some districts lagging on this indicator. \nHe instructed the officials to take polio team training seriously and submit updated status reports by the second half of the day.\nMr Afzaal also expressed concerns about the low number of government accountable teams in some districts, stating that the low numbers could negatively affect the campaign\u2019s quality. \nHe instructed the officials to work with line departments and involve more government personnel in the polio teams before the campaign.\nThe EOC coordinator stressed the importance of maintaining the quality of polio human resources and urged provincial monitors to prepare comprehensive reports on the quality of polio human resources. These reports should be submitted to the EOC after returning from the campaign.\nHe directed the CEOs to personally monitor the performance of polio teams; otherwise, they would be held accountable for any gaps.\nDuring the meeting, the EOC coordinator urged district health authorities to leave their offices during polio campaigns and personally monitor the campaign to ensure timely action.\nMr Afzaal expressed concern about the beginning of the summer season, stating that hot weather presents challenges in maintaining the vaccine cold chain and efficacy. \nHe directed district officials to ensure vaccine efficacy up to doorsteps by taking concrete measures, frequent monitoring checks, and saving an adequate quantity of ice packs.\nHe also underscored the importance of transit points, stating that the deployed teams need to be alert and provided with adequate security. \nHe called upon Dera Ghazi Khan and Rajanpur CEOs to remain in touch with polio officials in their districts to ensure security for polio teams in remote areas.\n"

            "Text": "TOBA TEK SINGH: Governor Balighur Rehman says the students should know which government is committed to promote higher education and that there was a government in the past that had cut the Higher Education Commission (HEC) budget by half. \nAddressing the 4th convocation of Government College Women University Faisalabad (GCWUF) on Friday, he emphasised the importance of education and leadership skills, advising the students to maintain integrity and gratitude. \nCommending the university for providing quality education in a safe environment, the governor congratulated 3,560 graduates who received their degrees in the event.  \nVice Chancellor Dr Zill-i-Huma presented a comprehensive report detailing the university\u2019s research and developmental endeavours, alongside academic and administrative accomplishments.  \nGCUF VC Dr Nasir Amin, Baba Guru Nanak University VC Dr Muhammad Afzal, former VC of GCWUF Dr Naureen Aziz Qureshi and MPAs Uzma Jabeen Raja and Qudsia Zia were also present.  \nTHREE DIE: Three bike riders died as a result of a collision between their motorcycle and a tractor-trolley near Marri Sahu Adda on Jhang Road in Khanewal.  \nBara Meel police had installed a barrier where a tractor-trolley was stopped by the policemen as it had no rear lights. Meanwhile, a motorcycle hit the tractor-trolley from its back. The accident resulted in critical injuries to three bike riders, identified as Muhammad Asif, Ijaz Ahmad and Mohsin Ali.  \nAll three of them died on the way to the THQ Hospital Kabirwala. \nBURNT: Wheat crop worth millions of rupees was gutted by a fire that broke out in the fields of a farmer at Chak 353-JB, Mehdiabad, Gojra.  \nThe farmer, Zain Ali Warraich, claimed that the fire was caused by sparking of wires at Fesco main transmission line passing over his fields. The firefighters extinguished the fire after hectic efforts. \nCOPS BOOKED: Two policemen were booked on Friday on the  charge of misappropriation of looted money they had recovered from robbers.\nAccording to the FIR registered by Nawan Lahore police, the complainant, SHO  Jeewan Khan, stated that the accused Sub Inspector Ahmad Raza and Muharrar  Javed Iqbal kept the amount recovered from robbers with them, instead of depositing it with \u2018malkhana\u2019 (treasury).\n"

            "Text": "NAROWAL: In a first in the Sialkot district, female traffic wardens have been assigned field duties with a view to boost confidence among the women drivers and help reduce the number of accidents.  \nSialkot District Police Officer (DPO) Mohammad Hasan Iqbal has started implementing a comprehensive traffic plan, including appointment of female wardens, in the city.  \nThe DPO has instructed the women wardens to do field work to ensure strict implementation of traffic rules and reduce the increasing number of road accidents.\nWomen wardens and officers have been deployed on important roads, intersections and areas with a heavy traffic in Sialkot.  \nAccording to the plan, the traffic rules will be strictly enforced and legal action will be taken against drivers without driving licence and helmet. Underage motorcyclists indulging in racing and wheelie will also be proceeded against to check fatal accidents.  Women traffic wardens also school young motorcyclists without helmets and licences on roadsafety and traffic rules.  \nSialkot police spokesperson says that the traffic police have opened driving schools in the four tehsils of the district --Sambaryal, Daska, Pasrur and Sialkot -- to raise awareness about traffic rules and road safety.  \nHe says the traffic police department is issuing driving licences to those who clear test in these driving schools.  \nSialkot Traffic Sector In Charge Rubina Haider told Dawn that people mostly respect women traffic wardens and did not misbehave with them. However, she says, some complaints have been received regarding misbehaviour by drivers of commercial transport vehicles with the women traffic wardens. She adds that many of these commercial drivers offer bribe when stopped for any violation, but women wardens discourage such practices.  \nMs Saima, Sector In-charge Sambaryal, says she volunteered for the field duty, adding that people respect female wardens more than they show for male officers.  Two local businessmen, Amin Awan and Atif Ali say that women wardens can play an important role in reducing violation of traffic rules and speeding. \nDPO Iqbal told Dawn that it is for the first time that women wardens have been  assigned field duties in Sialkot, hoping the initiative will give  positive results. \nHe says the initiative has been taken as per the vision of Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, adding that the move will help boost self-confidence among women drivers.\nHe says that due to the women wardens, women will also feel safe while driving independently on the roads.  \nHe says a driving school has been opened in the Government Girls College University of Sialkot, where female students will be trained and issued licences after clearing test so they can independently drive to the varsity.\n"

            "Text": "MADRID: World number one Iga Swiatek beat Wang Xiyu 6-1, 6-4 to reach the third round of the Madrid Open on Thursday as she bids to win the competition for the first time.\nCoco Gauff sailed through to the third round with a 6-0, 6-0 thumping of Arantxa Rus, while Liudmila Samsonova ousted Naomi Osaka in three sets.\nRunner-up last year, Swiatek bounced back from her semi-final defeat by Elena Rybakina in Stuttgart with a largely comfortable straight sets victory.\nThe Pole, a four-time Grand Slam winner and an expert on clay, wobbled in the second set as Wang won three games in a row but recovered to triumph in one hour 16 minutes.\n\u201cI love this place \u2014 I got to know the city a little better last year,\u201d Swiatek said.  \u201cSo this time I feel more comfortable around.\u201d\nMadrid is the only major European clay tournament that three-time French Open champion Swiatek has yet to win.\nSwiatek coasted through the first set, breaking twice for a 4-0 lead. She wrapped up it up with another break, leaving Wang no chance of reaching her red-hot backhand return.\nThe Doha and Indian Wells winner took a 4-1 lead in the second set but Wang fought her way back in for 4-4, before the top seed steeled herself to hold.\nWang then handed the second set on a plate to Swiatek with two double faults, and the Pole will face 27th seed Sorana Cirstea in the third round.\nEarlier, Gauff, 20, earned the first \u2018double bagel\u2019 victory of her career in a WTA Tour main draw event in only 51 minutes against her 33-year-old Dutch opponent Rus.\nThe American saved four break points in the match to become the third player ever to win 6-0, 6-0 in the Madrid Open main draw.\nWorld number three Gauff will face Ukraine\u2019s Dayana Yastremska next.\nSamsonova brought former world number one Osaka\u2019s return to clay to a halt with a 6-2, 4-6, 7-5 victory.\nFour-time Grand Slam champion Osaka twice battled back from a break down in the second set to force a decisive third but world number 17 Samsonova eventually ground out the win.\nJapanese star Osaka returned to tennis in January after a long break and earned her first victory on clay for two years on Wednesday against Greet Minnen.\nHowever Russian 15th seed Samsonova, whom Osaka beat at Indian Wells in March, was able to end a four-match losing streak with her victory in two hours 22 minutes in the Spanish capital.\nHard-court expert Osaka, 26, is not overly fond of the red dirt and has not won back-to-back matches on the surface since 2019.\nShe lost last week at the Rouen Open in France against Martina Trevisan in her first match back on clay but improved this week.\n\u201cI felt \u2014 I don\u2019t want to say happy \u2014 I felt good that I was able to fight back,\u201d said Osaka.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a big difference from my match in France, so I was happy that I learned from that match, but obviously really sad that I lost.\u201d\nSamsonova raced into a 4-0 first set lead, breaking in the first and third games as Osaka struggled.\n\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s not the sliding part for me, it\u2019s the touch,\u201d said Osaka. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m getting the balls, I\u2019m just not really placing them well.\u201d\nSamsonova will face Madison Keys in the next round.\nNADAL OUTCLASS BLANCH\nMeanwhile in the Madrid Open men\u2019s first round fixture on Thursday, Rafael Nadal thrashed 16-year-old wild  card Darwin Blanch 6-1, 6-0 and will face Australian 10th seed Alex de Minaur next. \nThe 22-time Grand Slam champion broke the American at the first  opportunity in the second game before grabbing the first set in just 28  minutes. \nNadal, who last claimed the title on  Madrid\u2019s clay in 2017, broke again to take the lead in the second set  and kept up the pace, giving a tennis masterclass to Blanch who is still  seeking his first tour win. \nThe age gap between the pair was 21 years and 117 days, the biggest between two opponents at ATP Masters 1000 level. \nThe American teen committed 27 unforced errors in what was his  second ATP tour match after he had made his debut last month in Miami. \n\u201cI think today I played against someone with a great future in front of him,\u201d Nadal said.  \u201c(But) Today he was making mistakes. \n\u201cI tried to be there and be solid all the time without taking a  lot of risks. I\u2019m happy to be through and I wish him all the very best. \n\u201cFor me after how things developed the last few years, every time I  have a chance to be on court on this amazing stadium with unconditional  support means a lot to me. Trying to enjoy every moment.\u201d\nDespite the ease of his victory, Nadal said it did not mean anything in terms of his prospects of competing at his beloved Roland Garros.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t change my perspective on Paris and it will not change here, I\u2019ll make a decision after Rome.\u201d \nThe win was Nadal\u2019s record-extending 57th victory in Madrid, a tournament that he has won five times. \nHe will play world number 11 De Minaur in the second round on Saturday.\n"

            "Text": "LAHORE: The upcoming T20 World Cup remains Pakistan focus despite their loss to a depleted New Zealand side in the fourth Twenty20 International here at the Gaddafi Stadium on Thursday.\nThe result confirmed the hosts would not be able to win the five-match series even if they trump New Zealand in the final match at the same venue on Saturday. A victory for Pakistan would see the series end 2-2, with the two teams sharing the winners\u2019 trophy.\nAfter their seven-wicket defeat in the third match in Rawalpindi, Pakistan had gone into the first fixture in Lahore with five changes, with mainstays Mohammad Rizwan, Shaheen Shah Afridi and Naseem Shah not featuring.\nWhile the changes may have had a role in Pakistan\u2019s four-wicket loss, for the national side\u2019s management, testing less experienced players to strengthen the bench means more with the World Cup less than two months away.\n\u201cWhen your main players don\u2019t play it does make a difference,\u201d Pakistan batter Fakhar Zaman, whose effort of 61 off 45 went in vain on Thursday, admitted. \u201cBut we are focusing on the World Cup, which is why we\u2019re making changes in every match.\u201d\nNew Zealand are touring Pakistan with their first-choice players absent, majorly due to their involvement in the ongoing Indian Premier League. Led by off-spinner Michael Bracewell, the BlackCaps contingent are being considered as second, if not third-string. Their opponents\u2019 standing has made defeats in the last two matches embarrassing for Pakistan. \n\u201cNo one likes to lose a match at the international level but again for each one of us the World Cup and finding the right combination for it matters the most,\u201d Fakhar noted. \u201cMeanwhile, we will try our best to win the next match.\n\u201cBoth things are important, the World Cup comes after a long gap, but it is also important to win individual matches at the international level.\u201d\nA newly-formed selection committee and a revamped coaching setup ahead of the New Zealand series has adopted a rotation policy focused on preparing Pakistan for the World Cup \u2014 to be held in the United States and the West Indies in June.\nThe management, Fakhar revealed, has clearly communicated to players about their roles and the number of opportunities they will be provided. \n\u201cIf I talk about myself, the management had informed me before the series that I will not play the first three matches,\u201d said the flamboyant southpaw. \u201cSimilarly, each player was given clarity over the matches they will feature in and the ones they won\u2019t play.\u201d\nMARGINAL ERRORS\nPakistan head coach Azhar Mahmood, who has taken up the role on a consultancy basis only for the New Zealand series, believed the two teams were separated in the fourth match only by margins.\nThe former all-rounder pointed out at intricate details that gave New Zealand the edge throughout the match, while hoping Pakistan will work on their shortcomings. \n\u201cThere were a few positives for us as we scored more boundaries than New Zealand,\u201d Azhar said. \u201cWe also bowled more dot balls but they just took more doubles than us. These are areas of concern for us and we\u2019re constantly working on it.\u201d\nThe 49-year-old was did not seem to be worried about Pakistan losing three wickets in the powerplay, which saw Saim Ayub and Usman Khan \u2014 both being tested as potential first-choice players \u2014 along with captain Babar Azam depart early.\nFor Azhar, the intent to score mattered more than keeping wickets in hand. \n\u201cWe always talk about showing intent,\u201d he observed. \u201cThe way Usman Khan showed intent today was pleasant to watch. He played some good shots but couldn\u2019t perform the way we wanted him to. But intent-wise, he was spot on.\u201d\nWhile Pakistan will be desperate to win the final match and draw the series, there are chances of rain playing spoilsport. Clouds hovered over the city after a storm followed by a spell of rain on Friday. \nNew Zealand were to go for an optional practice session but that was also called off due to rain. Meanwhile, Pakistan chose to rest on Friday.\n"

            "Text": "KARACHI: West Indies women stunned Pakistan as they edged the hosts by one in a last-ball thriller here at the National Bank Stadium on Friday.\nPakistan, chasing a seemingly easy target of 123 runs, were cruising towards it until a trigger was collapsed and the West Indies ensured they made the most of it.\nThe Nida Dar-led side had got off to a decent start in terms of runs but lost openers Gul Feroza and Sidra Ameen and Ayesha Zafar by the halfway stage.\nThe incoming Nida arrived right in the midst of the crisis and started Pakistan\u2019s rescue mission. She first combined with Muneeba Ali for 22 runs off 20 balls before accumulating 28 off 26 with fellow veteran Aliya Riaz.\nHowever, when Karishma Ramharack got Aliya to leave Pakistan at 104-5 at the start of the 18th over, things got out of control for the home side. The bowler took two more wickets in the same over, first that of Fatima Sana and then Nida herself, leaving Pakistan in tatters.\nYougsters Najiha Alvi and Tuba Hassan still took Pakistan far enough that they needed two runs off the last ball, which Najiha missed and still tried to complete a desperate single in an attempt to tie the match and take it to the super over, but West Indies wicket-keeper Shemaine Campbell hit the stumps to run Tuba out.\nRamharack finished with four wickets for 15 runs, while Qiana Joseph, Hayley Matthews and Afy Fletcher took a wicket each.\nEarlier, West Indies struggled with the bat after winning the toss as they lost their in-form captain Matthews on the second ball of their innings.\nTheir highest scorer was Joseph, who added 34 off 36 to the total, while Stafanie Taylor scored 30 off 32.\nThe two had combined for a run-a-ball 55-run partnership after the dismissal of openers Matthews and her partner Campbell. But after that, none of the West Indies batter could drag the visitors out of trouble.\nPacer Fatima took three wickets for 24 in her four overs, while spinner Sadia Iqbal, who had made the first breakthorugh, bagged two scalps.\nDiana Baig, Nida and Tuba took a wicket each.\nScores in brief: WEST INDIES 122-9 in 20 overs (Qiana Joseph 34, Stafanie Taylor 30; Fatima Sana 3-24); PAKISTAN 121-8 in 20 overs (Nida Dar 27, Sidra Ameen 23; Karishma Ramharack 4-15).\n"

            "Text": "\u2022 Apex court allows cantonments to charge property tax until Sindh govt enacts legislation\n\u2022 Says recovery of previous amounts to remain suspended till final decision in the case              \nISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court was told on Thursday that the Sindh government intended to bring a legislation to end a controversy whether the provincial government or the cantonment boards in Karachi will assess and collect the urban property tax from residents of cantonment areas.\nA five-judge bench headed by Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah ordered the Sindh government to legislate the law within a period of three months. \nIt said until the new law is devised, the earlier interim relief granted by the court in March 18 will continue. \nAccording to the interim relief, the cantonment boards will charge urban immovable property tax at the rates prescribed under the Sindh Urban Immovable Property Tax Act 1958, but the recovery of previous amounts will remain suspended until final decision of the case. \nBarrister Zeeshan Adhi represented the Sindh government.\nThe apex court also expressed the hope that after the enactment of the legislation, the issue would be resolved forever. However, it said, the Sindh government or any party in case of being aggrieved of the law may again approach the court.\nThe SC has taken a set of appeals moved by the federal government through the ministry of defence as well as cantonment boards in Karachi against the Jan 6 judgement of the Sindh High Court (SHC) in which it was held that after the amendment in Entry 50 in the Fourth Schedule of the Federal Legislative List (FLL) under the 18th Amendment, the federal government and cantonment boards lacked competence, power, and jurisdiction to levy, charge, impose and recover taxes on any immovable property including tax on the annual rental value of immovable property.\nThe high court\u2019s judgement had also noted that the 18th Amendment had restored the competence and jurisdiction of the province to levy, charge, recover and legislate on the subject identified and to pursue it accordingly.\nAt the last hearing on March 18, the Supreme Court had asked the Sindh government why it had failed to resolve the controversy when the option to bring legislation of enacting the law was available to the provincial government under Article 270A(3) of the Constitution and why the matter was being debated at the courts.\nIn return, the Sindh government\u2019s counsel had offered no plausible answer and sought time to obtain instructions from authorities in this regard.\nAttorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan had also contended that the Sindh Urban Immovable Property Tax Act 1958 was a provincial legislation and the urban rating area includes the cantonments. Subsequently the Presidential Order of 1979: the Cantonments (Urban Immovable Property Tax and Entertainments Duty) Order 1979 was promulgated on Aug 22, 1979 and subsequently protected under 18th Amendment in terms of Article 270A(6) of the Constitution. After the 18th Amendment, the Order 1979 was once again protected under Article 270A(3) of the Constitution.\nThus the only difference between the two laws is that under Order 1979, it was the cantonments that carry out assessment and collection as opposed to the Sindh government, the AGP had stated, adding Order 1979 falls within the federal domain.\nThe AGP had also contended that due to the SHC judgement, the cantonments had stopped collecting taxes and without funds such boards could not function, thus unable to provide services to the people in the Cantonment areas.\nOn Thursday, the Sindh government told the Supreme Court that they intended to bring legislation in this regard.\nThe appeals by the federal and cantonment boards argued that the high court judgement had not appreciated the fact that it was inherent in the nature of a local government to raise taxes, fee, cess for the purposes of local governance and provisions of municipality amenities, services which was a global phenomenon.\nThe petition contended that the cantonment boards were local authorities and fall within the meaning of the State in terms of Article 7 of the Constitution and as such the boards were by law empowered to impose any tax, fee or cess in its jurisdiction.\nThe cantonment boards has been discharging their functions and duties and collecting taxes, fee, taxes on the value of the buildings within their territorial limits.\nSome residents of cantonments in Karachi had challenged the property tax before the SHC and stated that such taxes could not be imposed and collected by the cantonments.\n"

The AAG said that as per district administration, it may take a month.\nResponding to another query of the chief justice about any other political gathering, the lawyer for petitioner, Ali Tahir, argued that the Pakistan Markazi Muslim League had held a public meeting at Shahrah-i-Quaideen a couple of days ago. However, the DC submitted that no such permission was granted for the gathering.\nAt this, the chief justice asked the officials as to what action had been taken against the persons concerned for holding the public meeting without permission. However, the DC and other officials could not offer any suitable reply.\nThe chief justice further said that the court would not be convinced until a reasonable justification was offered for denying permission for public meeting.\nWhile addressing the petitioner and his lawyer, he also remarked that if any untoward incident happened during the gathering, the administration would hold them accountable.\nThe bench adjourned the hearing till May 6, after the lawyer for petitioner sought a short adjournment to examine the report of district administration.\nThe DC in his statement also attached the reports of SSP (East), SHO Brigade and assistant commissioner concerned.\nThe police officials in their reports stated that security vetting and ground checks were conducted and it had transpired that in the wake of recent developments nationally and geopolitically, the hostile elements were engaging more actively in the terrorist and sabotage activities in the country.\n\u201cThat numerous threat alerts are received from sister agencies, especially regarding Karachi, in which hostile elements are planning to carrying out terrorist and sabotage actives, which may result in loss of lives of the innocent citizens\u201d, the reports said.\nPTI-Sindh general secretary Ali Ahmed Palh petitioned the SHC and submitted that the party had approached the district and provincial administration on a number of occasions for permission or no-objection certificate to hold a public gathering, but to no avail.\n"

            "Text": "KARACHI: At a talk organised by the English Speaking Union Pakistan (ESUP) at a local hotel here on Friday, Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi discussed a number of challenges in governing Karachi.\nThe commissioner touched upon and explained the issues faced by the city such as uncontrolled population growth, jurisdictional quagmire, the ever changing local government system, inadequate master planning, poor water supply and sanitation, inefficient transport system, dilapidated heritage, degrading environment and cumbersome price and quality control.\nIn the last 70 years, the population of Karachi increased from 1,1 million to 20m, he said, adding that the biggest growth rate was in district Central and district East, which also saw the influx of people from upcountry. Therefore, the growth was rapid, which impacted livability.\n\u201cThe acute challenges facing Karachi, compounded by rapid population growth and complex governance structures have over the past few decades resulted in the degradation of its dense urban and social environment, making it one of the least livable cities globally,\u201d he said.\nThe fragmented governance also came in the way of urban planning and service delivery in Karachi and there had been seven master plans proposed for the city in the past, including two before independence in 1947, but despite efforts, the implementation of those plans had proven challenging, he said. \n\u201cThe first plan, proposed by A.E. Miran in 1922 was the only one fully approved and implemented. The second plan, proposed by Colonel Swain Thomas in 1946, and the subsequent five plans faced issues such as delayed publication, mismatched proposals with the current reality, legal and technical shortcomings and limited implementation,\u201d the commissioner pointed out.\nHe said another big issue faced by the city was its water supply as water was being supplied to Karachi from considerably distant locations through a bulk conveyance system consisting of a complex network of canals, conduits, siphons, multi-stage pumping and filtration. \nThe present supply to Karachi from Indus and Hub was approximately 650MGD. The gallons per capita water demand for a population of 20 million was 1,080MGD, bringing the current shortfall to 430MGD.\n\u201cBy 2025, the projected population of Karachi will be 23 million, bringing up the demand to 1,242MGD and a shortfall of 600MGD,\u201d he said and added that the city also suffered from a poor drainage \nsystem along with the issue of solid waste management.\nAccording to him, the main issues of the transport sector in Karachi include inadequate road network, overcrowding and congestion, a predominantly radial road network with limited circumferential connectivity and an absence of mass transit and adequate public transport.\nHe said Karachi was also one of the most vulnerable cities of Pakistan, prone to different kinds of threats and hazards due to its unique geo-climatic conditions. It was at a high risk of disasters such as floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, water scarcity, heat waves and fire, he added.\n\u201cDue to a high incidence of air, land and water pollution that results from inadequate management of solid and hazardous waste including municipal waste, medical waste, raw sewerage, industrial affluent and vehicular pollution, a large population of Karachi is prone to diseases linked to environmental pollution,\u201d he pointed out.\nAs for the price and quality control challenges, he said that the precarious economic situation led to continuous price fluctuations. \u201cAdditionally, groceries, milk and meat prices are subject to frequent fluctuations due to factors such as seasonal variations. Hence, formulating effective policies may become challenging,\u201d he said.\nHe added that the supply chain for essential commodities in Karachi was also complex and fragmented, involving numerous intermediaries, wholesalers and retailers. \u201cThis complexity makes it difficult to track price fluctuations and identify instances of price gouging or hoarding,\u201d he said.\nPresident International Council of ESU and Patron-in-Chief ESUP Aziz Memon, its President Pervez H. Madraswala and Secretary General Majyd Aziz also spoke.\n"

            "Text": "DADU: Several nightlong gatherings of Sindhi nationalist leaders and activists were held in Sann town to pay homage to veteran politician G.M. Syed on his 29th death anniversary observed on Thursday. \nAlthough large groups of men, women and children had started arriving Sann since Wednesday morning from across Sindh to attend the anniversary events, they proceeded to the venue of their choice as the Sindh United Party, Jeay Sindh Movement, Jeay Sindh Qaumi Mahaz, Jeay Sindh Mahaz, (proscribed) Jeay Sindh Muttahida Mahaz and each of their breakaway factions had organised separate programmes close to the grave of the veteran leader. \nAll those destined for Sann had to pass through security check posts set up all along the routes leading to the town. Unlike in the past, there were no reports of any traveller having been detained by the police, Rangers or some other security agency. Nor was there any such claim made by the nationalist entities. \nThe event passed off by and large peacefully. \nSyed\u2019s followers used to be detained and even arrested in crackdowns allegedly for raising anti-state and anti-army slogans at gatherings held in the past to observe his birth or death anniversary anywhere in the province. However, this time the participants, perhaps, refrained from raising such slogans. \nThe main anniversary programme was held at the Syeds\u2019 residence which was hosted by Sindh United Party (SUP) Chairman Syed Jalal Mahmood Shah, the grandson of G.M. Syed. \nThe entire SUP leadership and a large number of party workers and supporters led by its President, Syed Zain Shah, attended the programme, which started on Thursday evening and continued into Friday morning.\nThe participants took out a torch-bearing ally from G.M. Syed\u2019s residence to his grave. They laid floral wreaths and showered rose petals on the grave and paid their respect to the late leader. \nThe SUP leaders spoke to the participants at a remembrance held at Syeds\u2019 residence.  \nSyed Zain Shah paid homage to the late leader saying that his nationalist philosophy is aimed at creating harmony between each two nations living in the country. He recalled that G.M. Syed had endorsed the 1940 Resolution and played a key role in the creation of Pakistan. \u201cG.M. Syed is the name of political ethics, character, courage and steadfastness,\u201d he remarked, and said he propagated peace, love and brotherhood through his philosophy and active politics. He was a true lover of Sindh and Sindhis and always worked for making Pakistan stronger, Shah said. \nUnfortunately, he added, G.M. Syed was incarcerated and kept in detention for a big part of his life over his nationalist views, politics and activism which were not liked by the establishment. \nHe paid rich tributes to G.M. Syed for his life-long struggle for the rights of Sindh and Sindhi nation. \nZain Shah said followers and supporters of Syed would carry forward his mission with great vigour and continue their struggle till Sindh and Sindhis were given all their due constitutional rights.\nHe claimed that Sindh\u2019s rights and resources had been usurped in the past and were still being snatched. Even the very existence of Sindh was under threat today, he said, and vowed to intensify the struggle to protect its territory and all its interests.\nHe said that all nations in Pakistan should be regarded equal and they should have ownership and authority on their respective resources.\nThe SUP president also criticised the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party for keeping feudal lords within its ranks \u201cand patronising criminal activities, like kidnapping for ransom and dacoities, through them\u201d. He alleged that PPP lawmakers and police had a nexus with the criminal gangs due to which law and order situation in Sindh had constantly been deteriorating. \n\u2018Sufi Melo\u2019 was one of the main features of SUP\u2019s programme where poets recited mystic verses and vocalists gave musical performance. \nThe other programmes held in Sann to observe G.M. Syed\u2019s death anniversary were organised by JSQM led by its Chairman Sanan Qureshi, JSQM-Arisar led by Aslam Khairpuri, JSM-R led by Riaz Chandio and proscribed JSMM led by Shafi Burfat.\n"

When they were handed back the bodies they stopped ambulances and once again placed the bodies at Zero-point in the city to block the Sukkur-Shikarpur road, they said.\nThe protesters raised slogans against the area\u2019s police and demanded immediate action against Marfani assailants.\nFormer provincial minister Imtiaz Ahmed Shaikh rejected, in a media talk, the protesters\u2019 allegations implicating his son in the attack. Everyone knew the incident was an offshoot of an old feud between the rival groups of Bhayo and Marfani clans, who had been at daggers drawn with each other for a long time, he said, adding his family had nothing to do with their dispute or the incident.\nShikarpur SPP told this correspondent on mobile phone that police believed the incident was in continuation of a simmering feud between rival groups of Bhayo and Marfani clans. Police teams had cordoned off the area and managed to control the situation to avert further bloodshed, he said.\nHe said that police had mounted search for the assailants and would arrest them soon. The dispute had so far claimed 10 lives and caused injuries to several persons on both sides, he said. \n"

Dacoits and outlaws had become more powerful than police because the district police themselves had become accomplice with bandits, they said.\nThey said that crimes of killing, robberies, looting, snatching and abduction for ransom had become a routine in the district, which had inflicted huge economic losses on the district. They believed the unsettled tribal feuds and armed clashes among clans had promoted purchase of sophisticated weapons and ammunition. The tribal feuds raged on as police had failed to control the assailants and killers of innocent people, they said.\nThey said that residents of the district, particularly Hindu families, had started migrating from the district due to growing crime rate and unbridled lawlessness and tribal feuds across the district.\nThe protesters demanded that Chief of Army Staff, Chief Justice of Pakistan and other higher authorities should take notice of unrest in Kandhkot-Kashmore district and restore peace in the district.\n"

The two sides discussed \u2018growing\u2019 street crimes in the city and sought an effective policing system to curb the menace.\nDuring the meeting, the home minister sought cooperation from the MQM-P , asking the delegation to come forward and support the police in their efforts to protect life and property of the people.\nOpposition leader Khurshidi said that the MQM-P wanted a political and administrative solution of the problem of street crime.\nTalking to the media after the meeting, Mr Khurshidi said that killing of youths during street crimes was not a \u2018political\u2019 but \u2018humanitarian issue\u2019.\n\u201cWe do not want partisan politics over this issue, but we want a political and administrative solution to this menace, therefore we came for the meeting,\u201d he said, adding that no party should give an \u2018ethnic\u2019 colour to the issue of street crime.\n\u201cWe will not let the citizens suffer because of negligence of the police or the government,\u201d he added.\nThe opposition leader warned that if street crime were not controlled, they would be compelled to stage a \u201cpolitical protest\u201d.\nResponding to a question, Mr Khurshidi said that the delegation asked the home minister to give preference to \u2018local officers\u2019 in appointing SHOs in Karachi.\nHe said the home minister was also asked to introduce \u2018community policing\u2019 in the metropolis.\nIGP admits surge in cars, motorbike snatching\nDuring the briefing, the IGP admitted that there was a surge in snatching of cars and motorcycles in Karachi, but brushed aside the impression about any rise in snatching of cell phones and theft of four-wheelers and two-wheelers, calming that due to \u2018efforts\u2019 of the law-enforcement agency the rate of street crimes in the metropolis was not growing, but rather \u2018declining\u2019.\nThe IGP said that till April 24, a total of 48 people were shot dead in street crimes whose 46 cases were registered.\nHe said 12 other murder cases had been included which did not belong to street crimes.\nHe said out of 46 cases, 27 cases had been \u2018traced or solved\u2019 while 13 suspected street criminals were shot dead in \u2018encounters\u2019 while 33 others, including 27 in injured condition, were arrested.\nHe said of the 12 other murder cases that a section of media had reported as robbery related killings, eight of them had been \u2018traced\u2019 and it transpired that they were the outcome of other crimes, not robbery.\n256 street crimes per day reported in 2023\nGiving comparative data, the IG said in the last year of 2023, 256 street crimes (which included snatching of cars, bikes, cell phones and theft of four-wheelers and two-wheelers) per day were reported but in current year of 2024 till April 24, the said five heads of the street crimes were continuously declining.\nHe pointed out that in January 2024, 252 street crimes per day were reported, 251 in Feb, 243 in March and so far till April 24, a total of 174 street crimes reported per day as per data of the Citizens Police Liaison Committee and the police.\nThe IGP admitted that snatching of cars and motorcycles were on the rise, but snatching of cell phones and theft of four-wheelers and two-wheelers were on decline.\nHe pointed out that last year from January to April 24, 2023, a total of 8,912 cell phones were snatched, but during the same corresponding period this year, 6,940 mobile phones were snatched, thus there was a reduction of 1,972 cell phones.\n\u201cBy making comparative analysis of street crimes, I don\u2019t want to show that we\u2019re \u2018satisfied\u2019 with the crimes but we feel sorry over the loss of innocent lives and want to tell the people that the police are making concerted efforts to eliminate this menace,\u201d observed the IG.\n\u2018Cops with ties to riverine dacoits not given posting in Karachi\u2019\nThe IGP said that the MQM-P lawmakers had raised the issue of policemen suspected of having links with dacoit gangs in riverine area.\nHe said he informed them that none of them had been given posting in Karachi. They were transferred to the police headquarters in Karachi to face inquiries over their alleged criminal activities.\n\u201cThese policemen have the right to defend themselves,\u201d said the IG. Different officers have been appointed for inquiries against them. If the transferred policemen are found involved in criminal activities, they will be \u2018challaned\u2019 (formerly charge-sheeted).\nHe said none of the policemen transferred from Shikarpur had been given posting in Karachi.\n"

They were carrying placards, PTI flags, portraits of Imran Khan and chanting slogans for his release.\nAddressing the participants at Chaar Minar Chowrangi in Bahadurabad, PTI-Sindh president Haleem Adil Sheikh vowed that the struggle of the PTI workers was set to bear fruit and their \u201cbeloved leader\u201d would soon be among them.\n\u201cImran Khan\u2019s days in prison are going to be over and he would be soon among you,\u201d he said. \u201cThis fake government can no more stand against the people\u2019s will.\u201d\nHe said that the entire country was paying the price for what happened on February 8 in the name of elections. \u201cThose who were celebrating their fake victories are now not able to face the public. Even the formation of the governments in the Centre and provinces has become joke for everyone.\u201d\nHe said that on Feb 8, the people of Karachi voted for PTI and there was no other party on ground in the contest. But it\u2019s an ironic that those who were rejected by the people of Karachi were imposed again only for the vested interests of certain quarters.\nIn district South, a large number of women activists of the PTI assembled outside the Karachi Press Club to hold a protest.\nIn Hyderabad, activists of PTI staged a protest demonstration outside the local press club for release of Imran Khan and against rigging in by elections. \nThe protesters raised slogans against the government and demanded withdrawal of cases against Imran Khan and his spouse. \nThey said that the government was working like \u201ca slave of the US\u201d and accused it of victimising PTI workers and leaders.\nIn Nawabshah, party workers gathered at Shiraz Chowk to stage a rally.\nIn Sanghar, PTI activists also held a protest demonstration against the prolonged incarceration of their founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi. \nThe Umerkot chapter of the party also took out a rally and demanded that Mr Khan be released forthwith.\n"

            "Text": "NEW DELHI: The second phase of Indian elections on Friday saw 88 constituencies in the fray, including Rahul Gandhi\u2019s contest in communist-ruled Kerala.\nSpeculation is rife that he could return to Amethi in Uttar Pradesh to challenge BJP\u2019s Smriti Irani. The cabinet minister defeated him in the traditional Gandhi family hub narrowly in 2019.\nAlternate media claims Priyanka Gandhi will be the Congress candidate from the neighbouring Rae Bareli constituency after her mother Sonia Gandhi moved over to the Rajya Sabha.\nA low voter turnout in Uttar Pradesh was below the 60 per cent overall voting in the second phase. Low voting is being seen as unfavourable for Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the BJP\u2019s bastion.\n\nModi appears to be in a bind against challenge from opposition alliance; Indian SC turns down opposition plea to make EVMs more transparent\n\nVoters said they did not receive the usual voting slips or reminders from the RSS workers who otherwise shore up the BJP usually.\nMr Modi has veered between communal invective against Muslims and wooing Muslim women in the next meeting, announcing some Haj facilities for them. This is being seen as an indication that he is in a bind against a robust challenge from the INDIA alliance.\nThe election commission has issued a notice to the BJP president to explain Mr Modi\u2019s controversial speeches. The Supreme Court has come to the rescue once again by turning down opposition demands to make the electronic voting machines more transparent.\nMr Modi on Friday demanded an apology from the opposition for \u201ccommitting the sin of creating distrust\u201d over EVMs. He was speaking at public rallies in Araria and Munger in Bihar when the Supreme Court\u2019s order dismissing petitions came through.\n\u201cWhen the Congress, the [Rasht\u00adriya Janata Dal] RJD and other INDIA alliance parties were in power, the poor, backwards and Dalits used to be deprived of their votes through booth capture. With the introduction of EVMs, they are no longer able to play their old game. Hence, they committed the sin of creating distrust against EVMs,\u201d the prime minister alleged in Araria.\n\u201cThe decision has exposed the Congress and other constituents of the opposition INDIA bloc,\u201d he said, claiming that opposition parties had taken every opportunity to \u201cdefame\u201d the Election Commission of India by raising questions on the credibility of EVMs.\nAs polling concluded for 88 seats across 13 states and Union Territories, Mr Modi expressed his gratitude to the voters. He said the second phase had been \u201ctoo good\u201d, adding that \u201cthe unparalleled support for NDA is going to disappoint the opposition even more\u201d.\nAs per the election commission data, the average voter turnout stood at 60.96pc till 7pm, while the lone constituency going to polls in Tripura recorded the highest turnout with 78.53pc eligible voters casting their votes. The lowest turnout was recorded in Uttar Pradesh at 53.67pc.\nA third of the total 543 Lok Sabha seats \u2014 including all the seats in Kerala, Rajasthan, Manipur and Tripura, and 14 of the 28 seats in Karnataka \u2014 have now completed polling.\nThere were a total 1,202 candidates in the fray. The Dalit Bhaujan Samaj Party, seen as a disruptor of opposition unity, has fielded the most candidates in this phase at 74, followed by the BJP at 69 and the Congress at 68. Congreess-ruled Karnataka, with 14 seats going to polls, had the most candidates at 247, followed by Maharashtra (8 seats) at 204 and Kerala (all its 20 seats) at 189.\n"

They never spoke again.\n\u201cEven until now, we couldn\u2019t believe that he\u2019s no more,\u201d he said at the funeral. \u201cWe are very proud of him because Islam, our religion, says that if you save even one human, you save all of humanity.\u201d \nJoel Cauchi, a 40-year-old who suffered mental health issues, killed five women and Tahir in the mall on April 13 before being shot dead by police.\n"

Jubilant Hindu activists had proclaimed when the mosque was destroyed that more would follow, identifying the Shahi Idgah in Mathura as one of their future targets.\nModi\u2019s opponents accuse his Hindu-nationalist government of marginalising India\u2019s 220-million-plus Muslims.\nHe was accused last weekend of \u201cblatantly targeting\u201d the coomunity in a campaign speech in which he claimed his opponents had once pledged that Muslims had \u201cfirst right over the nation\u2019s wealth\u201d.\n\u2018Most important issue\u2019 \nTemples small and large line Mathura\u2019s narrow, pot-holed streets, teeming with young men offering guided tours for pilgrims.\nThe street leading to the mosque has for decades been guarded by a stern, round-the-clock police detachment to prevent vandalism.\nA polling station nearby is testament to the close quarters in which the city\u2019s two main communities live, with women in Muslim dress voting alongside saffron-clad Hindu priests.\nMicrocosm of religious divide\nBut with Hindus accounting for more than 80 per cent of Mathura\u2019s population, its religious divide is a microcosm of the one across India at large.\nIts parliamentary seat has been held by the BJP since Modi was first elected in 2014, represented by movie star Hema Malini, and the Ayodhya temple\u2019s inauguration has galvanised Hindu voters in the city who support the mosque\u2019s removal.\nGokul Prasad, an electrician, said Modi\u2019s inauguration of the Ayodhya temple was the \u201csingle most important issue\u201d of the election campaign.\n\u201cSince we live in Mathura so close to the Shahi Idgah, we will obviously vote for Modi,\u201d the 50-year-old said.\nThe fate of the Shahi Idgah has also mobilised the city\u2019s Muslims. But several said they had lined up to vote on Friday only to find their names were missing on the electoral rolls. \u201cThey told me neither I nor my husband can vote as our names are not there,\u201d said 55-year-old Rehana Qureshi, no relation to Tasleem, outside a polling booth.\n"

Now it\u2019s time that he assumes the office of the party president and lead the party to new heights of popularity,\u201d the resolution said.\nPML-N Punjab President Rana Sanaullah told a presser after the meeting that Mr Nawaz was being made president of the party again primarily to \u201cundo the injustice\u201d the Supreme Court meted out to him in 2017 in Panama Papers-related corruption cases.\nMr Sanaullah said the party would \u201crequest\u201d Mr Nawaz to accept the party\u2019s president\u2019s office upon his return from China. Nawaz Sharif left for China on a five-day private visit on the day the Iranian president arrived in Islamabad early this week.\n\u201cNawaz Sharif was removed from the party president\u2019s office through a conspiracy. Now that Nawaz Sharif has been acquitted in all (corruption) cases, he should take up the party\u2019s reins,\u201d Mr Sanaullah said.\nAsked whether Mr Nawaz was being made the PML-N president again to have a complete hold of the party affairs, Mr Sanaullah said this was not the case, as all the decisions made by the current party president, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, were already endorsed by the elder Sharif.\nMr Sanaullah said Mr Nawaz would inject new impetus into the party and reorganise it under his leadership.\nThe former interior minister also did not rule out new appointments to other party offices after Nawaz Sharif\u2019s return.\nIt has been learnt that Khawaja Saad Rafique, who lost his National Assembly seats in Lahore, is lobbying with the Sharifs for the party\u2019s secretary general seat.\nMr Sanaullah also tried to give the impression that there had been no grouping in the party. Referring to PML-N leader Javed Latif, he said, \u201cThose sitting beside me show that there is a freedom of expression in the party\u201d.\nMr Latif, who lost his NA seat from his hometown of Sheikhupura, has made different claims regarding the PML-N\u2019s lower-than-expected performance in the February general elections and the establishment\u2019s role.\nSimilarly, Rana Sanaullah and Saad Rafique also made some controversial statements regarding Shehbaz Sharif\u2019s coalition government. Since the trio is considered from the Nawaz camp, their statements were taken as expressions of the elder Sharif\u2019s sentiments.\nTo a question, Mr Sanaullah said that if courts gave bail to PTI founder Imran Khan, he could come out of jail. Earlier, Mr Sanaullah said Nawaz Sharif was willing to talk to Mr Khan for the country\u2019s sake.\nFollowing his arrival in Lahore in October last year after a four-year self-imposed exile in London, Nawaz Sharif got a clean chit in Panama Papers-related corruption cases.\nHe was all set to become prime minister for a fourth time, but his party failed to get a simple majority in the Feb 8 polls. Mr Nawaz then allowed Shehbaz Sharif, considered close to the military establishment, to lead a six-party coalition government in the Centre.\nRecently, PML-N Senator Irfan Siddiqui dismissed the impression that Mr Nawaz\u2019s path to premiership was blocked by an \u201cunseen power\u201d or his younger brother, Mr Shehbaz.\n\u201cDuring my meetings with the three-time prime minister before the 2024 general elections, I felt that Nawaz Sharif was not eager to assume the PM Office for the fourth time,\u201d he said while talking at a Geo News programme. He also dismissed the impression that Mr Nawaz was impatient and restless in becoming the premier again and described it as media speculation.\nHowever, Mr Sanaullah disagreed with Mr Siddiqui\u2019s assertion, insisting that the PML-N\u2019s candidate for the premier\u2019s slot was Nawaz Sharif. \u201cSince the party failed to get a simple majority, it decided to make Shehbaz the premier,\u201d he said.\n"

Meanwhile, the meeting was told that the first phase of repatriating the foreign residents living in Pakistan without any identity documents is in progress.  \nThe PM said elements involved in the deep-rooted menace of corruption and criminal negligence for denting the national economy would be held accountable.  \nReferring to the track and trace system agreement made in 2019, the prime minister said this system was nothing but a cruel joke to the nation as no improvement was seen in the sectors of tobacco, cement, sugar and fertiliser.  \nThe agreement (signed between the government and these industries to monitor production and sales) is totally a fraud as it does not even include a penalty clause in it, he added.  \nThe PM ordered formation of an inquiry committee to ascertain the failure of the agreement and submission of its report within 72 hours.  \nAs regards the macroeconomic indicators, the prime minister expressed satisfaction over the collective performance of both the incumbent and interim governments. \u201cAccording to a recently published report on Pakistan economy, many indicators, including IT export, remittances and capital market, are showing positive results due to the prudent policies of the government,\u201d he added.  \n\u201cHowever, a lot of work needs to be done,\u201d he said, adding that the government will perform \u201cmajor surgical operation\u201d to get rid of deep-rooted flaws in the country\u2019s economy. \nPower theft, FBR reforms \nPM Shehbaz told the meeting that he had completed the power sector review in four phases in which important decisions were taken to minimise power theft and line losses, and to reduce prices of electricity. \u201cThe government also decided in principle to divest the electricity distribution companies (Discos),\u201d he added.  \nThe PM said the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) had old and obsolete systems which needed to be replaced to increase tax-to-GDP ratio. He said the FBR had the potential to earn extra revenues worth hundreds of billions of rupees by implementing reforms in its system. \u201cWe have to take tough decision in larger interest of the country and we will fully monitor the implementation phase,\u201d he remarked. \nPIA privatisation \nAbout the privatisation of state-owned entities (SOEs), the prime minister assured the meeting that the process would be done without any delay and in a transparent manner.  \nThe PM was informed that the privatisation process of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) was on track and several companies were taking keen interest in the airlines.  \nThe privatisation secretary, while briefing the cabinet on the recent progress in PIA\u2019s privatisation process, said the advertisements inviting expressions of interest were published in national and international newspapers on April 2, with the last date being May 3, and so far several companies had expressed keen interest in PIA.  \nThe aviation secretary informed the meeting that service counters at the airports had been increased and further improvement of the facilities was in progress.  \nOn the recommendation of the Ministry of Law and Justice, the cabinet approved the establishment of an additional special court in Makran division to deal with anti-narcotics cases in Balochistan. The jurisdiction of this court will be extended to Panjgur, Kech, Gwadar, Hub and Lasbela districts.  \nThe cabinet directed that judges of good repute be appointed in the special court and the prosecution process be made more effective.  \nThe meeting was told that the consultation with all stakeholders regarding a policy for use of drone technology in the agriculture sector was in final stages and it will soon be presented to the cabinet for approval.  \nThe cabinet also approved the appointment of four ex-officio members of the Board of the Institute of Cost and Management Accountants of Pakistan (ICMAP). \nCarbon credits \nMeanwhile, chairing the third meeting of Pakistan Council for Climate Change, PM Sharif ordered formation of a committee for consultation with the provinces for policy making on guiding principles for carbon credits.  \n\u201cOur challenges regarding climate change are increasing with every passing day,\u201d he said, adding without the consultation with the provinces, there was no question of policy making of any kind on the issue.  \nThe participants discussed in detail policy guidelines for foreign trading in carbon credits.\n"

The conference, attended by key civil and military officials including Federal Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal and Federal Minister for National Food Security Rana Tanveer Hussain, showcased various agricultural advancements under GPI.\nThe GPI aims to revolutionise agriculture through the introduction of model farms, water management schemes, technology innovations, and investment partnerships. The initiative, launched in July last year, is aimed at ensuring food security and enhancing agricultural productivity across Pakistan. \nThe Fauji Foundation, through its subsidiary Fon\u00adGrow, is leading the corporate farming initiative.\nGen Munir stated, \u201cComplete independence is not possible without economic stability,\u201d underscoring that economic growth is a foundational element for maintaining national sovereignty.\nWith the aggravation of country\u2019s economic turmoil, the military has significantly broadened its role in economic domain. The Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), which aims to secure foreign investments and boost economic stability, exemplifies this trend. Moreover, the involvement of the military in facilitating major agreements with countries like Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar shows the expanding economic influence of the military.\nThe army chief reassured military\u2019s continued support for the economic development of the country, affirming that \u201cArmy will continue to provide all possible support for the economic development of Pakistan\u201d. \nGen Munir used the occasion to highlight the military\u2019s intensifying worries about the social media challenge. \u201cNegative propaganda and social media trolls cannot distract us from working for the development and prosperity of Pakistan and its people,\u201d he maintained In his remarks at the conference, he urged national unity against detractors, saying, \u201cWe are all a united team Pakistan\u2026 Inshallah with the cooperation and support of the people, all efforts of those who distract and obstruct Pakistan\u2019s development journey will fail.\u201d\nThe federal ministers, who participated in the conference, praised the \u201ctransformative potential\u201d of the GPI. \u201cThe initiatives will introduce contemporary best practices in Pakistan\u2019s agriculture sector,\u201d they remarked.\n"

            "Text": "\u2022 Farmers advised to secure harvests, citizens asked to avoid unnecessary travel\n\u2022 Rain, falling prices put wheat crop in Punjab at risk\nISLAMABAD / LAHORE: The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) issued a nationwide alert on Friday, cautioning against severe weather conditions expec\u00adted to persist until April 29. \nThe forecast predicts rain, storms, and hail, potentially leading to flash floods and landslides across the country.\n\u201cHailstorms can damage crops and infrastructure. People should avoid unnecessary travel and crossing rivers and canals. Repair mud houses and ensure water drainage,\u201d the NDMA said, urging citizens to stay away from electric poles and trees in case of lightning. It advised farmers to plan their harvest, especially wheat, according to the weather.\nThe warning comes at a time when crops are ready to be harvested, especially the wheat crop.\nProlonged spells of rain have already delayed wheat harvest in the Potohar region. Farmers in the area have complained about an unprecedented rise in the cost of harvest, saying it has doubled compared to last year due to an increase in fuel prices.\nThough the harvest has begun in some parts of the plateau, farmers were worried that the untimely rains would affect the yield. They also fret about the rise in electricity, labour and agricultural machinery costs.\nMeanwhile, the Pakis\u00adtan Meteorological Depar\u00adt\u00adment (PMD) has also flagged the onset of a westerly wave that could exacerbate conditions through April 30. This system is expected to bring widespread rain and thunderstorms, particularly impacting Khyber Pakh\u00adtun\u00adkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan, Galiyat, Murree, and Azad Jammu and Kashmir.\nThe PMD said the anticipated heavy rainfall and thunderstorms posed risks of road disruptions, particularly affecting travellers and tourists. Authorities have urged individuals to monitor weather updates before embarking on journeys. Disruptions in electricity and other utility services were also anticipated. In addition to the risks posed by heavy rainfall, flash flooding in local streams and river tributaries, as well as landslides and mudslides, were potential hazards in upper KP, Galiyat, Murree, GB and AJK. Farmers have been advised to take extra precautions and adjust agricultural activities accordingly.\nThe PMD also warned that Balochistan would continue to experience adverse weather conditions, including heavy rainfall, leading to flash flooding in local nullahs and hill torrents in the Sulaiman and the Kirthar mountain ranges.\nThe new spell of heavy rains with thunderstorms that started in Balochistan on Thursday continued  on Friday, triggering flash floods. \nIn the border town of Taftan, a man was swept away in the flash flood while a woman and her daughter were injured in a lightning strike on their house.\nThe death toll from rain-related incidents in Balochistan reached 19 while around 250 houses were washed away and about 1,850 partially damaged.\nOfficials said that 14 highways and link roads were badly affected in the flash floods that suspended traffic between Balochistan and other provinces.\nPunjab rains\nMeanwhile, Punjab, including the city of Lahore, experienced light showers and sporadic hailstorms on Friday afternoon, as predicted by the Met Office.\nWhile it was a mild shower, with the rainfall measuring a maximum of 10mm at one of Lahore\u2019s 16 Water and Sanitation Agency monitoring stations, it has heightened concerns among farmers already facing declining market rates for wheat and potential crop damage.\nMeteorological officials said the rain system, originating from India, is expected to intensify, bringing widespread showers to central and northern Punjab on Saturday. \u201cToday, it rained only in Lahore, with Sargodha and Bhakkar areas receiving traces. But in the next 24 hours, all areas of central and northern Punjab may get heavy rains, with thunder, hail and windstorms. In climatic terms, there is nothing to bother. But in an agricultural context, it poses significant risks,\u201d a Met Office employee said.\nFarmers, hoping for a slight recovery in wheat prices, had postponed harvesting. However, the recent weather conditions have only exacerbated their plight, soaking and potentially ruining the crops.\n\u201cThe April weather has always been unpredictable, but with climatic change taking effect, it has turned nasty this year,\u201d said Amanullah, a wheat farmer from Okara.\nPersistent strong winds have been damaging the standing crop since the start of the month. This varying degree of damage took place because, in April, the crop\u2019s stems lose contact with soil, and even mild wind can lead to uprooting.\nThe situation is further complicated by the economic backdrop. Despite a potentially record yield, wheat prices have plummeted, with rates ranging from Rs3,000 to Rs3,200 per maund, representing a loss of Rs700 to Rs900 for farmers.\nThe delay in harvesting was a strategy to mitigate a market glut and hope for price stabilisation, contingent on an aggressive procurement strategy by the Punjab government \u2014 a move that has not materialised.\nAs Punjab has harvested only about 10 per cent of its wheat so far, the remainder of the crop is vulnerable to ongoing adverse weather conditions.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a grim scenario for us,\u201d Amanullah lamented. \u201cCaught between a crashing market, an unsympathetic government, and now the fury of Mother Nature, we are bracing for the impact and hoping for the best.\u201d\nSaleem Shahid in Quetta also contributed to this report\n"

Nevertheless, due to US sanctions on Iran, Pakistan has hesitated to advance the project. This year, Islamabad indicated its readiness to build its portion of the pipeline, primarily to avoid international arbitration by Tehran, which could impose a penalty of $18bn on Pakistan for failing to fulfil the agreement. Despite this development, it remains uncertain if Islamabad will start purchasing gas from Iran as long as US sanctions remain in effect.\nMs Baloch said Pakistan was engaged with US and had discussed the various aspects of Pakistan\u2019s energy needs. She emphasised that Pakistan\u2019s relations with Iran were not at the cost of ties with Washington. \u201cI should underline that Pakistan does not believe in zero-sum relationships. Expan\u00adsion of our relations with one country should not be considered as coming at the expense of our relationship with another. Pakistan is confident that its relationship with its friends and partners, including the United Sta\u00adtes, are robust enough to move forward on their own merit, and notwithstanding any other relationships that Pakistan has with other countries in our national interest,\u201d she said.\nPakistan\u2019s position on the gas project will be shaped by its national interests, focusing on energy needs, and influenced by the global context, including any UN sanctions and trade considerations with other countries, especially within the energy sector, she explained.\nProvocation rejected\n\u201cWe are witnessing an alarming surge in provocative statements from Indian leaders asserting unwarranted claims on AJK. Pakistan rejects these claims. \n\u201cFuelled by hyper-nationalism, this inflammatory rhetoric poses a grave threat to regional peace and susceptibility,\u201d she added, urging \u201cIndian politicians to cease their reckless practice of dragging Pakistan into India\u2019s populist public discourse for electoral motives\u201d.\n\u201cHistorical and legal facts as well as ground realities refute India\u2019s baseless claims over AJK. Despite India\u2019s rhetoric and assertions, Jammu and Kashmir remains an internationally recognised disputed territory,\u201d the spokesperson asserted, according to a Dawn.com report.\nShe noted that the UN Security Council resolutions on the region \u201cclearly outline that the final status of Jammu and Kashmir shall be determined by the will of the people through a free and impartial plebiscite under the UN auspices\u201d.\n\u201cIndia would be wise to help implement these resolutions instead of harbouring delusions of grandeur,\u201d the FO spokesperson stressed.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court has clubbed a set of ten petitions and applications seeking the court\u2019s intervention in response to allegations of \u201cintelligence agencies\u2019 meddling in judicial affairs\u201d, which were highlighted following a March 25 letter by six Islamabad High Court (IHC) judges.\nHeaded by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa, the bench includes Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Justice Athar Minallah, Justice Musarrat Hilali, and Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan. They will resume the case on April 30, initiated on a suo motu. Justice Yahya Afridi has already recused himself from the bench and will no longer participate.\nOne of the applications concerns impleadment as a party in the hearing, moved by six members of the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC), seeking an inquiry commission to probe the allegations levelled in the high court judge\u2019s letter.\nConstitutional petitions by the Lahore High Court Bar Association also requested the appointment of a judicial inquiry by the Supreme Court judges. Barrister Aitzaz Ahsan also sought a judicial inquiry by the Supreme Court judges, while the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) demanded a probe into the allegations. Similarly, the Balochistan High Court Bar Association and Advocate Shahbaz Ali Khan Khosa also requested an inquiry.\n\nIHC submits proposals before apex court to end interference in judicial affairs; judges unanimous in decision to give an \u2018institutional response\u2019\n\nIn one of the petitions Barrister Aitzaz Ahsan through his counsel Khwaja Ahmad Hosain had requested the Supreme Court to declare that the allegations by IHC judges, as well as those by Justice (retd) Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui, constitute evidence that the premier intelligence agency namely the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), and its operatives were involved in unlawful attempts to influence judicial decisions of IHC and the district judiciary in the federal capital, a development which requires judicial probe.\nThe Supreme Court initiated suo motu proceedings after former chief justice Tassaduq Hussain Jillani had recused himself from becoming part of the one-man commission established to probe the allegations of the executive\u2019s interference in judicial affairs.\nThe decision to proceed under Article 184(3) came a day after a group of lawyers and civil society members wrote a letter addressed to the Supreme Court, in which they said the commission was powerless to probe the claims made by the six judges of the IHC detailing harassment at the hands of intelligence officials.\nThe petition, moved by Aitzaz Ahsan, pleaded that the Supreme Court should declare any interference in judicial affairs as clearly unlawful and unconstitutional, posing a serious threat to the rule of law and the independence of judiciary.\nThe petition further urged the Supreme Court to instruct the federal government to terminate the service of all such individuals found involved in such unlawful acts, as determined by the judicial commission, without granting them retirement or other benefits from the national exchequer.\nAnd in case of individuals who have already retired to direct that no retirement or other benefits will be paid to them, the petition contended, adding that the government servants including any serving army officer or ISI operatives, who seek to influence the judicial proceedings or judges will be liable to be terminated forthwith from service without any retirement or other benefits being payable to such individual from the national exchequer.\nLikewise, the PBC, through a resolution, had asked for a judicial commission manned by sitting judges of the Supreme Court to address the complaints of meddling by intelligence agencies in judicial affairs.\nIn the resolution, the PBC requested the Supreme Court to decide the present suo motu case as expeditiously as possible.\nThe resolution emphasised that judges hold the highest esteem in our nation, carrying significant responsibility for adjudicating cases and meticulously deliberating allegations before reaching verdicts.\nSimilarly, the IHCBA also sought a probe to hold accountable those responsible for undermining the independence of the judiciary.\nIHC submits proposals\nIn a relevant development, the IHC administration has submitted proposals to end meddling in judicial affairs before the Supreme Court.\nThe IHC registrar filed the report before the apex court\u2019s registrar\u2019s office.\nThe report will be submitted before the apex court bench hearing the suo motu case.\nIn its April 3 order, the Supreme Court called for proposals from the main stakeholders in the judicial system and the independence of the judiciary, namely the PBC, SCBA, high courts, and the federal government.\n\u201cThey should suggest what should be the institutional response and mechanism to address the issues like the ones raised in the letter [of IHC judges] and ensure that such issues do not arise in future and, if they do, to fix liability and proceed against those responsible,\u201d the order said.\nIn compliance with the Supreme Court\u2019s direction, the provincial high courts as well as the IHC submitted proposals before the apex court.\nThe IHC\u2019s proposal was based on the minutes of the full court meeting held on April 23.\nIn the meeting, the judges unanimously decided to introduce several measures, including the reactivation of \u2018empowered\u2019 inspection teams to put an end to the alleged meddling of intelligence officials in judicial affairs.\nSources privy to the meeting told Dawn all the high court judges were unanimous that they would not tolerate interference by any intelligence agency in the proceedings of the high court, district courts, and the special courts.\nThe IHC proposal explained in details how the inspection team would respond to the complaint received from the judges of subordinate judiciary, said the sources.\nThe judges also decided to give institutional responses against any attempts to interfere in judicial affairs, and the high court, as an institution, would take up the matter with the top authority of the department involved in meddling.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: Before it was forced to close over its \u201cintolerable\u201d treatment of animals, the Islamabad Zoo was home to neglected elephants and underfed lions pacing back and forth behind the bars of their enclosures.\nNow, four years later, it is a rehabilitation centre for wildlife, providing a refuge for motherless leopard cubs, tigers seized from owners who kept them as status symbols and bears forced to dance or fight for the amusement of crowds.\n\u201cThe whole energy of the place has changed ever since the zoo was emptied... The care shows; look around,\u201d Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB) Head Rina Saeed told AFP.\nThe zoo gained international notoriety in 2016 when the singer Cher launched a campaign to remove its shackled Asian elephant, Kaavan, the last in the country and dubbed the world\u2019s loneliest elephant.\nBut Kaavan\u2019s treatment wasn\u2019t an isolated incident; two lions died at the facility when zookeepers attempted to force them from their pen by setting fire to piles of hay, and over the years, hundreds of animals listed on the zoo\u2019s inventory simply vanished.\nPakistan\u2019s climate change ministry said it was \u201cseriously concerned\u201d about the \u201cintolerable and inhumane\u201d treatment of animals at the zoo in 2020, the same year the courts ordered it shut down and Kaavan was moved to Cambodia.\nWithin months of its closure, a small rescue centre began to take root at the facility, and now evidence of its past as a tourist attraction is fading, as silence hangs over the empty, overgrown parking lot and the shabby ticket stand sits idle next to a swing set.\n\u201cNow it is a proper rehabilitation centre with over 50 animals,\u201d Saeed said, adding that the team had rescued more than 380 animals.\nAmir Khalil, a veterinarian who directs the global animal welfare organisation Four Paws, which oversaw Kaavan\u2019s relocation, recently made an emotional return to the zoo, saying it \u201cnow holds hope.\u201d\nVets from the Austria-based NGO had come to the centre to see three black bears whose claws had been removed by their previous owners, treating them in the shadow of an abandoned Ferris wheel in the zoo\u2019s former cafe, now a makeshift clinic.\n\u201cThis place is unrecognisable,\u201d Khalil told AFP while inspecting one of the animals, an overweight former dancing bear called Anila, who was also suffering from a nose infection from a ring pierced through her snout to help keep her under control.\nLast year, the IWMB seized a tiger cub with broken bones from a vet clinic in an upscale neighborhood in the capital, later relocating the animal to South Africa.\n\u201cWe think animals are toys,\u201d IWMB Research and Planning Deputy Director Ali Sakhawat said.\n\u201cNo matter how many zoos we make for kids, this won\u2019t teach them that animals are to be taken care of,\u201d said IWMB\u2019s Sakhawat, adding, \u201cWild animals are to be kept in the wild, not cages.\u201d \nThe animals brought to the centre are not only physically injured but also mentally traumatised.\n\u201cWe keep them occupied to help them erase the memories of the trauma inflicted by poachers,\u201d Aneis Hussan, a wildlife ranger, told AFP as he played with Daboo, one of the rescued black bears.\n\u201cThe bears you\u2019ve observed here exhibit signs of joy, roaming freely and climbing trees - a stark contrast to the captivity that deprived them of happiness,\u201d Hussan added.\nA new Islamabad Nature and Wildlife Management Act would strengthen animal protections, but Saeed says it still \u201cneeds the president\u2019s signature.\u201d The last presidential order on animal welfare, restricting bear baiting, was passed over 20 years ago by President Pervez Musharraf.\n\u201cNo one in the government listens; I have gotten old trying to make them understand how important this is,\u201d Safwan Ahmad, vice chairman of the non-profit Pakistan Wildlife Foundation, told AFP.\nIWMB wants to establish a permanent sanctuary at the site of the rehabilitation centre, but the local authority that owns the land intends to reopen the facility as a public zoo.\n\u201cThere is one zoo in almost every city worldwide,\u201d said Irfan Khan Niazi of the environmental department of the Capital Development Authority (CDA), adding, \u201cJust because rules were not followed once does not mean it would happen again.\u201d \n"

As a result, their properties were being sealed, they added.\nRaja Habib said there were over 40 cantonments in the country but properties were being sealed only in Wah. He alleged that the civic body was utilising colonial law to create unrest among the traders who were the backbone of the economy. He said shops of traders who were paying taxes were being sealed.\nSpeaking in the occasion, a trader, Naeem Ashraf, said: \u201cThese are not 118 commercial units but 118 families from whom the civic body officials were snatching bread and butter.\u201d\nHe said they were being treated as criminals by the civic body officials.\nHe went on to say that the bureaucracy was creating unnecessary obstacles in the conversion of domestic property into commercial as files were relevant files were lying with the civic body from the last many years.\nIn response to the traders\u2019 allegation, Additional Cantonment Executive Officer (ACEO) Ghulam Sabir Basra termed the traders\u2019 union an illegitimate body.\nFlanked by cantonment board secretary Kamran Sahi, Mr Basra told mediapersons that the so-called representatives of the traders\u2019 community were not registered with the relevant labour and traders\u2019 bodies concerned.\nMr Sabir said 423 residential premises were identified which were illegally being used for commercial purposes and were evading taxes.\nHe further said 118 units had been sealed while action was being taken against the rest of the properties.\nHe informed the media that residential properties were being used as schools, colleges, academies and shops.\nMarkets, hospitals and beauty parlours had also been established, Mr Sabir said, adding that the traders\u2019 unions were encouraging people to break the law instead of fulfilling their responsibilities.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: Owing to the negligence of Capital Development Authority (CDA), Islamabad is still without a landfill site and after several makeshift arrangements the civic agency has been temporarily disposing of waste in Losar area of Rawalpindi for around two years and the contract has been extended for six more months.\nAfter every six months, the CDA extends its contract with Rawalpindi Waste Management Company (RWMC). A couple of days ago, the civic agency extended the contract from April 4 to October 3, 2024. Under this agreement, CDA pays to the company Rs1,350 per tonne as the tipping fee.\nThe CDA collects garbage and trash from the city and before transporting to Losar dumps it at I-11. However, the civic agency is now in the process of setting up a proper transfer station at I-9 inside the compound of the sewage treatment plant. Once started, the work will be completed in six months.\nMeanwhile, almost every year the CDA floated the idea of setting up a proper \u201cscientific landfill\u201d site only to change the stance later. At present, the civic agency is planning to set up a site in Losar after acquiring land through the Rawalpindi administration.\n\nUnable to set up landfill site in Islamabad, civic agency has been relying on temporary arrangements\n\n\u201cWe are going to procure land in Losar to have a proper landfill site. Our talks are underway with Rawalpindi authorities,\u201d said director sanitation Mashooq Ali Shaikh. He said the CDA board had approved six-month extension in the agreement with RWMC.\nEarlier last year, the CDA had proposed two sites at Kuri and Dhoke Jando near Nicholson\u2019s Monument. In 2018, it had also proposed a landfill site in ditches created in hills by stone crushers at Sangjani, but the environment body rejected the site.\nThe unavailability of a landfill site in capital was also petitioned in Islamabad High Court (IHC) and last year the court had directed the CDA to resolve the issue.\nSenior lawyer Raja Inam Ameen Minhas, who filed the case in the IHC, told Dawn on Thursday that it was unfortunate that the capital city had no scientific landfill site. \u201cUnavailability of a landfill site in city of around three million people is great injustice.\u201d He said the handling of garbage and trash by the CDA was highly questionable. \n\u201cWe pleaded this case in court where not only CDA but representative of the federal government also assured the court that a proper landfill site will be developed, but nothing happened,\u201d he said, adding garbage was destroying city\u2019s environment while it is also hazardous for health of citizens. \n\u201cIn this city, five-star hotels and high-rises buildings can be built but I don\u2019t know why CDA is not paying heed to this issue of public importance,\u201d he said. Moreover, in rural areas of Islamabad, people were throwing garbage at vacant places and nullahs. \n\u201cThis was not a big issue when the population of Islamabad was small, but it has become a serious issue with urbanisation and growth of the capital city. Poor handling of waste is a source of contamination of water, soil and environment and spread of various diseases,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe CDA was established in 1960, but still today it has failed to have a scientific landfill site like other cities,\u201d the lawyer said.\nAn official of CDA said every year the civic agency spent over two billion rupees on waste issue and if a proper landfill site is developed, it could earn by using the waste for an energy project. He said that before disposing of solid waste at Losar, the civic agency used to dump garbage in the residential sector of I-12. However, the court in 2022 directed the civic agency to shift it outside the residential area. The court had also directed the CDA to ensure that \u201cno waste is dumped in temporary sites in residential areas with effect from 04-10-2022.\u201d Then the CDA moved towards Losar on a temporary basis.\nIn the past, on the recommendations of an international consultant, the CDA had selected a site at Kuri. An access road was also constructed to the site but all of a sudden, in 2011, the CDA and the environment body decided to shelve the project. Some officials at that time had alleged that the CDA dropped the idea of setting up a landfill site in Kuri to appease owners of housing schemes. Since then, the civic agency has been shifting the temporary landfill site from one place to another.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: Recognising the severity of migrant smuggling, a regional conference on Friday invited international cooperation essential to combating this serious crime effectively.\nTo address the pressing issue of migrant smuggling, the Federal Investigation Agency and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs jointly organised a two-day regional conference in collaboration with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the European Union (EU) at the Marriott Hotel Islamabad.\nMigrant smuggling has emerged as a lucrative criminal enterprise with minimal risks for perpetrators. Exploiting the desperation of individuals seeking better opportunities, smugglers operate within well-organised, transnational networks.\nSpeaking on the significance of the workshop, Foreign Secretary Syrus Sajjad Qazi emphasised the importance of leveraging regional and international partnerships to tackle the complexities associated with irregular migration. Syrus Qazi stressed the need for a comprehensive approach that ensured safe, orderly, and regular migration while mitigating the adverse effects of irregular migration.\nJeremy Milsom, the UNODC Representative in Pakistan, underscored the urgency of collaborative efforts following tragic incidents such as the capsizing of a trawler off southern Greece in June 2023. The accident claimed the lives of 350 Pakistani nationals. Highlighting the gravity of the situation, Jeremy Milsom reiterated the call for enhanced cooperation among nations to address the challenges posed by migrant smuggling.\nThe conference, held under the PROTECT: Improving Migration Management and Migrant Protection in Selected Silk Route Countries project, funded by the European Union, aimed to facilitate information-sharing among participating countries and promote victim-centred approaches to combat migrant smuggling.\nPhilipp Gross, Deputy Head of the EU Delegation to Pakistan, emphasised the pivotal role of regional cooperation in addressing the multifaceted challenges posed by human trafficking and migrant smuggling. Gross highlighted the critical routes originating in Pakistan, traversing through Iran and Turkey, and ultimately reaching the European Union, underscoring the necessity of formal and informal cooperation mechanisms to disrupt criminal networks and safeguard vulnerable migrants.\nThe European Union\u2019s launch of the Global Alliance to Counter Migrant Smuggling in November 2023 reflected its commitment to strengthening international cooperation to prevent and respond to migrant smuggling. The organisers maintained that the regional conference served as a testament to the collaborative efforts of key countries along critical migration routes, aimed at countering this crime while addressing root causes such as poverty and conflict.\nParticipants engaged in discussions regarding common challenges, best practices in border security, and investigations and explored the feasibility of establishing a regional task force to address migrant smuggling.\nIn conclusion, Jeremy Milsom stressed the importance of proactive measures in combating migrant smuggling, highlighting the support provided by the European Union in achieving significant milestones in this endeavor. The conference, he emphasised, presented a unique opportunity to forge stronger partnerships and drive meaningful progress in the fight against migrant smuggling.\n"

            "Text": " \n\n\nLate in December 2023, the United States Treasury warned that it would apply sanctions on foreign banks for evading the Russian price cap and called on them to boost compliance.\nPlaying it safe, banks in China, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) that work with Russia increased checks. They have now begun asking for extra documentation and have trained more staff to make sure deals were compliant with the price caps, Reuters reported, quoting eight sources familiar with the matter. Russian oil firms are consequently facing delays of up to several months or even rejection of money transfers into their accounts in Moscow.\nCautious of US secondary sanctions, these banks are now asking clients to provide written guarantees that no person or entity from the US Special Designated Nationals (SDN) list is a payment beneficiary or involved in a deal.\nRecent Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian oil hubs and refineries have also increased pressure on the Russian oil industry. Rosstat, Russia\u2019s Federal State Statistics Service, said that in the week ending on March 24, the nation\u2019s production of motor petrol fell by approximately 7.4 per cent to 754,600 tonnes compared to the week prior, when production was at 815,300 tonnes, as reported by Newsweek.\n\nPakistan is holding off on benefitting from Russian oil price caps, unlike other Asian countries, due to supposed pressure from the US\n\nTo manage any surge in domestic fuel prices, Russia banned gasoline exports for six months on March 1, meaning lost revenues for the Kremlin. Moreover, the tightening sanctions on Russia\u2019s oil exports are raising freight costs for moving Russian crude, Tsvetana Paraskova reported on Oilprice.com.\nRecent estimates by Argus Media say that since the US warned of using secondary sanctions against vessels striving to bypass American sanctions regime in December, shipping Russian crude from a port in the Baltic Sea to China costs around $14.5 per barrel. Reports say that more than half of this per-barrel cost is attributable to the sanctions.\n \n \n\nWith the increase in pressure, Russian exports to India are also under the cloud. India\u2019s imports of Russian crude oil fell to a one-year low in January \u2014 down 35pc from last year\u2019s peak \u2014 as New Delhi appeared to diversify its crude sources.\nAfter the announcement by the US Treasury and State to blacklist Russian state tank operator Sovcomflot, all Indian refiners are reportedly refusing to take Russian crude transported on vessels of Sovcomflot and avoid running afoul of the stricter enforcement of the US sanctions on Russia, Oilprice.com added. Russian crude exports on Sovcomflot\u2019s fleet to India have dropped by 0.3m barrels per day (bpd) from the 2023 average, the report added.\nIndian refiners are now carefully checking the ownership chain of every tanker carrying Russian crude to ensure the vessels are not affiliated with Sovcomflot, or other entities on the US sanctions list, unnamed sources with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg mid-March.\nMost cargoes, previously bound for India, are now either discharging or heading to private refiners in China, the world\u2019s top crude importer.\nYet, the overall scenario is not bleak for Moscow. It has leverage, too. Despite all the above, Asian imports of Russian crude oil hit a 10-month high in March, Reuters said, quoting a London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) Oil Research report.\nHigher arrivals of Russian crude in March to the top-importing markets in Asia are set to boost Asian crude imports to 27.5m barrels per day (bpd) \u2014 the highest level in 10 months. The estimated import volumes in March are higher than Asia\u2019s 26.7m bpd imports in February and the 27.2m bpd arrivals in January this year, the LSEG report said.\nChina remains the top buyer, with its crude imports from Russia approaching 11.8m bpd in March, up from 11.2m bpd in February and 10.4m bpd in January, the data added.\nThe sanctions could spike oil market prices. While Moscow would benefit from higher market prices, the Biden Administration may not find them palatable \u2014 especially in an election year.\nWhile Washington wants the sanction regime to work, it is also striving to dissuade Kyiv from targeting Russian oil installations behind the scenes, as it may result in a price spike. Russia knows this well and has begun flexing its oil market muscle accordingly.\nRussia has asked its oil companies to reduce output and ensure compliance with its reduced Organisation of Oil Producing Countries (Opec) output quota.\nMoscow\u2019s decision to cut oil production is likely to push the price of oil to $100 a barrel later this year, warned J.P. Morgan Global Commodities Research in a recent note, unless countermeasures are taken by the US or other suppliers \u2014 not an easy task. Given the shaky market balance, it seems the US is keeping the dark, \u2018shadow fleet\u2019 of Russian tankers taking its crude to customers on a rather loose leash.\n \n \n\nThis presents Pakistan with an interesting opportunity. Regretfully, under pressure from important quarters, Islamabad does not seem to be paying much attention to emerging opportunities. When the then prime minister Imran Khan visited Moscow in 2022, just when the Russian \u2018war on Ukraine\u2019 began, there were discussions about Pakistan importing crude from Russia at a discounted price.\nImmediately after, the PTI government was toppled, and it seemed that the opportunity to import crude at a discounted price from Russia was gone. However, after a lull, the new Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) government under Shahbaz Sharif also moved ahead with the project.\nFormer minister of state for petroleum, Dr Musadik Malik, was vocal about the possibility at the time.\nA few containers of Russian crude were even imported, with some saying it was the advent of a new era.\nSince then, the project seems to have fizzled out. Why? Not much is known. Some feel the power brokers in Rawalpindi do not want to annoy Washington, hence the lull. Similarly, there has been no progress on the Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline \u2014 again due to US pressure, some assert. Both these projects could have helped Pakistan overcome its energy scarcity problem at an affordable cost.\nThe US pressure, though, is not understandable. On one end, Washington wants Islamabad \u2014 Rawalpindi, to be exact \u2014 not to improve its relations with countries like Russia or Iran to at least ease its energy conundrum. On the other, it is allowing India to continue nurturing \u2018crude\u2019 relations with Russia.\n \n \n\nThe contrast is visible. US Treasury Assistant Secretary for Economic Policy Eric Van Nostrand said early this month that the United States neither expects India to reduce its oil imports from Russia nor has requested New Delhi to do so.\nThe Indian Express reported that Mr Nostrand said at an event organised by the Ananta Centre in New Delhi, \u201cThe price cap\u2019s goals are to limit Putin\u2019s revenue and maintain global oil supply, essentially by creating a mechanism for India and other global consumers of oil, to access Russian oil at discounted prices.\u201d He added that emerging markets like India benefited from the price cap as Russia was forced to deepen discounts on its oil.\nTightening screws on Moscow provided Pakistan with an opportunity. Why shouldn\u2019t we avail it? That is a big if, and someone in the corridors of power needs to have a straight, heart-to-heart talk on the issue \u2014 if one can.\n"

            "Text": "For the better part of the last 15 years, Pakistan has faced serious economic troubles. Even during the supposedly good times, the alarm bells were quite clear.\nLately, we have truly learned the meaning of rock bottom through a series of \u2018firsts\u2019. Be it the highest inflation in our history, interest payments exceeding federal revenues or another indicator of your choice.\nBriefly, the startup ecosystem appeared to be immune from the entire mess \u2014 at least to the flag bearers \u2014 as capital was pouring in regardless. Once that stopped, everyone became an expert on monetary economics and asset allocation.\nNevertheless, rounds were still being announced, albeit far less frequently. However, we have found a new rock bottom: in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, Pakistani startups raised a grand sum of zero dollars. It goes without saying that this was the lowest total in over five years, at minimum, possibly even 10.\nOf course, announcements don\u2019t necessarily mean no dollars came in, but based on anecdotal evidence from within the small ecosystem, the lack of funding avenues is becoming a little too clear. Its effects are already showing in the uptake of startup shutdowns. While we are hitting rock bottom, there are early signs of the global venture market recovering.\n\nVenture capital funding recovers by 14.2pc compared to Q4FY23 while the actual number of deals drops by 36.9pc\n\nAccording to the latest data from Pitchbook, global venture capital (VC) funding reached $95.7 billion across 7,520 deals in Q1FY24. While the amount is flat compared to the same period of 2023, it\u2019s an improvement compared to the seven straight quarters of sequential decline.\nThere was a recovery of 14.2 per cent compared to Q4FY23. Volumes-wise, there was less to cheer for as total deals plunged 36.9pc to 7,520 \u2014 the lowest figure since Q3FY16. Even if you add the estimated undisclosed transactions, which take the number to 10,222, it\u2019d still be the worst since Q3FY20.\nWhile the headline figures may be comforting, a deeper look suggests there is still a way to go before recovery as the biggest drivers of deal value continue to struggle. In VC, North America and Asia account for the largest share of investments \u2014 more than three-fourths historically. Therefore, in order to truly bounce back, these two need to be standing on their feet.\nSo far, this hasn\u2019t happened. North America has only once managed to avert a decline in Q4FY23, when the deal value edged up 1.1pc year-on-year but was down again 30pc to $37.3bn. On the other hand, Asia has had nine straight quarters of sequential decline now.\nIn fact, its funding value of $18.5bn was the worst since Q2FY17. While both Latin America and Europe experienced some respite, only the latter\u2019s numbers were meaningful enough to have an impact on the global totals.\nThings were a lot worse by a number of deals, as North America\u2019s 29.5pc decline was the lowest for any region while Latin America plunged 55.4pc sequentially in Q1FY24. Since Q3FY22, there hasn\u2019t been a single quarter in which even one region saw an increase in deal count. More importantly, the reason why venture may still take time to recover lies elsewhere.\nAs an asset class, VC is centred around exit events \u2014 the big bumper initial public offerings and mergers and acquisitions. This is how general partners multiply their stakes, earn actual cash instead of paper markup, and distribute earnings back to investors.\nFor now, such liquidity events are rare \u2014 at least ones that could offer a return on the valuations VC originally came in at. In Q1FY24, the exit value of VC was just $30.7bn globally. This is the lowest figure since Q2FY15 and not even 10pc of the peak of $397.1bn in Q4FY21. Similarly, the number of exits remains muted at 559, having fallen sequentially for nine straight quarters.\nAsia was particularly hit hard, with exit value receding to just $9.9bn, whereas North America bounced back yearly and quarterly, albeit off a terribly low base. Meanwhile, Europe hasn\u2019t crossed double digits in seven quarters in yet another instance of its secular stagnation.\nIn theory, what happens in the world of global VC should have an impact on Pakistan\u2019s own trajectory, considering that it\u2019s the only asset class still somewhat available for entrepreneurial finance. And it may have an impact, at least to the extent that local investors can close their subsequent funds and keep the market steady.\nBut anything beyond that will ultimately be driven by headline numbers and flashy stories \u2014 where we have a lot of damage control to do.\n"

            "Text": "Do you know that Singapore earned $291 billion through services exports in 2022?\nThe United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Turkiye followed with their earnings of $155bn and $90bn, respectively, according to a World Bank report. Pakistan can learn a lot from these three nations and from China and India \u2014 the two Asian giants. Combined, the five countries boast an 18 per cent share in global services exports.\nWe all know that Singapore has one of the best education systems, and Singapore and the UAE are the preferred destinations for top professionals and top companies worldwide. Meanwhile, China, India and Turkiye have made remarkable progress in education and skill enhancement since the beginning of this century.\n \n \n\nIf Pakistan also wants to boost its services exports, it will have to follow the same course \u2014 invest more in education and skill enhancement and become an acceptable destination for foreign investment in the services sector. However, even before that, the menace of extremism and terrorism will have to be eradicated.\nThe present hybrid regime has started working on the second part of the agenda, and understandably so. The framing of the budget for the next fiscal year, starting in July, will show evidence of whether or not it is also seriously working on the first part of the agenda.\n\nFaced with an alarming trade deficit of $1.9bn, the govt aims to increase ICT exports from $2.6bn to $15bn in five years\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be easy to do in the current tough economic environment. Nevertheless, it needs to be done at once. There is no other way.\nMerchandise exports may take time to grow enough in volume to significantly impact the trade deficit because of the ongoing energy price hikes and the resultant increase in the costs of all inputs. This is too difficult to contain in a single year. Faster chances of dramatic growth lie in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector.\nDuring the first eight months of this fiscal year (July 2023-Feb 2024), services exports fetched $5.1bn, and services imports consumed $7bn. The trade deficit, thus, came to $1.9bn.\nSuch a large deficit is unsustainable, particularly at a time when Pakistan is experiencing one of the worst forex crises of its history. In the last full fiscal year, our services exports and imports stood at $7.6bn and $8.6bn, respectively, and the trade deficit was much smaller, $968 million.\nContaining this deficit is doable only via massive growth in the export of services, particularly in the ICT segment and not through containing imports of services since that can hurt not only the economy but also the growth of the services sector and services exports.\n\nThe central bank needs to push financial institutions harder towards venture capital and find innovative ways to support viable technology startups\n\nICT services are the largest segment of our overall services exports. It roughly accounts for 40pc of the total export proceeds of all services. The caretaker government had devised a plan to boost ICT exports from $2.6bn in the last fiscal year to $15bn in five years.\nGenerally known as information technology (IT) and IT-enabled services (ITeS), the growth potential of this segment of services is enormous. We have a youth bulge in our demography \u2014 tens of thousands of young men and women can fluently speak English, and many of them are keenly interested in IT and ITeS and willing to work online during odd hours.\nThe current government should not allow the hard work of the caretaker government to go to waste and must ensure that workable parts of that plan are implemented sooner rather than later.\nHowever, that same plan, or a modified version of it, may only work if all stakeholders are taken on board before and during its implementation and bureaucratic hindrances are not allowed to spoil it.\n \n \n\nTowards the end of March, the civil-military-run Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) finally approved a plan to construct Pakistan\u2019s largest IT park in the G-10 area of Islamabad.\nThis IT hub, planned to be spread over 3.3 acres of land, would work under a public-private partnership and facilitate an estimated 6000 freelancers, according to media reports \u2014 a good idea. But what about the previous grand IT parks that were planned to be set up in Karachi?\nHave they started working? How are they benefiting from our IT exports, and what facilitating role is the federal or provincial government playing in their progress and performance?\nThere were two key elements of the ICT growth strategy of the caretaker government: First, to open more opportunities for girls and women in digital companies and online work platforms, and second, to encourage greater collaboration between large firms and small and medium enterprises.\nIf sincere efforts are made to achieve these two strategic shifts in our IT and ITeS export strategies, the results could be surprisingly grand. However, both the federal and provincial governments need to work in close coordination and ensure the participation of the right stakeholders in the implementation programmes. Can we expect that? It is possible, but given the track record of both our political parties, it seems a bit too difficult.\nShortage of funds has long impeded the growth of technology startups, and they either look for foreign funding or close shop if initial funding dries up while local banks look the other way. This must come to a stop now.\nThe central bank needs to push banks harder towards venture capital and find some innovative ways to finance viable technology startups. Similarly, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and the Pakistan Software Houses Association should sit together to find out how best to tax IT and ITeS companies. Indeed, some potentially good small companies leave the business early allegedly due to harassment by FBR staff.\n"

            "Text": "The Kalri Baghar (KB) Feeder Upper lining project \u2014 an important component of the Karachi Greater Bulk Water Supply Scheme (K-IV) project \u2014 is yet to start its development after being approved in July 2023 by the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec).\nThe K-IV project itself is facing delays and is now slated for completion in 2025, contrary to the previous deadline of October of this year. Likewise, for the time being, the KB Feeder lining project appears to be in limbo, and the cost escalation of the project cannot be ruled out.\n \n \n\nA perennial canal, the KB Feeder, supplies water to Keenjhar Lake after taking off from the right of Kotri Barrage. The lake is a vital drinking water source for the provincial capital. The lining of the 38km long canal is to be done at a cost of close to Rs40 billion on a fifty-fifty cost-sharing basis by the federal and Sindh governments. Meanwhile, the K-IV is being executed by the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) at a cost of Rs126bn.\nAdministrative approval for the lining project was issued in September 2023 by the federal government, requiring the Sindh irrigation department to submit a work plan \u201cto complete the project in sync with completion of the K-IV\u201d.\n\nThe K-IV project gets pushed back another year as the Sindh government struggles to appoint a project director to meet Ecnec conditions, among other issues\n\nThe Sindh Irrigation Department has submitted its work plan. Funds shall be released by the federal water resources ministry accordingly. In case of delayed implementation of the canal\u2019s lining, the Sindh government shall ensure the provision of water for the K-IV for the interim period.\nThe most important aspect of administrative approval is that the federal government mentioned that \u201cany increase in cost [in the KB Feeder lining project] will be borne by the Sindh government\u201d, which refers to the cost escalation as the federal government would be under no obligation to share it. Since July 2023, the Sindh government has been unable to finalise the tendering process for the project director (PD) appointment, which has been an issue for quite some time.\nIn the caretaker Sindh government, the post of PD was held by the then Chief Engineer (CE) of Kotri Barrage, Haji Khan Jamali. He had been issued an embarrassing show-cause notice on the day of his retirement relating to the project\u2019s tendering process by the then irrigation secretary, Dr Niaz Abbasi.\nDr Abbasi had cancelled national competitive bidding by the irrigation department, as he believed the process was marred by anomalies, and called for holding international competitive bidding (ICB) instead.\nMukhtiar Abro replaced Mr Jamali as acting director until a full-fledged PD was appointed through a competitive process. A steering committee, headed by the chairman of the Planning & Development Board of Sindh, was formed to hire the PD, while the ICB was scheduled for March 20.\n\nAbout Rs6n and Rs3bn, respectively, have been released by the federal and Sindh governments for the lining project, which may be completed for Rs40bn by 2027\n\nThe ICB was adjourned twice, first on April 5 and now on April 19. In the meantime, Mr Abro was replaced by CE Kotri Barrage, Mir Ghulam Ali Talpur, as PD on March 29 despite Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah\u2019s already placed summary on March 14 recommending the appointment of Zahid Junejo (a former Sindh member of Indus River System Authority) as PD of the lining project.\n \n \n\nOther competitors besides Mr Junejo were Yasin Qureshi, Mr Jamali, and senior CE Shafqat Wadhu. Mr Jamali has since moved the issue to the Sindh High Court, pleading that Zahid Junejo has attained the age of superannuation \u2014 thus, he (Jamali) now qualifies to become PD. The matter is pending adjudication.\nSindh Chief Miniter Murad Shah reviewed progress on the K-IV and the lining project on April 6. He pressed for timely completion of the K-IV, saying he would request the federal government to release Rs30bn to Rs40bn allocated for the K-IV under the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP).\nSecretary Irrigation Zarif Khero informed the chief minister that Rs6n and Rs3bn, respectively, have been released by the federal and Sindh governments for the lining project, which will be completed for Rs40bn by 2027.\nOfficial sources stated that the chief minister believed that a separate PD should not be hired for the project as this would save several millions of rupees of government. CM Shah said that CE Kotri Barrage may be notified as PD under the post because he has to ensure the water supply to the downstream population depends on the KB feeder during the execution of the lining.\nMoreover, the chief minister wants the completion of the lining project in two years instead of three years.\nOne officer says CM Shah intends to discuss the matter with irrigation minister Jam Khan Shoro. If the two agree, the Planning Commission would be requested to allow the Sindh government to drop the idea of hiring a director from the market.\n\u201cIf PD is not hired from the market, then it will help us [Sindh government] save around Rs600m considering the fact when a PD is hired several officers are to be engaged besides provision of required paraphernalia,\u201d says another officer. However, he says that there is a condition of Ecnec that a PD needs to be hired from the market if a project\u2019s cost exceeds Rs600m. Let\u2019s see what happens,\u201c he adds.\nWith a burgeoning population, Karachi\u2019s water needs are increasing rapidly. Karachi also regularly gets an influx of people from other parts of the country. According to irrigation officers, the lining of KB Feeder Upper is supposed to conserve 500 cusecs of water, which would be utilised for the K-IV in phase-I through the same canal. In phase II, the K-IV is supposed to get another 700 cusecs of water.\nThis volume of water is to be made available by conserving water by lining two other off-taking canals of Kotri barrage, namely Phulelli and Pinyari [both left bank canals].\nThe provision of 2,400 cusecs of water was agreed upon by the federal government at the time of the Water Apportionment Accord 1991, the document that forms the basis for interprovincial water distribution. Sindh is providing 1,200 cusecs of water to Karachi through KB Feeder \u2014 680 cusecs over and above 520 cusecs as the provincial share of Sindh for the metropolitan city under the 1991 accord.\nKarachi needs 2,400 cusecs of water. Sindh has been relentlessly arguing with the federal government that such a quantum of water should be made available for the metropolis out of the \u2018national pool\u2019. This matter remains pending in the Council of Common Interests.\n"

            "Text": "Unwilling to forego the joy of Eid despite the tough economic situation, Pakistanis flocked to the markets to maximise their budgets closer to Eid.\nThis surge in shopping activity in the last week of Ramazan contrasted sharply with the slower pace observed in regular markets and malls in the first three weeks of the holy month.\nKeeping challenges emanating from the lagging economy in sight, some companies innovated by making necessary adjustments, streamlining their online operations and strategically timing their discounts and sales offers based on thorough market analytics. This approach resulted in significant returns for some. Yet, trend watchers suggest that losers likely outnumbered gainers in the formal sector.\n\u201cGood performance was not consistent across all brands. Forward-thinking enterprises, mindful of their customer base\u2019s affordability and reduced profit margins, set realistic goals and executed their carefully crafted market strategies.\n \n \n\n\u201cWhile companies in the retail sector are often reluctant to share real-time sales data and inventory information, my observation is that even in cases where sales volumes fell below expectations, revenue targets were met due to higher price points,\u201d shared an executive from a major apparel company in a private conversation.\n\nRetailers make up for low profits in the first three weeks of Ramazan as shopper footfall picks up in the last week just before Eid\n\nBackground research conducted through interviews with leaders of market associations and marketing experts revealed that the success rate among medium and micro enterprises dealing in apparel and other Eid-related items was notably higher than that of larger brands in the formal sector.\n\u201cIt is essentially a matter of affordability rather than choice. In some cases where a branded item is accessible, customers may perceive it as overpriced and might not be willing to pay the premium.\n\u201cWhile everyone appreciates quality, most people prefer to stay within their budget and are hesitant to feel cheated by paying more than what they deem a fair price,\u201d noted a market observer.\nFamilies have primarily focused on purchasing personal items and grooming products and services, while home improvements and the acquisition of consumer durables, including big-ticket electronics, have generally been very limited this year.\n \n \n\nLocal producers gained significant ground, a trend that emerged since the shock of the 2020 pandemic, even in segments previously dominated by imports, such as children\u2019s wear.\nCommenting on the depressed share of imported items in Pakistani markets, Badaruddin Kakar, a business leader from Balochistan, argued that heightened vigilance by customs and other border control authorities to curb the influx of goods from China, Iran and India has limited their availability and increased their cost, often beyond the reach of the average household. This has created more space for local suppliers and has been advantageous for their producers.\nEid discount bazaars outperformed typical regular markets in major cities across Pakistan. However, in second-tier cities like Multan, Faisalabad, Gujrat, Hyderabad, Sukkur, Khairpur, and others, regular markets fared just as well, if not better than temporary Eid sales stalls.\nIn contrast to major cities, second-tier towns in the country witnessed higher consumer participation in the Eid market. \u201cCompared to their counterparts, town dwellers exhibited more enthusiasm, according to early indicators,\u201d an analyst shared.\n\u201cThe cost of living for households in these towns is relatively lower than those in cities like Karachi and Lahore, where nuclear families are prevalent. In town settings, people often opt for joint family arrangements to save on utility and other living costs, allowing them to allocate more funds for special occasions like Eid,\u201d explained a marketing research professional.\nThe footwear sector, though a fraction of the apparel sector in size, with multiple new brands and unbranded companies launched over the last year, did exceptionally well this year.\n\u201cThere was something more at work here than a superior marketing strategy. Probably people deferred buying shoes till Eid instead of buying new shoes for children at the start of the academic session,\u201d an analyst invented reasoning.\n\u201cMost brand representatives I interacted with during my visits to malls, markets and dedicated brand stores in Lahore were content. They appeared to be fairly relieved a day before Eid. After a dull start and lean business in the first three weeks, they pinned their hopes on the last week, and shopaholic Pakistanis didn\u2019t disappoint them. The footfall increased to a level typical for the Eid season in Pakistan,\u201d another retail expert informed.\n\u201cGenerally speaking, home-based dress and accessory makers, small footwear manufacturers, certain brands in the sector, street beauty parlours and hairdressers, among others, topped the list of gainers.\n\u201cMeanwhile, tailoring, large apparel stores, consumer durable companies and furniture makers suffered losses, alongside numerous others in the 2024 Eid market,\u201d he added.\n"

            "Text": " \n\n\nAs per the International Labour Organisation (ILO) definition, labour production represents the total volume of output produced per unit of labour during a given time. Economists refer to labour productivity as the amount of output per worker. It is calculated by dividing GDP by the total number of working labourers.\nLabour productivity is one of the most important indicators of economic growth and is linked with living standards. It determines economic growth and affects everyone in the economy. Higher labour productivity reflects high business profits, wages for workers, and more government revenue.\nUnfortunately, Pakistan has been running low on productivity for the last two decades \u2014 though it was once ahead of peer countries like India, Bangladesh, and China for at least one decade. According to the ILO, Pakistan had an average labour productivity rate of 1.5 per cent from 2000 to 2020 annually, compared to India\u2019s 5.7pc, Bangladesh\u2019s 3.9pc, and China\u2019s 8.5 pc in the same period.\nIt\u2019s a sad state of affairs that one of the founding members of the Asian Productivity Organisation (APO) was surpassed by India and Bangladesh in the years 2008 and 2012 respectively.\n\nPakistan\u2019s low average growth rate of 1.5pc from 2010 to 2020 reflects the country\u2019s increasing economic unproductivity due to political instability, insignificant exports, and lack of R&D\n\nLabour productivity is either a one-factor or partial-factor measure of productivity and doesn\u2019t reflect overall production efficiency. For example, low labour productivity could reflect labour production efficiency but not the production method depending either on usage and cost of human labour or technology \u2014 as only labour productivity can make it difficult to determine which is the case.\nTherefore, economists often analyse Total Factor Productivity (TFP) \u2014 the GDP per unit of combined input \u2014 to determine the overall production efficiency of a country. It reflects how efficiently an economy capitalises its production factors to produce output. It is a key determinant for long-run output growth.\nA research report published in January 2023 by the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics, \u2019Sectoral Total Factor Productivity in Pakistan,\u2019 reflects that TFP is crucial for sustainable economic growth.\nCountries with high TFP growth experience faster and more long-term economic growth compared to countries with low TFP growth. Evidence shows that economies with TFP growth above 3pc achieve GDP growth rates of 8pc and above, while those with below 3pc TFP growth have GDP growth between 3pc to 7pc. This indicates a positive correlation between TFP and GDP growth.\nHowever, Pakistan\u2019s average growth rate across 61 sectors from 2010 to 2020 remained low at 1.5pc, reflecting the increasing unproductivity of the economy over time. The study categorises sectors based on TFP growth, with services and tech-based sectors showing high growth, while manufacturing sectors, including key export sectors like sports goods and textiles, show medium to low TFP growth.\nThe possible reasons behind the high growth in the services and tech sectors could be digitisation and greater competition, in contrast to family-owned manufacturing sectors. The sectors with negative growth are also in the manufacturing sector, including textile spinning, weaving, and leather products.\nThe analysis indicates a trend in which sectors receiving subsidies tend to have lower and negative TFP growth, which suddenly declines during the general election period, indicating a correlation with political instability.\nPakistan\u2019s export sector does not have a presence among the top global export sectors. In comparison, sectors with high TFP growth are not part of major export contributors. The top two global export sectors consist of tech-based goods, including electronic products, with a global share of 16pc, and machinery & mechanic products, with a share of 12pc, which both require research and development (R&D) and innovation.\nIn comparison, Pakistan\u2019s top export sector \u2014 textile \u2014 has only a 2pc global export market share. Pakistan also exports agriculture-based products, whereas the top fifteen global exports do not feature such products.\nThe study suggests several factors that contribute to low productivity: inadequate skilled labour, political instability, weak organisational measures, poor management practices and patronage policies, low-capacity utilisation, slow tech adaptation, and lack of R&D and innovation.\nTherefore, Pakistan needs to revisit its policies and consider fostering steps to improve productivity to achieve sustainable growth. It requires immediate structural reforms and a policy overhaul focusing on human development, capacity building, transparency, and digitisation. It is time to reconsider and diversify exports and prioritise R&D and innovation in all production sectors.\nThe writer is a scholar and research fellow at the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics, Islamabad\n"

            "Text": "Rice is Pakistan\u2019s only major cash crop that does not have a minimum support price (MSP) for growers or an energy subsidy for rice exporters. India, however, has a strong MSP mechanism. The Indian government purchases\npaddy and milled rice to support growers and offers heavy direct subsidies on inputs. Recently, India announced Rs240 billion for fertilisers. Thus, India\u2019s exports are heavily subsidised.\nDespite the August 2023 restrictions, India is still the largest rice exporter and enjoys over a 27 per cent share of global rice exports. India has devised its food diplomacy to strengthen diplomatic ties, imposed an export ban on wheat, sugar, rice, and onion, and pushed sky-high prices of these commodities globally, endangering the world\u2019s food security.\n \n \n\nPakistan\u2019s rice exports could not cross the mark of $2.5bn in the last decade, but during the first eight months of fiscal year 2024, they reached a peak of $2.5bn compared to $1.1bn in 8MFY23 and $2.1bn in FY23.\nOverwhelming growth in value and quantity has rung alarm bells in the competitor\u2019s house. India sensed that their Basmati exports would fall, and apprehensions were raised in Pakistan that prices may rise, making basmati rice beyond consumers\u2019 reach.\n\nPakistan\u2019s strong harvest, along with strategic support from the Ministry of Commerce, has led to record rice exports\n\nHowever, this year, domestic prices of basmati rice are falling: the price of super basmati has fallen by Rs4,000 per 40kgs to Rs8,000 per 40kgs.\n \n \n\nIt is incorrect to link rice export growth with rupee devaluation, as the dollar-rupee parity last year remained at almost Rs280.\nAnother opinion is that India\u2019s export ban on white rice and 20pc export tax on parboiled rice has terrified global demand pressure, exacerbating prices globally, and bears little weight.\nThe main factors behind rice export growth are the record bumper crop in Pakistan, harvested 9.5 million metric tonnes (MMT), and the upward revision of Minimum Export Prices (MEPs), which boosted foreign exchange earnings.\nWe must appreciate the Ministry of Commerce (MoC) and its strategy devised at the start of harvest \u2014 implementing upward MEPs on Sep 2023 \u2014 to counter the aftermath of India\u2019s ban on white rice exports. Upward revision enabled the country to fetch the true value of the crops, increase foreign reserves, curb under-invoicing, and keep local Basmati rice prices stable.\nThe Agro Products Wing was monitored closely and revised again on Nov 7, 2023, to align with the global rice market. MEPs are still below the prevailing market prices, and if the MoC revises them to match the market, Pakistan can fetch more earnings and ensure domestic prices remain affordable.\nDue to warmer and drier weather because of an early El Nino in the Far East and a short-harvest rice crop, Pakistan shipped a large quantity of rice to Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia. Besides, significant achievements in non-traditional markets were added with the help of MoC.\nDue to collaborative efforts of the Ministry of Commerce, the Department of Plant Protection (DPP) and the Commercial section in Russia, rice exports resumed, and the DPP approved more exporters.\nPakistan exported 3.9MMT of rice \u2014 0.5MMT Basmati of $1,142 per ton and 3.5MMT Non-Basmati of $572 per tonne during the 8MFY24.\nIn FY22, rice grown on 3.5m hectares produced 9.3MMT rice in Pakistan, averaging 27 maunds per acre. Hybrid rice is rapidly growing in Pakistan due to a higher yield of 80 to 100 maunds, which is good and bad news.\nThis is good for non-basmati growing zones and bad for basmati growing areas, where growers are tempted to get higher yields. Two rice crops resulted in coarse rice exports increasing, but Pakistan is losing the global Basmati market share where once Pakistan was ruling.\nTo increase rice exports, we need to develop more open-pollinated Basmati aromatic extra long grain varieties and revive world-famous Kernel Basmati rice. We also need to grow and increase hybrid coarse rice in Basmati zones.\nHypothetically, 100 maund paddy productions can process 34.8MMT of rice at 60pc recovery, and for 25pc broken, 20.9MMT is available for export. Assuming $590 per tonne (free on board), the price can fetch over $12bn.\nTransportation of 20MMT rice to ports is another costly head. We need to use cargo trains to reduce inland freight costs and increase exports. Our exporters always pray for a miracle of a pandemic, devaluation, export bans, or export taxes by competitors.\nAfghanistan and Iran\u2019s rice exports are misdeclared as non-basmati and under-invoiced. A major chunk of rice exported to Iran by road is not declared in customs or paltry reported. The MoC and Federal Board of Revenue must check this menace and apply the same MEPs via land and sea.\nSo, if we think beyond emotions purely to increase rice export earnings, it might be doable. A lot of rethinking and meticulous planning is needed, and dumping many earlier notions might be required.\nThe writer is a former member of the managing committee of the Rice Exporters Association of Pakistan and former Vice President of Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry\n"

He said they were playing with the fate of the country because of their egos.\nHe reminded these people about the history of the \u201cnine stars\u201d who campaigned against Zulfikar Ali Bhutto with the dream of reaching the power corridors but ended up with a decade-long dictatorship instead. It may be noted that the PNA or the Pakistan National Alliance was a multi-party movement against the PPP government formed in 1977. According to the PPP chief, political stability can only be achieved through the \u2018Charter of Democracy\u2019 and \u2018Charter of Reconciliation\u2019 and the PPP will be at the forefront.\nHe said the Charter of Democracy had been implemented up to 90 per cent, adding that judicial reforms under this charter were yet to be implemented.\n\nPPP leader demands judicial reforms to ensure justice; Zardari urges politicians not to repeat past mistakes\n\nHe said the PPP aimed to achieve the reforms with the help of legal fraternity and civil society to ensure justice from courts, adding that the confidence of people in this regard had gone down. \u201cWe have to implement judicial reforms,\u201d he said.\nHe also referred to his 10-point agenda that he had announced during the election campaign. The ex-foreign minister said the Sindh and Balochistan governments led by the PPP would fully implement the 10-point programme and provide relief to the people in the budget. \u201cWe are also ready to work on the federal level in this regard,\u201d he added.\nZAB case\nTalking about the reference decided by the Supreme Court regarding the Zulfikar Ali Bhutto case, the PPP leader said: \u201cWe must see why the injustice was done.\u201d\nHe said unfortunately the dictator [Ziaul Haq] and the judiciary were its part. The apex court admitted that Z.A. Bhutto was not given a fair trial and the short order was \u201cour historic success\u201d, he added.\nSpeaking on the occasion, President Asif Ali Zardari invited the people to sit and think together to serve the country, stressing that power is meant to serve the masses. He said people were braving difficulties and \u201cwe must think that future generations should not suffer\u201d.\nThe PPP leader admitted that the mistakes were committed in the past but asked politicians to refrain from repeating them in the future.\nHe invited them to sit together for talks and leave in case of any disagreement. \u201cThis is our politics and we learnt it from Benazir Bhutto,\u201d he said. \u201cI am happy today, as I did my duty,\u201d he said, adding that he headed the party as per her vision.\nHe said he had become the president twice with the support of the people and party workers and \u201cI make decisions with their strength\u201d.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: Delaying his parliamentary address, President Asif Zardari has now summoned a joint sitting of both houses of parliament on April 18, as the National Assembly Secretariat on Sunday issued a six-point agenda for the sitting on Monday (today), which includes the laying of an ordinance promulgated by the caretaker government and a calling attention notice on the issue of the construction of a barrage on Ravi River by India.\n\u201cPresident Asif Ali Zardari has summoned the joint session of the Parliament on Thursday, April 18, 2024 at 4pm. The president has summoned the joint session of Parliament in exercise of the powers conferred by Articles 54(1) and 56(3) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan,\u201d said an official announcement of the Presidency.\n\u201cThe earlier notification to call the joint session of the parliament on April 16 stands cancelled,\u201d it said, without giving any reason.\nSources in the NA Secretariat, however, told Dawn that the president had taken the decision on the demand of the lawmakers, mostly belonging to the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), who had expressed some reservations over calling of the joint sitting soon after the Eid holidays as they wanted to spend some more time in their home constituencies.\n\nZardari set to make history by addressing parliament for record seventh time\n\nThe sources said that the president had delayed the joint sitting for a couple of days on the request of the party members who met him at Garhi Khuda Bakhsh, where he had addressed a public meeting in connection with the death anniversary of the party\u2019s founding chairman Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.\nSeventh address\nThis will be President Zardari\u2019s record seventh address to the joint sitting of the National Assembly and Senate as during his five-year stint in the Presidency from September 2008 to 2013, he had already addressed the parliament six times. President Zardari\u2019s sixth address on April 16, 2013, too, was a record as no other president had addressed so many joint sittings before him.\nIt was some abhorrence of former military ruler Pervez Musharraf for the National Assembly that gave Mr Zardari an extra sixth chance, instead of five, to address a joint sitting.\nGen Musharraf had addressed the joint sitting as president only once in 2004, in the face of strong opposition protests, and never came to the parliament again till his resignation in August 2008.\nHe had not called a joint sitting even after the February 2008 elections and that constitutional requirement was then fulfilled by President Zardari and since then, his predecessors Mamnoon Hussain and Dr Arif Alvi continued this practice of addressing the joint sitting at the beginning of each parliamentary year.\nPresident Zardari is likely to face a strong protest by the members belonging to the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), the party which has been protesting over the conviction and detention of former prime minister and its founding chairman Imran Khan and the alleged rigging in the Feb 8 general elections.\nNA session\nMeanwhile, the National Assembly Secretariat has issued a six-point agenda for the Monday\u2019s (today\u2019s) sitting. It includes a calling-attention notice submitted by PML-N MNA Malik Bashir Awan on the issue of the \u201cshortage of urea fertiliser\u201d in the country and another one by an independent Rai Hassan Nawaz Khan \u201cregarding Indian aggression on the water rights of Pakistan through its recent completion of the Shahpur Kandi Barrage on the Ravi River.\u201d\nBesides, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar will lay the Apostille Ordinance, 2024 (No. I of 2024) before the National Assembly as required by Article 89(2) of the Constitution.\nLaw Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar will present the Annual Report 2022 of the Election Commission of Pakistan as required under sub-section (2)of Section 16 of the Elections Act, 2017.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The Tyrian White case \u2014 a petition filed against former prime minister Imran Khan for concealing his alleged daughter \u2014 seems to have become something more than a paternity matter.\nThis is because the case was one of the only matters specifically referenced by Islamabad High Court (IHC) judges as having invited \u201cpressure\u201d from intelligence operatives after a letter written by six judges to the Supreme Judicial Council became public.\n\u201cConsiderable pressure was brought to bear on judges who had opined that the petition was not maintainable, by operatives of the ISI, through friends and relatives of these judges,\u201d said the letter addressed to the SJC on March 25.\nFollowing an abortive attempt by the government to form a one-member commission to probe the matter, the complaints of meddling in judicial affairs have now been taken up by the Supreme Court in exercise of its suo moto jurisdiction, and are now likely to be deliberated upon by a full court on April 29.\n\nSet to be taken up again after nearly a year, IHC judges said the matter drew \u2018considerable pressure\u2019 from intel operatives who wanted to ensure the plea was deemed \u2018maintainable\u2019\n\nReferred to in the letter as \u201cMuhammad Sajid vs Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi (Writ Petition No. 3061 of 2022)\u201d, this case has been on the back burner since May last year, when IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq dissolved a three-member bench hearing the case. The high court is likely to take up the matter again in the coming days, but the circumstances under which the bench was scuttled seemed quite peculiar, even at the time.\nMaintainability and a \u2018premature\u2019 verdict\nA three-member larger bench consisting of IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, and Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir had reserved their verdict on March 30, 2023.\nDuring earlier hearings, Justice Kayani had questioned the locus standi (right of audience) of the petitioner, Mohammad Sajid, whereas the presiding judge Justice Farooq appeared to be convinced on this particular aspect.\nIt should be noted that former IHC chief justice Athar Minallah had earlier dismissed a similar petition.\nDuring the hearing of the petition on March 2, 2023, the counsel for the petitioner argued that Imran Khan had submitted an affidavit to the Superior Court of California in a case related to the custody of Tyrian, his alleged daughter.\nBut the chief justice corrected him, saying that it was not an affidavit, rather a declaration that was signed by an oath commissioner in Pakistan.\nAt the time, Justice Kayani had pointed out that the declaration never mentioned that Mr Khan was the father of the girl, and questioned the bona fides of the petitioner, observing that only Tyrian White herself could file a petition seeking paternity rights.\nThen, on May 10, the opinions of two judges were uploaded on official website of the court, only to be taken down within minutes.\nThe registrar office then issued a statement clarifying that \u201cthe opinion of two judges was uploaded alone with office notes, which does not constitute [a] judgement of the court\u201d.\nThe statement said the \u201cchief justice has reconstituted the bench for rehearing of the case\u201d, and that action was \u201cbeing taken against those responsible for uploading the opinion without issuance of cause list\u201d.\nNot seeing eye to eye\nThe letter by the six IHC judges also hinted that some judges do not see eye to eye with the incumbent chief justice of the country\u2019s \u2018youngest high court\u2019.\nThe letter recounted a number of communications with the IHC chief justice, especially in the context of the Tyrian White case.\nWhile the judges noted that the IHC CJ had told them that no official from the intelligence agencies would approach them, they complained that the interference continued despite this assurance.\nIt is telling that senior puisne judge Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani \u2014 the senior-most after the chief justice \u2014 is one of the authors of the letter.\nOn the surface, Chief Justice Farooq and Justice Kayani have a good working relationship, as both used to sit on the same division bench and have decided a number of important political cases in the past, including references against Nawaz Sharif, Maryam Nawaz and Asif Ali Zardari.\nThe two were also part of the original bench hearing the Tyrian White case before it was dissolved.\nHowever, Justice Kayani was recently assailed by a complaint before the Supreme Judicial Council, which accuses him of \u201cinducing and convincing other judges of high court\u201d in connection with the letter.\nRetired Justice Noorul Haq N. Qureshi, himself a former senior puisne judge of IHC, told Dawn that differences between the chief justice and the second senior-most judge are \u201ca routine occurrence\u201d in the superior judiciary. He said that the senior-most judge expects power to be shared, but some chief justices want \u201cabsolute authority\u201d.\n\u201cI also experienced the same, but I never complained because I thought it would harm the reputation of the institution that administers justice to the public at large,\u201d he said.\n"

            "Text": "\n\n\n \nIN DELHI\u2019S Urdu Bazaar in 1980s, there were some 80 shops selling Urdu books. Now there are barely six and they too have to wait for a passionate customer looking for Urdu books, says a story by Srijana Siri, titled \u2018Delhi\u2019s Urdu Bazaar and the Decline of a Language\u2019, published by The Indian Express in its April 2, 2024, issue.\nMany reasons can be given for the decline of the language that was the medium of literary expression in India for all and sundry, from prince to pauper, just a couple of centuries ago. Bahadur Shah Zafar, the emperor of India, living in the Royal Fort \u2014 near the very same Urdu Bazaar \u2014 used to compose poetry in Urdu, as did hundreds of commoners and nobles in that city alone. But the sad fact is now Urdu is fighting a losing battle in India.\nAmong those fighting against the odds is Dr Ather Farouqui, general secretary of Delhi\u2019s Anjuman Taraqqi-i-Urdu Hind (ATUH). The Anjuman has been working since 1903, and its Urdu magazines and publications are considered among the authentic ones. But Farouqui\u2019s job is becoming more difficult day by day. Aside from a host of problems, one issue is how to retain the ever-decreasing readership for Urdu books and magazines. The number of readers is dwindling and the attitude of the Indian government towards Urdu is, at best, indifferent, if not hostile.\nApparently, the Urdu academies established in Indian states receive funding from the government to promote Urdu and several Indian universities do have Urdu departments where Urdu is taught at the highest level, but since Urdu is generally not taught at the school or college level, the younger generations are not interested in Urdu. But Farouqui is determined and fighting it out.\nUrdu Adab, a magazine that the ATUH began publishing in 1921 under the editorship of none other than Moulvi Abdul Haq, the colossus, set an example for Urdu research journals. Ever since Farouqui took over as secretary and editor in 2012, Urdu Adab often takes up burning questions and does not hesitate from criticising what it perceives to be detrimental to Urdu.\nTheme of Urdu Adab\u2019s latest issue, July 2023-March 2024, also available online at atuh.org, is Urdu imla, or Urdu orthography. The quest for standardised and unified orthographic rules to write Urdu is on since long and it only picked up pace with the publication of Rasheed Hasan Khan\u2019s epoch-making book Urdu Imla in 1974. Ghalib and later on Debi Prahshad Sahar Badayuni discussed some aspects of Urdu orthography in the latter half of 19th century, but it was Ahsan Marehravi who deliberated some issues in Urdu orthography through his magazine Faseeh-ul-Mulk. In 1920s, Hashmi Fareedabadi and Abdus Sattar Siddiqi formulated some rules at the ATUH under the aegis of Abdul Haq, who was very keen to resolve the issue.\nIn Pakistan, Urdu Dictionary Board adopted some rules under Shanul Haq Haqqee\u2019s guidance to compile Urdu\u2019s most comprehensive Urdu-Urdu dictionary when he was heading the organisation. Ghulam Mustafa Khan and Farman Fatehpuri were the two stalwarts who took up the issue and tried to give some guiding principles. In India, Rasheed Hasan Khan\u2019s book became the most referred guide on Urdu orthography, though many still don\u2019t agree with some of Rasheed Sahib\u2019s suggestions.\nIn fact it was the ATUH that took Urdu orthography seriously some 100 years ago and Urdu Adab\u2019s latest issue, dubbed Imla Number, endeavours to capture the essence of the debate that has been raging for over a century. Farouqui\u2019s editorial, crisp and candid as ever, sums up some issues and he, in his usual style, does not mince words to point out some lacunas that are hurting Urdu in India most and, as he puts it, one of the elements that are detrimental to Urdu in India today, is the induction of madressah students into Urdu departments of Indian universities. These students are admitted to BA classes and, albeit being quit well-versed with Urdu, Persian and Arabic, they have little or no study and understanding of literature. But almost all of them aspire to become a professor at a university, playing havoc with Urdu language, literature and their teaching, says Farouqui.\nThe latest issue also includes a list of some 300 words as sample standardised Urdu orthography. Though in Pakistan some may not agree with the way some words are spelt out in the sample, it is a commendable effort to address the issues in Urdu orthography. The recommendations of a seminar held at Islamabad\u2019s National Language Promotion Department in 2022 have also been made a part of the issue, making it an open forum for all kinds of opinions and one feels that such all-embracing approach will help resolve issues of orthography that Urdu has been grappling with for over one-and-a-half century.\ndrraufparekh@yahoo.com\n"

            "Text": "LAHORE: The Pakistan Railways \u2014 the country\u2019s second largest state owned enterprise \u2014 has no money to replace 100 locomotives that have passed their entire operational life of 20 to 25 years and has no option but to keep running them. Of the 100 outlived engines, around 35 were purchased in 1975\u2014around 50 years ago, Dawn has learnt.\nBesides unavailability of funds, the railways is plagued by other administrative issues as well that have forced it to keep the old fleet on tracks.\n\u201cThe PR is in dire need of at least 100 new locomotives to replace the old ones procured in 1975 and 1990. But the problem is the paucity of funds that must be made available to procure new locomotives and save the heavy maintenance cost being incurred on making the old ones operational,\u201d an official source explained while talking to Dawn.\n\u201cThe situation is worsening as the incidents related to faults in the outlived engines are increasing,\u201d the official, who requested anonymity, said, urging the government to allocate sufficient funds for the railways in the upcoming annual budget for the year 2024-25 under the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP).\n\n35 engines were purchased 50 years back; company paying heavy cost for maintenance, fuel\nof old engines\n\nAccording to the official, the Pakistan Railways has 350 active locomotives of various specifications. Besides this, it has over 60 engines that are not in operation and are currently parked at various yards. In railways terms, such engines are called as grounded and supposed to not to be used further. In 1975, the railways had purchased 35 locomotives of 300 horsepower. Some 10 or so were of 150 horsepower. Likewise, another 54 were procured in 1990, followed by some more purchased before the end of the year 2000. In 2013-14, the department purchased 63 more locomotives.\nSimilarly in 2017, the railways purchased 55 locomotives of 90 series (4,000 HP), having capacity to take load of 3,400 tonnes at 80km speed per hour. In 2019, another 20 engines of 45 series having capacity of 2,000 HP were also procured.\n\u201cIf you see the purchasing year, we have only 138 locomotives that still have their life for 12 to 20 years or so. But the rest of all have completed their life, especially those procured in 1975 and the 1990s. Life of a new locomotive is up to 25 years maximum but the Pakistan Railways is still using the 35 to 50 years old locomotives with heavy maintenance cost,\u201d the official said.\nTo a question, he added that to overcome the shortage of new locomotives, the railways needed sufficient funds to procure at least 100 new engines.\nIn this way, the railways can save millions of rupees being incurred on maintenance of old engines. Similarly, the cost of fuel can also be saved since the new engines in the market are fuel efficient with excellent mileage at a reasonably high speed.\nGAS: The Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) on Sunday severed another 62 connections and imposed Rs1.5m fine on the consumers for gas pilferage and other illegalities.\nIn Lahore, according to a spokesman, the regional team severed one connection for illegal use of gas. In Multan, 11 connections were disconnected, in Sahiwal, three meters were disconnected while the teams in Faisalabad severed two connections on illegal use of gas.\nThe SNGPL regional team of Bahawalpur disconnected two meters for illegal use of gas while another for using a compressor. In Gujranwala, five connections were severed on different charges while fine was also imposed in gas theft cases.\nFour connections were severed for illegal use of gas in Gujrat.\n"

            "Text": "TOBA TEK SINGH: Social media has made it possible for a woman from Kashmir to get freedom 16 years after her kidnapping.\nThe woman was allegedly kidnapped from Khulana locality of the Chakothi Police Station area on the Indian border in the Hattian Bala district of Azad Kashmir was recovered by the Arrouti police from village Shahpur of the Toba Tek Singh district.\nToba district police spokesperson Attaullah told the media persons on Sunday that Asia Bibi, daughter of Raja Sher Muhammad, had gone missing from her village in 2008 and Chakothi police had registered a case. Asia was actually kidnapped from her area by one Ghulam Mustafa, a resident of Jhang, who brought her to his city and kept her in his house for two years. He later handed her over to an aged man, named Allah Yar, a resident of Toba, who contracted a marriage with her. She had been living with him since then.\nAsia recently found an opportunity to use a smartphone and she recorded her video in which she told her story of kidnapping that occurred in 2008. She told about her present whereabouts. She made her video viral on social media, which was watched by someone from her village and he informed her parents. The matter was brought to the notice of the federal government and finally Faisalabad Regional Police Officer Dr Muhammad Abid Khan and Toba District Police Officer Ibadat Nisar were contacted.\nThe Toba police spokesperson said police raided the house of Allah Yar and recovered Asia. She has been temporarily shifted to Darul Aman on the order of a judicial magistrate from where she would be handed over to the Azad Kashmir police. Allah Yar has also been arrested and police would arrest the abductor, Ghulam Mustafa, from Jhang to hand both the suspects to Azad Kashmir police.\nAsia Bibi said she was very glad that her reunion was happening with her family after 16 years.\nTHEFT: During the Eid holidays, thieves took away Rs2.2m cash from the shop of a fertiliser dealer in the grain market at Gojra.\nMuhammad Rafiq told the Gojra City police that when he opened his shop on Sunday, he found locks of his shop broken. He also found that thieves had taken away Rs2.2m cash from his shop.\nIt is to be mentioned that during the Eid holidays, thieves had also taken away from trhe same area cash of Rs1.7m from the office of a cigarette agency owner, Zahid Rauf Kamobh.\n"

            "Text": "LAHORE: The Punjab government on Sunday decided to cut the rate of roti and naan and implement the decision immediately.\nThe decision was announced by Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz through her personal account on social media X (formerly twitter).\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAlhamdulillah, Punjab government has reduced the price of bread to Rs16 per loaf from today. I have directed all districts of Punjab and the departments concerned to ensure strict implementation of the decision. May Allah Almighty bring more ease in the lives of people,\u201d reads her statement.\nActing upon the direction, deputy commissioner of each district, including Lahore, immediately issued a notification fixing the price of a 100 gram roti at Rs16 and of 120g naan at Rs20.\nThough citizens have breathed a sigh of relief on the provincial government\u2019s decision, the association of naan-bais/tandoorwalas has rejected it saying they have not been taken on board.\n\nPunjab government slashes roti and naan rates\n\n\u201cThere had been no coordination with us. The deputy commissioners issued the so-called notifications without taking us on board,\u201d Naan-Bai Association president Aftab Gill tells Dawn.\n\u201cPerhaps, for the first time in history the stakeholders have been ignored before taking a decision on reducing prices of a commodity,\u201d he laments, rejecting the notification.\nHe says that an application of his association has been pending with the DC office for the last two months seeking to increase the roti and naan prices keeping in view the rising costs of flour, gas and electricity.\nRecalling that a former DC (Umer Sher) had earlier imposed such a unilateral decision in July 2022 only to be taken back when the naan-bais took out a rally up to his office, he says that they will repeat history if the authorities do not come up with a compensating formula for them.\nExplaining that the government should offer them subsidy to cut the roti and naan prices instead of benefiting the consumers at the cost of the tandoorwalas, he threatens to shut down the tandoors if the government tries to forcibly impose the decision on them.\nResponding to a query about likely cut in new wheat crop rates, he says that wheat flour is not the only input required to make bread. \u201cThe tariffs of gas, power and labour have also gone up adding to our production cost.\u201d\n"

            "Text": "Certain misconceptions gain currency and with the passage of time for the fact of being reiterated ad nauseam they become common. This is usually the result of not being able to differentiate between appearance and reality which are not only two sides of the same phenomenon but are also deceptive as they overlap each other.  \nPunjab suffers from a strange fallacy in contemporary times. Imagine Punjab. What does it evoke? You see it as what you find in the images and visuals thrown around you; countryside, villages, cattle and half-naked peasants. Just have a look at the sets of television programmes regarding Punjab. The sets of such programmes would have wells, painted pottery, motifs of cattle and folk stools with gaudy colours, handheld fans with tinsel frills etc. While visualising and erecting the set the set-designer goes brain dead. Some mysterious force seizes his thinking ability and compels him to look at Punjab purely in terms of an agrarian society. His entire concept of set, if one accepts it as one, is drawn from the detritus of bygone era. Flotsam and jetsam are offered as symbols that supposedly represent the reality of Punjab. The producer/director of the programme happily accepts what is offered as compatible with the current social reality of Punjab. Look at the irony of the situation; both the persons live in a metropolis or modern urban centre but when they think of Punjab they exclude all from it except countryside and the traditional life that has almost vanished. The trappings of country life imagined by them have disconnect with ground reality. Stuck in the past they fail to realise that well has been replaced by tube-well, oxen by tractors, colourful stools by plastic chairs and handheld fans by electric fans. What is being stressed here is that an irreversible change has taken place in our countryside which they fail to comprehend. They forget that the cities in Punjab have overwhelming presence as they guide and control life in the rural areas.  \nPunjab, they ignore, has a very long history of urban society spanning thousands of years starting from Harappa if not from earlier period. It\u2019s not to deny the existence of rural society. Rural and urban societies are twins joined at hip; one cannot exist without the other. The former needs the innovation and knowledge created by the latter and the latter needs the agricultural surplus produced by the former. \nSituation is somewhat similar in our literature. You can find in our literary set poets a dime a dozen. They endlessly churn out verses that mostly fall in the category of doggerel or sentimental kitsch. Like television programmers they take Punjab as it was in the past, idyllically painted by the tradition. Their voice is a voice from the past laced with a wistful feeling. It\u2019s remembrance of the things past in a mode of nostalgia coupled with subdued lamentations full of self-pity.\nWhat was valuable has been lost and what is present has nothing worthwhile to offer. Popular poems doing rounds these days appeal to the dead poets or saints and the spirit of an imagined Punjab to stop the wheel of time and resurrect what has been buried underneath its dust. Like others they conceive Punjab as it was, not as it is. They imagine Punjab as an infinite number of rural settlements in close proximity of nature in a state of bliss. Nothing can be more removed from reality. In their mental maps cities do not exist. If they exist at all, they exist negatively. The poets conveniently forget that rural life was marred by poverty, misery, starvation and petty conflicts. It was cities which introduced technology, methods of modern cultivation, new varieties of seeds and pesticide that improved the quality of life in countryside.  \nRemember peasants have the notion of 13th month of the year, the month when harvest is not ready and they face severe financial crunch. For some months, elders would tell you, they had grass grown in their hearths in the machineless past. \nThe situation is equally bad if not worse across the border in the East Punjab. They are like their counterparts this side of the border hooked on the past and obsessed with the countryside. Look at their songs and lyrical poetry to discover what they have common with the west Punjabis. Their songs incessantly wax lyrical of village life and \u2018Jat\u2019 and \u201cJati (a Jat woman)\u2019. Jat has multiple meanings. It means a peasant, a rustic, an uncouth person. But it also denotes a tribe, a caste. They in the sense of a tribe were originally nomads and started landing in Punjab after 13th and 14th centuries and gradually became good and hardworking farmers.  \nWhen they became a dominant segment of Sikh community they forgot their humble origins; the newly gained power went to their head. Now most of their artists conceive Punjab as a mammoth village dominated by a Jat, dead drunk with a gun on his shoulders, in frantic search of his ideal beloved who cannot be other than a Jati. Their singers glorify village idiocy as a mark of culture as they talk of guns and shootings in their romantic meanderings in gruff voices which lack skill and aesthetic appeal. Finesse is frowned upon as effeteness and machismo is touted as manliness. You no longer find Asa Singh Mastana, Surindar Kaur and Parkash Kaur, Wadali Brothers and Jagjit. All this happens despite the fact that every young man desperately wants to leave his village to settle in the urban centres of the advanced world. But whenever they think of Punjab it\u2019s nothing more than rural settlement.\nIn the West Punjab our mind evokes Punjab as a rural entity because we are cut off from our history and culture. Above all, we have lost our language. Since we find our language and cultural practices intact to some extent in the rural areas we subconsciously equate Punjab with the countryside. Cities are no-go-area for our mother language and culture. That\u2019s why we tend to have the image of our homeland frozen in the past.  \nIn the East Punjab they own the language but they associate the ethos of Punjab with agriculture and countryside as if cities don\u2019t exist. In a nutshell, both fail to see Punjab as it is; a fast changing countryside that emulates cities, and growing cities in a globalised world that lead the countryside in a new era of modernity. \u2014 soofi01@hotmail.com\n"

            "Text": "GUJRAT: Three daughters of Chaurdhy Zahoor Elahi are running the election campaign for former Punjab chief minister and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) President Chaudhry Parvez Elahi for the PP-32 bye-poll. Mr Elahi, who is in jail, faces Chaudhry Musa Elahi, son of Chaudhry Wajahat Hussain, of the PML-Q.\nThree sisters - Qaisara Elahi, wife of Mr Elahi, Naaz Elahi, wife of former Attock district nazim retired Maj Tahir Sadiq, and Sameera Elahi, wife of Tafweez Chohan - along with their niece (sister\u2019s daughter) MPA Basima Riaz Chudhary from Mandi Bahauddin, visited the main bazaar of Kunjah on Sunday in connection with Mr. Elahi\u2019s election campaign.\nAfter completing their visit to the bazaar and meeting with traders and shopkeepers, they arrived at the residence of Sheikh Shehkaz Aslam Moon where a large number of party workers and local traders had gathered.\nQaisara Elahi delivered a hard-hitting speech against her brother Wajahat Hussain, criticising him for resorting to pressure tactics through the police and administration against the supporters of Mr. Elahi in Kunjah and other areas of the constituency.\nShe said that Wajahat had now taken the lead from his nephews Salik Hussain and Shafay Hussain in using these tactics, surpassing what Shujaat\u2019s sons did in the February 8 polls.\nHad her mother been alive today, she would have dealt with her brother strongly, Qaisara said, adding that this was the first time she had spoken against Wajahat.\nShe said she wanted to clarify that people had a misconception that Mr Elahi would leave Imran Khan after facing many difficulties. She said that Mr Elahi had proven predictions wrong by standing firm with Imran Khan and not yielding to the influence of his relatives.\nQaisara said that Mr Elahi has endured many hardships for standing with Mr Khan for a year, and she affirmed that Mr Elahi, along with her, their children, and all their family members, firmly support Mr Khan.\nThe PP-32 by-elections will be held on April 21 after federal minister Chaudhry Salik Hussain vacated the seat to retain NA-64 (Gujrat-Kunjah).\n"

On April 15, 1974 a news item with reference to an exhibition held as part of the three-day Sindh Literary and Cultural Conference at the Sindh Centre near the YMCA highlighted, among other objects, a ja\u2019i namaz with embroidery on a spotted deer skin as the choicest handicraft on view. The exhibition also had pieces of jewellery, textile and furniture; tiles; works of literature; and official historic documents. Also displayed was the 350-year-old Dalayal-ul-Khairat in Arabic with its Persian translation and a volume on medicine titled Tib-i-Akbar.\nAnother similar noteworthy programme on April 20 grabbed the media\u2019s attention when an exhibition of personal belongings, letters, books and photographs of Allama Iqbal was inaugurated at the National Museum of Pakistan by the Provincial Education Minister Pyarali Allana to commemorate the 36th death anniversary of the poet. Among the exhibits were: a rare photo taken in Jerusalem where a meeting of the Motamar-i-Alam-i-Islami was held 43 years ago in which the grand mufti of Palestine and Iqbal were shown together; a chair used by the poet, his coats, a stick, an umbrella, pictures taken with the Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah during the Round Table Conference and some paintings.\nCertain old pieces of recent history also became the centre of attention that week albeit in a different context. On April 17, it was reported that dozens of buildings were posing a serious threat to the lives of over 20000 residents, mostly in the old city area. From 1969 to 1973, 71 buildings were declared dangerous by the Karachi Municipal Corporation (KMC) but 28 of them could be demolished. Action in respect of the remaining 43 was suspended when owners or occupants moved the court against the KMC and obtained a stay order. According to the corporation, it had been withholding demolition work in many cases for five years due to legal complications. Most of the structures, it suspected, might not survive the forthcoming monsoon season as they were in an extremely poor condition. The residents had been warned by the KMC and advised to take necessary precautions. The oldest pending case was that of a double-storey building in Bombay Bazaar. It was declared dangerous in 1967.\nWhat sometimes, if not always, takes out citizens from \u2018dangerous\u2019 spaces is a sense of humour. On April 17, a humorous mushaira titled Shab-i-Qehqaha on the occasion of the 10th death anniversary of poet Zareef Jalalpuri was held at the Karachi Press Club (KPC). Poets who participated in the event included Syed Mohammad Jafri, Dr Inam Ahsan, Mister Dehalvi, Prof Taha Khan, Ustad Bedil, Majeed Majid, Saif Sultanpuri, Amirul Islam Hashmi, Azim Ahmed Abbasi, Fazal Ahmed Siddiqi Bashshash, Ismail Anis, Harfan Lakhnavi, Shahid Alwari and \nQuaid bin Zareef. An audio clip of Zareef Jalalpuri\u2019s poem \u2018Teddy Boy\u2019, too, was played at the mushaira which was presided over by Dr Mahmud Husain, Vice-Chancellor of Karachi University.\n"

They strongly condemned the slow attitude of the government.\n"

            "Text": "KARACHI: A sessions court has awarded total eight-year imprisonment to a man in a robbery case.\nAdditional District and Sessions Judge (East) Ghulam Mustafa Laghari found Umair guilty of committing a robbery and possession of an illegal weapon.\nThe court pronounced its verdict after recording evidence and arguments from both sides. \nIn addition to the jail term, the judge imposed fines of a total of Rs15,000 on the convict and in case of default, he would undergo an additional two-month imprisonment.\nThe court took a lenient view in awarding sentence due to the convict\u2019s young age and the fact that he was a first-time offender.\nThroughout the trial, the accused denied the allegations levelled against him. However, during cross-examination, the court noted that the accused failed to establish a case of false implication. \n\u201cNo glaring contradiction was found by the accused to warrant the extension of the benefit of the doubt to him,\u201d the court ruled.\nThe verdict read, \u201cEven though all the material witnesses are independent, their evidence is corroborated and consistent with each other, and at no point was their testimony shaken by the accused.\u201d\nAccording to the prosecution, the complainant informed the police that last year she along with her son went to the Superior Science College in Shah Faisal Colony for his admission. However, two young men approached them, held them at gunpoint and snatched their mobile phones and valuables. \nFortunately, a police patrol arrived at the scene upon hearing the complainant\u2019s call for help. The police chased and apprehended both the suspects, identified as Umair and underage suspect Aftab. After a search, the police recovered a .30-bore pistol and five live bullets from Umair.\nDuring the investigation, the mother of the co-accused, Aftab, produced his birth certificate, which revealed that he was 16. Consequently, the investigation officer presented him before the concerned judicial magistrate, who remanded him to jail. The IO also separately submitted a challan before a juvenile court.\nState prosecutor Zulfiqar Ali Shah presented four witnesses to support the case against the accused. \nTwo cases were registered at the Shah Faisal Colony police station under Sections 397 of the Pakistan Penal Code read with Section 23 (i) of the Sindh Arms Act 2013.\nBail granted\nA sessions court granted bail to a man facing trial in a case pertaining to the killing of an official of the Sindh Bar Council (SBC) Gulistan-i-Jauhar in Dec 2021.\nFormer SBC secretary Irfan Mehar was targeted by gunmen near Chapal Plaza in Block-13.\nApplicant Ghulam Akbar, who is victim\u2019s brother-in-law, filed a post-arrest bail application before Additional District and Sessions Judge Abdul Zahoor Chandio. \nAfter recording arguments, the judge granted him bail against a surety bond of Rs500,000.\n\u201cThe applicant is entitled to bail in line with the rule of consistency. Under these circumstances, it is my humble estimation that the applicant has presented a strong case for bail,\u201d the court order stated.\nDuring proceedings, the applicant\u2019s counsel highlighted that the FIR was filed against unknown individuals. Additionally, co-accused Wajid Hussain and Rahim Bux were granted bail by the Sindh High Court, along with the victim\u2019s wife.\nThe counsel argued that despite 27 months of incarceration, no evidence had been presented against the suspect, with 16 witnesses examined by the prosecution.\nIn response, the complainant\u2019s counsel opposed the bail application, acknowledging that the suspects\u2019 names were not initially mentioned in the complaint. However, he argued that the applicant\u2019s sister instigated her brother to allegedly murder his husband over an alleged property dispute.\n"

The overcrowded truck overturned and plunged into a roadside ditch near Hub late in the evening. Many of the travellers fell off the truck and about two scores of them were crushed under it. Thirteen people died on the spot and five others, among the around 50 injured, died during emergency medical treatment. One family had lost its 12 members in the accident and some other members were receiving treatment at hospitals. On Sunday, another family member, Mohammad Rafique, 32, son of Imam Dino Jokhio, also succumbed to his injuries leading the total death toll in the tragedy to 19. \nTouching scenes were witnessed when several hundred relatives of the bereaved families and members of their community visited their homes again on Sunday after hearing the death of Rafiq Jokhio. They took part in the funeral. \nThe bereaved families and many of their other relatives earn their livelihood through brick kilns and stone crushing machines functioning along the outer boundary walls of the Thatta Cement Factory and its close proximity.\nMourners share feelings and views\nSome of the mourners at the condolence gathering were hugging the loudly crying bereaved relatives and many other grief-struck visitors were trying to console them. \nGul Hassan Jokhio, a representative of Qasim Jokhio village residents, lamented the lack of road safety measures pointing out that thousands of people travel through this route for the annual pilgrimage of Shah Noorani. No security measures were seen either even after the 2016 bomb blast at the shrine that had claimed 52 lives, he deplored.\nMNA Sadiq Ali Memon and MPAs Syed Riaz Hussain Shah Shirazi and Haji Ali Hassan Zardari were among the prominent figures who attended the gathering. They had also provided financial assistance to the bereaved families soon after the accident.\nFormer MNA Babu Ghulam Hussain has proposed more financial assistance out of the handouts collected by the Auqaf department at the shrine.\n"

They insisted that the target should be at least 1.7 million tonnes.\nAT media secretary Kashif Mallah, Advocate Najeebur Rehman Mahesar, Atif Mallah, Hadi Dino Khuharo, Hizballah Khoso and other party leaders from Dadu district led the rally, which started from Community Centre and culminated outside the press club in KN Shah.\nSpeaking on the occasion, the protest leaders criticised the government\u2019s treatment meted out to farmers, alleging that the traders backed by the Sindh government exploited farmers by purchasing wheat at low prices and reselling it to the food department at the rates fixed by the government.\nThey condemned government\u2019s alleged failure to open wheat procurement centres and accused it of extending undue favours to influential businessmen and wheat traders, \nleaving small farmers (abadgars) at their mercy. \nThey also accused the Sindh government of facilitating wheat smuggling by fixing low target and depriving growers of gunny bags, thus forcing abadgars to sell their produce at lower prices.\nThe leaders decried mismanagement of irrigation resources, highlighting neglect of canals in Khairpur Nathan Shah for years despite it being under the legal jurisdiction of the irrigation department. \nThey expressed their concern over the lack of progress in repair work of the canals damaged during the 2022 flood, despite allocation of significant funds for their reconstruction.\nThe AT leaders stressed an urgent need to address these issues, highlighting their detrimental impact on the livelihoods of farmers and other people.\nThey said: \u201cThe amendment to the Irsa Act is viewed as a symbol of martial law and reminiscent of the \u2018One Unit\u2019 rule. This ordinance is deemed unconstitutional and perceived as an assault on the principles outlined in the 18th Constitutional Amendment. Consequently, it is imperative to halt the implementation of this ordinance\u201d.\n"

As the shower count stayed light to moderate, the thunders and lightning triggered fears among residents.\nThe power supply system of a house in Naya Nazimabad was struck by lightning but luckily, no one was hurt in the incident.\nChief Meteorologist Sardar Sarfaraz said the combination of sea breeze with cold winds had increased the chances of \u2018tornadoes and lightning\u2019 which were witnessed in the fresh rain spell.\nAlthough the system had lost its intensity, he said, it could still cause light rains early on Monday.\nSurjani Town received the highest amount of rain which was 29 millimetres, or 1.14 inches, followed by Nazimabad with 21.2mm, Gulshan-i-Hadeed 20mm, Keamari and PAF Base Faisal 19mm each, PAF Masroor Base 18mm, University Road 15.7mm and Saadi Town 15mm. The other parts of the city received rains in single digit count.\nAfter the rain the city temperature dropped to 27 degree Celsius with 83 per cent humidity.\nA Met office advisory says that the city weather is likely to stay \u2018mostly cloudy\u2019 on Monday (today) but expected to turn \u2018hot and humid\u2019 on Tuesday (tomorrow).\nFive die as coach overturns on motorway\nFive persons, including two children, were killed and 20 others injured when an apparently fast-moving passenger coach overturned on M-9 motorway near Karachi due to rain on Sunday.\nOfficials said that the passenger coach was on its way from Karachi to Larkana and the incident took place near Jokhio Mor.\nPolice Surgeon Summaiya Syed said that three persons, including two children, were brought dead at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre.\nAn Edhi Foundation spokesperson said that two more persons, aged between 30 and 35 years, were shifted to a private hospital, where doctors declared them dead.\nGirl dies\nIn Baldia Town, a 10-year-old girl was killed and her relative injured when their motorcycle slipped due to rain.\nOfficials said that the incident took place on Suparco Road. The body was shifted to the Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi.\nPower failures\nSeveral areas of the city experienced power outages during rain.\nHowever, the K-Electric claimed that power supply to Karachi remained stable amid intermittent showers.\nIn a statement, the power utility said that the KE teams continued to closely monitor the situation, maintaining proactive contact with key departments of the government of Sindh, Met office, and the city\u2019s administration, while the field teams remained available to address any faults.\n\u201cOver 1,900 feeders of KE\u2019s network of almost 2,100 feeders remained fully energised at any given time. In accordance with emergency safety protocols, power supply to low-lying areas with a risk of water logging and those with a high prevalence of kundas was temporarily suspended. These areas have also been gradually re-energised after clearance from field teams,\u201d it said.\nMayor visits city areas\nThe civic administration, which claimed to have mobilised its teams and resources two days ago following the Met office forecast, was, to some extent, able to handle the challenge as no major urban flooding incident, that had been seen in the past, was witnessed on Sunday.\n\u201cThe staff is busy clearing rainwater from [areas] where it has collected,\u201d Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab posted on X (formerly Twitter).\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA statement issued by his office said that the city mayor visited various areas where he appreciated the teams busy draining out rainwater.\nBarrister Wahab said that all staff of the KMC, Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation, and Sindh Solid Waste Management Board were present on the ground to tackle the rain situation.\n\u201cFor the first time, vehicles with suction, jetting and pumping features have also been deputed on major arteries to deal with the situation,\u201d he shared in another post.\nSindh chief secretary Syed Asif Haider Shah, on the other hand, issued high alert for all municipalities, administrative bodies, and hospitals across the province to meet rain related challenges.\n"

Many wiped away tears.\n\nPolice say knife attacker was a local man \u2018with a history of mental illness\u2019\n\nPolice said the attack lasted for about half an hour until a solo police woman tracked down Cauchi and shot him dead.\nInspector Amy Scott was hailed by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese as a \u201chero\u201d who \u201cno doubt\u201d had \u201csaved lives through her action\u201d.\nAmong Cauchi\u2019s victims were a designer, a volunteer surf lifesaver, the daughter of an entrepreneur, and a new mother whose nine-month-old baby is still in hospital with serious stab wounds.\nAs the attack unfolded on Saturday, online social media accounts falsely reported that the attack was linked to ideological or religious groups or events in the Middle East.\nPolice have named the assailant as 40-year-old itinerant man Joel Cauchi, who was previously diagnosed with a mental health issue.\nNew South Wales police Assistant Commissioner Anthony Cooke said there was no evidence to suggest Cauchi was \u201cdriven by any particular motivation, ideology or otherwise\u201d.\nPolice said he was diagnosed with a mental health issue at age 17.\n\u2018Only doing her job\u2019\nIn a statement, Cauchi\u2019s parents offered thoughts for the victims and said their son\u2019s actions were \u201ctruly horrific\u201d.\n\u201cWe are still trying to comprehend what has happened. He has battled with mental health issues since he was a teenager.\u201d\nThe parents also sent a message to the officer who shot their son dead.\n\u201cShe was only doing her job to protect others, and we hope she is coping alright,\u201d they said.\nCauchi is believed to have travelled to Sydney about a month ago and hired a small storage unit in the city, according to police. It contained personal belongings, including a boogie board.\nHe had been living in a vehicle and hostels and was only in sporadic contact with his family via text messages, his parents said.\nA Facebook profile said Cauchi came from Toowoomba, near Brisbane, and had attended a local high school and university.\nA distinctive grey, red and yellow dragon tattoo on his right arm was used to help identify him.\nAustralians, largely unaccustomed to violent crime, are still coming to terms with an attack that shattered a city better known for its famed beaches and laid-back bars and restaurants.\n\u2018Outstanding human\u2019\nOne victim, 38-year-old mother Ashlee Good, succumbed to her injuries after desperately passing her bleeding baby to two strangers in the hope they could save the child\u2019s life.\nGood\u2019s family described her as \u201ca beautiful mother, daughter, sister, partner, friend, all round outstanding human and so much more\u201d.\n\u201cTo the two men who held and cared for our baby when Ashlee could not \u2014 words cannot express our gratitude\u201d, they said in a statement to Australian media.\nThe baby, named Harriet, was said to be recovering well after lengthy surgery.\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese said Australians were struggling to understand an \u201cunspeakable\u201d attack that is \u201creally just beyond comprehension\u201d.\n\u201cWe also know there are many people still in hospital dealing with recovery, and our thoughts and prayers are with them,\u201d Albanese said he had received messages from US President Joe Biden, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, and New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, among others.\nFlags across Australia will be flown at half-mast on Monday to honour the victims of the Bondi Junction stabbing, as per Sydney Morning Herald.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: While the impact of the Middle East escalation is yet to materialise, the higher international market is estimated to push up the prices of petrol and high-speed diesel by about Rs2.50 and Rs8.50 per litre, respectively on Monday (April 15) for the next fortnight, despite a decline in the import premium and a slightly improved exchange rate.\nInformed sources said the prices of petrol and HSD had increased in the international market by about $4 and $4.50 per barrel, respectively, during the last fortnight, before the latest escalation. Depending on final calculation, the price of petrol is projected to be higher by Rs2.50 to Rs2.80 and that of HSD to go up by Rs8 to Rs8.50 per litre.\nInterestingly, the imp\u00adort premium on petrol has dropped by almost 21pc to $10.7 per barrel over the last fortnight when compared to $13.50 in last few days of March and the rupee strengthened by about 40 paisa against a dollar to Rs278.20. The net impact is estimated to be about Rs2.80 per litre increase in petrol price from existing rate of Rs289.41.\nThe HSD price, on the other hand, was up in the international market and its import premium paid by the benchmark Pakistan State Oil remained unchanged at $6.50 per barrel.\nHSD rate was thus estimated to be higher by Rs8 to Rs8.50 per litre, subject to final exchange rate adjustment in pricing, from current rate of Rs282.24 per litre at depot stage.\nFor the purpose of price calculations, officials said the petrol price had gone up by about $4 per barrel to $98.5 last week while HSD price went up by $4.50 per barrel to $102.9.\nAlmost a fortnight ago, the government had increased the price of petrol by Rs9.66 per litre and reduced that of high speed diesel (HSD) by Rs3.32 per litre for the fortnight ending April 15.\nThe government has already achieved Rs60 per litre petroleum levy \u2014 maximum permissible limit under the law \u2014 on both petrol and HSD.\nUnder the commitments made with the International Monetary Fund, the government had set budget target to collect Rs869bn as petroleum levy on petroleum products during the current fiscal year. It has already collected about Rs475bn in the first half (July-December) of the fiscal, though the government is expected to mop up about Rs970bn by end of the year despite the revised target of Rs920bn by end-June.\nAt present, the government is charging about Rs82 per litre tax on both petrol and HSD.\n"

These damages include heavy losses to houses, infrastructure, and disruptions to transportation networks, including the coastal highway and other link roads, cutting off access to many areas from the provincial capital, Quetta, and other districts.\nThe power supply has been severely affected, with electric pylons uprooted in Pasni and Panjgur areas, leading to outages lasting hours in Quetta and surrounding areas. Gas supply disruptions and low pressure have also been reported across various areas of the provincial capital and other cities.\nNormal life and traffic have been significantly impacted across Makran and other regions of northern, central and southern Balochistan, with incessant rains affecting around 25 districts of the province.\nReports indicated that Pasni, a coastal town in the Gwadar district, has been particularly hard hit, with extensive areas submerged under rainwater.\n\u201cPasni looks like a big lake at the moment as flash floods entered the human settlements and main commercial areas,\u201d Noor Ahmed Kalmati, chairman of Pasni Municipal Committee, told Dawn by phone.\n\u201cDozens of mud houses and boundary walls collapsed in heavy rains that lashed the small town for four hours,\u201d Mr Kalmati said, adding that the municipal committee was trying to rescue residents trapped by floodwaters.\nIn Kech district, scores of houses have been damaged, and link roads washed away, cutting links to Turbat and other areas of Makran.\nKech Deputy Commissioner Hassan Baloch confirmed the death of a woman due to a lightning strike in the Gohrag Bag area of Bal Nagor and structural collapses, with significant damage to infrastructure, including an under-construction bridge at Buzi Top on the coastal highway. He said another man was killed in the Kech district after the roof of a house collapsed.\nBesides, several mud houses were damaged while hundreds of vehicles, including loaded trucks, passenger coaches and other vehicles, were trapped on both sides of Buzi Top.\nPanjgur has also suffered extensive damage, with hundreds of solar panels destroyed, disrupting essential services such as communication. The rain has severely impacted life in Quetta, flooding roads, damaging infrastructure and causing difficulties for residents.\nEfforts to mitigate the impact, including the city cleaning campaign launched by Quetta Metropolitan Corporation Administrator Hamza Shafqaat, have been hampered by the relentless downpour and subsequent flooding.\nPunjab\nIn Punjab, the lightning-related death toll rose to 21 after four more deaths on Sunday, a spokesperson of the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) said. The victims include nine men, five women and seven children.\nLightning strikes have occurred in Muzaffargarh, Rahim Yar Khan, Rajanpur, Lodhran, Bahawalpur and Bahawalnagar.\nOverall, nine people died due to lightning strikes in Rahim Yar Khan; three each in Baha\u00adwalnagar, Bahawalpur and Lodhran; and one each in Muzaffargarh, Rajanpur and Kot Addu.\nMoreover, five people were also injured due to lightning, the PDMA spokesperson said.\nPDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia has issued instructions to provide the best medical care to the injured. He said financial assistance would be provided to the families of the deceased.\nBilawal blames climate change\nPPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari offered condolences for the loss of lives resulting from multiple accidents amid heavy rains across various regions of the country, notably Punjab, KP and Balochistan, APP reported.\nHe urged the provincial governments to deploy all available resources to help the rain-affected victims.\nMr Bhutto-Zardari highlighted the surge in lightning incidents nationwide as indicative of climate change, emphasising the imperative role of universities and research institutions in addressing this issue. He underscored the necessity for exceptional spirit and leadership at the government level to shield citizens from climate change impacts.\nHe stressed that confronting the threats posed by climate change demands substantive action rather than superficial discourse or avoidance.\nSaleem Shahid in Quetta, Behram Baloch in Gwadar and Imran Gabol in Lahore contributed to this report\n"

            "Text": "HARIPUR: With ever rising population rendered homeless following natural disasters or otherwise in the country, the housing projects launched for poor and low income citizens in Haripur remained abandoned as 10 successive governments since 1988 failed to find the utility of its costly land and leftover structures.\nThe then prime minister Mohammad Khan Junejo launched \u2018Apni Basti\u2019 project, also known as, 7-marla scheme in 1987 to build 150,000 housing units for low income and poor citizens. \nHowever, only 35,000 houses could be constructed across the country before the then president Gen Ziaul Haq sent his government packing in May 1988.\nFor the poor of Haripur district, two sites, one each in Kot Najibullah and Pharhala, were selected for the construction of housing units. \nEach unit was supposed to have two rooms, a kitchen and a washroom and an open space in front of each lane of five houses, to be used by the owners as courtyard-cum-street commonly.\n\nScheme for homeless people was launched by Mohammad Khan Junejo in 1987\n\nFor Pharhala Apni Basti site, provincial secretary of physical planning and housing acquired a 150-kanal piece of land to build 140 residential quarters but only 40 units could be constructed.\nFor Kotnajibullah Apni Basti site, provincial government acquired about 100-kanal for a similar number of housing units and 25 were built. However, none of the homeless persons could benefit from both the multimillion projects.\nIt was observed that the scheme had too many flaws, including unrealistic pricing, unsuitable locations and lacking easy availability of basic amenities like water, electricity and gas.\nPoor monitoring and security arrangements eventually led to stealing of door and window frames and bricks. In Kot Najibullah, a couple of units could survive the broad day robbery sprees as being occupied by the tenants of local influential people. \nLikewise in Pahrhala, partial structures of walls and roof are still intact but the miscreants are busy removing bricks of units slowly.\nBy following the deep rooted political culture of abandoning the projects of predecessors, the 10 successive governments failed to complete the scheme although both PPP and PML-N and later PTI launched different housing projects during their tenures yet they ignored the Apni Basti project that requires less investment against the new one.\nAccording to the census 2023, Haripur district alone has 137 individuals, 79 male and 58 female, as homeless. As per census 2017, there are 38,415 homeless people in Pakistan and KP province constitute 11.3 per cent of the total shelter-less population while according to independent statistics shared by Muslim Aid organisation there are 20 million homeless people in the country.\nA site visit to both the sites and review of revenue record show that of the 150-kanal land of abandoned Apni Basti project, the ANP-PPP coalition government had allotted 30-kanal to local journalists for Haripur Media Colony, which is still in limbo since 2012.\nA piece of land of similar size was carved out for Girls Degree College Pharhala that is quite functional right now and the remaining land and open space between the houses is now being used for sowing seasonal crops by local influential people. Interestingly, the legal status of occupation of land is not known.\nThe leftover housing structures are put to disappear without any repair and maintenance or utility.\nLikewise, in Kot Najibullah the same land was used for agriculture purposes but who allotted the land to whom and under what conditions are still enigma even for the officials of revenue department.\n\u201cGive these incomplete units and even the white space to genuinely poor and homeless people on merit basis to save it from the illegal grabbers,\u201d said Niaz Khan, a social activist. He said that the village and neighbourhood council chairmen should be tasked to prepare the lists of homeless people.\n"

He said most were eager to put their songs on their YouTube channels for fans and followers. \n\u201cThere are over 50 music studios in Peshawar alone, all equipped with modern digital facilities. Afghan artists also use these studios for their online Eid releases as music studios in Afghanistan were dismantled after the Taliban took over Kabul in August 2021. Most of them shot outdoor shoots on several attractive locations in KP,\u201d he added. \n\u201cDespite the fact that studio charges range from Rs8,000 to Rs10,000 per new item, several young singers still approach these music facilities for recording their debut songs to attract more audiences on social media,\u201d Rahmat Wali, a studio technician, said.\n"

Literati, intellectuals and research scholars participated in the debate and shared their scholarly views.\nDr Mian Iftikhar Hussain, a noted psychiatrist, in his opening remarks said that PIF had planned since long to bring under discussion \nvarious aspects of Khushal Khan Khattak, especially his social and political contribution, and its monthly debate was dedicated to open deliberation.\nProf Noorul Amin Yousafzai was the keynote speaker while Gul Akbar Khan chaired the event.\nMr Yousafzai said that Khushal Khan Khattak authored Dastarnama when he was put behind bars by Mughal king. Khushal Khan Khattak\u2019s influence on Allama Iqbal\u2019s thoughts was a well-known fact.\nHe said that Khushal Khan Khattak described qualities and arts of a national leader with a stress on farsightedness, high moral strength, confidence and refine aesthetic sense alongside bravery and the spirit to lead the people in the said book.\nQuoting one of his inspirational couplets, he said that Khushal Khan Khattak envisioned that the entire world could be made to live in perfect peace together provided that the spirit of reconciliation and dialogue and mutual trust remained intact.\nLeader should be impeccable, reliable and brave to lead his people by setting his personal example and should instill the spirit of piety, inclusivity and respect for views of others among masses.\nA local folk artist also sang popular numbers of Khushal Khan Khattak that earned applause while selected poems were shared on the occasion.\nThe speeches were followed by an interesting question and answer session in which panelists responded to the queries of participants.\n"

They said the management of DHQ Hospital, which supervises the institution, had also sent SNE (sanctioned new expenditure) regarding the required equipment and staff to the provincial health department in November 2007.\n\nDC promises to take up matter with relevant authorities \n\nThe sources said then provincial health minister Dr Hisham Inamullah Khan during a visit to the district on January 14, 2019, had announced launching classes in the institution soon.\nThe sources said after the health minister\u2019s announcement, the provincial health department had started provision of necessary equipment to the institution to start classes in July 2019.\nBut the sources said the institution, which is to enroll about 50 students annually, couldn\u2019t be opened.\nThe sources said the college was later handed over to the Provincial Health Services Academy (PHSA) in 2020.\nSoon after taking control of the institution, PHSA decided to make the college functional by the end of 2020, and had also recruited essential staff, including the principal and some instructors (teaching staff). But the sources said the college could not be made functional.\nThe sources said the prolonged delay in making the college functional was not only forcing students to get enrolled in nursing colleges of Peshawar, Mardan, Swat, Timergara and other cities, but also damaging the valuable equipment.\nBoth the college building and the adjacent hostel are in bad shape. The hostel is currently in use by the nursing staff of the DHQ Hospital.\nWhen contacted, a senior official of the health department confirmed to Dawn that the nursing college had been lying non-functional since its establishment in 2006.\nThe official wishing not to be unnamed said though the institution had been under the control of PHSA, an autonomous body, since 2020, non-availability of required staff, shortage of essential equipment and lack of interest by the relevant authority were said to be the reasons behind the prolonged delay in its opening.\nMeanwhile, deputy commissioner Mohammad Anwarul Haq said he would take up the matter with the relevant authorities to ensure that it was made functional as soon as possible.\n"

All three have still been exercising aged Child Marriage Restrain Act, 1929,\u201d says Advocate Sharafat A Chaudhry, a legal expert on legislation.\nHe says that fundamental challenges of patriarchal institutional structures, interpretation of religion, poverty, limited access to education and government unwillingness to enforce birth registration are its major reasons.\nThe legal expert says that lawmakers from 2014 to 2023 made efforts to get Child Marriage Constrain Act, 1929, amended or repealed or make it consonant with the prevailing world, even Federal Sharia Court had given a green signal to parliament to go ahead, but no to avail.\nThe National Commission on the Status of Women also made last-ditch efforts in 2023 to get that British-era law amended by National Assembly but it also met with the same past standoff.\nThe NCSW envisions an amended law marriage age for either sex of 18-year and the Nikkak registrar (cleric) can only solemnise wedlock when a bride and bridegroom can produce their Computerised National Identity Cards.\nIt seeks punishment clauses amended to adjudicate child marriage cases only in family courts and enhance simple one-month imprisonment, and a fine of Rs1,000 in the existing ACT to rigorous imprisonment of three years and not shorter than two years and a fine of Rs200,000 for violators.\n"

He said Saraiki people had been protesting the pollution of Indus to try to draw the government\u2019s attention towards the grave matter.  \nSaraiki Qaumi Tehreek chairman Mauz Arain said there was no check on municipal waste being emptied into the mighty Indus, which was a lifeline of Saraiki people. \nKnown painter Ajab Khan (Sitara-i-Imtiaz), Syed Irshad Shah Bukhari, Tahir Shirazi, Abul Muazzam Turabi, Ramish Ali and others said the Indus River was their life and they wanted to keep it clean and free from pollution. \nThey demanded that the drains of Dera city emptying into the river should be diverted away. \nPoets Makhmoor Qalandari and Saeen Asmat Komal raised the spirits of the participants by reciting their pieces during the event.\n"

This marked the formal conclusion of the festival and \u2018prasad\u2019 (sweetmeats) was also distributed among the pilgrims.\nAt the end, the \u2018Palki\u2019 procession was also taken out during which the passion of the Sikh pilgrims reached its crescendo.\nThis year\u2019s festival marks the 325rd anniversary of Khalsa - the pure ones - a moniker for the Sikh brotherhood.\nIt is one of the most significant holidays in the Nanaksahi Sikh calendar, commemorating the establishment of the Khalsa in Anandpur Sahib in 1699 by the 10th Sikh Guru Gobind Singh.\nAccording to reports, around 8,000 Sikhs attended the celebrations. Of these, over 2,400 Sikhs came from India while over 2,000 came from other countries, including the UK, the US, Canada, Australia, and Gulf countries. As many as 2,000 Pakistani Hindus and Sikhs also attended the festival.\nFor the first time, diplomats from European and South East missions participated in the ceremony and witnessed Sikh devotees offering their rituals.\nThe leader of the Indian Sikh contingent, Sardar Kulwant Singh, in his address expressed satisfaction over the arrangements made for the pilgrims. In their speeches, representatives of Sikh groups from different countries lauded the Kartarpur corridor and thanked the government for fulfilling their longstanding demand.\nAmritsar\u2019s Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) party leader Sardar Rawinder Singh told journalists that special love for Pakistanis compelled them to visit the country repeatedly.\n\u201cWe are grateful to the Pakistan government, particularly the Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB), for making arrangements for the protection of gurdwaras in Pakistan,\u201d he added.\nTalking to journalists, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif claimed that the government was committed to providing complete religious freedom to people of all faiths living in the country.\nResponding to a question, he said that the Sikh Marriage Act had been passed in 2018 and would be implemented after the approval of the Punjab cabinet.\nHe said that around six gurdwaras would be opened across the country and handed over to the Sikh community.\nEarlier, speaking at the Bhog ceremony, Khawaja Asif said that the people of Pakistan and the government were proud to host the Sikh pilgrims in their holy land.\nETPB Additional Secretary Rana Shahid said the pilgrims would travel to Nankana Sahib from Hasanabdal today, where they would pay homage at \u2018Sacha Sauda\u2019 (Farooqabad) during their stay.\nThis will be followed by a visit to Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur (Narowal) on April 18, he said, adding that the pilgrimage will continue with a visit to Gurdwara Rori Sahib in Eminabad on April 20. The devotees will leave Pakistan on April 22 following the completion of their 10-day pilgrimage, he added.\nNational Rahmatul-lil-Alameen Authority Chairman Khurshid Ahmad Nadeem and its director general, Zaffar Mehmood Malik, also participated in the Bhog ceremony.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: Though the Capital Development Authority (CDA) has spent billions of rupees on road projects in the recent past, three main intersections which have been a constant source of traffic jams still await the attention of the civic agency.\nThe residents face traffic congestion at three points - Serena Chowk, Shaheen Chowk and PTCL Chowk - which is the intersection of 9th Avenue and Jinnah Avenue. Last year, the CDA was all set to start the construction work of Serena Interchange \u2013 where Srinagar Highway, Khayaban-i-Suharwardi, Attaturk Avenue and Club Road converge.\nThe project was supposed to be inaugurated by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in August last year (during his first tenure) and tenders were also approved.\nHowever, the prime minister after reaching the inauguration site refused to inaugurate the project when he was informed that Railcop had won the contract. Railcop is a government-owned company and a subsidiary of Pakistan Railways.\n\nOfficial says civic agency focused on completing ongoing projects\n\nWhile leaving the inauguration ceremony, he had said that Railcop had no experience in the construction of interchanges and underpasses and sought a detailed presentation from the CDA on the tendering process.\nHowever, the government\u2019s tenure ended before the presentation was held and the bid validity period also lapsed. Subsequently, the CDA shelved this project.\nIn July last year, in response to a tender by the CDA, Railcop turned out to be the lowest bidder. It had a bid of Rs2.1 billion against NLC\u2019s bid of Rs3.5 billion.\nUnder the said project, the Srinagar Highway from 7th Avenue Interchange to Serena Chowk was also slated to be widened with two additional lanes. Furthermore, a portion of the highway from the junction to Murree Road would have been overhauled as well, which would have taken six months to complete.\nLike the said project, the tendering process of Shaheen Chowk on Faisal Avenue was also completed last year and three construction firms took part in the process. After technical bids, the financial bids were however not opened.\nThe CDA also completed the environmental impact assessment of the project and a public hearing was also conducted. But, the fate of this project still hangs in balance.\nSimilarly, PTCL Chowk is also a troubling point for motorists. During peak hours, commuters face prolonged traffic signals. Officials told Dawn that the civic agency had announced to take up this project multiple times but even its PC-I was not prepared.\n\u201cWe have resolved the traffic mess in the city except for these three areas. Once these three projects are completed, the issue of traffic congestion in the city will be resolved,\u201d said a CDA deputy director.\nThe official said these projects were not on the priority list of the CDA management due to funding issues and the agency was focused on the completion of the ongoing projects.\n\u201cWe do agree that these three projects are important. The PC-I of two of them are already okayed while the PC-I of the PTCL Chowk will also be prepared soon,\u201d said a CDA official.\nThe official said the civic body would take steps to move forward soon but at present it was focused on finishing the ongoing projects, such as the multi-billion expressway widening project.\n"

They said the government should ensure implementation of the new prices.\nHowever, most of the people said there was no chance of getting the new rates implemented as traders ignored prices of edibles like milk, curd and meat fixed by the government. \nThe district administration had issued a price list of edibles on March 9 before the start of Ramazan, but the price magistrates failed to implement it giving shopkeepers a free hand to overcharge consumers. \nAccording the official list, the price of milk was Rs170 to Rs190 per litre for low fat and high fat, respectively, but in the market it was being sold at Rs220 per litre. The price of curd was fixed at Rs200 but it was selling at Rs230 per kg.\nSimilarly, the price of mutton was fixed at Rs1,600 per kg but it was available at Rs2,200 to Rs2,300 per kg while beef rate was fixed at Rs800 per kg and it was being sold at Rs1,150 to Rs1,200 per kg.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: In order to ensure smooth flow of traffic on a portion of Murree Road from Lake View Park to Kashmir Chowk, Islamabad Traffic Police (ITP) have started diverting traffic to the opposite side. \nAccording to the ITP, this experiment has helped in ensuring smooth flow of traffic. \n\u201cFor the last three days, in the evening we are diverting traffic to the opposite side to use one lane,\u201d Inspector Tanveer Khan of ITP, who was performing duty at the site, told Dawn.\nHe said after Eid extra traffic was entering Islamabad, therefore, one lane of the opposite side (which leads towards Murree) was being used for Islamabad-bound traffic. Near the entrance to the Lake View Park, the ITP officials after blocking the road heading towards Islamabad have diverted the traffic to the road on the opposite side leading towards Murree on which there is now thin traffic.\n\nOfficial says Islamabad-bound traffic is diverted to road on opposite side from Lake View Park to Kashmir Chowk\n\nSimilarly, a portion of Murree Road heading towards the hill resort is also closed for diversion and traffic is moved towards the road which passes from the rear of Convention Centre where after taking a U-turn it move towards Murree on a single lane up to Lake View Chowk. It was noticed that there was no smooth flow of traffic but at least it continued at a slow pace.\nMeanwhile, Serena Chowk is blocked for entering Khyaban-i-Suharwardi as New Zealand\u2019s cricket team is staying in the hotel, causing traffic mess at the signal. However, Srinagar Highway is opened.\nEvery year during Eid holidays, thousands of people throng Lake View Park, causing traffic jams. After the holidays when people return from Kashmir and Murree, the said portion of the road faces congestion. \nEarlier, motorists had to face the same situation in Bhara Kahu area, however, after construction of the bypass road the issue has been resolved as traffic to and from Murree and Kashmir uses the bypass road smoothly. \nThe portion of Murree Road from Kashmir Chowk to short of Lake View Park is congested compared to other portion of the main road. On both sides of the road, there is vast vacant area and the road could be widened easily to avoid gridlocks on Eid and other holidays when a large number of people visit Lake View Park.\n"

After this, repair work on the metro track from Faizabad to Pakistan Secretariat in Islamabad will start.\nA senior official of the RDA told Dawn that the bidding will be held next week and work on the project will start by the end of April and was likely be completed within 10 months.\nHe said Nespak had completed a survey and recommended that the track was in dire need of repair nine years after its construction.\n\nElevated road from Saddar to Faizabad will be repaired in first phase, says official\n\nHe said the Punjab Mass Transit Authority had asked the RDA to carry out the repair work as it had completed the project in 2015, adding the RDA would get funds from the Punjab government. He said in the initial phase, the elevated road from Saddar to Faizabad will be repaired.\nPunjab Mass Transit Authority General Manager (Operations) Uzair Shah told Dawn that heavy rains in the last two years had damaged the roads of the metro bus service in Rawalpindi and Islamabad that required repair.\nHe said they wanted to repair the tough tiles on the pavements and it had been decided to change them with concrete pavements. Potholes that have developed on the corridors of the bus stations would also be repaired.\nHe also said the repair work would be held in three phases, and RDA had been asked to select the areas.\nThe track would not be closed for repair and the operation of the buses would continue on the construction site.\nThe total length of the metro bus corridor is 23 km, including 8.6 km elevated, 10 km at grade and a four km trench.\nThe portion of metro bus service in Rawalpindi from Flashman\u2019s Hotel to Faizabad has a distance of 8.6 km and is elevated while in Islamabad, the 14.6 km is on ground, starting from Faizabad to Pak Secretariat via IJP Road and 9th Avenue.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: Despite the nation\u2019s rich mountaineering legacy, it has yet to claim a climber who has conquered all 14 of the highest peaks in the world. \nHowever, this narrative might soon undergo a significant shift with climbers like Sajid Sadpara leading the charge, said Alpine Club of Pakistan (ACP).\nRenowned for its formidable peaks, including five of the world\u2019s towering 8,000 metres mountains, Pakistan stands on the cusp of mountaineering history, said ACP secretary Karrar Haidri.\nSajid Sadpara, son of the late legendary climber Mohammad Ali Sadpara, was currently embarking on a monumental journey towards the 8,586 metres tall Kangchenjunga in Nepal and the third highest peak in the world. Should he succeed, it would mark his ninth conquest of an 8,000 metres peak. \nACP said what set Sajid Sadpara apart was his remarkable feat of scaling these peaks without the aid of supplementary oxygen, a feat he accomplished even on Mt Everest last year. Once again, Sajid Sadpara would brave the unforgiving heights as part of the rope-fixing team, eschewing bottled oxygen and personal sherpa support.\n\nACP says Sajid Sadpara currently on conquest of third highest peak\n\nFollowing Kangchenjunga, Sajid Sadpara\u2019s odyssey continued with four more mountains on his agenda the 8,516 metres Lhotse (4th highest in the world), 8,485 metres Makalu (5th highest) and the formidable Tibetan giants 8,188 metres Cho Oyu (6th highest) and Shisha Pangma 8,027 metres, 14th highest peak in the world.\nMeanwhile, two other Pakistani climbers, Sirbaz Khan and Shehroze Kashif, also had their sights set on Shisha Pangma, aiming to etch their names in mountaineering lore by completing their 14\u00d78,000m quest on the Tibetan giant.\nACP pointed out that Sirbaz Khan, known for his indomitable spirit and swift ascent, often collaborated with Mingma G\u2019s Imagine Nepal team. With 10 of his 138,000-metre summits conquered without supplementary oxygen. Khan\u2019s prowess on the mountains has earned him accolades from the mountaineering community.\nOn the other hand, Shehroze Kashif, one of the youngest faces in the high-altitude climbing scene, has been supported by Seven Summit Treks throughout his mountaineering endeavours. Having shattered age records with his ascent of Broad Peak at the age of 17, Shehroze Kashif continued to make waves in the mountaineering world.\nAmong Pakistani women, Naila Kiani has been a beacon of inspiration, achieving her 10th 8,000 metres summit by conquering Cho Oyu last fall. Despite her ambitious plans to tackle Shisha Pangma, avalanches halted her journey, underscoring the unpredictable and perilous nature of high-altitude mountaineering.\nAs the mountaineering community eagerly awaited their next moves, Naila Kiani, in particular, aimed to foster a culture of athleticism among Pakistani women, hoping to ignite a passion for sports and adventure in the younger generation.\nMr Haidri said that in a nation where only one per cent of women participated in sports, Naila Kiani\u2019s achievements served as a testament to the boundless potential of Pakistani mountaineers, inspiring future generations to reach new heights both on and off the mountains.\n"

The finance minister also highlighted this issue during his engagements in Washington.\nAmbassador Usman Jadoon, Pakistan\u2019s Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations, expressed during a UN meeting on Wednesday, \u201cYet, we were deeply disappointed to discover that we were neither eligible for the IMF \u2018food shock window\u2019, nor its Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT).\u201d\nMr Jadoon underscored Pakistan\u2019s expectation of automatic inclusion in any mechanism established for international support, considering the country\u2019s significant challenges posed by the changing climate.\nDuring his discussions in Washington to attend the IMF and the World Bank spring meetings, the finance minister highlighted the government\u2019s measures to strengthen the economy. \nRupee  devaluation\nIn an interview with the Bloomberg news agency on Thursday, he clarified that a new IMF deal would not lead to rapid rupee devaluation.\nHe added that there would be no reason for the rupee to depreciate more than the range of about 6pc to 8pc in a typical year. Pakistan last devalued its currency in January 2023.\nThe minister said that while massive devaluations had accompanied some previous IMF loans and are often a condition of the lender\u2019s programme, nothing comparable should be necessary this time.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see the need for any step change,\u201d Aurangzeb said, citing solid foreign exchange reserves, a stable currency, rising remittances and steady exports. \u201cThe only thing which can be a wild card, although in our projections we should be okay, is the oil price,\u201d he said.\nHe said the government was looking to bolster industries, including agriculture and information technology, hoping it would help push the nation\u2019s growth above 4pc in the coming years.\nThe Bloomberg report pointed out that Pakistan faced about $24bn in external financing needs in the fiscal year starting July. The finance minister, however, said Pakistan was in a \u201crelatively good shape\u201d to make those payments.\nHe further said that Pakistan expected an IMF mission to visit in May and would like to reach a staff-level agreement on the next loan by the end of June or early July, without specifying how much the country was seeking.\nEarlier, the minister also met with US State Department officials Donald Lu and Elizabeth Horst, during which the latter reaffirmed Washington\u2019s commitment to bolstering ties between the two countries.\nA statement issued by the finance ministry early on Wednesday said  Assistant Secretary  Lu, and Deputy Assistant Secretary for Pakistan Horst met the finance minister at the WB headquarters in the US capital, \u201creaffirming Washington\u2019s commitment to bolster Pak-US ties\u201d.\nThe ministry said that the meeting focused on upgrading economic partnerships, with an emphasis on alternative energy, agriculture, climate resilience and the tech industry.\nAurangzeb briefed the US diplomats on Pakistan\u2019s reform agenda, which includes broadening the tax base, streamlining the energy sector and privatisation.\n\u201cIdentified American investment opportunities in information technology, renewables, agriculture and minerals extraction. Pakistan pledges close collaboration with US International Development Finance Corporation & Exim Bank for mutual development,\u201d the finance ministry said.\nEarlier, the finance minister also met the WB-IMF Pakistan Staff Association and briefed them about the country\u2019s reform agenda.\n"

However, it closed at 70,290.12 points after shedding another 43.20 points, or 0.06pc from the preceding session.\nThe overall trading volume slightly eased by 0.40pc to 440.31 million shares. However, the traded value surged by 51.93pc to Rs24.36bn on a day-on-day basis.\nStocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included Cnergyico PK Ltd (33.24m shares), K-Electric (29.87m shares), Pak Refinery (28.44m shares), PTCL (24.39m shares) and Worldcall Telecom (23.69m shares).\nThe shares registering the most significant decre\u00adases in their share prices in absolute terms were Nestle Pakistan (Rs52.50), Hoechst Pakistan (Rs50.00), Shahmurad Sugar Mills Ltd (Rs22.59), Lucky Cement (Rs12.38) and Mari Petroleum Company Ltd (Rs11.37).\nThe companies registering the major increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Rafhan Maize Products Company Ltd (Rs81.10), Hallmark Company Ltd (Rs52.00), Sazgar Engineering Works Ltd (Rs29.17), Premium Textile Mills Ltd (Rs23.00) and National Refinery Ltd (Rs16.57).\nThe market witnessed aggressive buying from foreign investors as their net buying of shares swelled to $23.3m.\n"

            "Text": " \n\nHafiz Naeemur Rehman\n\nKARACHI: It was early 2021, and a sizable crowd had gathered at one of the city\u2019s busiest commercial centres for the opening of a pharmacy set up by Jamaat-i-Islami\u2019s welfare arm \u2014 Al-Khidmat. They were eagerly waiting for the party leader who would grace the inauguration.\nA car soon stopped near the gathered crowd, and JI\u2019s Karachi chapter emir, Hafiz Naeemur Rehman, stepped out. Catching their first glim\u00adpse, the crowd encircled him; some were enthusiastically shaking his hands and others took out their phones to click selfies with the JI leader.\nThe fervent salutations took so long that the organisers had to announce that the ceremony had been delayed a little \u201cdue to unavoidable reasons\u201d.\nAmong the crowd were also many journalists, one of whom noted that Mr Rehman is \u201ccreating [an] impact\u201d and said it wouldn\u2019t surprise him if JI managed to dent other parties\u2019 vote bank in upcoming elections in Karachi.\nThe prediction did hold some truth; in the three elections that followed, Mr Rehman\u2019s popularity helped the party stage a strong comeback in the city, where it had been effectively wiped out in the 2018 elections.\nIn the Feb 8 general election, the party\u2019s vote bank increased by 177 per cent, from 280,000 in 2018 to 775,000 in 2023, according to ECP data. Many attribute this jump in popularity to Mr Rehman\u2019s active leadership.\nOath-taking\nOn Thursday, Mr Rehman, 52, took oath as the sixth emir of the JI at a jam-packed ceremo\u00adny at the party\u2019s Mansoora headquarters.\nAfter taking the oath, Mr Rehman laid out his agenda in an elaborate address, touching on all issues confronting Pakistan i.e. a democratic deficit, sinking economy, recent elections, questions over the role of the judiciary and army, etc.\n\u201cThe JI does not recognise those imposed on us through Form-47s and the party must prepare for a movement to correct this electoral mistake. We also do not acknowledge all those parties running as dynastic and family concerns or drawing legitimacy from a \u2018will\u2019. All those seeded in establishment\u2019s nursery also fall in the same category,\u201d he said.\nBut for a party known for its more measured orators, Mr Rehman adopted a more populist approach, winning over the crowd with his rhetoric. By the end, he was so overcome with emotion that he seemed to be blinking back tears.\nVocal populist\nA graduate of Karachi\u2019s NED University of Engine\u00adering and Technology, Mr Rehman led the party in Karachi for a decade.\nObservers see him as both an unconventional choice to lead the right-wing party, as well as a leader who would help JI \u201creconnect with the ground realities and requirements of electoral politics.\u201d\nMr Rehman is known for his populist approach and vocal leadership.\n\u201cThere was a huge vacuum in Karachi\u2019s politics with no party \u2014 even those with a mandate from the city \u2014 becoming a voice of the locals,\u201d said Kashif Hafeez of Pulse Consultants, a nationwide social research organisation with studies on several issues of Karachi.\nHe added that  the vacuum presented Mr Naeem with a chance and he became \u201cthe only voice\u201d raising the issues faced by Karachi\u2019s residents.\nA daunting task\nSince Mr Rehman\u2019s appoi\u00adntment as the JI central emir earlier this month, there has been only one question on people\u2019s minds. Can he replicate his success in Karachi at the national level?\nWhen Dawn posed the same question to the JI leader after his appointment as the emir, he gave a brief answer where he emphasised giving hope to the masses.\n\u201cThe youth of Pakistan is so disappointed; we haven\u2019t witnessed such pessimism before. We are here only to give them hope.\u201d\nWhen asked about the solution to multiple crises faced by the country, he said, \u201cI think that everyone, whether institution or individual, would have to go back to their constitutional domain. That\u2019s it.\u201d\nFor observers who have closely watched JI\u2019s politics over the years, the new role would be an uphill challenge for Mr Rehman.\n\u201cIt would be a great challenge [for Mr Rehman],\u201d said senior journalist Mazhar Abbas, adding that he has only seen the politics of Karachi. \u201cIt\u2019s yet to be seen how he makes moves in KP or Balochistan or Punjab.\u201d\nAhmad Fraz Khan in Lahore also contributed to this report\n"

However, it couldn\u2019t find evidence of involvement of the officials in pushing the woman to death, Dawn has learnt.\n\u201cIt is a finding of the preliminary inquiry conducted by the SP (Railways, Karachi division). A detailed inquiry is also underway, as a team headed by the DIG (South) is about to complete it in a day or two,\u201d Pakistan Railways Police Inspector General Dr Rao Sardar Ahmad told Dawn on Thursday.\n\u201cIt is true that no one from police, train staff or passengers pushed the woman (Maryam Bibi) to death,\u201d the IG claimed, admitting that the constable should have shown restrain instead of beating the woman, who was mentally challenged as shown in the viral videos, and the children accompanying her.\nAccording to a report, on April 10, a video went viral on social media, showing a railways constable beating and mistreating a woman. Report mentions that as per the daily diary reports of Railway Police Station Karachi Cantt and RPS Hyderabad, Constable Meer Hassan and Head Constable Muzaffar Ali were assigned duty on the Millat Express on April 7. After performance of their duty, they arrived at RPS Hyderabad at 7:25pm.\n\nPolice write to home dept for arrest of constable\n\nIn his statement, Constable Muzaffar said he was unaware of the beating of the woman by his colleague.\nHowever, he said, Constable Hassan had informed him about a woman who was allegedly being disruptive, spitting on others, and causing disturbance on the train.\nMuzaffar informed SHO Ghulam Hussain Brohi of RPS Hyderabad about the situation via telephone and requested assistance from a woman constable as the train was near the Hyderabad Railway Station.\nHe said ASI Tanveer Ahmed boarded the train in Hyderabad to address the situation.\nIn his statement, ASI Tanveer said he saw the woman sitting calmly with children and he found no complaints from surrounding passengers while he was not informed by anyone about the woman being beaten by a policeman. He talked to the woman and advised her to continue her journey peacefully, to which she agreed and he allowed her to proceed.\nThe statement of an eyewitness passenger, Imran, was also recorded. The report termed two police officers, ASI Tanveer and SHO Ghulam Hussain Brohi, responsible for serious negligence as they did not take required action.\nBAHAWALPUR: The district police has approached the Punjab home department for the arrest of railways constable Meer Hassan, against whom Channigoth police in Bahawalpur district had on Wednesday registered a first information report under section 302 and other offences.\nThe police spokesman told Dawn that DPO Asad Sarfraz has sent a letter to the home secretary to seek government permission and send a team to Hyderabad, Sindh. This, he argued, was necessary as the nominated police constable was stationed in Hyderabad.\nThe spokesman added that as soon as the permission was granted by the provincial home department, a police team could be dispatched to Hyderabad for his arrest.\nIt merits mentioning that complainant Muhammad Afzal in his FIR had accused constable Meer Hassan of pushing his sister Maryam Bibi out of the moving train.\n"

The cause of her death remains unknown.\nUniversity students took to social media, alleging that the deceased student, along with several others, had to take the examination in the campus corridor due to a lack of classrooms.\nThey claimed to have requested water during the examination, but their pleas went unanswered.\nA spokesperson for WUM attributed the lack of classrooms or examination halls to insufficient funds. She refuted allegations that the student\u2019s death was due to a lack of water, stating that filtration plants were installed on the campus.\nThe spokesperson explained that the university had to accommodate approximately 6,500 students, necessitating the use of corridors for examinations.\nShe further noted that the Mattital campus of the university remained incomplete, with only the administration block constructed so far, while the Kutchery Road campus was currently accommodating more than 4,000 students.\n"

            "Text": "LAHORE: In response to the pressing need for accessible and high-quality emergency healthcare for children in Pakistan, an organisation has introduced an innovative telemedicine network in district and tehsil hospitals of Punjab, providing critical consultations to children in remote areas.\nThe initiative aims to address the alarming child mortality rates in the country, with 1,000 children losing their lives daily due to various illnesses.\nThe experts say with two-thirds of Pakistan\u2019s population residing in rural areas, many families face significant challenges in accessing specialised medical care for their children.\nThey say financial constraints, logistical difficulties, and the sheer distance to major cities often deter families from seeking timely medical attention.\nOn average, families must spend Rs50,000 to travel to tertiary care hospitals in major cities, worsening the burden on already vulnerable households.\nRecognising these challenges, the ChildLife Foundation has pioneered a provider-to-provider telemedicine model, deploying high-definition cameras, IP phones, and registered nurses at telemedicine sites across Punjab.\nThrough this innovative approach, children in remote areas receive consultations from FCPS Peads emergency specialists stationed at the control room in Lahore.\nIn 60 per cent of cases, these consultations result in value-added interventions, including training for on-ground government doctors on the latest medical protocols and interventions.\n\u201cThis telemedicine initiative is a game-changer for children in remote areas who previously lacked access to timely and quality emergency care,\u201d stated Dr. Ahson Rabbani, CEO at ChildLife Foundation. \u201cBy leveraging technology, we are bringing critical medical expertise directly to the doorstep of those who need it most, saving lives and alleviating the burden on families,\u201d he said.\nIn Punjab alone, 90 telemedicine sites are currently operational, providing consultations to children with critical illnesses. Additionally, ChildLife Foundation manages 13 children\u2019s emergency rooms under public-private partnerships with the government, spanning across Sindh, Balochistan, Islamabad, and Mayo Hospital and Children\u2019s Hospital in Lahore and Multan, respectively. These emergency rooms are equipped with state-of-the-art infrastructure, latest life-saving equipment, and a fully stocked pharmacy with a 45-day supply of essential medicines.\nHe said the holistic approach of the organisation is encompassing a scalable and cost-effective model operating in 313 hospitals nationwide in partnership with the government. With emergency rooms in tertiary care hospitals and Telemedicine Satellite Centres in secondary care hospitals, the foundation aims to provide free-of-cost treatment to two million children this year, ensuring that every child has access to life-saving medical care, regardless of their geographic location or financial circumstances.\n"

The two countries, however, routinely face off in International Cricket Council (ICC) events. \n\u201cI totally believe that they are a good team, superb bowling line-up, good contest, if we play overseas,\u201d Sharma said on Club Prairie Fire, a Youtube show hosted by former Australian keeper-batter Adam Gilchrist and former England skipper Michael Vaughan. \u201cThe last Test was played way back in 2007-08. \n\u201cYeah, I would love to, it would be a great contest between two sides. We play them in ICC trophies, pure cricket I am looking at, great contest, so why not?\u201d, he said when asked whether Indo-Pak Tests were possible at a neutral venue like England or Australia.\nLed by Shaheen Shah Afridi, Pakistan\u2019s traditionally pace-reliant bowling line-up currently features exciting talents like Naseem Shah, who is only 21, and Aamer Jamal.\nThe Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has maintained that any decision on bilateral cricket with Pakistan will hinge on approval from the Indian government, which has so far not permitted cricketing engagement with the arch-foes.\nPakistan, on the other hand, has been aggressively pushing for bilateral engagement with India, even taking it up at ICC forums at every available opportunity.\nLast year, India refused to travel to Pakistan for the Asia Cup, which was eventually conducted in a hybrid model. All of India\u2019s scheduled games in Pakistan were relocated to Sri Lanka.\nThe next year\u2019s Champions Trophy will be another bone of contention between the two countries as the tournament is set to be held in Pakistan, which has declared that it won\u2019t agree to any change of venue to accommodate India.\nThe ICC, on its part, has stated that it won\u2019t force any member nation to disregard government advisory. \n\u201c\u2026 ICC Board\u2019s position remains that it doesn\u2019t expect its members to go against any policy/instructions issued by its own government,\u201d an ICC official had stated recently.\n"

And that was that.\nThe opening Twenty20 of the series between Pakistan and New Zealand was washed out due to rain here at the Pindi Stadium on Thursday, the game ending almost as soon as it began after after a nearly three-hour delay, and after it had been reduced to a five-over match.\nThe fans, who braved the incessant downpour, did get something to cheer about though; the moment coming when Shaheen showing a return to his former self by sending back Robinson with a ball that swung back late as the right-hander attempted to swat away Pakistan\u2019s pace spearhead.\nThe rain had delayed the toss by 30 minutes, and after it eventually took place with New Zealand captain Michael Bracewell opting to bat first, the downpour returned just when Shaheen took his mark to bowl the first ball.\nIt kept pouring down for the next hour and a half and just at the cut-off time, the umpires decided that it would be a five-over affair. However, all that could ensue on the pitch was Shaheen\u2019s moment of brilliance.\nEarlier, Pakistan, with Babar Azam returning as captain, had awarded international caps to batters Usman Khan and Irfan Khan Niazi, while Mohammad Amir \u2014 who had rescinded his retirement last month \u2014 was also to play his first match for the side after nearly four years. \nThe team selection suggested Pakistan were aiming to test their bench strength with the series being the start of their build-up to the T20 World Cup, which is set to be held in the United States and the West Indies in June.\nAccording to the line-up, Babar was to open the batting with explosive sensation Saim Ayub, while the former\u2019s long-time opening partner Mohammad Rizwan was pushed down to number three.\nUsman\u2019s inclusion meant experienced batter Fakhar Zaman was also left out. Imad Wasim, who had also called his retirement off along with Amir, also was not included.\nPakistan may have named wicket-keeper Azam Khan in the eleven, but the pinch-hitter was left out due to an injury.\nAccording to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), Azam experienced discomfort in his right knee and calf muscle while batting in the nets during a training session on the eve of the match.\nThe PCB said the right-hander promptly received medical attention and treatment. Azam, 25, is currently under the care of the medical team, and a decision regarding his participation in the upcoming T20 matches against New Zealand will be made pending the results of radiology reports, the board added.\nThe next two matches will be played at the same venue on Saturday and Sunday, before the series moves to Lahore for the last two games. The series will be followed by Pakistan\u2019s tour to Ireland and England for T20Is, before the side travels to Dallas for their first World Cup game.\n"

It was her fifth career century and she brought up her hundred in 125 balls. She had earlier taken 57 balls to post fifty.\nHayley put on 102 runs for the second wicket with Shemaine Campbelle \u2014 who added 45 off 71 with the help of four boundaries \u2014 after experienced Pakistan spinner Sadia Iqbal had dismissed Rashada Williams in the third over of the innings. \nAfter the West Indies slipped from 103-1 to 138-4, Hayley added 40 runs for the fifth wicket with Chinelle Henry (run-a-ball 23).\nHayley\u2019s brilliance, coupled with Pakistan\u2019s lapses in the field, allowed the West Indies to collect 77 runs in the last 10 overs, including 49 runs off the last 30 balls  \nIn their turn at the wicket, Pakistan were left chasing the game from the very start when they plummeted to 65-4, which soon became 100-6 before they were eventually dismissed for 156, thanks to a 23-ball 25 by Tuba Hassan.\nFrom the top order, only opener Muneeba Ali (22 off 33) and captain Nida Dar (19 off 27) offered some resistance against all the accurate West Indies bowlers. \nApart from Matthews, Afy Fisher and Zaida James picked up two wickets apiece, conceding 14 and 19 runs, respectively.\n\u201cOur bowling was disappointing and the fielding was full of lapses,\u201d rued Nida after the match. \u201cWe have to take catches and we have to take the opportunities for run outs. \n\u201cWe leaked too many runs in the last 10 overs and they went to 270. If we restricted them to 220 it would have been different.\u201d \nNida was full of praise for the effort Pakistan put with the ball and hoped the team would bounce back stronger in the next match, which is set to be held on Saturday.\n\u201cSadia, Diana [Baig] and Tuba bowled well,\u201d she said. \u201cWe did good things but we need to work on improving over our mistakes. We have to take responsibility; everyone is aware about their roles. I am very hopeful that we will bounce back.\u201d.\nScores in brief: \nWEST INDIES 269-8 in 50 overs (Hayley Matthews 140 not out, Shemaine Campbelle 45, Chinelle Henry 23; Sadiq Iqbal 2-38, Tuba Hassan 2-48); PAKISTAN 156 in 35.5 overs (Tuba Hassan 25, Muneeba Ali 22, Najiha Alvi 20; Hayley Matthews 3-17, Zaida James 2-14, Afy Fisher 2-19).\n"

            "Text": "HYDERABAD: Sindh Chief Secretary Syed Asif Hyder Shah has conceded before the Sindh High Court that the timelines for the implementation of Supreme Court-appointed water commission could not be met. He also conceded that were still 769 points from where different departments had been releasing waste into freshwater bodies.\nThe one-man commission headed by retired Justice Amir Hani Muslim had inspected most freshwater bodies and sewerage installations in Sindh in 2018 before recommending a series of measures to ensure provision of clean drinking water to citizens and improving sanitation across the province. The Sindh High Court has already held many proceedings since the Supreme Court directed it to see that the commission\u2019s recommendation were implemented. \nThe latest proceedings were held in continuation of the hearing of a petition filed by Aftab Ahmed, Noor Ahmed and Ali Akbar, residents of Johi, through Advocate Gulzar Almani in 2021. CS Asif Shah, along with Sindh Advocate General Mohammad Hassan Akbar personally appeared before the bench comprising Justice Shamsuddin Abbasi and Justice Amjad Ali Sahito.\nWhile admitting that most recommendations of the water commission could not be implemented for various reasons, the chief secretary argued that they were \u201csuggestive\u201d and \u201cguiding principles\u201d in nature. \nHe informed the bench that 31 proposals were short-term and the others medium- and long-term ones. Seventeen of them have been or are being implemented,\u201d he added.\nThe judges heard him patiently, and observed that they trusted him for his track record, otherwise they were fed-up hearing departmental heads. \u201cIf we refer their [officers\u2019] cases to anticorruption [establishment], it will give them clean chit while NAB won\u2019t do anything either,\u201d Justice Sahito remarked.\nCS Asif admitted: \u201cIndeed, substantive compliance is not seen on some proposals and timeline was missed for resource constraints, etc.\u201d \nGiving a break-up of the works carried out under the commission\u2019s directives, he said that out of 493 public health engineering (PHE) schemes, 273 were rehabilitated and 220 were pending rehab but the department had promised to complete them by June 2025. He said 46 schemes would be taken-up in Phase-III if found technically feasible.\nHe said PHE had been instructed to include \u2018oxidation pond\u2019 component in schemes from now onwards. In 77 works, oxidation ponds were built and land acquisition is pending in remaining ones. He added that 837 water supply schemes pertained to hypochlorinator and alum chambers processes in water supply works. He admitted that progress was not made on 600 schemes as yet.\nReading from his report, he stated that following the commission\u2019s report, a survey was conducted and it was found that actually 769 points, and not 180, existed where untreated sewage was disposed of into irrigation channels. \n\u201c[A total of] 428 such points are plugged and work on 341 points is underway as land acquisition [issue] is involved again,\u201d he said, and added that the 769 points belonging to different departments were releasing waste into freshwater.\nIncinerators at health facilities\nRegarding the commission\u2019s recommendations for health sector, the chief secretary said that the incinerators at these facilities were not working due to the design issue and absence of gas supply. \n\u201cIn 70pc cases, gas supply is not there. The health secretary has sought one month\u2019s time to make them functional at 35-40 hospitals,\u201d he said, adding that the department was trying to provide incinerators to major hospitals to implement a strategy. He said provision of 16 incinerators to district headquarters hospitals and 50 to taluka headquarters hospitals was envisaged under the annual development programme (ADP).\nReferring to the commission\u2019s observation that around 4,000 schools needed safe water supply, the CS revealed that actually they were around 5,000 in number. He said the project would take two years to resolve the issue. \nManchhar Lake water\nAbout Manchhar Lake water issue, the chief secretary noted that the commission had called for feeding the lake through two irrigation escape channels \u2014 Maado and Rawat \u2014 and said this project was under way.\nAt this juncture, Justice Sahito asked him to explain what action was taken against the chief engineer of the Right Bank of Sukkur Barrage for not emptying the lake in 2022, when floodwaters from Balochistan came and resultantly Khairpur Nathan Shah, Mahar and Johi were inundated. \nThe CS invited the irrigation secretary, Zarif Khero, to assist court. Khero tried to explain that release of Manchhar\u2019s flows always depended on flows in Indus. He said Manchhar was indeed emptied but in a controlled manner considering Indus flows.\nJustice Sahito said Rs300m were collected during the floods but its utilisation eluded people. Khero succinctly said that works were indeed carried out and even lake\u2019s bunds were breached to offload it, and added that soil salinity also added to the contamination of the lake\u2019s water. \n\u201cManchhar Lake was not washed despite available flows rather it was an \u2018eyewash\u2019 for Sindh,\u201d Justice Sahito said as Justice Abbasi came up with observation that \u201cthere is massive corruption in irrigation department\u201d. Justice Abbasi said \u201cif matter of corruption is referred to NAB it would not deliver\u201d.\nPetitioners\u2019 counsel Gulzar Almani termed the chief secretary\u2019s report \u201ctotally baseless\u201d, and urged court to get the works inspected through sessions and civil court judges. \u201cEverything will become crystal clear,\u201d he told the bench. \nThe court took the chief secretary\u2019s report on record before adjourning the matter to a date to be fixed after three months.\n"

            "Text": "\u2022 Power minister vows decisive action against complicit staff, officers\n\u2022 Hints at reviewing power rates for solar, industrial consumers to stimulate demand\nISLAMABAD: Conce\u00adding regular overbilling by distribution companies and the power division\u2019s total ignorance about the extent of defective meters, Power Minister Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari on Thursday hinted at reviewing electricity rates for solar, industrial and tribal region consumers to revive plunging electricity demand and counter rising capacity payments.\nSpeaking at a news conference, Mr Leghari also alleged that not only electricity thieves but also the officers and staff of his ministry and subsidiaries were causing around Rs560 billion annual loss. He vowed to end this menace that was becoming unaffordable to the nation and causing irreparable harm to the economy.\nThe minister said the distribution companies were losing Rs200bn on account of electricity units they bill but cannot recover, while another Rs360bn worth of units were lost to theft facilitated by \u201cour officers and staff\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable,\u201d he said.\nHe said the government would act against all those in whose jurisdiction such losses and theft were found. \u201cThe government would not be bowed down by protests. This is essential service\u201d and 20pc staff and officers were involved in facilitating those losses at the cost of common consumers, he said.\nHe said the government was being blackmailed that fresh inductions could not be made to replace corrupt officials. \u201cThere\u2019s no dearth of fresh engineers who have the relevant qualifications and can be trained to take over assignments,\u201d he stressed.\nMr Leghari said the Discos staff from superintending engineers (SEs), executive engineers (XENs), sub-divisional engineers (SDOs) to linemen and meter-readers had time until April 23 to survey their respective areas and jurisdictions and remove kundas (illegal electricity connection). If they failed to do so, the government would send special teams and FIA officials to act against the staff.\nHe deplored that his ministry did not know how many meters were faulty. He said that on his inquiry, the power division reported that only 100,000 meters were defective in Discos\u2019 jurisdiction. He said when he pushed if all other meters across the country were working fine, \u201cwe don\u2019t know\u201d was the answer.\nMassive overbilling\nThe minister also conceded that overbilling worth \u201ccrores of rupees\u201d was taking place in the Discos every month, not only in the domestic sector but also in other areas. He said massive overbilling was also going on in the agriculture sector, where people had shifted their tube-wells to solar power and transformers were lying idle, but millions of rupees worth of bills were being issued to them.\nMr Leghari\u2019s position contrasts with the line taken earlier by the power division before he took over as federal minister. Last year, the power regulator Nepra accused the electricity distribution companies of massive overbilling after a detailed investigation.\nThe power division and its attached companies denied Nepra\u2019s allegations. The division then formed its own \u201cindependent inquiry team\u201d, which also confirmed Nepra\u2019s findings, but the power division did not make the report public.\nMr Leghari said a strong roadmap for power sector reforms had been prepared based on the directives of the prime minister that would be made public in a few weeks to control power pilferage, overbilling, and circular debt. The minister also confirmed that about Rs1.9 trillion worth of bills were currently outstanding and the circular debt now stood at about Rs2.5tr.\nIn response to declining electricity demand partly due to the shift towards solar power, the government is contemplating rate reductions for industrial consumers and other incentives to encourage higher power usage.\nThe minister said about 6,800 MW of solar panels had been imported this year, and only 700 MW had gone into net-metering as more and more consumers were going off-grid. \u201cWe are seriously thinking about this,\u201d Mr Leghari said.\n"

This is horrifying, it\u2019s not normal,\u201d Al-Arja said, adding that at least 10 people were killed in the blast.\nSoon after the war began on October 7, Israel told Palestinians living in the north of Gaza to move to \u201csafe zones\u201d in the territory\u2019s south like Rafah.\n\nGuterres warns against \u2018full-scale regional conflict\u2019; Washington expected to veto Palestinian bid for UN membership\n\nBut Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has since vowed to invade the city, where around 1.5 million people live in shelters, more than half the territory\u2019s population.\n\u201cHow is Rafah a safe place?\u201d said Zeyad Ayyad, a relative of the victims.\nIn a separate strike on a house in Rafah\u2019s Al-Salam neighbourhood overnight on Tuesday, rescue crews recovered the corpses of eight family members including five children and two women, Gaza\u2019s civil defence service said.\nMeanwhile, senior US and Israeli officials held a virtual meeting on Thursday expected to include a discussion of both Israel\u2019s plans for the southern Gaza city of Rafah and its consideration of a retaliatory strike against Iran.\nPresident Joe Biden has urged Israel not to conduct a large-scale offensive in Rafah to avoid more Palestinian civilian casualties in Gaza, where Palestinian health authorities say more than 33,000 people have been killed in Israel\u2019s assault.\n\u2018Brink of disaster\u2019\nAt the United Nations, Secretary General Antonio Guterres painted a dark picture of the situation in the Middle East, warning that spiraling tensions over the war in Gaza and Iran\u2019s attack on Israel could devolve into a \u201cfull-scale regional conflict.\u201d\nGuterres also said Israel\u2019s military offensive in the Gaza Strip had created a \u201chumanitarian hellscape\u201d for civilians trapped in the besieged territory.\n\u201cGranting Palestine full membership at the United Nations will lift some of the historic injustice that succeeding Palestinian generations have been subjected to,\u201d special Palestinian Authority envoy Ziad Abu Amr told the Council.\n\u201cIt will open wide prospects before a true peace based on justice.\u201d\n\u201cThe Middle East is on a precipice. Recent days have seen a perilous escalation \u2014 in words and deeds\u2026 One miscalculation, one miscommunication, one mistake, could lead to the unthinkable \u2013 a full-scale regional conflict that would be devastating for all involved,\u201d he said, calling on all parties to exercise \u201cmaximum restraint.\u201d\nHis speech came hours before a vote in the Security Council on a Palestinian bid for full UN membership.\nAny request to become a UN member state must first earn a recommendation from the Security Council \u2014 meaning at least nine positive votes out of 15, and no vetoes \u2014 and then be endorsed by a two-thirds majority of the General Assembly. But the US has already voiced its opposition, meaning that the initiative that will likely be vetoed.\n"

            "Text": "\n\nA composite skeleton showing fossil vertebrae representing the trunk region of the prehistoric snake Vasuki indicus, as seen in this illustration.\u2014Reuters\n\n \nWASHINGTON: Fossil vertebrae unearthed in a lignite mine are the remains of one of the largest snakes that ever lived, a monster estimated at up to 49 feet (15 metres) in length \u2014 longer than a T. rex \u2014 that prowled the swamps of India around 47 million years ago.\nScientists said on Thursday they have recovered 27 vertebrae from the snake, including a few still in the same position as they would have been when the limbless reptile was alive. They said the snake, which they named Vasuki indicus, would have looked like a modern-day large python and would not have been venomous.\nThe mine is located in the Panandhro area of the Kutch district in western India\u2019s state of Gujarat. Lignite is the lowest grade of coal.\n\u201cConsidering its large size, Vasuki was a slow-moving ambush predator that would subdue its prey through constriction like anacondas and pythons. This snake lived in a marshy swamp near the coast at a time when global temperatures were higher than today,\u201d said Debajit Datta, a postdoctoral researcher in paleontology at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee (IITR) and lead author of the study published in the journal Scientific Reports.\nBecause of the incomplete nature of the Vasuki remains, the researchers gave an estimated length range of 36-49 feet (11-15 metres) and a rough estimate of a metric ton in weight.\nVasuki, named after the snake king associated with the Hindu deity Shiva, rivals in size another huge prehistoric snake called Titanoboa, whose fossils were discovered in a coal mine in northern Colombia, as announced in 2009. Titanoboa, estimated at 42 feet (13 metres) long and 1.1 metric tons, lived 58-60 million years ago. The reticulated python is the longest extant snake, sometimes measuring 20-30 feet (6-9 metres).\n\u201cThe estimated body length of Vasuki is comparable to that of Titanoboa, although the vertebrae of Titanoboa are slightly larger than those of Vasuki. \nHowever, at this point, we cannot say if Vasuki was more massive or slender compared to Titanoboa,\u201d said paleontologist and study co-author Sunil Bajpai, a professor at IITR.\nThese huge snakes lived during the Cenozoic era, which began after the dinosaur age ended 66 million years ago. Perhaps the largest-known Tyrannosaurus rex is a specimen named Sue at the Field Museum in Chicago, at 40-1/2 feet (12.3 metres) long, though a T. rex would have been more massive than these snakes.\n"

Even PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif was conspicuous by his absence.\nDuring the speech, PTI members clamoured in front of the dais, shouting \u2018Go Zardari Go\u2019 throughout. At times, the president seemed to lose his train of thought, but remained composed and only acknowledged the protesters with a smile, ending his speech with a victory sign.\n\u201cIn my considered view, it is time to turn a new page\u2026 The challenges we face are not impossible to overcome. They just require the fundamentals of meaningful dialogue and parliamentary consensus\u2026 We can effectively tackle our challenges and foster an atmosphere of mutual respect and political reconciliation,\u201d he said.\nPresident Zardari said the country needed to build its strengths by investing in people, focusing on public needs, and harnessing its resources to create pathways to inclusive growth.\nBesides economic and tax reforms, he also urged the federal government to promote a working relationship with the provinces.\nAbout climate change, the president said Pakistan had been devastated by the adverse impacts of climate change, especially the 2022 floods. \u201cWe urgently need to invest in climate-friendly and climate-resilient infrastructure to mitigate the rapidly compounding risks of risks of climate change.\u201d\nRegional peace\nReferring to the surge in terrorism, which threatens national security as well as regional peace, he termed the problem a shared concern that required collective efforts for eradication. He urged the neighbouring countries to take \u201cstrong notice\u201d of militant groups involved in attacks against Pakistan\u2019s security forces and people.\nPresident Zardari also thanked friendly countries, particularly Saudi Arabia, the UAE, China, Turkiye, and Qatar for supporting Pakistan through difficult times.\nSpeaking about the Kashmir issue, he called upon India to reverse all illegal measures taken on or after Aug 5, 2019. He also expressed deep concerns over the genocide of Palestinians by the Israeli forces in Gaza, saying Pakistan condemned the brutality and impunity of the occupation forces.\n\u2018Tough time\u2019\nIn a media talk outside the Parliament House, the PTI leaders boasted they gave a \u2018tough time\u2019 to President Zardari during his address. PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan justified the protest, saying the PTI would continue to pressure the government. \u201cWe gave him the 21-gun salute \u2014 the one they all deserve,\u201d he quipped.\n\u201cThe protest is for the restoration of democracy and strengthening of the parliament,\u201d he claimed. \u201cZardari is not the legitimate president of the country, and the worst is that he is not even behaving in that manner.\u201d He said Mr Zardari has not even resigned from the PPP co-chief position even though he was the head of the state and the symbol of the federation.\nBarrister Khan said that the president of the country has to be \u201capolitical but Zardari sahib addressed the [PPP] public gathering\u201d in Naudero. \u201cIs that legal,\u201d he questioned.\n"

Instead, it aims to concentrate its efforts on China and Ukraine. The ongoing crisis in the Middle East is diverting its focus, energy, time, and resources.\nA Pakistani diplomat claimed that the US has not asked Islamabad anything regarding the conflict, but it is concerned about reports that Pakistan plans to go ahead with the stalled gas pipeline project with Iran. Therefore, Washington will be watching the Iranian president\u2019s visit with great interest.\n\u201cAmb Blome conveyed the United States\u2019 commitment to working with the government and people of Pakistan, underscoring that prosperity and security for Pakistan remains a top priority for the United States,\u201d the US embassy said in its statement.\nAmb Blome\u2019s meeting adds an interesting layer, especially considering Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb\u2019s ongoing discussions with the IMF in Washington on a potential follow-up programme to the previous $3 billion stand-by arrangement. The new IMF programme is believed to be crucial for the financially struggling country.\nUN move\nIn a related development, Pakistan refrained from joining a UN move to condemn Iran\u2019s attacks on Israel, signalling its desire to remain neutral on the issue.\nOn Wednesday, the United States and 47 other countries circulated a statement unequivocally condemning attacks on Israel by Iran \u201cand its militant partners\u201d.\nDuring the weekend, Iran launched more than 300 drones and missiles, although most were intercepted with the help of the United States, Britain, France, and Jordan.\nThe statement initiated by the US permanent mission to the UN urged nations across the globe to condemn the Iranian action. Britain, France, Germany, and 47 states supported the US move.\nA statement distributed by Pakistan\u2019s permanent mission on Thursday expressed deep concern over the ongoing developments in the Middle East.\nIt pointed out that for months, Pakistan has emphasised the necessity of international efforts to prevent the expansion of hostilities in the region and to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza.\nOn April 2, Pakistan condemned an Israeli attack on an Iranian consular office in Syria as \u201ca major escalation in an already volatile region\u201d.\nThe statement highlighted that latest developments in the Middle East were the consequences of diplomatic breakdown. \u201cThese also underscore the grave implications when the UN Security Council is unable to fulfil its responsibilities of maintaining international peace and security,\u201d Pakistan warned.\nPakistan reminded the international community that it\u2019s \u201ccritically urgent to stabilise the situation and restore peace\u201d and urged \u201call parties to exercise utmost restraint and move towards de-escalation\u201d.\nThe United States and its allies also condemned Iran\u2019s seizure of a Portuguese-flagged commercial ship near the Strait of Hormuz on Saturday and called for the immediate release of the ship and its crew.\n"

            "Text": "\u2022 Hastens process amid rise in smuggling, complaints from oil industry\n\u2022 Move may help shift brunt of public criticism to oil marketing companies\nISLAMABAD: Amid increasing fuel prices and the oil industry\u2019s complaints over the rising influx of smuggled oil products, the government has expedited the process of deregulating petroleum pro\u00adduct prices to shift the brunt of public cri\u00adticism to oil marketing companies (OMCs).\nIn a directive, the petroleum division has asked the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) \u201cto share a presentation on the analysis and implications of deregulation of petroleum products\u201d within three days.\nThis should particularly cover the \u201cin-country freight equalisation margins (IFEM) and other related aspects\u201d, it said.\nThe directive came following instructions from the Prime Minister\u2019s Office for urgent finalisation of a \u201cderegulation framework for the petroleum sector\u201d, a senior government official said.\nThe government has been under public criticism for rising petroleum product prices, even though it was not at liberty to change fixed tax rates on various products under the donor-dictated pricing mechanism.\nThe government\u2019s only role at present is limited to announcing fortnightly fuel prices calculated by Ogra to pass on the impact of the international market and exchange rate to consumers.\nThe oil industry has also been criticising the government for doing little to stop the massive smuggling of low-quality and cheaper products, particularly from Iran.\nThis smuggling affects the regulated oil industry\u2019s market share and profitability, and cau\u00adses the government annual revenue loss of over Rs230 billion.\nThe industry had warned the government of its inability to upgrade its infrastructure to Euro-5 quality fuels when it had to compete with low-quality kerosene and benzene-grade smuggled fuels freely available across the country.\nPricing independence\nAn official told Dawn that while the final deregulation framework would come out with the approval of the federal cabinet and the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), the deregulation of petrol and high-speed diesel (HSD) pricing would mean an end of uniform pricing across the country and the oil companies would be free to set their own prices for different cities and towns.\nLegally speaking, he explained, petroleum prices were already deregulated and the government notified only kerosene prices for the retail stage.\nIn case of other products like petrol, HSD and light diesel oil, the government only notified tax rates like petroleum development levy, customs duty and sales tax, etc. and fixed profit margins for dealers and marketing companies, while Ogra and the Ministry of Finance adjust the IFEM, which currently ensures uniform pricing across Pakistan.\nTherefore, the Ministry of Finance normally announces ex-depot prices without notification, while petrol stations set their own retail prices.\nOn the other hand, the oil industry set its own rates for furnace oil and the high-octane blending component (HOBC) based on tax rates notified by the government.\nNow, the government is likely to completely deregulate the prices of petrol and diesel, including commissions of OMCs and dealers, on the pattern of HOBC.\nIn the new framework, Ogra and the Competition Commission of Pakistan would have a greater role, notwithstanding their limited capacity and outreach, to ensure product quality, availability and competitive environment to avoid market collusion and cartelisation.\nThis would also mean that the IFEM mechanism would also be deregulated. This means the prices would significantly vary from one city to another and from one oil company to another.\nConsumers close to ports and refineries would be at an advantage in getting products at cheaper rates, while those further afield would have to pay a higher price. The difference could vary between Rs3 and Rs8 per litre, depending on the actual transportation cost.\nWarning from OCAC\nThe move comes at a time when the Oil Companies Advisory Council (OCAC) \u2014 an association of over three dozen oil companies and refineries \u2014 warned the government early this week about \u201ca serious threat to the opportunity of huge investment in the country due to the staggering influx of smuggled petroleum products from Iran\u201d.\nIn a letter to the SIFC, the advisory council said that besides causing billions of rupees revenue loss to the government and forcing the local refineries to operate at unviable lower throughputs, the \u201cmenace of unabated smuggling seemingly under the patronage of official authorities is now reached to the extent that it may jeopardise opportunity of the forthcoming huge investment (worth $5bn-6bn) in refineries expansion and upgradation projects under the Oil Refining Policy for Upgradation of Brownfield Refineries, 2023\u201d notified in February 2024.\nIt pointed out that the feasibilities of these upgrade projects were based on the optimum capacity utilisation of refineries.\n\u201cThe smuggling of petroleum products, if continued, would seriously question the viability of these projects, forcing the prospective investors to review their decisions\u201d to bring in huge investment and substantially increase production of deficit products and meet environment-friendly Euro-5 specifications.\n"

These are not major policy decisions at all. There is nothing illegal,\u201d he added.\nOn March 8, health department imposed a ban on major decisions by BoGs of teaching hospitals including recruitments, appointments, terminations, promotions, procurements and awarding fresh tenders. However, Ayub Teaching Hospital (ATH), Abbottabad, has violated the directives, according to documents.\nDocuments show that major decisions were taken in the 96th meeting of BoG of ATH held on April 3 in violation of the ban imposed by the government. Three BoG members stayed away while the chairman attended the meeting online. The minutes published on April 8 revealed that major policy decisions were taken to benefit specific employees.\n\nBoG chairman Mushtaq Jadoon denies any wrongdoing at the hospital\n\nAs per decisions, Dr Ather Lodhi, who is also hospital director (HD), was designated as coordination officer in BPS-21 despite deference of the same from agenda items thrice in previous BoG meetings. Dr Lodhi, previously serving as chief medical officer in BPS-20, was not only promoted to BPS-21 but also his position was re-designated as coordination officer in BPS-21, a designation that did not exist under the law.\nAn officer serving as a patient record manager (BS-17) was not only upgraded to BPS-18 but also re-designated as manager human resource, say documents.\nThe BoG upgraded the position of manager radiology to BPS-18, as the actual sanctioned position of officer was patient record manager in BPP-17 and no such position existed. It had been rejected thrice in the past.\nAn employee of health department in BPS-20 was granted a No Objection Certificate (NoC) for transfer to ATH despite non-availability of position. The BoG\u2019s subcommittee deliberated that the performance of a security officer was not up to mark but he was promoted to BPS-18.\nDespite a ban on recruitment and creation of new posts, the BOG approved hiring of 10 fixed-pay Class-IV employees that falls under major decision-making. It approved the promotion of two pharmacists to the posts of senior pharmacist in BPS-18 and from BPS-18 senior pharmacist to chief pharmacist in BPS-19. The latter had faced disciplinary proceedings and served more than half of his time as officer on special duty.\nThe board also granted go-ahead to creation and formal notification of management cadre doctors, which falls under major policy decisions.\nHonorarium of Rs5,000 was granted to 852 Class-IV staffers causing financial burden to the hospital of Rs4,260,000. An allowance of Rs150,000 was approved for hospital director (HD). He was reappointed for three months or until the arrival of a permanent HD while salary of medical director was raised by Rs50,000 per month along with previous areas from September 2022.\nDocuments show that a telephone exchange supervisor was promoted from BPS-11 to BPS-14. HD procured medicines worth Rs400 million in violation of ban.\nHowever, chairman of BoG Mr Jadoon denied any wrongdoing at the hospital.\nSources in health department said that BoGs of 10 medical teaching institutions were directed to refrain from taking major policy decisions till the appointments of new BoGs.\nThe caretaker government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had replaced the BoGs appointed by the previous PTI government. They are likely to be terminated soon. \u201cSome BoGs of MTIs are taking major decisions, much to the embarrassment of the government, which wants to appoint its own boards,\u201d sources said.\n"

Most of the deaths are preventable provided we control use of tobacco, inculcate the habit of exercise and take steps to control air pollution,\u201d Dr Zafar Mirza, former federal health minister, told participants of the four-day international public health conference at Khyber Medical University here on Thursday.\nHe said that every third adult person of 18 years had hypertension while every fourth above 20 years suffered from type-2 diabetes that could be avoided. World Health Organisation says that 90pc of essential health services should be made available at primary healthcare facilities.\nKMU\u2019s Dr Khalid Rehman said that innovative approaches such as artificial intelligence could be effectively utilised to tackle the threats posed by climatic change and lessen burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). \u201cPrevention is far better than treatment for which we need to make our primary health services more effective,\u201d he said.\nProf Zainab Samad from Aga Khan University Karachi said that life expectancy could be increased in Pakistan from 68 to 80 years by adopting healthy habits as lack of physical inactivity was causing host of NCDs that were preventable. \u201cLow health literacy is the main issue haunting people physically as well as economically,\u201d she said.\nThe director of Institute of Radiotherapy and Nuclear Medicine, Dr Aakifullah Khan said that only 20 pc cancer cases were reported in Pakistan. He stressed the need for adopting evidence-based policy to cope with the number of cancer patients. He said that there were five hospitals run by Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa but more facilities were required in view of the growing number of patients in the province.\nKMU Vice-chancellor Prof Ziaul Haq said that people preferred to visit tertiary care hospitals despite the fact the most health problems could be addressed at basic health unit and rural health centre.\n\u201cWe are ready to assist government in shaping the health system under which the quantum of diseases can be lessened a great deal,\u201d he said.\nHealth Minister Syed Qasim Ali said that they were launching campaigns at educational institutions on May 1 to scale up awareness regarding causes of NCDs. \u201cThe prevalence of 30pc diabetes is alarming and we need to work as a team to overcome the situation. We want to work in collaboration with institutions,\u201d he said.\n"

It\u2019s in grants, unlike loans provided by other organisations. It means that the USAID provides grants for the projects and does not expect repayments,\u201d she said.\nThe USAID mission director said currently, 26 USAID projects were under way in the province in very diverse areas like academic development, women\u2019s development, education, climate change, and energy.\nShe added that the agency had built a lot of infrastructure, especially in the power sector.\nMs Somvongsiri said USAID had supported the Gomal Zam Dam, Tarbla, and other energy projects.\n\u201cWe have provided 253 megawatts of electricity, mostly hydel, clean, and affordable energy to the province,\u201d she said.\nThe mission director said that at the national level, USAID had helped add 4000 megawatts of energy to the national grid, which was all clean and affordable energy.\nShe said the agency also helped with the execution of the Golen Gol project.\nRegarding the road infrastructure, Ms Somvongsiri said that the agency had helped build over 1300 kilometres of roads, bridges, link roads, and tunnels in the province.\n\u201cThese roads are a way to livelihood and connectivity to the outside world, where the economic potential lies,\u201d she said.\nShe said education and health were priority areas of USAID.\n\u201cWe helped build 29 new schools and rehabilitated over 1,000 others affected by the conflict and natural disasters in the province. We are also working with the government to introduce the private public partnership mode for the improvement of education in the province,\u201d she said.\nThe mission director said USAID wasn\u2019t just building infrastructure but also ensuring the provision of quality education to people as well.\nShe said in the higher education sector, the agency extended help to eight universities, including the modern centre for energy at the University of Engineering and Technology, Peshawar.\n\u201cWe have also built the faculty of education in four universities, including Gomal University, the University of Peshawar, Hazara University, and the University of Malakand,\u201d she said, revealing the provision of over 1,000 merit- and need-based scholarships to students from across the province.\n"

However, tandoors provided roti to restaurants.\n\nSay govt move unreasonable amid high inflation\n\nComplying with the provincial government\u2019s orders, deputy commissioner Bilal Shahid Rao set the rates for every roti weighing 100 grams and 200 grams at Rs15 and Rs30, respectively, the other day.\nThe nanbais association\u2019s president said the roti rates fixed by the administration were unacceptable to tandoor owners for being unreasonable amid high inflation.\n\u201cInflation has hit an all-time high, so you better decide how we can run our business in such circumstances,\u201d he said.\nMr Hussain said nanbais would prefer shutting down businesses than accepting the unjustified roti rates set by the district administration.\nThe residents suffered due to the nanbais\u2019 strike. They demanded of the government to enforce its decision to slash roti rates.\nThey said the rate of wheat flour had come down significantly in recent days and was likely to reduce further in the days ahead due to the projected bumper wheat crop.\n\u201cWhen flour price goes up slightly, nanbais take no time to increase roti price but when the government has ordered them to slash it they\u2019ve refused to do so. It is unacceptable,\u201d said resident Mohammad Ajmal.\nHe said the roti price of Rs25 was unacceptable following a recent cut in the flour price.\nRELEASE OF FUNDS DEMANDED: The chairmen of village and neighbourhood councils in Balakot tehsil here on Thursday demanded of the government to immediately release funds for municipal and social services.\n\u201cVillage, neighbourhood and tehsil councils provide basis for the democratic setup and offer basic services to residents. Two years have passed since the establishment of these bodies but we\u2019re still without funds and other rights,\u201d chairman of the Pattan Des village council in Kaghan Valley Raja Khalid Nawaz told reporters here.\nAccompanied by the chairmen of village and neighbourhood council from Balakot tehsil, he said the successive governments in the province ignored local bodies and tried to do away with the LG system.\n\u201cWe, local body representatives across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, are united to claim rights. We will thwart any government bid to wind up this system,\u201d he said.\nMr Nawaz said the local body members from Balakot tehsil would join the street protests by their counterparts in the province.\n\u201cThe government should immediately release development funds to village, neighbourhood and tehsil councils and empower them in accordance with the LG Act, 2013,\u201d he said.\nThe village council\u2019s chairman said the Election Commission of Pakistan should hold elections for the presiding officers of local bodies without them as the council meetings couldn\u2019t take place for the last two consecutive years due to the absence of the custodians of those houses.\n"

            "Text": "| Naanbais say strike to continue today as well\n| 16 arrested over non-compliance with notified rates\nRAWALPINDI: The district administration on Thursday arrested 16 naanbais for not complying with new rates of Roti and Naan as tandoors across the garrison city observed a partial strike against the government\u2019s move to reduce the prices of Roti.\nThe strike was observed on the call of the All Pakistan Naan-bai Association and is likely to continue today as well. On the other hand, the district administration warned they would seal the shops if the tandoors remained closed on Friday and the new price list was not followed.\nLast week, the Punjab government reduced the price of Roti from Rs20 to Rs16 while the price of Naan was reduced from Rs25 to Rs20 in the province. However, the move was rejected by the naan-bai association which said the decision was taken by the government without consultations with the stakeholders.\nThe refusal of the tandoor owners to follow the government prices was met with high-handedness. The president of the naan-bai association was detained under the MPO and many naan-bais were arrested for violating the notification. Fines were also imposed.\nAccording to a report submitted to the Punjab government on Thursday, the district administration teams visited different bazaars and markets and imposed fines to the tune of Rs243,500 on 59 tandoors and arrested 16 violators. The administration warned the price magistrates that negligence would not be tolerated in the implementation of the new price for Roti.\nMeanwhile, All Pakistan Naan-bai Association General Secretary Khursheed Qureshi told Dawn the tandoors remained closed on Thursday as they refused to accept the new price list issued by the Punjab government.\n\u201cThe district administration must release the association president Shafique Qureshi who was detained under MPO four days ago. It is not possible for tandoors to sell Roti at Rs16 as the production cost is more than Rs18; how is it possible to sell Roti for Rs16,\u201d he said.\nHe said that the price of flour, natural gas, and LPG has increased, adding that the tandoors run on natural gas had a much higher cost. \u201cThe price of wheat flour has reduced, but not so much that we reduce the price of Roti,\u201d he said. In many areas of the garrison city, tandoors remained closed during the day. \u201cWe brought roti from home as the tandoor owners informed us that they will not open their shops on Thursday,\u201d said Muhammad Rafique, a shopkeeper in Chaklala Scheme-III.\nIntikhab Khan, who runs a tandoor on Bostan Khan Road, said his shop was closed on the call of the naan-bai association. He said that tandoors would remain closed till their demands were met. On the other hand, the district administration remained active in the garrison city and imposed fines on those who failed to implement the new price of Roti.\nA senior official said the district administration warned the naanbais that their shops would be sealed if they failed to open them on Friday and did not follow the new list. He said that the roti price would be implemented in the district within a day or two and people would get Roti at the notified rate. He claimed that the price of wheat flour had reduced and the cost of Roti was less than Rs13.\n"

He had also claimed that Saudi Arabia was influenced by the US in regional matters.\nWhen asked about his previous statement, the PTI leader owned it, adding that they were his own views and he had an understanding of the issue.\nWhen questioned on the premise of his understanding, Mr Marwat stated about the intellect capacity of parliamentarians and professionals.\n\u201cI have a basic understanding of things, and it is also based on common sense,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cJust look at the friendship between India and Saudi Arabia and see what they are doing for India and compare it with what they have done for us\u2014all their favours to Pakistan are peanuts compared to the benefits given to India.\u201d\nReplying to a question that his statements are not being taken well by the leadership of his party, Mr Marwat noted, \u201cMy level of intellect is equal to that of yours, so whatever you say is okay.\u201d\nHowever, a day earlier, PTI leaders Zulfi Bukhari and Asad Qaiser tried to clarify the party\u2019s position on the subject in separate statements. They expressed that Pakistan and Saudi Arabia were united by shared values, culture, and a common vision for regional peace and prosperity.\nMr Bukhari, on his X (previously Twitter), said that the party had no reason whatsoever to say or believe in any kind of intervention from the kingdom.\nHe added that PTI chairman Imran Khan and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman have a relationship of mutual respect, trust, and brotherhood.\n"

The meeting was attended by Country Director British Council James Hampson and Secretary Education Mohyuddin Wani.\nThe minister said the number of OOSC in Pakistan was ballooning and the only way to address the issue was by making it a national agenda. He said due to rapid and uncontrolled urbanisation and slums in major cities, the number of OOSC was increasing as slums were ignored in every education policy.\nHe highlighted the importance of ensuring that no child is left behind, says a press release. Mr Siddiqui urged the UK to provide support in the cause of eliminating out of school children. He said we need to bring all stakeholders especially donors on the same platform so that efforts can be channelled and streamlined.\n\nMinister says national agenda needed to tackle issue of out of school children in Pakistan\n\nThe minister said various initiatives were being taken to bring improvement in the education sector, saying: \u201cexpense on education is not expenditure but investment.\u201d\nThe British high commissioner said UK and Pakistan were the oldest partners and had been shoulder to shoulder since 1947. She said UK encouraged expansion of its green programme which can lead to an increase in enrolment of Pakistani students in UK universities via distance learning. She said Google Education was highly interested in supporting Pakistan in its bid to address the issue of access to education.\nThe high commissioner and the education minister also discussed the challenges and opportunities following the devolution of education to provinces.\nThe secretary education said the ministry was developing a comprehensive plan which will declare an education emergency in the country and align all stakeholders on the same page. He said all donors and NGOs operating in Pakistan were working in silos and compartments.\nEarlier, the minster while talking about youth said, \u201cwe have set a target to train one million youth in the IT sector.\u201d\nHe hoped that in the medium term, Pakistan will become one of the biggest suppliers of IT professionals to the world. He asked the UK to help in attaining IT certification for IT trained professionals that would be recognised globally.\nThe minister said the ministry aims to establish mental health awareness and support desks in all colleges in Islamabad.\nThe country director British Council told the minister that after China the biggest British Council Programme was in Pakistan. He said the global chief executive of British Council will be visiting Pakistan in May.\nThe minister welcomed the initiative from the British Council and expressed the desire to enhance collaboration between the council and Pakistan, especially with respect to increasing educational outreach programmes for slums in metropolitan cities of the country.\n"

The police then registered a case on its own and started investigations.\nStation House Officer (SHO) Inspector Ahsan Butt told Dawn that the police after matching her fingerprints with Nadra records identified the deceased as Tahira Nosheen Rana, a resident of Chak-33 SP, Pakpattan. She turned out to be a journalist attached with a local Urdu paper.\nHe said her heirs were also traced and her brother approached the police and claimed that she had not been in contact with the family since 2018 after she got divorced from her first husband and married to another man. He said the first husband of his sister had died and she had a daughter from him.\nAccording to the SHO, her brother requested that the police let her body remain buried in the Sohawa graveyard.\nReplying to a question, the SHO said that the woman\u2019s second husband had also been contacted and would join the investigation soon. He said three criminal cases were found registered against the deceased in Pakpattan and Lahore police stations while she was also a complainant and a witness in several cases.\nIn an interview available on Facebook with a journalist in Islamabad, the deceased had stated that her second husband had already married five women and had contracted his seventh marriage after marrying her.\n\u201cThis is a gang very active in Lahore that lures well-settled women after building relationships with them to get financial benefits,\u201d she had alleged in the interview. In the video, she also alleged that her husband had subjected her to assault and blackmailing after she applied for Khula.\n\u201cHe had also kept me hostage for four months at different places and recorded my obscene videos after intoxicating me and sent them to my family and friends\u201d, she alleged in the video.\nTalking about cases registered against her, she claimed that her husband had given her cheques after faking her signatures to different people while she was kept hostage, adding his aim was to confiscate her property. She alleged that her husband had also attempted to take her life multiple times. She also claimed that her husband had made a plan to put the blame of her death on her brother and other family members. She had also soiught justice and protection from the authorities.\nInterestingly, in another video statement recorded earlier on April 9, 2023, she had claimed that she and her husband were receiving life threats from her family members, including her brother.

As a result, the illicit cigarette market share has reached 63 per cent of the total market in Pakistan.\nThe media was informed that there were three categories of illicit cigarettes on the market: smuggled packets mostly manufactured in the UAE with attractive packaging and a variety of flavours; non-registered local cigarettes; and counterfeit products of registered brands.\n\u201cAll of these do not pay taxes; that is, their prices were less than half to one-third of the regulated cigarette brands,\u201d Ms Uroos highlighted.\nShe said that the government has to enforce all the laws of the country on the cigarette industry, and the tax stamps of the track & trace system were introduced to combat illicit tobacco trade, but that too was not being implemented, and cigarette packs with fake tax stamps were openly being sold in the markets.\nResponding to a question about the statements by various anti-tobacco organisations that increasing taxes on tobacco products was leading to a drop in smoking habits, she said that these organisations have been misguiding the government through misinformation.\n"

Under the law, he said, no construction could to be done along the river banks and its right of way, and it would only be used for farming purposes. However, he said, all the green areas along the river and seasonal nullahs in Rawalpindi were shrinking due to urban development.\nThe official further said the ground water level in the garrison city was depleting fast as the water recharge areas along the river were reducing.\nSoan River is one of the major water bodies of the Potohar Plateau, passing through the heart of the garrison city and cultivating the region. The river is of immense importance to the city, but during recent times, it has been observed that the plains and right of way of the Soan River are heavily encroached and the water flow is obstructed, said the official.\nHe said the district administration had taken serious notice of the alarming situation of the right of way of the river and said it would be identified so that encroachment and constructions without permission would be dealt with accordingly. He said the no-construction zone had been established to protect the natural flow of the river.\nWhen contacted, Deputy Commissioner Dr Hassan Waqar Cheema said that he had directed a survey of the area along the Soan River to remove the encroachments. He said they would start surveying the area soon and their basic concern was to save the people\u2019s lives.\n\u201cDue to the negligence of those who constructed illegal structures, many people have lost their lives, and it is not acceptable for the Punjab government,\u201d he said.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: Even though the notification of DIG Ali Nasir Rizvi as the new police chief remains in the field, two senior police officers of the Islamabad police have stepped up efforts to clinch the coveted post with the help of senior bureaucrats in the interior ministry.\nInsiders told Dawn that the two officers had held meetings with senior civil servants, including those serving in the interior ministry. They claimed that the two DIGs also visited the interior ministry separately and met a senior official at the ministry with a request to recommend their name for the post of the police chief.\nThe office of the IGP has been vacant since March 29 after the Establishment Division posted Akbar Nasir Khan and appointed DIG Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi as the new police chief of the capital police. The sources said that there were reports that Mr Rizivi was likely to assume the charge.\nIn this regard the interior minister, who picked DIG Rizvi for the top office, also said that the officer based in Lahore would join the office of the Islamabad police chief, they added. The notification for DIG Rizvi\u2019s appointment is still not cancelled despite his reluctance because the minister wanted him to head the capital police. On March 29, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi accompanied DIG Rizvi and met the premier. After this meeting, the notification regarding his appointment as the IGP Islamabad was issued.\n\nTwo DIGs vie for top slot amid reports of DIG Rizvi\u2019s expected arrival\n\nThere are several reasons DIG Rizvi has not arrived in the capital. For instance, he had wanted to bring his own team from Punjab, including DIGs and SSPs and the Punjab chief minister\u2019s objections over his transfer.\nIt may be mentioned here that the capital police have four DIGs, including DIG Security Owais Ahmed, and DIG Headquarters Hassan Raza from CTP-29 and Safe City Authority Director General Mohammad Shoaib from CTP-30. DIG Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi, however, is from CTP-31 and the senior officers in the police are reluctant to work under his command.\nDIG Headquarters Hassan Raza, DIG Security Owais Ahmed, and Safe City head DIG Mohammad Shoaib had also approached the commissioner for a 15-day leave because they did not want to \u2018salute\u2019 a junior officer DIG Rizvi. The request for the leave was turned down and the application was returned to the DIGs.\nThe commissioner\u2019s office asked them to approach the interior secretary to seek leave, saying the commissioner lost its powers to the interior secretary after the promulgation of the Police Order. After the leave request was rejected, the DIGs resumed their duties. It may be noted that the police officers had approached the administration for a 15-day leave after the approval of their five-day leave by the outgoing police chief.\nAkbar Nasir Khan relinquished the charge on March 30 day without nominating an officer, as DIG Rizvi did not appear to assume the charge. On April 8, the chief commissioner\u2019s office approached the interior ministry and requested to appoint the \u2018most senior\u2019 officer DIG Headquarters Hassan Raza as acting IGP Islamabad, as during the absence of the police chief the official work of the capital police was suffering. DIG Headquarters Hassan Raza, however, is junior to DIG Security Owais Ahmed in the seniority list of the CTP-29.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: Against the backdrop of March 25 letter by six Islamabad High Court (IHC) judges, the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) on Thursday sought a probe for fixing liability against those responsible for undermining the independence of judiciary.\nMoved through senior counsel Syed Ahmad Hassan Shah on behalf of IHCBA, a petition filed before the Supreme Court on Thursday also requested for delineating matters highlighted in the March 25 letter by six high court judges to suggest suitable recommendations for due consideration by the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) that develops code of conduct for the judges.\nEarlier on April 5, the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) had asked for a Judicial Commission manned by sitting judges of the Supreme Court to settle the complaints of meddling of the intelligence agencies in the judicial affairs.\nHeaded by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa, a seven-judge Supreme Court bench which initiated a suo motu on the issue will resume the hearing on April 30. A member of the bench Justice Yahya Afridi had already withdrawn himself from the bench.\nNow the fresh petition pleaded that there was no room for any kind of interference, overt or covert, in the discharge of judicial functions by any court of law by any external element.\nIntimidation or harassment of a judge of a high court or a judge of the court subordinate to it or those discharging quasi-judicial functions at a tribunal established by the law is not a fair game. It is an affront to constitutionalism and a brazen attack on the independence of judiciary, the petition argued.\nThe independence of judiciary, as a comprehensive constitutional construct, encompasses distinct aspects, including the independence of the judicature, as an organ of the state and independence of individual judges to decide all manner of cases before them in accordance with law.\nThe letter highlights grave concerns with respect to both, the petition reminded.\nThe multi-layered judicial structure under the Constitution is amenable to interference whatsoever, particularly from another organ of the state including the executive branch of the state as each organ must not encroach upon the constitutional domain of others.\nThe petition emphasized that within the established judicial hierarchy, each judge is independent and under oath to preserve, protects and defend the Constitution.\nThe faction motivated by vested political interests and personal gains that operate to erode public confidence in the administration of justice by spreading false information and unfairly targeting individual judges, whereby right-thinking members of the society are misguided and the lines between the rule of law and advocacy and pretence and personal benefit are blurred to undermine the independence of judiciary.\nThe petition emphasised the confidence on the justice system of Pakistan will erode, if the Supreme Court did not address the issues raised in the judge\u2019s letter, adding in exercising of its original jurisdiction under Article 184(3) of the Constitution, the apex court should intervene to secure independence of judiciary by addressing important questions of law.\nThe petition also questioned whether the media trial of individual judges in pending cases before the courts amounts to interference in judicial work or akin to influencing or interference in conduct of fair trial or cause disparagement or develops a sense of ridicule in the mind of the public for the judiciary.\nThe petition contended whether due process requirements enshrined in Article 10A of the Constitution warrants probe in to instances highlighted in the letter, particularly when the federal cabinet in its meeting of March 30, 2024 has denied any involvement.\nWhether the code of conduct prescribed by SJC is deficient in providing guidelines to deal with instances of influence or intimidation by the executive branch of the State including operatives of its agencies as noted in the IHC judges letter through other means.\nThe petition has also questioned whether Article 209 of the Constitution enables of SJC to take cognizance of the letter and initiate inquiry in respect of the instances of interference in the judicial work at the high court as well as the courts under its supervisory jurisdiction and to provide guidance to judges of the high court as well as the courts under its supervisory jurisdiction in respect of the matters specified therein.\nThe petition said the constitution permits intra judicature consultation ie consultation among judges of the Supreme Court as well as judges of the high court along with judges of the courts under supervision of the high court for purposes of developing a robust code of conduct of judges of all tiers of the courts in Pakistan.\n"

He was appointed for a period of three years by the prime minister in consultation with the chief justice of Pakistan (CJP).\n\u201cUnfortunately, Medical Tribunal Act 2020 does not allow acting chairman or even letting the chairman continue working till the appointment of a new chairman. The ministry tried and even appointed Lahore High Court\u2019s former judge Justice Shoaib Saeed as the acting chairman for three months but he did not assume the charge,\u201d the official said.\nLater, he added, an attempt was made to appoint retired Justice Ghulam Azam Qambrani as an acting chairman but he also refused because the appointment could be in violation of the Act.\n\u201cCurrently, over 100 complaints are pending in the tribunal, majority of them are filed by students who got admissions in medical and dental colleges and even paid fees but after completion of a year were told that they cannot appear in exams as their colleges were not affiliated with universities, or have other issues,\u201d he said.\nWhen asked about the process of appointment, he said first of all the CJP was requested to nominate someone as the chairman.

The think-tank was launched at a seminar hosted by the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad (ISSI) with the theme: \u201cReviving the Bandung spirit of Afro-Asian solidarity: Pakistan-Africa relations\u201d.\nPAIDAR\u2019s launch coincided with the 69th anniversary of the Bandung conference of Asian and African nations held on April 18, 1955 in Indonesia in which Pakistan participated together with China as well as countries from Africa.\nThe senior foreign ministry official said the first phase of Engage Africa Policy was successfully implemented under which Pakistan opened five new missions in Africa taking Pakistan\u2019s diplomatic presence in the continent to 20. Moreover, two existing missions were upgraded.\nFive more missions were planned to be opened under the Phase\u2013II of the policy, but financial constraints forced revision of the goals and now the plan is to add one mission every year, he added.\nAdditionally, MoUs for political consultations have been signed with 10 African countries, Mr Khan said, adding that previously there were such arrangements with only seven countries in the continent.\nEthiopia and Zimbabwe opened diplomatic missions in Pakistan over the past two years. Rwanda and Tanzania are, meanwhile, opening their missions here later this year.\nSenator Mushahid said Africa was a pivotal player in the resurgence of the Global South with 54 members of the African Union.\nOutlining the objectives of the new Africa specific think-tank, Senator Mushahid said it was established to restore Pakistan\u2019s foreign policy priority orientation and involvement in Africa and for reviving Pakistan-Africa bond through people-to-people exchanges and business-to-business connectivity in such areas as education, environment and climate change, trade and investment, energy, promoting the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals, maritime affairs, sports, tourism and culture.\nDirector General ISSI Amb Sohail Mahmood said that deeper engagement with Africa remains a strategic imperative for Pakistan.\n\u201cForging a strong and effective partnership for peace, progress and prosperity is an indispensable goal, which should be advanced through a clear vision, consistent policy, and a long-term strategy,\u201d he said.\nDean of the Islamabad-based African Corps Amb Mohammed Karmoune identified science and technology, agriculture, industrial cooperation and the promotion of trade and investments as the potential areas of cooperation between Pakistan and African 0countries\nEthiopian envoy Jemal Beker said Pakistan government\u2019s \u2018Look Africa\u2019 and \u2018Engage Africa\u2019 policies led to the establishment of Ethiopia\u2019s Mission in Islamabad as well as the commencement of Ethiopian airline direct flights to Pakistan.\nKenyan High Commissioner Mary Nyambura Kamau urged Pakistan to focus on enhancing economic cooperation through trade, investment, joint ventures, tourism, and technology exchange. This, she suggested, could be done both through regional blocks and bilateral levels.\n"

            "Text": "Propelled by a strong post-pandemic recovery in the US, sticky inflation, and geopolitical tensions, a surging dollar has battered almost every Asian currency. The changing expectations that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) might delay its anticipated rate cuts in the wake of stronger March inflation numbers and lingering conflict in the Middle East are causing home currencies to tumble across Asia and capital to outflow.\nLast week, Bloomberg reported that all but one of the 23 developing nation currencies it tracks have dropped against the greenback this year. The Japanese yen plummeted over nine per cent falling to its weakest in 33 years, while the Korean won weakened by 6pc hitting its lowest level in eight years.\nIndia\u2019s rupee and Vietnam\u2019s dong are also at their weakest ever. Likewise, the Indonesian rupiah has been at its softest in four years, and the Malaysian ringgit has been close to its weakest ever since the 1998 Asian financial crisis.\nThe pain caused by a strong dollar, along with the 23-year high interest rates of 5.25pc to 5.5pc, is compelling governments and central bankers from Japan and Indonesia to Vietnam and elsewhere to intervene in foreign exchange markets, raise interest rates or issue warnings to prop up their currencies as importing US inflation via their weaker currencies becomes problematic for their economies.\n\nPakistan must diversify its reserves to move away from dollar dependence amid global crises and disrupted supply chains\n\nOngoing developments suggesting that the Fed will delay rate cuts have made Asian currencies plummet even faster in recent weeks. \u201cThe rampaging dollar and the prospect of higher-for-longer US interest rates have been the main drivers,\u201d wrote India\u2019s The Economic Times.\nThough the Pakistani currency has remained unaffected by the anticipated delays in the US rate cuts, higher Fed rates are one of the key factors keeping the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) from lowering interest rates despite falling inflation numbers.\nAs recently noted by economist Ahmed Jamal Pirzada, this development is not encouraging for Pakistan. He explained that if Pakistan\u2019s interest rates stray too far from what advanced economies are doing, it could weaken the Pakistani currency and erase recent progress on inflation. The ongoing Middle East conflict adds another layer of complexity, potentially forcing Pakistan\u2019s central bank to raise interest rates even further.\nNo wonder most analysts don\u2019t expect the SBP to cut rates in today\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting despite the third consecutive fall in the inflation rate to 20.7pc last month \u2014 the lowest since May 2022. The MPC meeting comes amid media reports that the SBP has bought $5.5bn to bolster the rupee during the current financial year.\nMeanwhile, Karachi-based brokerage firm KTrade\u2019s new report, \u2018Assessing the Future Trend of the US Dollar & Global Currency Flows\u2019 has predicted that the value of the dollar is likely to go through a downward cycle in the next few years, considering the pressure from both fiscal and current account deficits and an anticipated combination of expansionary monetary policy and restrictive fiscal policy in sight.\nIn the absence of two key growth drivers \u2014 the unprecedented surge in the US fiscal deficit and the depletion of surplus savings \u2014 propelling the US economy in 2023 could slow down growth as consumption decelerates and business investments weaken.\nThe report projects the US Dollar Index (DXY) \u2014 a measure of the dollar value against a basket of six major currencies \u2014 to decline from 102.4 to 96-96.2 by 2028, expecting the Fed to start interest rate cuts sometime this year.\n\u201cT-bill issuance has increased by 125pc since 2019 while reserve balances are up 118pc. Therefore, interest payments on T-bills and reserve balances, together, are putting pressure on the US economy, which will prompt the Fed to ease its monetary policy stance in the next couple of years,\u201d it says.\nFurthermore, the report predicts that the already exorbitant prices of gold and bulk commodities might remain high as \u201ccentral banks diversify away from the dollar to alternative systems and countries strive to become self-reliant and competitive in green transformation amid the disrupted global supply chain\u201d.\n\nNearly 40pc of the world would be under sanctions if China was sanctioned\n\nCritically analysing the dollar\u2019s dominance as a store of value and global reserve currency, the reports says that the greenback remains dominant as its share in official foreign reserves, global trade invoicing, international debt securities and cross-border loans is many times greater than the US\u2019 share in the global GDP and international trade.\nHowever, this dominance is now being challenged by the growing use of local currencies by many countries, particularly by the BRICS bloc, for conducting international transactions and trade invoicing to avoid impacts of dollar volatility such as seen recently on the value of national currencies and foreign capital flows.\nDiversifying official foreign exchange reserves into currencies other than the dollar would provide further impetus to these trends. The dollar comprised 59pc of the disclosed global official foreign reserves in 2023, far surpassing all other currencies, but still less than its 71pc share in 2000.\nMoreover, 20pc of the global oil transactions in 2023 were conducted in other currencies, notably as Russia and Iran supplied cargoes to different purchasers. \u201cThis strategy mitigates the risks associated with exchange rate fluctuations and reduces dependence on dollar-denominated transactions, aligning with broader efforts to fortify economic cooperation within the BRICS framework,\u201d the report notes.\nSpeaking with a correspondent from London, KTrade Chairman Ali Farid Khwaja noted that central banks and policymakers are looking to diversify away from the US dollar for international financing as direct and secondary sanctions implemented by the US increase the risks of holding assets or raising finance in dollars.\n\u201cThe message is loud and clear. The use of the dollar as a policy to implement sanctions has been the most damaging factor as 28pc of the world\u2019s GDP is under sanctions, which is big enough for these countries to start thinking about using their own currency,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe rise of the US economy is based on its practice of, and people\u2019s belief in free markets. Unfortunately, recent political measures such as protectionism, trade obstructions and infringement of corporate property are breaking the fundamentals \u2014 the confidence in capitalism is broken.\n\u201cChina could be the next to face sanctions, and if that happens, then the size of the world\u2019s GDP under sanctions would increase to 40pc. Today, if I am a country, if I am one of the emerging markets in the Global South, I\u2019ll be worried if I will be the next Russia or face the same kind of trade barriers as China is currently facing,\u201d he remarked.\nMr Khwaja says Pakistan faces similar risks to exchange rate and capital flows as being confronted by other Asian economies due to dollar dominance. \u201cPakistan must gradually move towards diversification of its reserves. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb talked about this when he outlined plans to issue Panda bonds to raise debt from the Chinese market in yuan.\u201d\nNevertheless, he admits that it is not easy to break out of dollar dominance. \u201cCan the Global South successfully challenge the Western economic hegemony? This is the biggest question being asked. Moving away from the US presents technical, operational, and political challenges for economies like Pakistan.\n\u201cThe prudent way for Islamabad to become part of consortiums like BRICS is to take collaborative action by bolstering its trade with Asian nations and the Global South.\u201d\n"

            "Text": "Food loss and waste are emerging as a new global challenge with far-reaching implications. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation, around 33 per cent of all food produced globally for human consumption is lost or wasted across the food value chain \u2014 from production to consumption. This figure is even higher, exceeding 40pc, for highly perishable fruits and vegetables.\nIronically, in addition to this, Pakistan faces another form of food loss where thousands of farmers deliberately rotavate (destroy) their mature, fruit-bearing vegetable crops almost every year. Unfortunately, this significant food loss has not been documented or accounted for in any analysis.\nWhen a vegetable crop is cultivated on an excessively large area, exceeding the overall requirements of domestic and foreign (if any) markets, prices often plummet to such dismal levels during peak harvesting days that they fail to cover even the costs of harvesting labour, packaging, and transportation to the market.\nAs a result, farmers are left with no choice but to destroy their crops. This seemingly drastic measure is actually a rational response to the financial realities they face.\n\nIn a food-insecure country, farmers deliberately destroy hundreds of thousands of tonnes of crop\n\nThe high perishability of vegetables, the underdeveloped value-added industry that can process them for later consumption, and the limited availability of temperature-controlled storage facilities \u2014 with their prohibitive rental charges \u2014 are among the primary factors contributing to the market glut.\nDriven entirely by the dynamics of demand and supply, there is no fixed pattern of such oversupply and market crash. It varies across different vegetables over different periods, year to year. Reportedly, tomato, white radish, Indian squash, onion, turnip, cauliflower, cabbage, coriander, and spinach are some of the crops rotavated in previous years due to extremely low prices in the wholesale markets.\nRegrettably, such enormous food loss, amounting to hundreds of thousands of tonnes, occurs in a country ranked 99th out of 121 countries on the Global Hunger Index 2022. International organisations, including the World Food Programme, have already declared Pakistan food-insecure, and this is quite evident given that 40pc of the country\u2019s children are stunted due to malnutrition \u2014 their own and their mothers\u2019.\nCompounding this issue, Pakistan is grappling with high food inflation, characterised by extreme price volatility and an upward long-term trend in food prices, rendering fruits and vegetables increasingly unaffordable for poor and lower middle-class segments.\nAnother concerning dimension of farmers\u2019 deliberate food loss is the squandering of the country\u2019s scarce and precious resources, such as land, water, fertiliser, pesticides, and labour. Surprisingly, such a massive loss of agricultural inputs, which diminishes the overall productivity of our agriculture system and also fuels food inflation, has not been documented or included in government reports.\nNow, the question that arises is why it continues to happen. Can we do something to mitigate such a loss?\n\nThis seemingly drastic measure is actually a rational response to the financial realities they face\n\nGenerally, when a vegetable crop fetches high prices in a given year \u2014 due to reduced production or increased exports \u2014 more farmers tend to grow the same crop the following year, leading to an oversupply in the domestic market.\nSince our vegetables have limited export potential and the export system requires significant lead time to respond to market changes, the excess acreage (if greater than a certain limit) exacerbates the oversupply issue, leading to a drop in prices and causing losses. In response, farmers reduce the acreage of that crop in the subsequent year, causing prices to rise again, thereby perpetuating a boom and bust cycle \u2014 a critical issue in Pakistan that hurts both consumers and farmers.\nTo our dismay, even when farmers destroy their crops, vegetable prices in urban areas often remain unaffordable because of multilayered intermediaries, who benefit the most from prevailing market dynamics.\nUnfortunately, there is no mechanism in place, nor has any effort ever been made, to synchronise crop area with the overall demand for a particular vegetable crop, considering domestic consumption, value-added processing, and exports.\nDue to the disconnect between farmers and buyers, farmers lack reliable market demand data at the time of crop sowing, while buyers remain equally ignorant of reliable production estimates at the start of the harvesting season. This information gap and lack of coordination lead to persistent imbalances and fluctuations in the market.\nIn several countries, this problem is partially addressed through contract farming, where farmers and major buyers (food store chains, processors, and exporters) enter into a formal contract before sowing begins.\nThis helps reduce price volatility (spikes and collapse). Moreover, in these countries, farmers\u2019 marketing cooperatives, which handle local and export sales on a large scale, play a crucial role in enhancing farmers\u2019 market power.\nAnother solution lies in real-time data collection. In Pakistan, the sowing season for a given vegetable crop generally spans one to two months, and sometimes even longer, depending on the varied agro-climatic conditions across the different vegetable-growing clusters in different provinces.\nIn the evolving agricultural landscape, it has become imperative to put a mechanism in place to collect real-time sowing data for each vegetable crop and disseminate this information, along with market demand, to farmers through media and extension services. It would enable farmers to make rational and informed decisions about sowing/planting a particular vegetable instead of blindly jumping on the bandwagon based solely on last year\u2019s financial gains.\nThanks to the advancements in satellite remote sensing and geographic information systems, it is now possible to estimate crop acreage in real time with remarkable accuracy. Alternatively, data collection software and information and communications technology can be used to collect such data by deploying field enumerators.\nKhalid Wattoo is a farmer and a development professional, and Dr Waqar Ahmad is a former Associate Professor at the University of Agriculture, Faisalabad\n"

            "Text": "During the last fiscal year ending in June 2023, Pakistan earned $35.2 billion through exports of goods and services. Out of this, a significant $8.3bn, or 23.7 per cent of the total, came from the US, according to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). During the same year, the country also earned $2.6bn, or 7.5pc of the total exports, from China.\nThis vast gap in the share of the world\u2019s number one and number two economies in Pakistan\u2019s export earnings may narrow in coming years as Islamabad takes concrete steps to boost exports to China. Pakistan is also making efforts to increase its exports to Afghanistan and Iran.\nAs for normalising trade with India, that depends on how soon the two countries re-engage in confidence-building measures. Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar recently said that the government had engaged all stakeholders in consultations to explore the possibility of resuming trade ties with India.\nIn today\u2019s world of ever-rising trade costs with faraway countries, Pakistan clearly needs to trade more with its four neighbours \u2014 China, Afghanistan, Iran, and India. Unfortunately, for a long period, its trade with India and Iran has remained small due to political and diplomatic reasons in case of the former, and US sanctions in the case of the latter.\n\nGovernment must walk a tightrope in trying to tap into trade opportunities with neighbouring states without tarnishing Western trade ties\n\nDuring the last fiscal year, Pakistan\u2019s goods exports to India and Iran totalled just $0.3m and $28,000, respectively. In Afghanistan\u2019s case, Pakistani exports are currently on the decline. According to SBP, goods exports to Kabul slipped to $522m in the last fiscal year from $553m a year earlier. Moreover, in 8MFY24, the export earnings from Afghanistan fell to $320m from $346.5m in 8MFY23.\nTo maximise the benefits of economies of trade, Pakistan now needs to pursue a \u201clook towards Asia\u201d approach, focusing on neighbours and development partners in the Gulf Cooperation Council \u2014 Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.\nThis would also be a practical acknowledgement of the rising Asian share in the global economy and growing intra-Asian trade. However, to redirect merchandise exports, Islamabad must gradually shift from the West to the East.\nThere are three main reasons for this: First, it is practically impossible for exporters to immediately replace their old and large Western trade partners with Asian partners.\nSecond, as Pakistan depends on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for frequent external borrowings, it is strategically unwise and unviable to speedily reduce its presence in Western markets.\n\nIn the last fiscal year, Pakistan\u2019s goods exports to India and Iran totalled just $0.3m and $28,000, respectively, while exports to Afghanistan fell to $522m from $553m\n\nThird, there is no harm in allowing imports from America and Europe and foreign investment from the Western world. The presence of American and European companies in the country influences our export policy. Hence, we see our leadership mostly engaged in balancing Pakistan\u2019s trade and investment policies to tap the potential of intra-Asia trade without weakening the existing trade ties with the West.\nBoth the US and the European Union occasionally offer Islamabad some trade concessions and preferential treatment to our exporters (after extracting the due geopolitical and geostrategic price, of course). This factor also influences \u2014 and should be allowed to influence \u2014 the pace of any shift in the direction of trade.\nIran\u2019s President Ebrahim Raisi\u2019s recent visit to Pakistan was partially aimed at signalling to its arch-foe Israel that Tehran and Islamabad are \u201cinseparable.\u201d However, its primary purpose was to explore avenues of bilateral trade, investment, and cooperation in the fields of science and technology.\nMedia reports suggest that Saudi Crown Prince Muhammad Bin Salman may also visit Pakistan. In mid-April, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal Bin Farhan Al-Saud came to Islamabad and showed a keen interest in Pakistan\u2019s viable projects for possible Saudi foreign investment. All the promised Iranian and Saudi investment in Pakistan is for medium to long-term development.\nBut the visit of Iranian President Mr Raisi, followed by the visit of the Saudi foreign minister, would surely help Pakistan enhance goods and labour exports to Saudi Arabia, curb smuggling through Pak-Iran borders, and accelerate bilateral trading immediately. These topics were not only discussed with the visiting dignitaries, but they also gave necessary assurances.\nPakistan\u2019s merchandise exports to Saudi Arabia are already on the rise. In the last fiscal year, goods\u2019 exports to Saudi Arabia totalled $503.4m, up from $420.4m a year earlier. And, in 8MFY24, export earnings from Saudi Arabia have already reached the $443m mark.\nAccording to the SBP, during 9MFY24, Pakistan\u2019s current account deficit shrank to only $508m from $4.05bn in the same period last year. This was possible both due to a big rise in exports and an even bigger fall in imports \u2014 a slight increase in remittances played a tiny role.\nBut Pakistan will have to lift all curbs on imports as soon as it formally enters negotiating a large $7bn to $8bn, three-year IMF loan. This means that the trade deficit in goods would start growing again. Selling more export goods to neighbouring countries could be a good strategy to boost our exports at that crucial time.\nLately, the share of food items in our overall goods exports has grown steadily \u2014 directing food exports towards neighbouring countries is obviously a lot easier than shipping them to faraway countries.\n"

            "Text": "\n\n\n \nPakistan is grappling with its highest inflation rate in almost half a century. Over recent months, inflation has surged to as much as 38 per cent, marking the highest rate in South Asia. Food inflation has skyrocketed to 48pc, reaching its highest level since 2016.\nThe government significantly devalued the currency by more than 50pc within a year and eliminated subsidies as part of the latest instalment of the International Monetary Fund bailout package. Consequently, the nation is facing a severe cost-of-living crisis.\nIn a country where economic challenges often overshadow the daily lives of its citizens, the concept of fair wages has emerged as a beacon of hope. Pakistan, like many developing nations, faces the uphill task of addressing poverty, inequality, and social disparities due to the inflation mentioned above.\nAt the heart of these issues lies the question of how much workers are paid for their labour. Private sector corporate giants need to hold discussions surrounding the importance of fair wages and living incomes and why Pakistan needs to prioritise this crucial aspect of economic justice.\n\nUnfair informal sector wages lead to cyclic poverty as workers toil for long hours and remain unable to afford necessities\n\nA fair wage is not merely a number on a pay slip. It represents the dignity and value of human labour. It ensures that individuals can afford necessities such as food, shelter, healthcare, and education for themselves and their families. In Pakistan, where a significant portion of the population struggles to make ends meet, fair wages can make a world of difference.\nImagine a scenario where a worker earns a wage that barely covers the cost of rent, let alone other essential expenses, after toiling for long hours. This is the reality for many in Pakistan\u2019s workforce. Without fair wages, workers are trapped in a cycle of poverty, unable to break free and improve their lives. This not only affects individuals but also hinders the overall development of the country.\nOne might argue that increasing wages could lead to higher business costs, potentially impacting profitability. However, the benefits of fair wages far outweigh the costs. When workers earn enough to meet their basic needs, they become more productive, leading to increased efficiency and quality of work. Moreover, higher wages translate into greater purchasing power, stimulating demand for goods and services and driving economic growth.\nPaying fair wages is not just a moral imperative but also a legal obligation. The Constitution of Pakistan guarantees the right to fair wages and equal remuneration for equal work.\nHowever, this right remains elusive for many, especially those working in the informal sector or as daily wage labourers. The government and businesses alike must ensure that this fundamental right is upheld and enforced across all sectors of the economy.\nSeveral organisations have made various efforts to implement fair wage policies. These initiatives range from setting minimum wage standards to providing inflation adjustments and comprehensive benefits packages. Such measures not only benefit workers but also contribute to employee satisfaction, retention, and, ultimately, organisational success.\n\nA salary is not merely a number on a pay slip but represents the dignity and value of human labour\n\nIt is important to note that fair wages contribute to social cohesion and stability. When workers are paid fairly, they feel valued and respected, leading to a more harmonious workplace environment. This, in turn, reduces the likelihood of labour disputes and strikes, fostering a conducive atmosphere for business operations and investment.\nFair wages are also essential for reducing income inequality, a pressing issue in Pakistan. The gap between the rich and the poor continues to widen, exacerbating social tensions and hindering social mobility. By ensuring that all workers receive fair compensation for their labour, Pakistan can take significant strides towards narrowing this gap and building a more equitable society.\nIt is worth noting that fair wages are not just a matter for the private sector; the government also has a crucial role to play. Through policies and legislation, the government can create an enabling environment for fair wages to thrive. This includes enforcing minimum wage laws, promoting collective bargaining rights, and incentivising businesses to adopt fair wage practices.\nInvesting in education and skill development is essential for ensuring that workers are equipped to command fair wages. By improving access to quality education and training programs, Pakistan can empower its workforce and enhance its productivity and earning potential.\nThe importance of fair wages serves as a wake-up call for Pakistan to prioritise this critical issue. Pakistan can create a more just, prosperous, and sustainable future for all its citizens by ensuring that all workers receive fair compensation for their labour.\nFair wages are good for workers, businesses, communities, and the nation as a whole. It is time for Pakistan to take bold steps towards making fair wages a reality for all.\nThe writer is the head of content at a communications agency.\n"

            "Text": "Notwithstanding Pakistan\u2019s commitment to aggressively implement the new International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, doubts persist among eminent analysts about whether Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb will be able to fulfil his pledges.\nAmong other factors, fears are grounded in historical records of missed targets, instability triggered by current political polarisation, and the fact that the country is facing its worst-ever economic crisis.\nAddressing the critical issue of getting out of the IMF programme, Mr Aurangzeb says it is \u201cto have a very clear roadmap\u201d.\nIn their initial discussions held in Washington, Pakistani officials advocated for \u201ca new IMF plan tailored more specifically to their country\u2019s needs.\u201d\n\nAnalysts question whether the new IMF programme will break Pakistan\u2019s chain of financial bailouts as strict monetary policies harm industrial output\n\n\u201cWe have our own views, and we\u2019ll share it with IMF,\u201d Mr Aurangzeb told journalists, adding that \u201cin terms of the size and duration of the programme, I would rather leave it to the joint meetings\u201d.\nPakistan has requested $6 billion to $8bn \u2014 termed as a \u2018guesstimate\u2019 by Aurangzeb \u2014 for the next Extended Fund Facility bailout package. He, however, stressed the importance of collaborative efforts for sustainable economic development.\nOn other hand, the IMF\u2019s Middle East and Central Asia director, Jihad Azour, argues, \u201cWhat is important at this stage is to accelerate the reforms, double down on the structure of reforms in order to provide Pakistan with its full potential of growth.\u201d\nAnalyst Dr Omar Javed says a more balanced approach is needed to both demand-side and supply-side policies. To quote Belgium-based economist Rizwan Rawji: \u201cIf India\u2019s supply-side leadership took the bold and correct steps towards economic prosperity, can\u2019t we in Pakistan?\u201d\n\u201cCollaborating for Growth\u201d was the theme of the 7th Leaders in Islamabad Summit held last week where the organisers called for \u201ca shared vision of a successful, sufficient and sustainable Pakistan\u201d. The event was attended by over 1,000 foreign and local delegates.\nThe government was ramping up support for industries, agriculture, and information technology to boost national growth above four per cent in the coming year.\nAnalysts pose a pertinent question: Will the new IMF programme break what the finance minister refers to as the \u201cchain of financial struggle and bailouts\u201d? As Pakistan could not complete the IMF programmes in the past for political reasons, they ask, \u201cwhat is different this time around?\u201d\nThe IMF has, again, advised Pakistan to keep its monetary policy strict \u2014 a policy that businesses argue has already taken a heavy toll on industrial output and the government\u2019s budget.\nAbout half of the current inflation rate \u2014 12pc of the estimate of 23pc for fiscal year 2024 \u2014 has been attributed to depreciation of the exchange rate by Dr Moazam Mahmood, Seemab Sajid, and Amna Noor at a conference organised by the Lahore School of Economics.\nIn an interview with Bloomberg, the finance minister said there would be no reason for the rupee to depreciate more than the range of about 6pc to 8pc witnessed in a normal year.\nHighlighting the \u201csolid foreign exchange reserves, a stable currency, rising remittances and steady exports\u201d, he added, \u201cThe only thing which can be a wild card, though we should be okay in our projections, is the oil price.\u201d\nHe expects Pakistan\u2019s foreign exchange reserves to reach \u201canywhere between $9bn to $10bn by the end of June\u201d.\nIn its latest move, the customs department plans to widen its oversight of Rs3.03 trillion worth of commodity imports by September to curb misinvoicing and under-invoicing practices.\nIn discussions with the IMF on the issue of export-led growth, the serious problems of deindustrialisation in Pakistan and rising global protectionism abroad need to feature prominently.\nMore than 2,500 protectionist industrial policies were introduced worldwide last year \u2014 roughly three times the number in 2019 \u2014 according to Patricia Cohen of The New York Times. In 2023, most of these policies were imposed by the richest, most advanced economies \u2014 many of which previously criticised such acts.\nIn an article titled \u2018Nations turn protectionist in pursuit of autonomy,\u2019 the writer points out that security, resilience, and self-sufficiency were pushed to the front of the list of economic policy goals along with growth and efficiency.\nIn response to the recent wave of state interventions, the IMF has drawn up a new set of guidelines for when and how industrial policies will be carried out. There are gains, the Fund says, if done right and used to address extraordinary market failures, like the dangers posed by climate change.\nIt is worth noting here that the IMF has clubbed Pakistan among six nations facing serious conflicts this year and said conflicts and tight monetary policy will affect their economic output.\nOnce the IMF loan is agreed upon, Pakistan will also request additional financing from the Fund\u2019s Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST).\nThe RST is intended to help low-income and vulnerable middle-income countries build resilience to external shocks and ensure sustainable growth, contributing to their longer-term balance of payments stability.\nThe next budget will reveal how steadfast the government will be in its commitment to undertaking reforms and how Mr Aurangzeb balances stability with fast growth, say an analyst.\n"

            "Text": "LAHORE: Former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi has likened seeking a bailout package from IMF by Pakistan to admitting failure to manage its affairs.\n\u201cApproaching the IMF to get a bailout package is in fact admitting that we have failed in managing our affairs, our economy on our own,\u201d he told a session of the Asma Jahangir Conference on A Growing Debt Burden: The Impact of State & IMF Policies here on Sunday.\nFormer governors of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Shahid Hafeez Kardar and Reza Baqir as well as ex-Punjab finance minister Dr Aisha Ghaus Pasha were also among the panellists.\nMr Abbasi regretted that the country had secured IMF packages 24 times, but each time failed to benefit from it because investment was not made in the export-oriented sectors, which is the only solution to national economic problems.\n\nPakistan borrowed $65bn in 65 years but doubled the debt in last 12 years, laments Dr Aisha Ghaus Pasha\n\nCriticising economic policies, he said rulers used to distribute free flour, 40 per cent of which is embezzled.\nReferring to negative impacts of IMF terms on the economic growth and prices, he said the lender did not give money to stabilise the economy but to recover its previous loans.\nHe said solution to fix the ailing economy lied in political stability and a just judicial system to give a sense of security to investors.\nHe was not hopeful of any relief for the masses in the coming budget because the IMF would give target-based funds.\nMr Kardar, the ex-SBP chief, said that the country\u2019s decline is self-inflicted as successive governments did not change their misplaced financial policies.\nHe said the state did not lack resources but rulers were spendthrift as even assistant commissioners were given precious luxury vehicles.\n\u201cDespite devolution of most of the state functions to provinces post-18th Amendment there exist 43 divisions in the federal government. This is because both the bureaucracy and politicians don\u2019t have the desire to curtail expenses and want to maintain their offices and ministries.\n\u201cThere are many offices of government agencies with functions unknown to the general public,\u201d he said.\nHe predicted that many government departments could not be privatised; rather these would have to be shut down for want of buyers.\nHe also lamented at delayed completion of projects leading to manifold increase in their cost and unbridled smuggling causing revenue loss in the form of taxes and eating out local industry.\nDr Baqir endorsed Mr Abbasi\u2019s views that economic stability depends on political stability and that taking loans is a shared problem of successive governments since 2007.\nHe said no single party could resolve the present crisis and all political forces would have to join hands for an economic turnaround. \u201cWe need a non-partisan plan and complete ownership to deal with the problem of debt burden.\u201d\nDr Pasha said that while Pakistan borrowed approximately $65 billion in the first 65 years of its existence, the country has doubled its external debt in just the last 12 years.\n"

I feel pity for his family members.  \n\u201cThe PTI has been ruling the KP for 10 years, but it has done nothing in the province as roads have not been constructed and because of this people have been facing problems,\u201d the information minister said. \n\u201cAt present politics of PTI revolves around dresses of Maryam Nawaz, what she eats and how she sits,\u201d Ms Bokhari claimed. \n\nAzma claims Punjab govt will soon provide various facilities to farmers\n\n\u201cThe culture of abusive language, introduced by the PTI is not being changed. Imran Khan, during his tenure as the prime minister, used to say he will not spare anyone and even now he is making the same statements from the jail,\u201d Ms Bokhari said, adding that PTI leaders are trying to hamper the development of the country. \nShe said prices of edible items had started coming down and the government will take further steps to resolve the issue. \nReferring to problems faced by farmers, she said the Punjab government is making efforts to address these issues and it will introduce modern machinery for farming and irrigation in the province.  \nShe said farmers will soon get fertilisers, seeds and a number of other facilities. \nMs Bokhari said the Punjab chief minister does not need social media to show her performance as her efforts was quite visible as she has reduced the price of roti and improved the sanitation system. \nShe said that in the past people had to run from pillar to post to get birth, death and a number of other certificates, but soon they will be issued through a helpline and people will not have to visit government departments for this purpose. \nThe minister said she will ensure that cases from Journalists Support Fund are processed at the earliest and a mechanism is prepared for this purpose. \nShe said Media Town Phase II will soon be announced in Rawalpindi and access of Metro bus will be provided to Media Town Phase I.\n"

It includes eight direct references to Mr Khan.\nDespite recent tensions, a State Department spokesperson reassured reporters that there is \u201cabsolutely no\u201d underlying discord between the United States and Pakistan.\nEmphasising Pakistan\u2019s significance as a regional partner, the spokesperson highlighted continued cooperation in security and trade sectors.\nThe US acting under secretary\u2019s visit underscores the ongoing diplomatic dialogue between the two countries, as they navigate shared challenges and opportunities in the region.\nHis visit comes on the heels of a significant diplomatic encounter when Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi made a strategic visit to three cities of Pakistan.\nDuring this visit, both nations articulated their shared ambition to elevate their trade relations from $2 billion to $10bn annually.\nIn response to this development, the US issued a cautionary statement, expressing concerns that heightened trade engagement with Iran could potentially trigger sanctions.\nThis stance underscores the delicate balance Pakistan must navigate in its diplomatic and economic relations with regional partners amid broader geopolitical dynamics.\n"

            "Text": "KARACHI: Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has said that the undocumented economy has been the biggest challenge for the country and the government is considering transition towards the digital solutions for its documentation.\nSpeaking during a session on Opening Doors with Fintech at a special World Economic Forum (WEF) meeting in Riyadh on Sunday, the finance minister said that approximately Rs10 trillion in cash is circulating in the market.\n\u201cWe generate Rs9.4 trillion in annual revenues, yet half of our economy remains undocumented,\u201d he stated.\nHe stressed the necessity for the country to envision its economic framework anew, following the footsteps of other nations that have successfully utilised digital solutions.\nThe finance minister stressed that the country has two important pillars that can propel the nation towards economic digitalisation.\n\nSBP governor Jameel says economy on path to recovery\n\n\u201cWe have national identification, supported by Nadra, and we have [a] real-time payment system called Raast. These are two important pillars with that we can start moving towards documenting the economy through digital solution,\u201d he said.\nMr Aurangzeb said that an agreement was signed with McKinsey on Friday to facilitate comprehensive digitalisation of the economy.\n\u201cThey are going to come in and help us with the end-to-end digitalisation of our economy. It is a huge priority for us,\u201d the finance minister said.\nHe noted that the government is extending the digital solutions to the informal sector to accelerate the process of documentation of the economy.\n\u201cBased on the latest figures I have, approximately 700,000 SMEs and around six million farmers are being offered credits through digital solutions. There is an absolute need for scaling up.\u201d\nFurthermore, the foreign minister emphasised the importance of extending digital solutions to women and the unbanked population segment.\n\u201cThe government is providing cash to the poor women of Pakistan. Women say that the male family members take cash from them. Unfortunately, that is a reality,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe women want to get the cash through the digital wallet,\u201d said the finance minister.\nHe said that harnessing digital transformation is crucial to address economic challenges effectively and promote inclusive growth across all segments of society.\nIn addressing macroeconomic challenges, the finance minister assured that the government is diligently working to steer the economy in the right direction.\nSBP governor applauds economic recovery\nSeparately, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Governor Jameel Ahmad has also acknowledged that the government\u2019s firm commitment and the SBP\u2019s efforts to respond to the macroeconomic challenges have resulted in a significant improvement in the economy.\nHe expressed his views while addressing the ICMA convocation in Karachi as the chief guest, according to a statement.\nHe noted that a year ago, Pakistan was facing a very challenging macroeconomic environment. \u201cInflation had reached as high as 38 per cent; foreign exchange reserves were rapidly depleting; the exchange rate was under a lot of pressure, and uncertainty was quite high.\n\u201cHowever, today, inflation is sharply decreasing; our reserves have risen to around $8 billion despite heavy debt repayments and will soon cross the $9 billion mark; the current account deficit has significantly narrowed, resulting in a stable rupee. Additionally, the stock market is reaching new highs,\u201d he added.\nThe SBP governor stressed the need for fresh perspectives and innovative solutions to address the longstanding issues facing the economy. This fresh perspective and innovative thinking have become more necessary as the global shocks facing the economy are becoming increasingly complex.\nHe shared that climate change, technological advancements, cybersecurity threats, and financial innovations are adding new dimensions to the risks to economic and financial stability.\n"

He emphasised that the country\u2019s future hinges on the supremacy of democracy and the strengthening of political parties.\nHe criticised the weakness of political parties, which, he argued, has empowered the establishment to rule the country according to its will. He expressed concerns about the current government and parliament, labelling them as the weakest institutions in history.\n\u201cAt present, the country\u2019s constitution is seeking self-preservation,\u201d he said, adding that elections were rigged across the country, including Balochistan, and the buying and selling of votes was rampant. \n\u201cPopular public leaders were ousted from parliament, and those brought in were not politically affiliated and had no connection with people,\u201d Dr Malik said, adding that instead of spending heavy sums of money, parliamentary seats were bartered, marking one of the most shameful chapters in political history.\n"

            "Text": "LAHORE: Amid speculations of talks with the establishment, the PTI has linked the proposed dialogue to the release of incarcerated leaders of the party, including its chief Imran Khan, as confidence-building measures by the powers that be.\nThe remarks by the PTI leaders came in light of an uproar to convince the PTI to hold a dialogue to steer the country out of political and economic crises amid conflicting statements by the top party officials.\nAgainst this backdrop, more and more party leaders, including those imprisoned, have suggested that the party should go for dialogue only after some tangible actions.\nTo set the groundwork for dialogue, some leaders suggested that all incarcerated party leaders be released on bail and the \u2018stolen mandate\u2019 of the PTI in the Feb 8 polls be returned.\nIn a joint letter to the party founder, Mr Khan, and the core committee, PTI\u2019s imprisoned leaders Senator Ejaz Chaudhry and former Punjab governor Omar Sarfraz Cheema suggested the party should go for dialogue only after some confidence-building measures.\n\nEjaz Chaudhry, Omar Cheema call for release of Imran, jailed supporters to build confidence\n\nThey said that the powers that be should ensure the release of Imran Khan and other PTI leaders and workers including the May 9 accused on bail. They also sought guarantees from the establishment.\nSenator Chaudhry and Mr Cheema stated that the dialogue agenda should include the formation of a judicial commission to probe the Feb 8 general elections and May 9 incidents.\nThey suggested that the proposed dialogue should ensure the complete restoration of the Constitution and scrutiny of \u201cunconstitutional steps\u201d taken by the caretaker governments.\nThey also suggested that the proposed dialogue should look for electoral reforms for free and fair elections, besides removing the incumbent chief election commissioner, Sikandar Sultan Raja.\nThe dialogue should also discuss and create an environment for democratic liberties, free speech and public meetings as allowed under the Constitution of Pakistan, they said.\nSeparately, PTI Central Punjab General Secretary Hammad Azhar asserted that Mr Khan would not talk to the establishment until the masses\u2019 stolen mandate was returned and all incarcerated party leaders were released.\nThe former federal minister, however, also claimed that the establishment \u201clacked credibility and ethics\u201d for a dialogue to kick-start.\n\u201cThe establishment had no credibility even before the May 9 false flag operation, which was used as an excuse to batter the PTI leaders and workers\u2026to achieve its political agendas,\u201d Mr Azhar alleged.\n\u201cThe Islamabad High Court judges faced no harassment or torture as compared to the establishment\u2019s might unleashed on PTI leaders and workers. The torture [on PTI workers]stories will baffle human beings,\u201d Mr Azhar lamented.\nThe PTI leader said \u201cmassive sacrifices\u201d had been offered by the PTI supporters and people enthusiastically voted for the PTI candidates. \u201cNow the ball is in the court of Imran Khan and nobody, except some cronies, was standing with the establishment,\u201d he claimed.\nPTI leader Moonis Elahi told Dawn that \u201ca productive dialogue\u201d could only happen after the stolen mandate was returned as a goodwill gesture to start talks with the establishment and the ruling political parties.\nPTI leader Shahbaz Gill said the PTI would not start a dialogue with a government that was not even empowered enough to appoint its interior minister and the Islamabad police chief.\n\u201cThe incumbent government is looking for dialogue with the PTI to become politically relevant and create an enabling environment for itself,\u201d said Mr Gill.\n\u201cImran Khan will be released soon and the government is trying to colour the prospective release as a deal,\u201d he said and asserted Mr Khan would never start a \u201cdialogue with thieves\u201d.\n"

            "Text": "MUZAFFARGARH/BAHAWALNAGAR: The officials of the Pakistan Agriculture Storage and Services Corporation (Passco) in Muzaffargarh and Bahawalnagar districts are facing criminal cases for illegal sale of gunny bags in the ongoing wheat procurement season.\nIn Muzaffargarh, the Jatoi police registered a case against Passco in charge of Fatehpur centre Muhammad Mohsin for selling 1,000 gunny bags for Rs700 per bag to traders on the complaint of the Jatoi assistant commissioner (AC). The police recovered the bags from traders.\nThe FIR states complainant Jatoi AC Tariq Mahmood Malik with his team raided different wheat procurement centres and found thousands of bags missing. A case with fraudulent charges was registered in Jatoi police under sections 419 and 420 of the Pakistan Penal Code against Mohsin.\nBefore the police case, the gunny bag embezzlement had been uncovered by Bardana Audit Committee convener Syed Sibtain Bukhari leading to Alipur AC\u2019s surprise visits to different wheat procurement centres of Passco. According to the audit team convenor, 21,000 gunny bags were illegally sold to traders in Alipur by Passco supervisors.\n \n \n\nThe Alipur AC and the convenor checked stock of various Passco centres, such as Khairpur Sadat, Sultanpur, Baqir Shah North, and Alipur, and found thousands of sacks illegally sold to traders even before the bags were distributed to the farmers. Mr Bukhari asked the Passco DGM to hold an inquiry, after which action will be taken against those officials involved in corruption.\nAccording to the report, the AC and the convenor checked the Passco centres at Sultanpur where Passco center in charge admitted that 11,000 bags were sold to traders illegally. The committee found 6,000 bags missing at Khairpur Sadat centre. The body found similar complaints at other centres.\nMr Bukhari said that he had sent a letter to the deputy commissioner and the chief minister\u2019s office. Dawn has learned, many traders of Muzaffargarh approached Passco centres in Alipur and Jatoi for gunny bags after offering bribes.\nIn Muzaffargarh district, Alipur and Jatoi tehsil are under Passco for wheat procurement, while Muzaffargarh tehsil and Kot Addu district are under the food department. The Punjab food department did not give even a single bag to farmers, while the Passco department started bag distribution to farmers, and one farmer can get six bags per acre. Farmers are worried about the non-provision of gunny bags while private buyers offer Rs3,000 per 40 kilograms to farmers.\nIn Muzaffargarh, Layyah, and Kot Addu districts, a majority of farmers were forced to sell their wheat to traders at the lowest rates after disappointment with the policy of the Punjab government, which introduced an app for gunny bags, where no farmers could log in. Several farmers said that in the future they could cultivate wheat only for themselves.\nThe Passco DGM was not available for comment, while Convenor Bukhari said that he had informed the high-ups for strict action against irresponsible officials.\nIn Bahawalnagar, a farmers\u2019 protest against the delayed provision of gunny bags, the sale of official gunny bags to factory owners, and the favouring of middlemen and politically affiliated people led to the district administration booking and arresting two factory owners for illegally procuring official gunny bags. The FIR, filed on the complaint of Naib Tehsildar of Dunga Bunga Muhammad Mushtaq, stated that on April 27, farmers demonstrated at the Khatan Passco purchasing center against the staff and the Incharge for selling official gunny bags to middlemen at rates of Rs400-500 per bag instead of providing them to farmers.\nOn April 28, the Bahawalnagar AC along with revenue and police officials visited the Muslim Cotton Factory on Haroonabad Road where the team observed that wheat from private gunny bags was being illegally loaded into Passco gunny bags. Along with seizing 3,000 illegally obtaining official gunny bags, each containing 100 kg of wheat, the team also seized 20,000 maunds of wheat in the factory. Cotton factory owners Muhammad Sajid Bashir and Muhammad Bashir later told the team that they got the official gunny bags from Khatan Passco In Charge Shujaat at the rate of Rs500 per bag. The team arrested the duo and sealed the factory with all available stock in it.\nThe DGM Passco was not available for comments.\nBahawalnagar Deputy Commissioner Zulfiqar Ahmad told Dawn that that they would take strict action against the elements exploiting farmers and the crackdown against such elements would continue.\n"

Some officials said that private buildings were being rented despite the health secretariat on Queens Road having enough space to accommodate these institutes to save public money. Also, the hardships of people increased manifold when they have to visit the \u2018scattered government health offices\u2019 in the provincial capital, as many issues were of a common nature involving multiple state-run institutes.\nAccording to documents, a monthly rent of Rs3.6 million is being paid by various offices of the Punjab Healthcare Commission (PHC). The commission\u2019s three head offices in rented buildings in Lahore are paying around Rs3 million, while offices in other cities are paying Rs600,000 every month. Three of the PHC offices located in Garden Town are paying Rs2.3 million, Rs387,750, and Rs280,000 in rent.\nThe Multan Region office in Multan is on a monthly rent of Rs205,000, the Bahawalpur Regional Office in Bahawalpur Rs106,945, and the Sargodha Region in Sargodha Rs130,000.\nSources say the health department has sufficient official buildings in these cities where these institutes can be shifted to avoid the loss of public money.\nSimilarly, the Punjab Health Initiative Management Company housed in a rented building in Gulberg of Lahore pays Rs1.3 million rent. This company has paid over Rs80 million in rent so far.\nThe Punjab Human Organ Transplant Authority pays Rs1.3 million rent to a private owner of the building in Shadman, whereas the office of the Punjab Pharmacy Council took a private villa on rent for Rs800,000 per month in Garden Town, Lahore.\nOfficials say that the huge expenses in the name of huge salary packages being drawn by the officials running these government offices are in addition to the millions of rupees going to the pockets of private building owners every month, while the performance of these institutes has been under question.\nWhile the government is spending millions on rent, poor and deserving patients have become rolling stones in the public sector major hospitals of Lahore where they were neither getting free medicines nor tests. The situation was so irritating that the five major government hospitals have been declared defaulters of Rs9 billion due to non-availability of funds. As as result, the supply of medicines has been suspended, most diagnostic facilities have been shut down, and surgeries postponed.\n"

She was of the view that the JI\u2019s narrative had been adopted in the Constitution, leading to the inclusion of anti-women laws in it.\nMallah also highlighted that Pakistan stands alone in its support for the Muslim Ummah, with other Muslim countries showing little concern.\nLala Robin, Chairman of the National Minorities Alliance of Pakistan, expressed the sense of loss felt by the minorities living in the country after the death of Asma Jahangir. He recalled how members of minority communities would approach Jahangir when facing discrimination.\nRobin lamented that minorities in Pakistan are still not mainstreamed.\nPastor Ghazala echoed these sentiments, stating that she had not seen any equality for religious minorities in the last 60 years in Pakistan. Despite numerous laws and international agreements, she claimed that none have been implemented in their true spirit. Ghazala called for the separation of state and politics from religion.\nPeter Jacob, Executive Director of the Centre for Social Justice, proposed the establishment of an inquiry commission on minority-related cases. He suggested that a national commission should be established through legislation in the parliament and run on a secular basis, not as a religious department.\nWriter Aamir Rana pointed out the state\u2019s failure to provide equal rights to its two percent minorities, calling it a challenge for the state\u2019s existence.\nReem Alsaleem, UN Special Rapporteur, discussed gender bias, stating that it is motivated by gender discriminatory practices. These biases can magnify based on a woman\u2019s religious and ethnic status. Alsaleem criticised the way self-identification legislation has been put forward, arguing that it has ignored the concerns of women\u2019s groups.\n"

            "Text": "Naveed Shahzad is a well-known poet, research scholar and literary critic having more than a score of books to his credit. His latest publication \u2018Sutlej da Tazia (In mourning for Sutlej)\u2019, a collection of poems, has been published by Ravel Publications, Lahore. All of us who enjoy modern Punjabi poetry know that Naveed Shahzad is a modernist poet who strives to get rid of the debris of traditional poetry which hangs around our neck like an Albatross disallowing us to breathe freely.\nHis creative effort is bold and relentless as is shown by his latest book. His poems are visibly marked by three elements. One, some of his poems at the structural level combines poetry and prose. Poetry and prose traditionally have been two distinct ways of expression. In the early 20th century, it was felt that essential difference between prose and poetry is not that of formal structure. It lies in the different modes of looking at things. Poetry in the traditional mould can be less poetic than prose in a poetic mould. In some of Naveed\u2019s poems, we find together what is traditionally viewed as poetry and prose. A poem begins in a meter and then switches over to prose. So it is poetry interspersed with prose or prose interspersed with poetry that creates a distinct impression.\nApart from him we find Najam Hosain Syed, our great poet, employing this technique in some of his poems in recent years. Two, Naveed uses myths or allusions to myths as a means to decipher the underlying meanings of current reality giving it a quasi-historical context. Myth, we must remember, is born of reality in an effort to understand it. Reality of myth and myth of reality are intertwined. Poetic imagination is always fascinated by such a phenomenon pregnant with suggestive meanings. Three, there is an urgency to explore and convey what we have lost or losing fast; rivers, trees, birds, i.e. nature. In our terrible predicament we are reduced to seeing what he calls \u2018paradise hung on the hanger\u2019. In his poems a sense of loss creates angst and anguish laced with subdued anger at the ugliness that impoverishes us.\nLet\u2019s savour a few lines of one of his poems: \u201cEarth, you are like a twig fallen from (baya) weaver\u2019s bill / What do you know how someone spends their days in the branches? / What do you know how it\u2019s like flying holding one\u2019s family in one\u2019s bill? / let me tell it\u2019s flying like people walking away never to return\u2026\u201d What is striking about Naveed Shahzad\u2019s poems is their uncanny freshness. One can feel it but cannot hold it as something definite or fully defined which creates the possibility of multiple interpretations. The book is a valuable addition to the repertoire of modern poetry which is still limited.\n\u2018Loh-e Izhar\u2019 is Syed Shabbir Ahmed\u2019s latest book published by Misaal Publishers, Faisalabad. The author, we are told in the blurb, already has more than two dozen publications to his credit. \u201cThis book revolves around history, a visitor\u2019s observations, personalities and books\u2026Translations of stories from foreign land, tales, autobiographies, novels and chronicles have been discussed while poetry, Sufism, travelogues and music have not been left out,\u201d says Prof Ghazi about the book.\nThe subtitle of the book shows that it contains literary reviews and reportage. The book is divided into two segments; literary reviews (of a number of books) and reportage. The former has some interesting entries such as the region of Khari, some lost pages of history of Mirpur, Pothohar, Farrukh Yar\u2019s \u2018Ishq Name\u2019, neighbouring states of Kashmir, Yasir Jawad\u2019s autobiography, and Krishan Chandra\u2019s reminiscences about Kashmir. The latter called \u2018Reportage\u2019 is obviously about author\u2019s observations and impressions.\nShabbir Ahmed takes us on an England\u2019s tour. He shows us Shakespeare\u2019s ancestral home, Bronte Sisters\u2019 village, a festival of Punjabi, Pothohari and Pahari languages /dialects in Birmingham and launch of Mahpara\u2019s book \u2018Mera zamana, Meri Kahani\u2019 etc. The author\u2019s tone in most places is laudatory rather than critical as is the tradition in our part of the world where critical evaluation of any piece of writing is considered rude. So the author has to be careful; he/she should have the knack of not offending anyone while discussing an event or a book.\nShabbir Ahmed knows how to steer clear of analyses which may cause a controversy. His style of writing is unambiguous and thus easily accessible. The book offers a lot of information and informed views on history, literature and culture.\nA collection of Javed Asif\u2019s short stories in Sariaki titled \u2018Puth Durr\u2019 has been published by Fiction House. The author is a known poet, fiction writer, translator and research scholar. He lives in the boondocks but seems to be well-connected with the contemporary literature and literary trends. The book has 17 stories with an introduction by Mussarat Kalanchvi, a well-known fiction writer. \u201cJaved Asif has a strong perception of social deprivations, and exposes social distinctions and injustices. He is aware of the artistic needs of fiction writing. That\u2019s the reason we find in his stories at times an eerie mystique that keeps the readers engaged and doesn\u2019t let their attention wander. And his story may have an end which nobody would have thought of,\u201d she writes in the introduction.\n\u201c\u2026Javed Asif as a writer has a quality; he writes the story of today. That\u2019s how he will be remembered,\u201d writes Muhammad Hafeez Khan, another reputable fiction writer, in his blurb. His stories focus on ordinary mortals whose existence in a rigidly hierarchical class society displays their constant struggle to not only retain their sanity but also maintain modicum of self-respect. Economic misery, social injustice, gender discrimination and class oppression inbuilt in the system constantly batter them in a systemic effort to dehumanise them. They are forced by their socio-economic conditions to live less than individuals and little more than types playing the roles assigned to them by traditions. The stories are reflective of author\u2019s progressively inclined worldview showing the reality of human situation not as natural but as constructed by a class system we all are condemned to live with. Living at the periphery of one\u2019s centre can enable them to experience life what it is; harsh at best and unforgiving at worst. \u2014 soofi01@hotmail.com\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: After resolving the controversy over two training camps, a selection committee announced an 18-member Pakistan hockey squad for the upcoming Sultan Azlan Shah Cup, which will be held in Malaysia from May 4 to May 11.\nSeasoned Ammad Shakeel Butt will lead the team with defender Abu Bakar as his deputy. The three-member selection committee consisting of head coach Roelant Oltmans, Monzoor-ul-Hasan Sr., and deputy director-general of the Pakistan Sports Board Mohammad Shahid Islam finalised the squad.\nThe team comprises two goalkeepers \u2014 Abdullah and Muneeb-ur-Rehman, while it includes six defenders \u2014 Usman Bashir, Athisham, Mohammad Abdullah, Sufiyan, Abu Bakar, and captain Shakeel Butt. Midfielders Salman Razzaq, Arshad Liaqat, Moin Shakeel, Zakriya Hayat, Murtaza Yaqoob, and Ghazanfar Ali have also been selected.\nForwards Abdul Rehman, Hanan, Rana Waheed, and Ejaz Ahmed complete the squad.\nMeanwhile, seven players have been selected as standbys, including Akmal Hussain, Aqeel Ahmed, Arbaz, Hammad Anjum, Abdul Rehman Jr., Abdul Manan, and Rooman.\nIt is worth noting that the Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) was recently split in two factions, one headed by Tariq Bugti and the other by Shehla Raza, both conducting separate training camps.\nThe camp organised by Shehla in Karachi announced a 20-member squad last week. However, after intervention by the federal government, players announced by the Shehla group were brought to Islamabad.\nFollowing trials on Sunday, a new team was announced, comprising players from both camps. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had taken notice of these rival groups, and his coordinator on youth affairs Rana Mashhood played an important role in the selection of the new team.\nHe announced on Friday that the issue of rival groups would also be settled within the next two days. The members of the selection committee stated that while 18 players have been selected for the Azlan Shah Cup, these players and the seven standbys will form the team for the Nations Cup as well, to be held in Poland from May 31 to June 9.\nThey added that a total of 44 players participated in pre-selection and trials, with 35 being selected for final trials.\nSpeaking to Dawn, former Olympian and Pakistan head coach Shahnaz Sheikh said that a balanced team was selected from the available pool of players. He suggested having at least six forwards instead of four.\nNonetheless, he expressed satisfaction with the team\u2019s selection and advised them to adopt an aggressive and attacking approach to achieve good results.\nShahnaz emphasised that playing with an attacking mindset and solid defense would lead to success.\n"

He will also lead the team in the next year\u2019s Champions Trophy, T20 Asia Cup and the 2026 T20 World Cup. \n\u201cGillespie will assume responsibilities for the ICC World Test Championship fixtures against Bangladesh (at home in August), followed by Tests against England (at home in October) and South Africa (away in December) in the 2024-25 season,\u201d added the PCB in a press statement.\nIn their remarks, both Gillespie and Kirsten expressed gratitude for their appointments and outlined their visions for the team\u2019s future success.\n\u201cI am grateful to the PCB for their faith in my abilities and giving me the honor of coaching one of the most highly-regarded and talented cricket teams in the traditional format of the sport,\u201d Gillespie said in a statement.\nGary Kirsten, meanwhile, remarked: \u201cIt\u2019s a tremendous honor to be entrusted with the responsibility of coaching the Pakistan men\u2019s national team in white-ball cricket and to rejoin the international cricket arena after some time.\u201d\nGillespie, a 49-year-old, boasts an illustrious cricket career, including coaching stints with Yorkshire County Cricket Club, Adelaide Strikers, Sussex, and South Australia.\nKirsten, 56, brings extensive coaching experience, having previously coached the Indian and South African national teams, as well as various IPL franchises.\nMohsin expressed optimism regarding Pakistan\u2019s future prospects under the new coaching staff, aiming to elevate the team to world-class status across all formats of the game.\nThe PCB chief praised the national selection committee\u2019s choices for the coaching staff, emphasising unity and merit as crucial elements for Pakistan\u2019s future success in cricket. He extended his congratulations to Kirsten, Gillespie, and Azhar for their appointments.\nMohsin commended Azhar\u2019s commitment to the national team, highlighting his decision to relocate from England to work with the Pakistan squad. Azhar previously served as the head coach during the recent series against New Zealand, which ended in a 2-2 draw.\nFurthermore, Mohsin announced that the PCB would soon appoint new coaches for the national women\u2019s team, emphasising equal opportunities and the promotion of women\u2019s cricket on the international stage.\nMeanwhile, Azhar emphasised the need for Pakistan to increase their average score in T20 matches to over 190, highlighting improvements in running between the wickets, fielding, and minimising extras as key areas for achieving this target.\nMohsin later announced the PCB\u2019s will cover the medical expenses of three young cricketers injured during a tape-ball cricket match in Balochistan on Saturday.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Sports Board (PSB) is facing stark criticism on social media for not getting the premises of a boxing academy vacated from the Frontier Corps (FC), a paramilitary force, whose personnel have been residing at the place for almost two years.\nSeveral years ago, Amir Khan, a prominent Britain-born Pakistani boxer, established an academy at the Pakistan Sports Complex in Islamabad to help young boxing aspirants in Pakistan train and excel there.\nThe academy remained functional for some years. However, in 2022 the PSB got it vacated apparently for \u201crenovation and overhauling\u201d. However, later FC was shifted to the premises of the academy and since then their personnel have been living there.\nThe matter emerged on Friday, when Amir expressing his concerns in a video message stated that the facility instead of promoting boxing was being used for FC\u2019s residence. \u201cFC should go back,\u201d the former world champion boxer, who signed an MoU with the PSB in 2015 for the academy, said in his video.\nAmir further said that some Pakistan boxers had messaged him that they were unable to train at the academy, saying that it was closed. Noting that he had taken up the matter with government officials concerned, Amir regretted that nothing had happened during the past one year \u201cand maybe over one year\u201d.\nMeanwhile, speaking to Dawn, a PSB official said that a strategy was being made to get the facility vacated. According to another official, the issue had already been taken up with the Interior Ministry.\n\u201cWe hope that the facility will be vacated soon, we are making efforts to get it vacated [even] tonight,\u201d claimed a PSB official.\n"

            "Text": "LAHORE: While acknowledging that his team need to lift their game overall ahead of this year\u2019s T20 World Cup, Pakistan captain Babar Azam has said that the batsmen need to lift their game in middle overs. \n\u201cWe are struggling significantly to get quick runs in middle overs. To improve in this area, we tested Iftikhar Ahmed, [all-rounder] Shadab Khan and [top-order batter] Usman Khan up the order under our rotation policy. But unfortunately injuries to Mohammad Rizwan, Azam Khan and Irfan Khan Niazi hit our plans in this series [against New Zealand],\u201d Babar said during a presser after Pakistan survived a scare while registering a narrow nine-run win over an under-strength New Zealand team in a thrilling fifth T20 International here at the Gaddafi Stadium on Saturday night.\nThe result ended the five-match series tied at 2-2 with one game in Rawalpindi washed out.\n\u201cWe are scoring 50 runs on average in powerplay [first six overs] which is not bad but we should add 40-odd runs from seven to 10 overs and 90 to 100 in the last ten overs with power hitting, particularly in the last five overs,\u201d the captain added.\nPakistan, Babar further said, also still lacked in fielding department. \u201cThough the boys have made some improvement, more work has to be done in this area.\u201d\nAs captain Babar was not satisfied with the result of the series against New Zealand, saying \u201cthe home team should have won by bigger margin\u201d.\nBut, he said, as Pakistan currently were going through a rotation policy, some margin should be given to the team.\nHe praised Shaheen Shah Afridi, who tilted Saturday\u2019s match in Pakistan\u2019s favour with three wickets after breaking the opening partnership quickly to finish with four wickets for 30 runs in the match to help Pakistan restrict New Zealand to 169 all out.\n\u201cIn my last interview I had said that Shaheen is [our] best bowler and he knows how to make a comeback. He is mentally strong and dedicated and fighter too and the way he gave us [the] wickets at a crucial time made me significantly happy as captain,\u201d Babar said.\nHe lauded for Azam, saying the team also missed him. \u201cHe has the talent to change the match with his power hitting in a few overs.\u201d\nBabar also expressed satisfaction over the performances produced by pacer Mohammad Amir and all-rounder Imad Wasim, who played their first international series against New Zealand, after withdrawing their retirement last month.\nWhile noting that Pakistan could not post 200-plus in any match of the T20 series against New Zealand, Babar said, \u201cSometimes it also depends on nature of the pitches. Our team has crossed 200 in many T20s at the same grounds [in Rawalpindi and Lahore].\u201d\nBabar also defended attacking young opener Saim Ayub, whose performance remained below par against New Zealand.\n\u201cSaim has loads of talent and he with his attacking strokeplay can put the rivals on back-foot; he should be given some more opportunities,\u201d the skipper stated.\n\u201cAs Pakistan still have seven to eight T20s left ahead of the World Cup [June 1-29] the places are still up for grabs.\u201d\nHe also defended new entrants like Usman, emphasising that the richly-talented batter had just become part of the Pakistan team and required some time to settle and prove his credentials at the highest level.\nMeanwhile, New Zealand skipper Michael Bracewell expressed his delight over his team\u2019s performance against a strong side like Pakistan.\n\u201cOverall it was a good entertaining series. Pakistan also played good cricket and my boys also learnt a lot by playing against [their] big players,\u201d off-spinning all-rounder Bracewell said after the match.\nAbout losing the fifth T20 from a good position, Bracewell said despite the slump they fought till the very end.\n\u201cUnfortunately we in middle-orders lost some quick wickets to go on backfoot but still the players did pretty well by fighting till the last moment.\u201d\nBracewell said his team played outstanding cricket in Pakistan for which all members of the touring team deserved applause.\n\u201cInternational matches have very different pressure, and my young players coped with it [pretty] well,\u201d the New Zealand skipper said and appreciated the crowds in Rawalpindi and Lahore who came in big numbers to watch the action.\nNew Zealand coach Gary Stead, speaking after the fifth T20, said he was proud of the way his team bounced back to draw the series in Pakistan even if it is unlikely that several members of the touring side will make his World Cup squad.\nStead, who will name his squad for June\u2019s World Cup in the US and Caribbean on Monday, was content with that turnaround after a seven-wicket thrashing in the first match to be completed in Rawalpindi.\n\u201cI\u2019m very proud of the way our team played,\u201d Stead told reporters.\n\u201cWe had a disappointing first hit out and where we were soundly beaten but to bounce back from that I thought was really pleasing and I think there\u2019s a few young guys that have certainly increased their stocks over here.\n\u201cLet\u2019s not forget Pakistan only two years ago were World Cup finalists and ... for us to compete with them I think was really, really pleasing for us.\u201d\n"

Rural women preferred home-based  work but, after educational development, parents are now sending  children to schools, believing change is only possible through  education.\u201d \nHR director Abdul Jabbar Mari said that communities  played a crucial role in fostering positivity but expecting results from  a struggling community without making investment was unjust.  \nHe  said that investing in communities to help them realise their  importance yielded better results. Enhance trust in community by  recognising its ability to send children to school. \u201cWomen, in  particular, excel in this role, as they effectively create enabling  environments. Whether as mothers, sisters, wives, or daughters, they  embody excellence. We take pride in our partnerships,\u201d he said. \nMs  Rana Hussain, educationist and keynote speaker, was astonished at women  partners\u2019 talent and said these women represented transformation which  triggered change within local communities through entrepreneurial  endeavours in education. \nShe emphasised the need for a more  serious approach, advocating infusion of positivity into mainstream  culture and said Sindh was the only province where education was  conducted in mother tongue, underscoring responsibility of every woman  to raise awareness among populace, especially those blessed with  abundance. \nSEF managing director Abdul Kabir Kazi highlighted  remarkable achievement of SEF, with approximately 260 women managing 300  schools and announced launch of \u2018Care for Life\u2019 programme for 300  schools, which was aimed at educating children in how to interact with  nature, society, animals and fellow humans.\n"

He said the government was facilitating the privileged class by raising taxes and prices of petroleum products after every fortnight. He said that declared and undeclared taxes were being imposed in order to meet state expenses and perks.\nHe said that instead of doing away with its own expenses, financial privileges and free concessions, the government was looking towards the IMF, World Bank and other financial institutions, governments and companies. He said that Pakistan\u2019s important assets were being privatised at throw-away prices which could lead to disastrous consequences.\nHe said that unless the political conditions of Pakistan were corrected by making them people-friendly, situation would not improve. He said the right of rule of the federating units and nations would have to be accepted and people\u2019s trust would have to be won. Unless these issues were fixed, the question of improving the conditions simply did not arise, he added.\nHe said Pakistan needed massive reforms, pro-people and revolutionary in nature, and such reforms could only be brought about by an ideological revolutionary political leadership in collaboration with the mass participation, therefore, expecting some good from corrupt, incompetent, opportunist and business-oriented leadership was tantamount to deceiving ourselves.\nHe urged students, youths, labourers, women, peasants, farmers, intellectuals, journalists and lawyers to adopt the path of unified struggle to get rid of repeatedly-tested rulers responsible for that exploitative system. He said that such decision could lead to the path of popular revolution.\n"

The chief minister replied: \u201cI am aware of the problems being faced by the people due to delay in completion of the project and [I am] making efforts to resume it.\u201d\nThe project has many components like construction of two separate corridors from Malir Halt Depot to Mausmiyat (Lot-1) and Mosumiyat to Numaish (Lot-2) and, two bus depots, biogas plant/station and purchase of buses.\nFormer federal minister and Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan leader Aminul Haq said the project was being executed in a vast area housing d six universities and more than two million people including students of these universities have been suffering from dug-up roads, open drains and dust on a daily basis.\n \n \n\nThe Rs79 billion Asian Development Bank (ADB) funded biogas based fuel Red Line bus project was started in 2022 and it was supposed to be completed in 2025.\nInitially, the contractors started construction work and after completing five per cent work they stopped it in view of cost escalation, lack of required land, delay in designing and non-cooperation of Sindh government.\nA recent meeting of the board of TransKarachi held last month had approved provision of cost escalation by 30 per cent after which the overall cost of the project may go up from Rs79 billion to Rs103 billion.\n\u2018Work may resume in three to four months\u2019\nDr Sharoosh Lodi, the vice chancellor of the NED University of Engineering and Technology, said that many of the bottlenecks in the project had been removed.\nDr Lodi, who is the chairman of the board of, said even then work on the project might take one month or so to resume.\nHowever, sources in TransKarachi said it would take at least three to four months to resume the work on the project as labourers and workforce of contractors had already left for their hometowns to celebrate Eidul Fitr and they would likely to return after celebrating Eidul Azha.\nDr Lodi said that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) had given the go-ahead to resume the project.\nHe agreed that the non-acquisition of the land in Malir Halt from Rangers for the construction of a bus depot was one of the reasons behind the delay in the project.\n\u201cThe Rangers were reluctant to relocate their base from Malir Halt as they were providing security to the airport from there,\u201d he said, adding that now another piece of land was given to the Rangers so that the bus depot could be established at the proposed site.\nDr Lodi said the second bus depot was earlier proposed at the Mosamiat area but now it would be established at the 16-acre land of now demolished Alladin Park on Rashid Minhas Road.\nThe project has a Lot-3 under which a biogas plant was going to be established. However, the sources said that Sindh government had so far not awarded the contract for establishment of the plant.\nAnother official said that the Sindh government had managed to address one of the basic demands of the contractors as the Executive Committee of National Economic Council (ECNEC) had approved required escalation of cost keeping in view of inflationary factors and increase in the prices of construction material like steel, cement and diesel.\n"

On April 29, 1974 it was reported the day before a literary event was held to celebrate Shah Latif\u2019s life and work at S M College under the auspices of the Sindhi Adabi Majlis. The Provincial Minister for Transport and Communications, Mir Hazar Khan Bijarani, in his speech paid glowing tributes to Shah Latif calling him a great mystic poet by highlighting his literary accomplishments and his impact on the people of Sindh. Prof Ayaz Qadri described him as one of the giants of world literature because of his \u2018noncontroversial\u2019 personality and the universal nature of his poems. Zaman Shah, President of the Majlis, talked about the various aspects of the poet and the contents of Shah jo Risalo.\nShah Latif had a heart of gold and strongly felt about the struggling segments of society. The working class in any society has always had its fair share of struggles. On April 30, the Muttahida Mazdoor Federation took out a huge torchlight procession in connection with May Day. The five-mile journey started from Shaheed Chowk in Banaras Colony and terminated at Bara Board at Manghopir (SITE) passing through Abdullah College, Paposhnagar, Nazimabad and First Chowrangi. It was led by the leaders of the federation Babar Khan, Ayaz Khan and Nausher Khan. The participants carried banners and raised slogans urging the government to provide basic necessities to workers.\nIn a similar vein, on May 1, the city\u2019s journalists resolved to continue upholding the banner of the Chicago workers for a proletarian revolution in the world. At a meeting of the Karachi Union of Journalists (KUJ) arranged at the Karachi Press Club (KPC) they said they would resist all attempts at dividing the working class on the basis of caste, creed, colour, nationality and religion. All present observed a minute\u2019s silence in memory of the fallen Chicago workers. Those who spoke on the occasion included Habib Ghori, Zafar Rizvi, Hasan Abidi, Abdul Hameed Chapra, Arshad Shad, Iqbal Bukhari, Ghulam Nabi Khirkiwala and Inam Durrani. Poets Naqqash Kazmi and Mujeeb Khairabadi recited their poems and Aziz (cartoonist) read Iqbal\u2019s Lenin Khuda Ke Huzur.\n\nShah Abdul Latif Bhittai and May Day\n\nA big number of people representing low-income groups or the middleclass use public transport. On May 4, it was announced that the Regional Transport Authority (RTA) would take serious action against drivers of taxis and rickshaws for refusing to carry passengers and for overcharging. The Provincial Transport Minister had issued orders to the effect following complaints lodged by the public. It was pointed out by the RTA that under the terms of agreement no driver of a public vehicle could refuse to take passengers, especially during peak hours. Badly hit by this attitude of drivers and vehicles\u2019 owners were the suffering patients, housewives and persons in need of emergency care.\nAnother mode of public transportation was in the news on April 30 when this newspapers in a story said that one person was caught red-handed for allegedly selling two tickets of Awami Express for extra Rs40 at Cantt Station.\n"

            "Text": "KARACHI: The 7th International Conference on Urban and Regional Planning (CURP) concluded on Saturday with some experts calling for urgent action to address the issues of impermeable surfaces and (unregulated) extraction of underground water in Karachi.  \nThey also emphasised the need for nature-based solutions for mega cities and inclusive and sustainable planning to tackle the multifaceted challenges associated with informal settlements.  \nThe conference titled Urban Ecology, Sustainable Planning and Inclusivity; Issues and Challenges was organised by the department of architecture and planning at the NED university.  \nIt featured diverse discussions underscoring the complexity of urban challenges and importance of innovative solutions grounded in sustainability, inclusivity, and community engagement.  \nOn the concluding day, urban planning expert Faseeha Waheed delivered a thought-provoking presentation on the challenges and considerations of applying nature-based solutions for future megacities, with a focus on Karachi\u2019s potential as a \u2018sponge city\u2019.  \nThe urban planning expert underscored the urgent need to address issues such as degradation of soil nutrients, impermeable surfaces, and water extraction, while advocating for incentives to promote the use of permeable materials in building construction.  \nGiving a presentation on her study on urban densification of informal settlement in Gulshan-i-Iqbal, Afshan Jamshed, assistant professor at Sir Syed University of Engineering and Technology, said that the research comprehensively investigated the impacts of rapid densification and the proliferation of informal settlements in Karachi, focusing on Zia-ul-Haq Colony in Gulshan-i-Iqbal.  \nThe research, she said, highlighted the importance of inclusive and sustainable planning to address the multifaceted challenges associated with informal settlements by examining the built environment, building materials, and spatial dynamics.  \nAnother study by Asma Siddika, assistant professor at Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology, Bangladesh, delved into multifaceted experiences of single young adults navigating the challenges of urban living, particularly in Dhaka.  \nBy examining spatial dimensions, social isolation, housing instability, and the quest for meaningful connections, the research shed light on complexities of single adulthood in the city, with implications for urban planning and social policy.\nDr Abid Mehmood, senior lecturer at Cardiff University, UK, in his paper titled \u201cInfinite injustice: Bottom-linked governance of urban informality for social inclusion\u201d highlighted the importance of bottom-linked governance in the age of \u2018caring neo-liberalism\u2019.  \nConference keynote speaker was noted architect Tariq Alexander Qaiser who started off with his documentary titled Karachi Islands, the Enchanting Forests, highlighting the role of mangrove forests in the ecological landscape of Karachi.  \nMr Qaiser\u2019s documentary and the speech was followed by a panel discussion during which he remarked that personal desires and interests were destroying the future.  \nHe raised certain questions such as; will our species survive? How will the concept of equity change? Will it be real or aspirational? Equity and justice both feel like alien concepts, he opined.  \nEarlier, Dr Anila Naeem, chairperson of the department of architecture and planning at the NED University shared that the conference served as a platform for robust discussions and knowledge-sharing aimed at addressing the multifaceted issues plaguing urban environments worldwide.  \nIt aimed to inspire innovative solutions and transformative approaches to urban planning and development, she added.\n"

Many times people would dissuade her from going to certain political protests or visit jails for checking up on prisoners, especially on account of her being a woman, but she was always found on the front lines, he said.  \nHe also recounted her selfless decision to live among the working class in her last years before passing away.\nHistorian Dr Tahira Khan highlighted Prof Wahid\u2019s significant contributions to the education and empowerment of women in Pakistan.  \nShe lauded Prof Wahid\u2019s commitment to the working class and her role in shaping a more equitable society.\nDr Tahira also said that there was a dire need to create awareness among the youth of personalities who have valuable contributions for the people of the country.  \nPresident of Irtiqa Institute Kaleem Durrani thanked the speakers and requested Dr Syed Tipu Sultan, chancellor of Malir University of Science and Technology, Karachi, to present a shield to Prof Zaidi as a token of appreciation.\n"

Mr Dar is currently accompanying PM Shehbaz at the World Economic Forum\u2019s (WEF) special meeting in Saudi Arabia.\nThe appointment of 73-year-old Ishaq Dar as the deputy prime minister raises many questions. The main talking point is around PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif wanting to have his \u201cconfidant\u201d in a key position in the federal cabinet to compensate him for the loss of the finance portfolio.\nThe move was also seen in the context of Nawaz Sharif taking over the reins of the ruling party as its president, a position he had lost following his conviction in the Panama Papers case.\nA senior cabinet member told Dawn that the decision to appoint Ishaq Dar was made \u201cjointly\u201d by Nawaz and Shehbaz Sharif. \u201cIt shows that there is no division in the party,\u201d he claimed. The minister claimed it was an \u201cold practice\u201d to appoint a senior minister as the deputy prime minister and Mr Dar \u201cdeserved\u201d this position being the \u201csenior-most member\u201d of the government.\nAnother insider, however, claimed that the move was \u201cpre-planned\u201d. At the time of the formation of the coalition government, it was decided that Ishaq Dar would become the deputy PM. \u201cIt was decided from the very first day that Ishaq Dar would be the deputy prime minister in the present government,\u201d the source added.\nWhen contacted, senior PML-N leader Irfan Siddiqui told Dawn Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was \u201cfully authorised to give any additional charge to anyone within the government\u201d.\n\u201c\u2026there is no harm if the prime minister gives an additional charge of deputy prime minister to anyone,\u201d he claimed, likening the posting to the US system, where the president can appoint anyone to his cabinet.\nBut Mr Siddiqui rejected the impression that Ishaq Dar was given the key position in the cabinet on the directive of Nawaz Sharif. \u201cThere is no divide in the PML-N ranks as all party members consider Nawaz Sharif as their top leader.\u201d\nA senior PML-N leader, who did not want to be named, told Dawn that the party called a meeting of its general council on May 11 in Lahore in which Nawaz Sharif would again be elected as party president. \u201cNawaz Sharif, who was earlier reluctant to hold the office of the party president is now ready to lead the party again\u2026,\u201d he added. Responding to a question, he revealed that senior PML-N leaders convinced Nawaz Sharif to again become the PML-N president.\nHe said the elder Sharif was likely to become the president because PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif and Senior Vice President Maryam Nawaz were busy with their respective government matters, having little time for party affairs. \u201cThis is the reason that Nawaz Sharif is once again being made the party president,\u201d he added.\nKey Nawaz aide\nAs a senior party leader and a close relative of Nawaz Sharif, Ishaq Dar is said to be the key confidante of Nawaz Sharif in the party. He served as the federal minister for commerce and investment in the 1997-99 government of Nawaz Sharif and then the finance minister at least four times: 1998-1999, 2008, 2013-2017, and 2022-23.\nIt is pertinent to mention that when Nawaz Sharif was the prime minister of the country, Ishaq Dar was acting as the de-facto deputy prime minister, heading dozens of government and parliamentary committees as its chairperson.\nAlthough there is no provision for a deputy prime minister in the Constitution, Ishaq Dar is the second lawmaker to become deputy premier since the turn of the century. This position was previously held by then-PML-Q leader Parvez Elahi, now PTI president, in June 2012.\nBefore his first assignment as a federal minister, Mr Dar was appointed minister of state/chief executive of the Pakistan Investment Board (PIB) from 1992 to 1993. He also served as president of the Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry.\nIn 2008, Dar briefly assumed the duties of federal finance minister but resigned from the position after PML-N decided to part ways with the PPP-led coalition government.\nHe also served as the finance minister in then-PM Nawaz\u2019s government in 2013. He was reappointed as the finance minister of Pakistan from September 2022 till the end of the coalition government\u2019s tenure in August 2023.\nDespite being the PML-N\u2019s go-to finance expert for decades, he was surprisingly made the minister of foreign affairs when PM Shehbaz picked his new cabinet in March of this year, with his preferred finance portfolio going to Muhammad Aurangzeb.\nThe PPP, the main ally of the PML-N-led government, did not raise any objection to the appointment.

He studied law at Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar and pursued graduate education at Harvard Law School. He worked as a lawyer with a law firm in New York and, while living and working in the US, was issued the \u201cPermanent Resident Card\u201d (also called \u201cGreen Card\u201d) after being regarded as a person of extraordinary ability. He left his job in the US in 2005 and returned to Pakistan, where he has lived and worked since then.\nAccording to the US government\u2019s Citizenship and Immigration Services, a Green Card allows individuals to live and work permanently in the US. However, they are still not considered citizens.\nThe US constitution grants certain rights exclusively to citizens, such as voting, bringing family members to the US, obtaining citizenship for children born abroad, travelling with US passport, becoming eligible for federal jobs and becoming an elected official.\nIn common parlance, a Green Card is considered a step towards naturalisation, but does not entail the award of citizenship or a US passport.\nThe IHC statement said that Justice Babar Sattar\u2019s wife and children are citizens of both Pakistan and the US. They were living in the US until 2021, but returned to Pakistan after Justice Babar Sattar was appointed as a judge of the IHC and now reside in Islamabad. Prior to Justice Sattar\u2019s elevation as a judge of the IHC, he had reported to the chief justice of the Islamabad High Court that he was a Pakistani national and had a Green Card that allowed him to travel to the US without a visa.\nAccording to the press release, Justice Babar Sattar\u2019s mother is an educationist who established a school in Rawalpindi in 1992 as its sole proprietor. Justice Babar Sattar has no ownership interest in it and is not involved with its management. Before being appointed a judge, his law firm acted as a legal adviser to the school and received a retainer fee for its legal services.\nJustice Sattar owns real estate assets in both Pakis\u00adtan and the US, which are listed in his tax returns that were scrutinised by the Judicial Com\u00adm\u00adission of Pakistan prior to his elevation as a judge. All real estate assets that he owns are either inherited or were acquired while he was a lawyer. He has acqu\u00adired no real estate assets since his appointment as a judge. He is not involved with the management of any business entity. As a judge, he has not presided over any cases in which any of his family members has any interest, it said.\n"

Information Adviser to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif later also confirmed the judge\u2019s safe recovery.\nIn a video statement sent from an unknown location, Mr Marwat earlier stated: \u201cTaliban brought me here. It is a jungle and a war is going on.\u201d\nIn the minute-long message, the sessions judge said his release was only possible if the militants\u2019 dema\u00adnds were accepted. \u201cI request the federal and provincial governments, chief justices of Peshawar High Court and Supreme Court of Pakistan to make sure the Taliban\u2019s demands are accepted and my recovery is made sure as soon as possible,\u201d he said.\n\nPrior to his release, Marwat asked govt to accept kidnappers\u2019 demands; driver tells police abductors had warned of \u2018serious consequences\u2019\n\nHow Marwat was kidnapped\nAn FIR of Mr Marwat\u2019s abduction was registered at the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) police station on Sunday under Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act and other provisions.\nA CTD official said the judge\u2019s driver, Sher Ali Khan Mehsud, stated in the FIR that he along with Mr Marwat was going to D.I. Khan from Tank when 25 to 30 people equipped with sophisticated weapons intercepted their car at Garah Mohabbat Morr, forcing it to stop. They then opened fire on the vehicle.\nThe gunmen blindfolded the driver and five of them boarded the judge\u2019s car and drove away. When they stopped after some 40 minutes, the vehicle had reached a forest.\nThe FIR added that the judge was dressed in pants and shirt, but the kidnappers took out a shalwar kameez suit from the car and asked him to wear it. The kidnappers then set the car on fire.\nAccording to the FIR, the kidnappers belong to different tribes, including Marwat, Mehsud, Gandapur and Afghans.\nThe FIR said that the kidnappers asked the driver to convey to the authorities that their relatives were kept in jails and they would release the judge if their demands were met, but warnad of serious consequences otherwise. Later, the kidnappers took away the judge on a motorcycle.\n\u2018Bid to undermine system\u2019\nWhile condemning the incident, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Bar Council said the judge\u2019s abduction was an attempt to undermine the judicial system in the country.\nThe council added that the incident is a question mark on the efficiency of law enforcement agencies.\nTaking notice of the incident, Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur directed the IGP to take measures for the safe recovery of the judge. \u201cSteps should be taken on emergency basis to recover the judge,\u201d the chief minister said.\nA joint investigation team comprising CTD officials from D.I. Khan and Tank was later formed for the recovery of the abducted judge. Sources said during the joint operation of security forces, there was no loss of life or property.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: While simultaneously working on proposals for expenditure control, the government is ready to hire around one and a half dozen technical experts and consultancy firms from the market at special remuneration packages, starting with the ministries of energy and finance.\nThe recruitment model for \u2018technical advisers\u2019 would subsequently be replicated in 10 other economic and technical ministries in due course, a senior official told Dawn. He said Finance Minister Mohammad Aurangzeb would build an expert team of his own, probably from the banking sector, to look at things from a fresh and doable angle, rather than the traditional bureaucratic set-up.\nLikewise, a total of 10 \u2018technical advisers\u2019, including a couple of consultants, would be immediately hired at Special Professional Pay Scales (SPPS) in the petroleum division. The prime minister has already approved the revised remuneration structure for four different grades of SPPS, involving an all-inclusive remuneration package of Rs2 million for SPPS-1, up to Rs1.5m for SPPS-II, up to Rs1m for SPPS-III, and up to Rs500,000 per month for SPPS-IV.\nInformed sources said the positions of technical advisers, independent of and higher than the federal secretaries, for the economic and other technical ministries were originally proposed to the PTI government by Dr Ishrat Hussain, following the pattern of under secretaries in the United States. It was generally believed in certain quarters that the existing senior bureaucracy was one of the key stumbling blocks to the smooth functioning of the government in terms of foreign investment deliverables.\n\nAmid proposals for austerity measures, over a dozen \u2018advisers\u2019 to be placed in various ministries\n\nDr Ishrat\u2019s proposal was that such technical advisers should be above the secretaries and below the rank of federal ministers. However, this proposal could not reach the implementation phase as powerful secretaries, particularly erstwhile DMGs, dragged their feet. This time around, the reporting line for the technical advisers would remain the federal secretary.\nUnder the first batch, three technical advisers (technical, financial and legal) are being hired for mineral sector, a technical adviser for LNG business and three advisers (legal, contract management and petroleum economy) for exploration and development and a technical adviser to the petroleum minister. All of them would be hired in SPPS-1 for a term of three years through a headhunting firm, extendable for subsequent two years. In addition, there would be two consultants in SPPS-II for refining and investment and joint ventures\u2019 wing.\nThe process would be completed within 45-50 days including formal budgetary allocations so that the two teams in ministries of finance and petroleum are up and working with the start of next fiscal year beginning July 1, an official said. Their jobs would remain subject to KPIs.\nSome other ministries to follow suit would also include information technology and telecom, power, wa\u00adter resources, climate change, com\u00ad\u00admerce, national food security, industries and production, health services, aviation and maritime affairs.\nOfficials said the finance and petroleum divisions had been prioritised for fresh inductions mainly because of their critical role in dealing with most of the major upcoming foreign investment plans being pushed by the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) for expedited result oriented engagements with Saudi Arabia, China, Qatar, the UAE and Turkiye to name a few.\nThe key stakeholders believed the new layer of experts was needed to address the challenge of less than required number of professionals and lack of needed skill-set and expertise to effectively facilitate the provinces, investors, and other stak\u00adeholders. This was resulting in poor outcomes because of missing det\u00ada\u00adiled exploration, bankable feasibility studies, mechanisation and value-addition in mineral, oil and gas sector.\nThe technical advisers for mineral sector are expected to provide expertise for sustainable resource exploration, planning, due diligence, examination of investment proposals and transaction structures besides development, production, value-addition, utilisation, marketing and exports.\nAlso, varying set of financial frameworks across the provinces and other entities were posing challenges in attracting investment. The advisers would thus perform financial analysis of potential projects, market trends, and financial regulatory environments and help undertake financial, investment, risk analysis and formulate investment strategies and help prepare robust legal and regulatory frameworks.\nSerious weaknesses have also been observed in policy making and implementation strategies in the LNG even though its share was now touching almost 30pc of national gas mix and almost half of SNGPL\u2019s sales volume and legal challenges were emerging not only in local courts but also at international arbitrations.\nIn certain cases, the government would seeks support of leading business groups like Pakistan Business Council and Pakistan Banking Association for specialised expertise on pro bono basis, the sources said.\n"

In case a district court judge does not make a report, they may be charged with misconduct and could be liable for disciplinary proceedings as well.\nJudges of the high court have also proposed an institutional response to any meddling attempt, under which criminal proceedings could be initiated against a private individual \u2014 or in case they are linked with any official department then the administration would take up the matter with the bosses of the department concerned.\nMoreover, the resolution suggested that Article 204 of the Constitution, which deals with contempt of court, may be invoked against those who would try to interfere in judicial affairs, while any such occurrences would be taken by the high court\u2019s Administration Committee.\nThis committee usually deals with major policy decisions with regards to the functioning of the high court and is reconstituted from time to time. It was last reconstituted in November 2022.\nA judge in the Islamabad judiciary told Dawn that the IHC judges\u2019 proposal ignored the dismal working condition of the lower judiciary, where some promotions had been withheld for well over a decade.\nAccording to him, the decision to penalise judges from the subordinate courts would only demoralise them further.\nExisting framework\nLegal experts Dawn spoke to were of the view that except for introducing penal consequences for the subordinate judiciary, the other remedies suggested by the IHC judges were already available in the law.\nFor example, under Article 203 of the Constitution, the Islamabad High Court also supervises the lower judiciary and judicial officers of the district courts can send references through their respective sessions judges to the registrar, members of the inspection team, the inspection judge or even directly to the chief justice.\nThe court\u2019s institutional response also borrows from past precedent. For example, in the case of former Gilgit-Baltistan chief judge Rana Shamim \u2014 who accused a judge of delaying bail to former PM Nawaz Sharif, allegedly at the behest of former CJP Saqib Nisar \u2014 the IHC proceeded against him under contempt laws, and the matter is still pending in court.\nFormer prime minister Imran Khan also faced a contempt case for intimidating a judicial officer when he threatened judge Zeba Chaudhry during a speech in Islamabad in 2022.\nRetired Justice Shabbar Raza Rizvi, formerly a judge of the Lahore High Court, told Dawn that interference into judicial affairs had continued despite the presence of laws to prevent it.\nHe believes that now, with the issue out in the open, the court\u2019s administration would be under public pressure to take measures against such external meddling.\nSenior lawyer Ahsanuddin Sheikh told Dawn that while the judges had raised a very grave issue, i.e. external meddling in the judiciary\u2019s affairs. However, in his view, the response did not appear to match the seriousness of the matter.\nThe proposal entails remedies already provided in the relevant laws, he said, adding that the proposal should have called for a judicial probe to trace the persons and institutions behind this meddling, in order to settle the issue once and for all.\nHe recalled the claims made by former IHC judge Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui, who had named certain individuals from an intelligence agency, saying that it would have been better if the proposal sent to the Supreme Court also included the initiation of an inquiry into the revelations he made in his speech delivered to the Rawalpindi District Bar, which ultimately led to his dismissal from service.\nAn inquiry to establish the veracity of his allegations, incidentally, was among the points mentioned in the original letter by the six IHC judges.\n"

He added that Maulana Mufti Mehmood had also led a movement against such rigging in 1977.\nThe JUI-F chief said that their elders had fought war for the independence of the subcontinent and they created awareness among people through Azadi March. He said that they were independent and would never accept subjugation. Since independence of Pakistan, he said, it was irreparably damaged politically, economically and democratically.\nHe said that they would fight in \u2018public assembly\u2019 against the forces that rigged elections as they had come out to save the country. He said that his party would restore real democracy by toppling the government currently imposed on the country.\nMr Rehman also expressed concerns over Israel\u2019s atrocities against innocent Palestinians. He said that Israeli forces were killing children, women and elders indiscriminately. He added that cruelties of Israel and its allies could be judged from the fact that they bombed hospitals, killing patients and wounded people. \u201cJUI-F stands by Palestinian people in this hard time and will raise voice for them at all forums,\u201d he said.\nEarlier, Senator Attaur Rehman presided over the meeting of the office-bearers of JUI-F. Besides others, the meeting was also attended by leaders of Ansarul Islam, JUI-F social media representatives, MPAs, tehsil nazims and lawyer forum and teacher forum of the party.\nAddressing the meeting, Maulana Attaur Rehman said that under a well-designed plan and rigged elections on February 8, the blue eyed people were given governments in four provinces and centre.\n\u201cJUI-F has not accepted the results of the previous general elections. Rigging of the previous general elections is the continuation of the rigged elections in 2018,\u201d he said.\nHe said that a historic rally would be staged by JUI-F on May 9 that would have deep impact on the political landscape of the country. During the upcoming rally, he said, people would be informed about rigging in elections.\nHe said that 4,000 volunteers of Ansarul Islam would provide security to the leadership and participants of the rally.\n"

They added that any order regarding officers working in grade above BPS-18 was issued by the office of chief secretary.\nThe director-general of health was among the few officers, who held more than one positions simultaneously.\nHe remained close to former chief minister Mahmood Khan. Last year, the caretaker government was about to replace him but he managed to stick to the second top position in health department despite opposition by the then adviser to chief minister on health.\nThe first caretaker health adviser, Prof Abid Jamil, was unhappy with his alleged corruption in purchase of drugs but his request to remove him fell on deafears and as result the former called it a day. The other health adviser had no issue with director-general of health.\nDr Shaukat Ali health faced huge campaign on social media regarding his alleged irregularities but he remained very active in meetings in departments and elsewhere. He was good at obliging the high-ups, sources said.\nDespite his suspension as director-general of health, he is still regional director health of Malakand, project director of Timergara Medical College and head of a foreign-funded project.\nDr Shaukat Ali in a brief chat with this correspondent denied all allegations and vowed to face inquiry.\n"

            "Text": "PESHAWAR: Senior writer Zafarullah Parwaz has asked authorities to take steps for preservation and promotion of linguistic and cultural diversity of Chitral valley.\n\u201cChitral valley enjoys unique traditions, history and ancient heritage. Around 12 languages are being spoken with Khowar being the major lingua franca of locals,\u201d he told this scribe.\nMr Parwaz, a resident of Booni in Chitral, urged stakeholders to take concrete measures to preserve rich treasure trove of the people and land. He was in the city to attend a monthly literary debate in which an Urdu fiction writer\u2019s short story was discussed.\nHe said that folk songs in Khowar literature of Chitral tracked back to about 3,000 years. Having inspired by Radio Pakistan and a journal, local literati began to pen down drama, fiction, translation, research and criticism and served Khowar, he added.\n\nZafarullah Parwaz says 12 languages are spoken in the valley\n\nMr Parwaz said that presently a literary organisation \u2018Anjuman-i-Taraqi Khowar (ATK) was working for promotion of local literary traditions but it needed official patronage to promote storytelling tradition among youth.\n\u201cChitral is home to linguistic and cultural diversity but unfortunately the required attention has not been paid to it. Unless serious efforts are made for preservation and promotion of the incredible heritage, locals will lose a precious asset,\u201d he added.\nThe septuagenarian writer stated that he authored several books on variety of topics, especially customary laws, poetry and folk stories in Khowar, and received widespread appreciation from literary circles and literati.\n\u201cI am the first fictionist in Khowar as my first ever novel in Khowar titled \u2018Angaristani\u2019 spanning over 300 pages was published about seven years ago. Now it has been translated into Urdu and rated among the most and must read,\u201d he claimed.\nMr Parwaz has been touring colleges and universities across the country for delivering lectures on arts, literature and culture of Chitral. He has also been taking active part in social activities with an objective to raise awareness among youth and general public at large to save indigenous heritage both tangible and intangible alongside tourism.\nThe senior writer regretted that arts and culture of Chitral had been ignored in the past and the loss could only be compensated if authorities concerned take steps to save rich treasure trove of local heritage.\n"

            "Text": "PESHAWAR: Peshawar High Court has granted bail to three persons including two Afghan refugees arrested on charges of attempting to procure CNIC (computerised national identity card) and passport on the basis of fabricated birth registration documents.\nA single-member bench of Justice Syed Arshad Ali accepted bail petitions of the three suspects named Masood Khan (Pakistani citizen) and the two Afghans, Jamshed and Zubair, on condition of furnishing two surety bonds of Rs300,000 each.\nThe bench observed that the charges against which the petitioners were confronted with did not fall within the prohibitory clause of section 497 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, therefore, as a rule they were entitled to the concession of bail.\nThe bench observed that the relevant authorities to investigate the matter would be either Nadra (National Database and Registration Authority) or FIA (Federal Investigation Agency) so that the allegations could be logically concluded.\nThe bench directed that the matter should be referred to the regional office of Nadra Lower Chitral to take appropriate steps in this regard.\nThe FIR of the occurrence was registered at police station Chitral City March 23, 2024, under section 419, 420, 468, 471, 34 and 109 of Pakistan Penal Code, section 14 of the Foreigners Act and section 30 of the Nadra Act.\nThe complainant in the case was a sub-inspector who claimed that during routine patrolling of the area along with other police officials they spotted certain persons in suspicious conditions.\nHe stated that on inquiry they disclosed their names as Masood Khan, Inam and Mohammad Khan, residents of Gool Arandu (Chitral).\nHe stated that in respect of their identity the suspect Masood produced his CNIC, whereas the other two persons produced Nadra form and token of procurement of CNICs.\nThe complainant stated that for further satisfaction the three suspects were brought to the police station and during cursory interrogation Inam and Mohammad Khan identified themselves as Afghan nationals.\nHe claimed that Inam disclosed that his real name was Jamshed, whereas Mohammad Khan said that his name was Zubair. He added that both of them stated that being Afghan nationals they intended to go abroad on the strength of alleged forged and fictitious Pakistani passport and CNIC.\nAllegations against the petitioner Masood Khan were that he had facilitated one of the petitioners/suspects Jamshed by disguising his name as Inam, one of his son in the Form \u2018B\u2019 as well as in his family tree and thus the said Jamshed on the basis of the same had applied to Nadra for procurement of CNIC as well as passport.\nThe police claimed that the Jamshed by deceitful manner had represented himself as Inam in Nadra record.\nSimilarly, the petitioner Zubair had also manoeuvred to obtain the documents from Nadra showing himself as Pakistani citizen.\nThe record also showed that the two petitioners Jamshed and Zubair had also been given POR (proof of registration) cards meant for Afghan refugees.\nThe petitioners\u2019 counsel, Sabir Shah, argued that the petitioners were implicated in a forged case.\nHe contended that the provisions of law wherein the petitioners were charged were not included in the prohibitory provisions of the CrPC. He added that the police was not proper forum for conducting investigation in the matter.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The Capital Development Authority is all set to open the newly built Iran Avenue (formerly 11th Avenue) from the D-12 to E-11 sector to traffic today after night-long preparations by the engineering wing of the civic agency to ensure the move.\nThe 5.5-kilometre portion of the highway, including an interchange, is worth Rs4 billion and started in December 2022. The road begins from D-12, merges into Margalla Avenue and culminates at the E-11 interchange and Khayban-i-Iqbal (also known as Margalla Road). This is the first phase of the project; in the second phase, a 7.5km long road will be constructed from E-11 to Karnal Sher Khan Road (formerly I.J.P Road). \u201cWe are all set to open this road at midnight so the residents of Islamabad can ply vehicles on it from today,\u201d said a deputy director of the CDA.\nThe CDA official said this road would allow commuters to reach Sector E-11 from G.T. Road in a few minutes and facilitate the residents of Shah Allah Ditta and adjoining areas. Three new CDA sectors, C-13, C-14, and C-15, will also benefit from this road since they fall alongside the Margalla Avenue which has also been connected to the newly built road.\nThe official claimed that the project was completed for Rs3.5 billion and the CDA saved money through efficiency in this project. Asked about the second phase of this road, the official said that last week, the CDA board approved a summary of the engineering wing to hire a consultant to finalise the design of the 7.5km road.\n\nOfficial says artery to significantly reduce travel time from G.T. Road to E-11\n\n\u201cSince the board has given the go-ahead for the consultant, we will soon float a bid for the hiring of the consultant, who will finalise the design within two months, then we will go for the tendering process to start the construction project,\u201d he said.\nDuring the last two years, the CDA completed the 7th Avenue interchange, Bhara Kahu bypass, Margalla Avenue from G.T. Road to D-12 as well as the abovementioned road. Several other projects which include the widening of Expressway, Park Road, and 10th Avenue are also in progress and there is a need to expedite these projects as soon as possible as they have already missed several deadlines.\nAccording to Islamabad\u2019s master plan, the 33-km-long Margalla Avenue starts from G.T. Road and ends after passing through the foothills of Margallas. However, the CDA divided the project into three phases and the major portion of the road is yet to be built.\nIn the first phase, a road was constructed from G.T. Road to D-12, while the second portion of the road, which is a part of Margalla Avenue and Iran Avenue as well, was completed from D-12 to E-11, and the Bhara Kahu bypass was constructed in the third phase. A CDA official said that besides constructing Iran Avenue from E-11 to I.J.P Road, the CDA should also construct Margalla Avenue as per its original alignment in the foothills of Margallas to provide a bypass road to traffic from G.T. Road.\n"

The districts are: Lahore, Rawalpindi, Multan, DG Khan, Rajanpur, Rahim Yar Khan, Sheikhupura, Mianwali, Faisalabad and Okara.\nIn Rawalpindi, Mianwali and Sheikhupura, the campaign will be held partially.\nHowever, all areas in rest of the districts will be covered in full. In Rawalpindi, Lahore and Faisalabad, the campaign will last seven days while in the other districts it will continue for five days only.\nIn all districts, the last two days of the campaign will be allocated to cover the leftover children.\nOver 67,000 polio workers will participate in the campaign, including 60,000 mobile team members.\n\u201cAll environmental samples which have tested positive in Punjab are linked to polio virus clusters active across the border in Afghanistan or other endemic and high-risk districts of Pakistan.\nThis proves that Punjab is at the risk of polio virus importation.\nTherefore, Punjab is taking concrete steps to prevent the local circulation of virus by implementing immediate outbreak responses,\u201d said Khizer Afzaal, the head of the polio eradication programme and the coordinator for Emergency Operations Centre, in a press release.\nHe said Punjab had set up transit vaccination points to immunise cross-border and inter-provincial populations to prevent virus from entering Punjab, urging parents to cooperate with polio teams.\nIt may be mentioned that polio is a highly infectious disease caused by poliovirus mainly affecting children under the age of five years.\nIt invades the nervous system and can cause paralysis or even death.\nWhile there is no cure for polio, vaccination is the most effective way to protect children from the crippling disease.\nEach time a child under the age of five is vaccinated, their protection against the virus is increased.\nRepeated immunisations have protected millions of children from polio, allowing almost all countries to become polio-free except Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n"

            "Text": "TAXILA: Tandoor owners in Taxila and Wah are still selling naan at Rs25, challenging the writ of the government as the local administration has failed to implement the new price lists to provide relief to the public.\nThe provincial government issued a notification fixing the price at Rs20 for a standard size naan of 120 grams while assistant commissioners and price control magistrates were tasked with ensuring the enforcement of the new prices. It has been observed however that instead of adhering to the mandated lower prices, the Naanbai Association continues to sell naan at higher rates.\nIt was also observed that despite the notification, the price of bread did not decrease as roti is still being sold at Rs20 and the notification of selling roti at Rs16 and naan at Rs20 has not been implemented.\nZohaib Salman, a resident of Muslim Colony, lamented the lack of reduction in prices at tandoors where roti was still being sold at Rs20 and naan at Rs25.\n\nResidents say despite revised price list issued by district administration, tandoor owners selling naan at Rs25\n\nMushtaq Turk, a resident of Banni mohallah said despite the Punjab government\u2019s announcement and new price list issued by the district administration, tandoors and nanbais were selling naan at Rs25.\nFormer member Punjab Assembly Prof Waqas Khan said that tandoor and naanbai had refused to comply with the government order, maintaining their own pricing structure. He said no nanbai had displayed the official price list in Taxila and Wah while the local administration officials were looking the whole affair as an idle spectator.\nMohammad Qadeem, Vice President Nanbai Association, said the government was not giving any subsidy on gas and electricity to nanbais who were using liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Therefore, it was not possible to reduce the prices.\n\u201cFirst of all, there should have been a notification on reduction in the prices of flour and LPG for the tandoors,\u201d he added. He said they would be selling roti at the government rate if they were provided subsidy.\nWhen contacted, Assistant Commissioner Salman Akbar Warraich said strict action would be taken against those violating the price regulations. Responding to a question, he said that during a crackdown against tandoors and nanbais violating the official price list, fines amounting to Rs95,000 were imposed on 15 of them. He said three naanbais were sent behind bars after registration of cases against them for repeated violation of the price list. He said price magistrates had been assigned specific tasks to ensure compliance with the new roti and naan prices.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: Media freedom in Pakistan suffered significant setbacks over the past year, particularly through \u201cstate-driven intimidation\u201d and \u201cpredatory actions by some non-state actors\u201d which saw over 200 journalists and bloggers targeted via at least 70 legal notices.\nAn annual report titled \u2018Erosion of Free Speech: The Silencing of Citizens, Political Parties and Media\u2019 was published by the Freedom Network ahead of World Press Freedom Day on May 3. It covers the May 2023 to April 2024 period.\nThe report noted that there was reduced tolerance for online dissent as well as a raft of attacks and harassment of journalists and bloggers, including the murder of four journalists, which eroded the parameters of free speech and dissent in Pakistan and enhanced the risks for media freedom.\nIt said over 70 legal notices were served to media practitioners. \u201cMany came consequent to a \u2018joint investigation team\u2019 of various government departments tasked with identifying persons allegedly running a smear campaign against some judges; although, the chief justice later said he was not a complainant, and that the judiciary was being used to target free expression aimed at others.\u201d\n\nReport says four journalists killed, online \u2018dissent\u2019 regularly targeted\n\nIt said four journalists were killed in the period under review \u2013 two each in Sindh and Punjab. A total of 104 cases of violations against journalists and other media practitioners, including murders, attacks, injuries, kidnapping, threats and legal cases, were documented by the Freedom Network.\n\u201cAcute political polarisation and governance and economic instability saw three governments in the one year between May 2023 and April 2024\u2026 Through their actions all three ruling dispensations seemed to have evolved an alarming consensus among its most powerful political and state figures to lower their threshold of tolerance to freedom of expression, particularly online dissent,\u201d the report underlined.\nA pattern of crackdowns in the past year emerged that saw dozens of journalists and bloggers slapped with legal notices, some being arrested, and others attacked and aggressively intimidated, according to the report. \u201cPolitical workers also came in the dragnet. All this transpired against a backdrop of warnings of actions by high officials, including top government functionaries, followed by regular targeting of online expression.\u201d\nThe report noted major failures of key state actions and targeting of other journalists and free speech practitioners by non-state actors that reversed the freedom of expression dial in Pakistan in the period under review, including a near-universal suspension across the country of mobile phone services on February 8 polls. The curtailment of access to information and freedom of expression also included frequent network shutdowns and prolonged social media platform suspensions.\nThe report also expressed concern at renewed government attempts to legislate in the coming weeks the \u2018E-Safety Bill and Personal Data Protection Bill\u2019.\nBoth were approved by the federal cabinet of Shehbaz Sharif\u2019s previous government in July 2023. The bills aim to establish separate authorities with powers to penalise \u2018posters of content\u2019 on social media platforms.\n\u201cAdverse policy actions, such as the state\u2019s intent to weaponise regulations of online content, particularly social media platforms, including journalistic and social expression, will not only institutionalise coercive censorship but also put other Pakistan\u2019s rising digital economy in peril,\u201d the report warned.\nThe report, however, documented \u201csmall victories\u201d in defence of freedom of expression and media freedom. These included: The Supreme Court, acting in January 2024 on a joint petition filed by the associations of court journalists, ordered the Federal Investigations Agency to suspend notices issued to journalists. The Lahore High Court in November 2023 quashed a case against a journalist charged with hate speech and sedition and in February and April 2024, the Sindh High Court and the Islamabad High Court, respectively, ordered the suspension of social media platform \u2018X\u2019 (formerly Twitter) to be revoked.\n"

Islamabad needs 300 buses to overcome its mass transit needs. We have developed apps after thorough research that can tell commuters which bus to take and how long they have to wait for it.\nWe have monitored the movement of people digitally on different routes and roads,\u201d he said.\n\u201cOn the basis of our work, we are able to offer the city managers solutions to traffic problems. We can tell them which new routes are to open. Our apps are working, and QAU students are benefiting from them,\u201d he said.\nHe said that his team has developed smart parking mechanisms for Islamabad. He said there was a need to pool buses in the federal capital so that available resources could be used optimally. \u201cIf we make a pool of buses, we will cut down the number of vehicles on our roads in a big way. It will lead to saving resources that are needed to operate these buses. It will also cut down on pollution levels,\u201d he said.\n\u201cHowever, the existing lot of bureaucrats is alien to the concept of pooling, and red tape has been hampering these solutions from being presented to the masses for whom they are meant for. Out-of-the-box thinking is the need of the hour, as we have resources enough to solve our problems but we lack strategy,\u201d he said.\nResearchers from QAU, International Islamic University Islamabad, National University of Sciences and Technology, Lahore University of Management Sciences, Ibadat University, and others attended the event and presented their work.\n"
