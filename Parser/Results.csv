2022-12-31,2022-12-22,Govt calls emergency NA session today to approve controversial LG law,PML-N candidate seeks delay in polls; PTI leader files contempt petition against PM for changes in law.,"ISLAMABAD: The government has summoned an emergency session of the National Assembly on Thursday (today) to get Islamabad’s local government amendment bill passed, with an aim to increase the number of union councils and seek direct election for the post of mayor.
The session has been convened by President Dr Arif Alvi at a time when political parties are already busy campaigning for the local government polls scheduled for Dec 31.
In a related development, a ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) candidate and a senior member of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) filed separate petitions before the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on the issue with the former seeking postponement of the polls and the latter desiring initiation of contempt proceedings against Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his “cabinet” for making changes in the law which could cause a delay in the elections.
The National Assembly Secretariat on Wednesday issued a 10-point agenda which shows the Islamabad Capital Territory Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2022 standing in the name of Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah Khan.

PML-N candidate seeks delay in polls; PTI leader files contempt petition against PM for changes in law

The minister will also present a motion seeking to suspend the rules of the assembly to enable the members to pass the bill on the same day without referring it to the concerned committee and following the parliamentary procedure.
After passage of the bill from the lower house of the parliament, it will also have to be passed by the Senate before getting the president’s ceremonial assent.
It may be recalled that the National Assembly had been prorogued by the president only on Tuesday after passing the Foreign Investment (Promotion and Protection) Bill in a similar fashion and after suspending the rules. 
The federal cabinet has already approved the amendments to the law through a circular on Dec 19 after which the interior ministry issued a letter increasing the number of seats from 101 to 125. 
Moreover, the federal cabinet has also approved a summary for direct election of Islamabad’s mayor and for this necessary amendment, the bill is being tabled before the National Assembly.
Despite these developments, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), however, refused to defer the LG elections and vowed to conduct it in accordance with the already announced schedule.
Since the PML-N and PTI have brought this matter before the IHC, the fate of LG elections now depends upon the judicial verdict.
In the petition, PML-N candidate from Tarlai Union Council Shahzad Aurangzeb defended the government’s decision of increasing the number of UCs.
The petition stated that Islamabad districtfor the most part has been administered without a local government comprising elected representatives of the people until the passing of the 18th Amendment in the Constitution on April 19, 2010.
It said the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) Local Government Act 2015 in sections 5 & 6 of the Act, empowered the federal government to declare any area as union council and to divide an existing area of one union council into two and to notify the number of union councils in Islamabad, adding that the federal government had recently increased the number of union councils to 125.
The petitioner pointed out anomalies in the voters’ lists of different areas and said “in such conditions any election that is held would be disputed and cannot be declared as a free and fair election”.
It requested the court to set aside the ECP’s decision of conducting elections in 101 UCs.
On the other hand, PTI leader Ali Nawaz Awan asserted in the petition that the ECP in the light of the judgements of the superior courts announced schedule for local government elections in 101 UCs to be held on Dec 31.
“However, the federal government with utmost mala fide, has yet again in its bid to frustrate the process has done exactly what had been apprehended,” the petition said, adding that the act of federal government of increasing the number of UCs is a “clear attempt at frustrating the process and holding of elections, which is clear cut violation of the judgement of this court”.
According to the petition, the federal government was “well aware” of court’s directions, “however, the action of yet again increasing the number of UCs, merely 11 days prior to the elections…is a blatant disregard to the dictum laid down exhaustively by the court.”
The petition termed it a deliberate attempt to frustrate the judgement of the IHC.
Subsequently, it requested the court to initiate contempt of court proceeding against the prime minister and all the members of the federal cabinet.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Verdict reserved on appeal over Zahir’s sentence in Noor case,"The court asks lawyers to submit written arguments, if they want, within seven days.","ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday reserved verdict on a plea challenging the death sentence of Zahir Jaffer in Noor Mukadam murder case.
The two-member division bench comprising IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Sardar Ijaz Ishaq Khan reserved the verdict after the lawyers completed their arguments.
Jaffer’s lawyer, Usman Khosa, in his argument on the last day of hearing on Wednesday, said one of the reasons for giving the death sentence to his client could be to set an example that there was a lesson for others to not take such a step. 
He added that such a punishment was awarded to habitual criminals to create deterrence.
He said there was pressure on Pakistan at an international level to abolish the death penalty, adding that his client was an American citizen and a resident of New Jersey, where there was no concept of capital punishment. He urged the court to take this point into consideration.
Chief Justice Aamer Farooq remarked that abolishing the death penalty was a matter of legislation and only legislators could view this subject, however, he added that Pakistan was an independent country and it had its own law. 
The lawyer of the plaintiff, Shaukat Mukadam, said Jameel, Jaffer’s cook, worked during the day and had no role in the crime.
While the court inquired whether any drugs were recovered from the crime scene, Mr Mukadam’s lawyer Babar Hayat said no drug was recovered and the relevant report had been attached with the record.
The court also inquired about Noor’s handbag, which was not part of the record but it was visible in the CCTV footage.
Mr Hayat said only the prosecution could talk about the bag. After the two sides concluded their arguments, the bench reserved its judgement.
The court asked the lawyers to submit written arguments, if they wanted, within seven days.
The trial court in Islamabad had awarded death penalty to Jaffer in February 2022 for killing Noor Mukadam. Her body was found in Jaffer’s residence in F-7 on July 20, 2021.

IHC division bench comprising Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan took up the petition seeking protective bail for Aziz.
His counsel Amjad Pervaiz advocate argued before the court that Aziz was scheduled to arrive at Islamabad International Airport via Qatar Airways at 7:35pm on Dec 21.
He said Haroon Yousaf Aziz intended to surrender before the Accountability Court of Lahore in connection with assets reference case.
In the petition, Mr Aziz cited the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) chairman, NAB Lahore director general and Accountability Court Lahore judge as respondents.
He requested the court for grant of protective bail, enabling him to surrender before the competent court of law.
Mr Aziz is a co-accused in the assets reference.
According to NAB, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s family members received foreign funds through alleged fake transactions.
These transactions had been made through the company, allegedly owned by Shehbaz Sharif’s son-in-law Haroon Yousaf Aziz. 
The maximum numbers of fake transactions to the Shehbaz family had been made through Al-Zarooni Exchange of Dubai.
After hearing preliminary arguments, the IHC bench restrained the LEAs from arresting Aziz till Dec 22 and ordered him to appear in person on Thursday.
Further hearing in this matter has been adjourned till today.

Former Pims executive director Dr Ijaz Qadeer, while talking to Dawn, said Dr Hazir was a top paediatrician of Pakistan and his services for Pims would always be remembered.

Top paediatrician laid to rest in Lahore

He said the deceased established the paediatric department at the hospital and headed the neonatology department.
It is worth mentioning here that neonatology is a sub-specialty of paediatrics that focuses on medical care of newborns, especially those who are ill or premature.
“He believed in research and never stopped learning new fields while he was in the hospital. He was expert on issues related to reasons of death in newborn and also reasons of infection in children,” Dr Qadeer said.
Talking to Dawn, former vice chancellor of Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Medical University Prof Dr Javed Akram said he had frequent interaction with Dr Hazir as Pims was the affiliated hospital of the university.
“He was a thorough gentleman and professional. He was supportive of academics and was a supporter of the university. He was eager to do research, which is why I consider him as one of my best friends,” he said.
Dr Tabish Hazir’s sister Tamkinet Karim, while talking to Dawn, said her brother was born on May 31, 1958 in Lahore.
“He did his initial schooling in Sialkot and MBBS from Allama Iqbal Medical College, Lahore. He also did a number of courses and specialisation and joined Pims which he served till his retirement. He was under treatment at Pims at the time of his death. We shifted the body on Wednesday morning to his house in Islamabad and then to Lahore,” she said.
Ms Karim said the deceased had worked in collaboration with the World Health Organisation and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for the welfare of the children of Pakistan.
She said Dr Tabish Hazir and Dr Shireen Mazari separated 12 years ago but it was not correct that the couple had divorce.
“The deceased has a daughter Imaan Mazari-Hazir and a son Sabeel Mazari-Hazir,” she said.
Tamkinet Karim said Dr Hazir was the son of renowned poet Taufiq Rafat and wanted to be laid besides his father’s grave, which was why his body was shifted to Lahore.
She said Qul would be held on Thursday (today) in Model Town Lahore between 1pm to 3pm.

2017-12-01,2022-12-22,Work on widening of Soan River bridge restarts finally,RAWALPINDI: Work on widening the Soan River Bridge finally commenced earlier this week. The project is anticipated...,"RAWALPINDI: Work on widening the Soan River Bridge finally commenced earlier this week.
The project is anticipated to be completed by the end of Dec 2023.
The Soan River Bridge was two lanes wide on each side, but after work, it will have four lanes on each side.
According to an official from the National Highway Authority (NHA), widening of the bridge had been suspended in April 2022 after the contractor was black-listed and now a fresh contract had been awarded to Frontier Works Organisation (FWO).
The widening of the bridge across Soan River was started in 2017 and was scheduled to be completed by January 2022. However, the bridge will now be completed by the end of 2023.
Due to left-over construction material scattered on the bridge and its adjoining area, hundreds of commuters entering the city have been facing problems.
Motorists, while proceeding towards Rawalpindi from Rawat, face difficulty as safety walls of the bridge have been demolished by the previous contractor and left abandoned.
More than 62,000 vehicles cross Soan Bridge every day, where widening of the bridge began about five years ago and is yet to be completed.
The former chief of army staff had taken strict notice of the delay in the construction of Soan Bridge project and the poor workmanship and directed the authorities concerned to complete it without wasting time.
“I have never seen such sheer negligence in public welfare/important projects while living abroad,” said an expatriate who recently came to Pakistan to spend vacations with his family.

Students of Al-Huda International School took part in creating awareness about global warming by organising a science exhibition under the title ‘Earth Matters’. 
They displayed over 60 projects to highlight the issues of global warming, urging that an organic life style and natural method in work was the only solution to save the planet.
Topics like bio gas, water, solar energy, green grills, hydroponic planting, collection of garbage, floods and mitigation, importance of birds and so on were well covered by students through their projects. 
These topics were connected with Islam and its teachings and in all stalls, related verses of the Quran were also highlighted.
“Through this exhibition, we are trying to create awareness as environment is a serious issue the world is facing today,” said Fareha Wasim, a teacher.
A seventh grader said that everyone will have to play a role towards reducing the impact of fast changing climate. Another teacher Fouzia Umar said that besides taking care of the climate and human beings, there is also need to protect birds.
Students from montessori to senior grades constructed and displayed their projects. Each project was presented in a distinctive way and the uniqueness of the event was that each child participated and the projects were made from recycled and eco-friendly material.
The exhibition comprised of different sub themes such as ‘Green Vibes Only’, ‘Air Care’, ‘Slow the Flow’, ‘Master the Disaster’, ‘Waste Wise’ and ‘Now and Never’. 
The student’s project display and demonstration of projects was an effort towards provoking thoughts and leave the audience inspired. Students had captured the attention and focus of the audience and visitors throughout the day. 
The message from all students was clear and crisp that this was high time that we have to take care of our planet.
They emphasised that according to the Quran, environmental conservation is a religious duty as well as a social obligation and not an optional matter. The event was graced by dignitaries and educationists from the twin cities, journalists and the kinsfolk of the students. 
Different schools and university students also made an appearance and interacted with students. The programme was spread over two days and was split into three slots of morning and evening.

According to an FIR, police officials had detained a merchant from Peshawar and released him after receiving Rs1 million from his heirs.
Javaid Ahmad had come to Rawalpindi on Dec 6 with Rs300,000 to purchase some goods. He was sitting in a hotel when a man in police uniform came and started interrogating him. In the meanwhile, two persons also joined and snatched Rs300,000 from him.
Ammad Akbar, employer of Javaid Ahmed, said in his FIR registered with Pirwadhai police on Wednesday that the accused shifted the victim to an undisclosed location after covering his face. The victim was detained in a room where he was tortured by the kidnappers who demanded money from him. 
On Dec 8, the kidnappers forced him to talk to his family asking him to arrange Rs600,000 more for his release.
Rahimullah, a friend of the victim, brought the money to Rawalpindi. When Mr Rahim arrived in Pirwadhai, the kidnappers detained him as well and took the money. Later, they started demanding more money from Rahimullah following which Rs50,000 were transferred twice in the bank account of one of the accomplices of the police official.
“Yes, Javaid was tortured by the kidnapper,” Ammad Akbar told Dawn while quoting Javaid.

He assured the high-powered delegation that Nadra would surely extend all possible G2G support in ID-related projects and urged the visiting dignitaries to develop an ID ecosystem that would bring about ‘Single Version of Truth’.
The potential is endless for the digital public goods to be rolled out on the basis of a good ID system, he added.
The Nadra chairman said: “A good ID system helps build a strong democratic system, especially in developing countries. The ethos of democracy in ‘One Person, One Vote’ is better delivered through a national ID system that facilitates in development of computerised electoral rolls with negligible margins of voter fraud and other fraudulent practices.”
It is pertinent to mention here that under South-South cooperation, Nadra was assisting the governments of Nigeria, Sudan, Kenya and Somalia with regard to development of identity management and civil registration system.
The Somalian interior minister lauded the efforts of the incumbent Nadra chairman, Tariq Malik and his team.

2022-12-21,2022-12-22,Call to ensure ease of business in pharma sector,ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PPMA) Chairman Arshad Mahmood on Wednesday said...,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PPMA) Chairman Arshad Mahmood on Wednesday said Pakistan would become Nigeria if ease of business was not ensured in the pharmaceutical sector, fearing that the country would be left with no choice but to import medicines worth $20 billion every year.
“The foreign exchange starved Pakistan should be eyeing on the export of pharmaceutical products which is an $1,800 billion industry. Even if we capture the market of Africa, which is an $86 billion market, we would be able to bridge the gap between imports and exports of the country. If ease of business would not be ensured, investments will be shifted from Pakistan to Bangladesh, China, Iran and other countries,” he said while speaking to participants at an international conference on pharma and healthcare.
Mr Mahmood said once Nigeria used to manufacture medicines but with the passage of time, it implemented conditions of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and increased taxes and now it was importing 100pc of its medicines.
“On Wednesday morning, I was shocked to see in a newspaper that the per unit cost of the pharma sector is going to be increased by Rs32 due to which, each unit of electricity will be Rs93. Currently, the per month bill of my factory goes over Rs4 million, out of which electricity charges remain around Rs1.8 million and the rest are all taxes,” he said, adding Pakistan can export medicines to a number of countries of Africa and some countries of Asia including Myanmar, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan.
“A number of companies have been manufacturing medicines for people of Pakistan but when they get orders to export medicines to other countries, the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap) refuses to issue them a letter of good manufacturing practices (GMP) and insists on carrying out another inspection of the factory. The letter is mandatory to export medicines,” Mr Mahmood said.
“It is unfortunate that Drap allows companies to sell medicines to people of Pakistan but does not allow exporting the same medicine to other countries. That is why our exports are worth $269 million. On the other hand, India has been exporting medicines worth of $24 billion per annum. The local industry has been providing medicines worth $5 billion to people of Pakistan and if manufacturing would be stopped due to high cost of production, Pakistan will have to import medicines worth of $20 billion because in that case, foreign countries/companies will provide medicines on their cost and conditions,” he said.
“We cannot compete with international/foreign companies by importing raw material. The business community has been thinking about shifting investments abroad because over here, policies are made without taking the stakeholders onboard. The government needs to take steps for industrialisation rather than depending on remittances of overseas Pakistanis,” he added.
During a panel discussion, member of the PPMA Central Executive Committee Usman Shaukat said it was time to enforce an export emergency in Pakistan to tackle the current economic crisis and pharmaceuticals can play a vital role in earning precious foreign exchange for Pakistan.
“A pharma export council needs to be set up immediately to enhance the exports of pharmaceuticals which has immense potential. The stakeholders such as Drap and Ministry of Commerce have already principally agreed to formulate the pharma export council and the industry requests the process to be expedited in order to facilitate exports,” he added.
It was high time that Pakistan pharmaceutical products reach developed markets such as the United States and Europe.
Drap Chief Executive Officer Dr Asim Rauf, who also attended the conference, said that all possible steps would be taken to facilitate the pharmaceutical sector and ensure increase in export of medicines from Pakistan.

2009-12-01,2022-12-22,CDA plans housing projects for expats to attract dollars,Auction of commercial plots also on the cards.,"ISLAMABAD: In a bid to attract foreign investment into the country, the federal government is looking towards the Capital Development Authority (CDA) to launch new housing schemes for expatriates to boost country’s dollar reserves.
The civic body has prepared a presentation which would likely be given to the prime minister on Thursday (today) in light of his directives pertaining to these housing projects.
Sources said the CDA was planning to develop Gandhara Enclave – a housing project which falls in Zone I and partially in Zone III – and the Kuri housing scheme. Similarly, the civic body will also brief the government about the revenue potential from the under-construction Nilor Heights housing project.
CDA Chairman Mohammad Usman and his team will give a presentation on the schemes, sources said, adding that the auction of some commercial plots will also come under discussion. They said both schemes have the potential to generate billions of rupees in revenue.

Auction of commercial plots also on the cards

In its briefing, the CDA would also inform the federal government that if it wanted to develop Gandhara Enclave on more than 5,000 kanals, then the civic body would need to acquire more land falling in Zone III. Under the current zoning regulations, construction in Zone III is not allowed. However, the CDA is reportedly working on amending these regulations.
Similarly, the sources said in the first phase, the Kuri housing scheme could be developed on 10,000 kanals. They said it would be one of the largest schemes if everything went as per the plan. Sources said the Kuri scheme could turn out to be a “complicated matter because of chronic and unsettled issues with the locals” also known as affected persons.
The CDA had acquired the land decades ago but after announcing the award, no serious step was taken for the development of the Kuri model village. The civic body officials said thousands of housing units could be constructed as part of this scheme.
The officials said after paying compensation and built-up property claims, the civic agency would have around 2,000 acres of land worth billions of rupees. However, the civic agency never made any serious effort to settle issues with locals to get land’s possession. The officials said an initial survey had shown 1,100 occupants on the said land, but in 2011 the number had risen to 7,000.
At that time, the CDA officials in connivance with locals added many bogus cases to the list of land ownership claims. Later, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) probed the matter and cleared 3,422 ownership cases.
The CDA officials said the civic agency had acquired the land in 1968 while the built-up-property award was announced in 1971. But the CDA failed to take possession of the land after removing the objections raised by locals. In 2009, the civic agency announced a revised built-up property award, but due to allegations of bogus claims, it could not resolve the issue.
“Since the federal government has been supporting CDA, we will deliver and will launch at least two housing schemes, with a focus on apartments,” a CDA official said. He added that the plots would be sold to developers and investors who will be asked to build apartments.

Health Services Academy (HSA) Vice Chancellor Prof Shahzad Ali Khan said majority of the Pakistani population is either depressed, experiencing stress or anxiety and are not very optimistic about the country’s future.
He was addressing the launch of the 24th Thematic Calendar by Jahan-i-Maseeha Adbi Forum (JMAF). The theme of the 2023 calendar is, under these circumstances, Allama Iqbal’s message of ‘Khudi’.
Prof Khan said that hopelessness and despair has spread among the youth and under these circumstances, Iqbal’s message of self-hood can lift the spirits of the Pakistani nation again.
He added that the Pakistani youth now consider everybody as corrupt and incompetent, adding that majority of youngsters are desperate to leave the country although the entire world is facing similar issues and problems like inflation, joblessness and recession.
“Initially, teachers and academia of our society was targeted and they were defamed, later, character assassination of physicians and healthcare professionals was carried out and the same treatment was met out to politicians,” Prof Khan said, adding that things were not as bad as they were being portrayed.
He lauded the philosophy of Iqbal, adding that he was able to turn youngsters from a minority group in the Indian subcontinent into a united force by teaching them lessons of optimism, enthusiasm and encouragement.
The event was organised in collaboration with pharmaceutical firm Pharmevo that has been promoting Iqbal’s philosophy among healthcare professionals throughout the country.
Syed Jamshaid Ahmed of Pharmevo stressed on establishing and creating a healthier society in Pakistan and said that for a healthier society, not just medicines but promotion of literary activities was essential like holding book fairs, mushairas and so on.
Renowned poet Ajmal Siraj said an advisory committee comprising educationists, writers and scholars selected life and literary works of Iqbal as the theme for the next year’s calendar.
