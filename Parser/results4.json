            "Text": "KARACHI: With the deadline for the country\u2019s first digital census approaching on April 10, the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) said on Wednesday that more than 90 per cent of work had been completed in Punjab, Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\nHowever, according to official data released on Wednesday, Islamabad and Balochistan trail significantly behind, with 72pc and 62pc work completed so far, respectively,\nThe brief and sketchy details shared by the PBS also referred to the contribution of 121,000 field enumerators, who have made the exercise possible within the stipulated period, which was revised only on Tuesday, when the bureau extended the last date of field operations from April 4 to 10.\nHowever, the PBS statement didn\u2019t explain the reason behind the below-par performance in Islamabad and Balochistan and how it planned to complete the remaining work in five days.\n\nProgress abysmally low in Balochistan, where 40pc work needs to be completed within five days\n\n\u201cThe digital census is a huge success and a moment of pride for the nation,\u201d the PBS said, adding that so far, 40 million households had been counted and geotagged and 92pc of the census work had been successfully completed, including 95pc in KP, 95pc in Punjab, 92pc Sindh, and 62pc in Balochistan.\n\u201cThe smooth workflow and technology innovations, data of almost 10m people is daily synched without any issues or technical glitches,\u201d it said. \u201cThis is a huge win for Pakistan.\u201d\nPBS officials didn\u2019t respond to calls for further clarity on the breakdown of provincial data provided by the federal agency. The statement, however, lauded the role of provincial governments in ensuring the coverage of areas under respective administrations.\n\u201cThe provincial governments are playing a major role in ensuring 100pc coverage while ensuring the quality and credibility of the whole census process,\u201d it said. \u201cThe real-time data progress monitoring dashboards, provided by PBS down to provincial and district governments, allows for a completely transparent process and continuous oversight of field operations. The dashboard also helps provincial governments in identifying any abnormalities, any areas missed and any other emerging anomalies on a daily basis.\u201d\nIt also shared the methodology based on \u201cuniversal inclusion,\u201d which ensures the area of every individual who\u2019s counted depending on their livelihood.\n\u201cThe current methodology ensures universal inclusion, which means that each and every individual living in the location for six months or planning to live there for another six months, and will be using resources around that location, regardless of their nationality, geography, ethnicity, identity, affiliations, politics, caste or creed, will be counted,\u201d the PBS said.\nThe PBS has also supported the provincial and district governments by setting up a helpline 080057574 and SMS gateway 9727 where people can call for queries or report anyone or any area missed.\n\u201cRecently, on the directions of the prime minister of Pakistan, the 495 census support centres are now also working as points of referral for all missed areas,\u201d it added.\n"

            "Text": "LAHORE: PTI Chairman Imran Khan said on Wednesday that people would take to the streets if the ruling alliance attempted to block the implementation of the court ruling that directed polls in Punjab on May 14.\nThe former prime minister was speaking during a televised address to mark Yaum-i-Tashakkur (gratitude day) celebrations following the top court\u2019s judgement that directed for general elections in Punjab.\nThe speech was broadcasted from his Zaman Park residence through a satellite link on mega screens installed at 75 locations across the country, including in 13 cities of Punjab.\nHowever, the main gathering of the event was held at the Liberty roundabout in Lahore where PTI supporters gathered despite the rain. They were holding party flags while some of them were wearing PTI-themed headbands and scarves.\n \n\n\nAddressing his supporters, the former prime minister said, \u201cThe nation should wait for my call to ensure that the incumbent rulers could not run away from holding elections; otherwise, neither the history nor the future generations will pardon this generation for not waging jihad against the forces undermining the rule of law.\u201d\nHe said \u201cthe Sicilian mafia\u201d was now standing against the decision of the Supreme Court, which had earlier decided in their favour and overturned PTI\u2019s decision to dissolve the National Assembly after opening courts at midnight.\nThe former premier said \u2018absconder\u2019 Nawaz Sharif and Asif Ali Zardari were sitting in London and Dubai, respectively, and taking decisions about the fate of Pakistan. He said the incumbent rulers were also trying to divide the Supreme Court while also working to create a rift between the PTI and the establishment which \u201cmight repeat events of 1971\u201d.\nAsking what kind of economic and security stability can be ensured by October for holding elections, Mr Khan said that only elections would be the way out to take Pakistan out of the blind alley where it was fast heading. \u201cI will complete interviews and selection of candidates in 10 days,\u201d he said and added that the nation would not let the incumbent rulers run away from elections.\nIn an interview with Al Jazeera before the speech, the PTI chairman alleged the ruling PDM could violate the Constitution to prevent national elections due later this year. \u201cThey are just scared of the elections and are even willing to violate the Constitution,\u201d Mr Khan claimed.\n\u201cBy not accepting the SC\u2019s verdict, the government would violate the Constitution\u201d. In such a situation, he said, the SC could slap contempt of court on them.\nMr Khan disclosed he had held two meetings with former army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa and wanted to work out how to hold elections. \u201cWhat I didn\u2019t realise was that he wanted an election provided he gets an extension in his tenure,\u201d he said and added since then he had no conversation with the establishment.\nAnswering a question about his plans on restructuring the civil-military relationship if elected back to power, the PTI chairman said Pakistan needed to change. \u201cThe current civil and military imbalance has to change if we want Pakistan to get out of this mess,\u201d he asserted.\n\u201cYou cannot have a system where the prime minister has the responsibility but he does not have the authority to implement his policies because that authority is shared with the military,\u201d the PTI chief observed.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: In a significant development, the National Tax Council (NTC) on Wednesday approved the much-awaited Place of Provision of Service Rules (PPSRs), a step towards harmonising general sales tax on services across the country and ultimately easing the doing of businesses.\nHarmonising GST on services is a condition of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to unlock funding to Pakistan stalled since December despite implementing several tough policy decisions, in\u00ad\u00adcluding additional tax measures.\nAfter approval of the respective provincial cabinets, the PPSRs will come into effect from May 1. The Sindh Revenue Board (SRB) suggested implementing the rules from July 1, while the other three provincial revenue authorities wanted the implementation from mid-April.\nThe government is in a hurry to get loans from multilateral lenders to shore up its falling foreign exchange reserves and the early implementation of the World Bank project could give some breaking space to Pakistan.\nAs a result, the early implementation of the rules will pave the way for the release of a $1 billion programme loan under the Resilient Institutions for Sustai\u00adn\u00adable Economy (RISE) programme of the World Bank. The programme loan is vital for Pakistan keeping in view the country\u2019s balance-of-payments issue and a considerable delay in getting a $1.1bn tranche from the IMF.\nThe service rules are also a step forward towards facilitating ease of doing business.\nAn official announcement of the finance ministry said the NTC approved the recommendations of its executive committee regarding draft PPSRs. The approval will help achieve the prior actions for the World Bank-funded programme.\nThe meeting approved the exclusion of electric power transmission from the list of Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) goods and it will now be treated as a service. It was decided that it would be implemented from July 1 following the amendment to the Sales Tax Act through the Finan\u00ad\u00adce Bill in the upcoming budget.\nThe SRB has already proposed ru\u00ad\u00adles for the provision of services re\u00ad\u00adlating to electric power transm\u00adi\u00ad\u00adssi\u00ad\u00ado\u00ad\u00adn. Other provincial revenue au\u00ad\u00ad\u00adt\u00adho\u00adrities will also adopt similar rules.\nAll provinces will have their own set of rules subject to the condition that there should be no material differences in these rules, as that is the aim of the entire harmonisation exercise.\nAs per agreement among provinces and the FBR, the advertising service and advertisement agents will be charged sales tax as per an agreed plan. GST on TV and radio ads will be based on the location of the beaming stations.\nIn the case of still media, GST will apply to the location of hoarding sites, while in the case of advertising agents, the tax will be collected based on the location of the agent\u2019s office or branch.\nIn the case of different insurance services \u2014 life and health insurance, insurance of immovable property, insurance agent, re-insurance agent, re-insurance imported and re-insurance local \u2014 the GST on services will be based on the location of the office or branches of the insurance company providing services.\nThe provinces agreed that GST would apply based on the location of the franchise. They also agreed on a formula that half of GST will go to the province of origin on tra\u00adnsportation of goods other than pe\u00adtroleum services provided by co\u00admpanies while the remaining half will go to the destination province.\nIn the case of non-companies, the GST will be based on the location of the booking office on transportation of goods other than petroleum services.\nHalf of the GST will be on the origin of transportation of goods through pipeline or conduit and transmission through the electrical grid, while 50pc tax will be ap\u00ad\u00adplied to the destination province.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: Hitting out hard at the judiciary, a key government minister on Wednesday termed the \u201cimperial Supreme Court (SC) a menace to democracy\u201d and a \u201cusurper\u201d of the rights of all state institutions, as lawmakers in the National Assembly continued their one-sided assault on judges and the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) in the wake of the controversial verdict of a three-judge SC bench to hold elections in Punjab on May 14.\n\u201cThe law is a sword, shield and a menace. And it\u2019s to my deepest regret to state before this house that the imperial SC is a menace to democracy [in this country],\u201d said Federal Minister for Power Khurram Dastgir Khan while using the famous quote of US philosopher and jurist Ronald Dworkin in his speech, as Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf allowed lawmakers to have a full-fledged debate on the April 4 court\u2019s verdict on points of order, which consumed more than four hours.\nBesides Mr Khan, almost all the speakers, including other federal ministers, in their speeches accused the judiciary of facilitating PTI Chairman Imran Khan and said the SC verdict would divide the nation and the country.\nIn their speeches, the members took names of former chief justices, including Iftikhar Chaudhry and Saqib Nisar, accusing them of usurping the rights of all the institutions through the alleged misuse of suo motu powers given in the Constitution and questioned the reluctance of Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial in constituting a full court bench.\n\nNA continues bashing judiciary, PTI in one-sided proceedings; speaker allows debate during points of order\n\nMr Khan alleged that \u201cby consistently showing a tilt towards one person, the court has turned into another political institution and thus undermining its own legitimacy\u201d. He said after facing dictatorship and terrorism, they were now confronting an \u201cimperial Supreme Court\u201d.\nCriticising the judiciary for legitimising past military rules, the minister said there had been a \u201cnexus between the generals and the judges\u201d which had imposed \u201cthe doctrine of necessity\u201d on the nation.\nHe said they either had to struggle against the generals and when there was no military rule, they had to face the judges. The country, he said, needed \u201cdoctrine of democracy and not doctrine of necessity\u201d.\n\u201cThe imperial SC has usurped the rights of legislation, executive, constitutional institutions, lower courts and even their fellow judges,\u201d said the minister while accusing the CJP of encroaching the domain of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) by announcing the election date.\nHe said Clause 69 of the Elections Act, 2017, called for holding of elections in the country on a single day besides empowered the ECP to delay the elections, if a situation arose beyond its control.\nHealth Minister Qadir Patel in his hard-hitting speech suggested that the candidates should be asked to submit their nomination papers in the SC, instead of the ECP.\nOpposition Leader and a PTI dissident Raja Riaz as usual in his unimpressive speech mostly targeted Imran Khan and used some derogatory remarks against him which were expunged by the speaker.\nLashing out at the judiciary, Mr Riaz regretted that instead of listening to the voices of the parliament and lawyers\u2019 organisation, the court preferred to side with a \u201cdrug addict\u201d. The opposition leader used street language and cursed the judges.\nThe opposition leader was directed by the speaker to select appropriate and parliamentary words in the speech. Later, he received flak from his own colleague and another PTI dissident Riaz Mazari, who advised the opposition leader not to talk like those sitting in hotels.\nReligious Affairs Minister Mufti Abdul Shakoor also hit out at the SC and suggested that the SC should now be called a \u201cPTI\u2019s wing.\u201d\n\u201cIs he the CJP or the PTI\u2019s vice-chairman?\u201d asked the minister while making another suggestion that it would be appropriate to place the ECP under the SC.\n\u201cWhen they [judges] are giving schedule and dates [for polls] then what is the need for having the ECP. Better merge the ECP with SC and make the CJP its head,\u201d he said mockingly. And then he suggested giving powers of the president, the prime minister, the speaker and the Senate chairman also to the CJP as there was no need for other institutions when the SC was not caring even for the resolution that had been passed by the parliament seeking formation of a full court.\nFederal Minister for Information Technology Aminul Haque of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) alleged that efforts were being made to create a constitutional crisis in the country which was already facing political and economic mess.\nMr Haque expressed his surprise that the SC\u2019s verdict talked only about the polls in Punjab whereas it seemed that the court had no concern over the elections within 90 days in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. He said it was evident that the ladla (blue-eyed) was being facilitated.\nHe said the upcoming general elections in the country would be held after the completion of the digital census and delimitation of constituencies.\nLone member of the Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) sitting on the opposition benches despite being a part of the ruling Muttehida Majlis-i-Amal (MMA) Maulana Abdul Akbar Chitrali on this occasion supported the stance taken by the ruling coalition and called for the constitution of a full court on the matter, stating that Islam also called for decisions through consultations.\nHe also stated that his party believed that elections of the National Assembly and all the provincial assemblies should be held simultaneously.\nNaz Baloch of the PPP said that \u201cthe worst form of injustice is pretended justice\u201d.\nAnother federal minister Hashim Notezai took the SC to task over al\u00ad\u00adleged misuse of suo motu powers and questioned as to why the court didn\u2019t take any notice of over 5,000 missing persons in Balochistan province.\n"

            "Text": "THE Manchhar Lake is sparkling and calm as fishermen venture deep into the its waters, in anticipation of a decent catch. Several motor boats are anchored near a poorly-maintained harbour. The lake, luckily, has received plenty of freshwater last year, though at the cost of disaster across Sindh in the shape of catastrophic floods triggered by heavy rainfall in Balochistan and upper Sindh.\nThis harbour, situated at Bund Manchhar or RD-62 of embankment, is one of the multiple points set up at and around the lake to transport the catch of the day to the market. Fishermen here are passing boxes to colleagues, to be loaded in vehicles that start lining the bund during the course of the day.\nA worker has just finished putting ice on fish in a large icebox. This is spoilt fish, he says when I ask him about it, destined to end up as poultry feed in Karachi.\nGood times, bad times\n \n \n\nGenerally, fishermen have been euphoric since last year as the lake received more water flows in 2022\u2019s floods than in 2010. However, Maula Bux Mallah, a fisherman by profession, sits in a pensive mood at his small grocery shop located near the harbour.\n\u201cThey [his fellow fishermen] are catching young fish of all species, thus killing them even before they grow in size and weight. It can be beneficial from a commercial point of view for traders, but not fishermen,\u201d he tells me. According to him, larger fish spawn had entered the lake last year through floodwaters coming from Balochistan and torrents from the lake\u2019s catchment area.\n\u201cFish need time to survive and gain health to be used for food. It is a disservice to the lake if we catch the small fish. But who cares,\u201d he rues.\nShowing his discontent, he presses the point: \u201cWe have fish species aplenty since September 2022. Fish spawn should not be culled in the name of the day\u2019s catch,\u201d he says, lamenting that the practice will translate into economic losses for the fishermen.\nHe is not wrong; over the past four decades, fish production has dropped considerably. \u201cAs per fisheries rules, catching small-size fish is an offence,\u201d observes Mustafa Mirani, a representative of the Pakistan Fisherfolk Forum.\nAccording to Mallah, fishermen mix soil intentionally with fish to give it an unclean look to make it seem unfit for the dinner table. \u201cAll these species will have a 7kg-8kg weight easily if allowed to survive, but mohanas [fishermen] are selling them for a price as low as Rs25-Rs30 per kilo under the very nose of fisheries officials.\u201d\nThe lake\u2019s ecology, too, has been affected by toxic effluent from the Main Nara Valley Drain (MNVD) or Right Bank Outfall Drain-I, over the past two decades. MNVD empties effluent in the lake throughout the year.\nFor centuries, families of mohanas have been spending their lives on the lake in floating wooden boathouses, which dot the waters. But the destruction of Manchhar\u2019s ecosystem has led to a drastic decline in fish production and many families have now migrated to other areas with wetlands and freshwater bodies.\nSelling short\nLake conservation activist Maula Bux has been leading the Manchhar Bachao Tehreek for a long time.\nA kilo of morkahi fish can be sold for Rs250 and thelli for Rs200 to Rs300 per kilo. Price-wise, it is a similar story with the raau or jarka species. \u201cFish spawn is now sold for Rs20 per kilo and five to six pieces make a kilogram,\u201d he claims.\nHyder Mallah, another fisherman, concurred with Bux that undersized species are being caught nonstop. For instance, he said a maund is sold for Rs1,200, which can easily go for Rs100,000 if the fish are allowed to survive for a year, making them healthy, nutritious and delicious.\n\u201cSome say fishermen are in the debt of traders and they are selling the catch for cheaper rates,\u201d he says.\n\u201cSince nobody questions them, they catch fish with impunity. They [fishermen] are obviously influential,\u201d he asserted, implying that the lake falls in the Sindh chief minister\u2019s constituency, and thus the fisheries department tends to look the other way while this activity goes unchecked.\nFrom the department\u2019s viewpoint, it is mostly wild fish \u2014 locally known as talabiya \u2014 that is being caught by fishermen for poultry feed trade.\n\u201cThanks to a larger wild fish catch, which is used in poultry as value addition, consumers can avail inexpensive chicken meat, otherwise meat will have been sold for Rs2,000 per kilo as soybean that is used in poultry feed is not imported nowadays,\u201d argues Sindh Fisheries DG Dr Mir Allahdad Talpur.\n\u201cManchhar is not a freshwater lake anymore as effluent discharge has changed its chemistry. We don\u2019t opt for stocking [throwing fish seed] in the lake due to untreated effluent disposal\u201d, he said.\nBux, however, insists that he has urged fisheries officers, including Dr Talpur to take cognisance of the issue. What becomes of the fish, only time will tell.\n"

We have only 1,600mmcfd of gas left for the entire country while the demand is on the rise,\u201d he added.\nThe government, he said, would ensure that poor households are provided gas on priority. However, he added, there would be a ban on new connections.\nHe recalled that Sindh had surplus gas until a few years ago, but currently it is facing a deficit due to a soaring demand.\nMr Malik pointed out that as compared with other provinces only Khy\u00adber Pakhtunkhwa had surplus gas at the moment.\nAs regards gas loadshedding in the industrial sector, he said the crisis could be tackled by coming up with an expensive blend of natural gas and RLNG.\nMr Malik said he would again meet the industrial sector\u2019s stakeholders on Thursday (today) to discuss a strategy to address the issue of gas shortage.\nHe hinted at signing an agreement with Russia for purc\u00ad\u00adhase of crude this mon\u00adth so that consumers could get cheaper fuel.\nHe was of the view that power tariff should be brought down to Rs15-20 per unit from the existing Rs42 to encourage people to meet their heating needs through electricity.\nThe businessmen expr\u00adessed concerns over suspension of gas supply and said it is striking a crippling blow to the local production as well as exports.\nThey said industries cannot perform well due to gas and electricity shortages and high interest rates. They urged the minister to devise an effective strategy for overcoming gas shortage otherwise industries would close down, rendering thousands of people jobless.\nThe state minister also held a meeting with Paki\u00adstan Petroleum Dea\u00adlers Asso\u00adcia\u00adtion Chairman Abdul Sami Khan and discussed with him issues like deal\u00aders\u2019 commission, down\u00ad\u00ad\u00adw\u00adard trend in the sale of domestic oil products due to smuggled Iran\u00adian oil, Shell Pakistan\u2019s franchise fees, structure/processing of sasta petrol scheme, etc.\n"

As per the revised schedule, the process will start from appeals against acceptance or rejection of nomination papers which can be filed by April 10, while the appellate tribunal will decide the appeals by April 17.\nRevised lists of candidates for each constituency will be published on April 18, while candidates can withdraw their nominations by April 19.\nElection symbols to the contesting candidates will be allotted on April 20, while polling for 297 general seats of the provincial assembly will be held on May 14.\n\u2018Punching bag\u2019\nThe ECP announced the schedule after holding a meeting, chaired by Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja, on Wednesday. In its verdict, the court had not only ordered the ECP to hold elections, but also issued a schedule and directed the commission to submit a compliance report by April 11.\n \n \n\nHowever, even the explicit directives of the apex court have so far failed to clear the cloud of uncertainty looming over the polls. Since yesterday, the ruling coalition has minced no words in expressing its disapproval of the apex court\u2019s verdict and refused to abide by it. There is still no clarity on whether the requisite funds and security personnel for holding the elections would be provided to the ECP or not.\nReacting to the apex court\u2019s decision, a senior official of the ECP said the commission\u2019s constitutional mandate to hold free, fair and transparent elections was under attack and the writ of the commission had been weakened, the official added.\nWhile talking to Dawn, the official regretted that the commission had been made \u201ca punching bag\u201d by different institutions.\n\u201cConspiracies have been hatched and the ECP, along with its head have been publicly ridiculed,\u201d he remarked.\nHe added that the Elections Act, 2017 has empowered the commission to try those involved in contempt of the ECP. But the subsequent action of institutions diluted the commission\u2019s authority.\nA malignant campaign was launched against the commission and its head who, the official claimed, also received written threats.\nThe official added that show-cause notices were issued over contemptuous remarks and the use of intemperate language against the ECP. \u201cBut instead of recognising the constitutional position of the ECP, the courts granted stays against the notices.\u201d\n\u201cWe were told to continue with the proceedings, but restrained from passing a final order,\u201d he said.\nThe arrest warrants of those accused of contempt were suspended, weakening the constitutional position of the ECP, the official told Dawn.\nHe said those who allegedly committed the contempt did not appear before the bench as they were \u201ccertain of the support from certain quarters\u201d.\n\u201cA constitutional institution was being made helpless under a preconceived plan, putting a question mark on the holding of fair and transparent elections\u201d, he remarked.\nReferring to the Daska by-poll in February 2021, the official added that 20 presiding officers disappeared under a plan to manipulate the poll results.\nHe added that the ECP took a historic decision to uphold the transparency of elections and make bureaucracy answerable to the commission.\nHe recalled that two separate inquiries found that senior police and district administration officials knew \u201cwhat was going on but still allowed the scheme to unfold\u201d.\nOne of the inquiries found that election officials and government functionaries acted as \u201cpuppets\u201d during the saga.\nThe official said action was initiated against the culprits, but instead of supporting the commission, other institutions suspended the order and granted stays.\nAmjad Mahmood in Lahore also contributed to this report\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: A day after the federal cabinet denounced the court order that directed for elections on May 14, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) asked the ministers \u2014 who attended the meeting \u2014 to distance themselves from the cabinet declaration unless they wanted disqualification proceedings under Article 63-A.\nDuring a media talk in Lahore, PTI spokesperson Fawad Chaudhry said refuting the verdict of the top court was akin to treason and added the PTI would file a reference in the Election Commission under Article 63-A for disqualification of ministers if they did not disown the cabinet\u2019s statement.\nMr Chaudhry said the Insaf Lawyers Forum (ILF) has sought a list of cabinet members who attended the meeting to proceed against them under Article 63-A.\nHe said a request will be made to de-seat the ministers, as they had allegedly violated articles 2A and 68 and other \u201cfundamental articles\u201d of the Constitution.\nThe former information minister also said the PTI would make efforts to get the membership of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz cancelled since a \u201cconvicted person [Nawaz] was running the party from abroad\u201d.\n \n \n\n\u201cIt is against the Constitution of Pakistan and the Election Act. Additionally, Nawaz Sharif is trying to conspire against the Supreme Court\u2019s judges,\u201d he alleged.\nMr Chaudhry said the ECP and the government were bound by the timelines \u2014 such as date for polling \u2013 given in the Supreme Court verdict.\nCommenting on the joint investigation team formed to probe violence at Zaman Park, the PTI leader alleged that interim Chief Minister Mohsin Naqvi, IG Usman Anwar and CCPO Bilal Siddique Kamyana were prime suspects in the murder of Zille Shah. \u201cIt will be unfair to present ourselves before them for investigation,\u201d he said, adding that this JIT was not approved by the cabinet. \u201cThe case is sub judice now and the JIT cannot work till the decision of the court,\u201d he added.\nAddressing the cases against Imran Khan and PTI leadership, he said that the political rivals of the PTI could \u201cstoop to any limit\u201d to victimise the major opposition party.\nPTI offers dialogue\nA separate statement issued by the PTI spokesperson, however, offered an olive branch to the government and said that instead of locking horns with the top court, the government should talk to the PTI to pave way for general elections.\nMr Chaudhry said the ECP\u2019s decision of notifying the Punjab polls date and the caretaker government\u2019s assurance for the implementation of the court decision were \u201csteps in the right direction\u201d.\nThe PTI leader urged the ruling parties to refrain from confrontation with the apex court in the wake of the polls ruling. Fawad Chaudhry said that economic problems necessitated the need to de-escalate the political temperature while calling for polls in the country to put an end to the uncertain situation prevalent in the country.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has observed that the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) could not provide evidence to connect former prime minister Imran Khan with the prohibited funding his party is said to have received.\nIn a detailed judgement issued on Wednesday, the division bench comprising Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani and Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri held that the FIA could not produce \u201csufficient evidence\u201d in support of its request seeking the cancellation of Mr Khan\u2019s bail.\nEarlier, pre-arrest bail was granted to Mr Khan by a trial court in the prohibited funding case.\nThe FIA counsel argued that during inquiry it had transpired that Arif Masood Naqvi, owner of M/s Wootton Cricket Limited (WCL), UAE (registered in Cayman Islands), had transferred ill-gotten money to the tune of $2.12 million to a UBL account.\n\nIHC dismisses plea seeking revocation of PTI chief\u2019s pre-arrest bail\n\nHe said Mr Naqvi, the founder-owner of Abraaj Group, UAE, was imposed with a penalty by the Dubai Financial Services Authority for carrying out unauthorised activities in the Dubai International Financial Centre and misusing the investors\u2019 money. Mr Naqvi is also facing trial in UK and USA for defrauding investors, but PTI submitted an affidavit of Mr Naqvi to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) stating that all the amounts collected in the WCL\u2019s accounts were transferred to the party\u2019s account in Pakistan.\nThe counsel argued that the affidavit was found to be false and forged while signatories and beneficiaries of the UBL account are Mr Khan and nine others. However, when the amount was transacted to the PTI\u2019s account, 12 STRs (suspicious transaction reports) had to be reported by the UBL to the authorities concerned, but they had not performed their duties.\nHe alleged that UBL had not only facilitated these suspicious/illegal transactions but also allowed the \u2018internet merchant acquiring agreement\u2019 changing the account\u2019s title to \u201cNaya Pakistan\u201d of the above referred PEP (politically exposed person\u2019s) UBL account.\nThe FIA\u2019s lawyer claimed that trial court had granted the pre-arrest bail to Mr Khan without due deliberations.\nThe court observed that the FIR only reflects two eventualities \u2014 one, Mr Naqvi has given an affidavit to the ECP regarding the foreign currency transferred into the PTI\u2019s account but the said affidavit has been proved to be false/forged as two more transactions were made from WCL to two different accounts in Pakistan in May 2013. The court noted that this has nothing to do with Mr Khan\u2019s case as the FIA can investigate that the amount transacted by Mr Naqvi is ill-gotten money and his affidavit was false but both these aspects were not probed till date.\n\u201cThe second element, which was highlighted in the entire record, is the allegation against bank\u2019s officials who have allegedly not reported regarding 12 CTRs/STRs to the concerned authorities despite receiving of huge amount in US$ in the PTI\u2019s account which reflects that matter should fall within the mandate of State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) being master regulator under SBP Act, 1956\u201d, stated the court order.\nThe FIA failed to demonstrate \u201cany of the regulation of the SBP where signatories of account in any scheduled bank are liable to prosecution,\u201d it noted.\nAs regards the allegation of changing PTI\u2019s account with \u2018Naya Pakistan\u2019, the court ruled that it was not an offence at all.\nThe bench has perused the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947 and noted that prosecution \u201chas failed to demonstrate the requirements of Section 19 of FERA, 1947 [complied with] prior to the registration of FIR, where only authorised person on behalf of Federal Government or the State Bank supported by a statement on oath can represent that any contravention of provision of this Act has been committed\u201d.\nThe bench expressed surprise over the conduct of SBP officials, who have not yet inquired regarding the bank transactions being the master regulator, nor declared any of the banking transaction as illegal, neither IO has ever recorded the statement of any of the official of SBP through which it could be demonstrated that any bank rules, regulations or circulars have been violated.\nWith regards to the contention of prosecution that Mr Khan has not yet joined the inquiry, the court noted that this could not be the reason for bail cancellation.\nThe bench subsequently dismissed the petition.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court has held that it has the power in its constitutional jurisdiction to monitor investigations into matters affecting the fundamental rights of the public at large.\n\u201cWe are further strengthened in this view by our own jurisprudence which affirms that the court has the power in its constitutional jurisdiction to monitor, as opposed to supervising, investigations into matters affecting the fundamental rights of the public at large,\u201d observed a four-page Supreme Court order after the March 17 hearing. Headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial, the court had taken up suo motu hearing in the killing of journalist Arshad Sharif who was shot dead in Kenya last year.\nThe Supreme Court made these remarks by relying on the 2010 Bank of Punjab versus Haris Steel Industries (Pvt) judgement. The observation came when senior counsel Shahzad Aziz Siddiqui, representing the mother of the slain journalist, had pleaded that since the Special Joint Investigation Team (SJIT) has been formed to investigate the murder, the court\u2019s supervision of the investigation, though bona fide, was impermissible.\nTo fortify his contention, the counsel had relied on the 1971 Shahnaz Begum versus Judges of the High Court of Sindh and Balochistan in which it was held that the high court has no power under section 561-A of the CrPC to interfere with police investigations into criminal offences. But if an investigation is launched mala fide or is clearly beyond the jurisdiction of the investigating agencies concerned then it may be possible for the action of the investigating agencies to be corrected by a proper proceeding.\n\nIf dissatisfied, court says it will form judicial commission for Arshad Sharif case\n\nThe March 17 order said the Supreme Court has perused the judgement cited and was of the view that the case cited was not applicable to the present matter since it was delivered on a completely different factual matrix.\n\u2018Question of public importance\u2019\nThe apex court said it was not disputed by any party before the court that the present suo motu raises important questions of public importance and has a direct nexus with the fundamental rights of the journalist community and the people.\nIndeed the Dec 5, 2022 office note, which became the basis of the process for the present suo motu notice recalled how after the murder of Arshad Sharif on Oct 23, 2022, more than 5,000 letters from journalists and the general public seeking the court\u2019s scrutiny of the matter were received, the order said.\nNevertheless, the court exercised restraint and took notice on Dec 6, 2022, after it had become evident that scant progress had been made regarding the investigation into the murder. The sole purpose was to secure an independent and transparent investigation into the murder of Arshad Sharif, an objective to which it is committed, the order explained.\nThe court appreciates that the present matter is a sensitive one which spans multiple foreign jurisdictions. Consequently, expecting prompt results as might have been possible if the investigation was confined within the territorial limits of Pakistan may not be realistic, the ruling added.\nHowever the court is also concerned that progress in the investigation has stalled in the past few months, the order said, adding three weeks were earlier given to the government and the investigation team to demonstrate their earnestness in advancing the investigation.\nFailure to satisfy the court that all efforts were being expended to accelerate the investigation may compel the Supreme Court to consider constituting a judicial commission for investigating the murder of Arshad Sharif, the order said.\nIt added that on his part, Additional Attorney General Chaudhry Aamir Rehman was directed to identify the correct process for forwarding Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA) requests to the government of Kenya under the Kenyan Mutual Legal Assistance Act 2011 and to inform the court once a response was received from the Kenyan authorities on the amended MLA request of Feb 22, 2023.\n"
