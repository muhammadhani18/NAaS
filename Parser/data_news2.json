Among them, 103 appeals were approved, 56 were rejected, and six were withdrawn.\nThe appellate tribunal operating under the jurisdiction of the Lahore High Court\u2019s Rawalpindi Bench, consisting of Justice Mirza Waqas Rauf and Justice Chaudhary Abdul Aziz, issued verdicts on all filed appeals.\nAccepted appeals declared several candidates eligible for the upcoming election, including former interior minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, former Punjab speaker Sabtain Khan, deputy speaker Wasiq Qayyum Abbasi, former law minister Basharat Raja, former minister Raja Rashid Hafeez, former federal minister Ijazul Haq, Major Tahir Sadiq, Naz Sadiq, Iman Sadiq, Zulfi Bukhari, Ijaz Khan Jazi, Murtaza Satti, Major Latasab Sati, Ayaz Amir, Umair Khan Niazi, Fozia Behram, Colonel Ajmal Sabir, Seemabia Tahir, and Raja Nasir.\nRead\u00a0Tribunal gives clean chit to Sharif family to contest polls\nHowever, key figures such as former premier Imran Khan, former Punjab chief minister Pervaiz Elahi, former minister Fawad Chaudhary, Hiba Chaudhry, Hafiz Ammar Yasir, Arif Abbasi, and former prime minister Yusuf Raza Gilani\u2019s media advisor Mian Khurram Rasool had their appeals rejected, barring them from the election.\nCandidates whose appeals were rejected plan to challenge the election tribunal's decision in the Lahore High Court Larger Bench on Thursday.\nThe larger bench is expected to resolve all appeals within three days. The election tribunals forwarded the list of approved appeals to relevant returning officers on Wednesday, and a new list will be issued on Thursday, incorporating the approved names.\nIslamabad tribunal\nSeparately, an Islamabad appellate tribunal decided on 70 cases and approved 65 candidates\u2019 appeals against the rulings of returning officers.\nTribunal Judge Arbab Muhammad Tahir rejected two appeals against the approval of the nomination papers of a transgender candidate.

            "Text": "The ironing machine is an essential household item which serves as a basic necessity in every home. However, Sher Muhammad of Patiala still runs his business by taking it upon himself to iron people\u2019s clothes with his hand-crafted coal-powered iron at a nominal fee.\nIt can be said that iron plays an important role in shaping people\u2019s personality and surely, no one prefers to leave the house wearing clothes lined with creases. However, ironing can be a time-consuming task that may prove a challenge, especially in the case of smoothing out clothes fashioned from different kinds of fabric.\nThis is where Sher Muhammad comes in. A 75-year-old man from Patiala near Saidpuri Gate \u2013 the densest area of Rawalpindi \u2013 makes both ends meet by using a charcoal iron to provide ironing services to locals of the area and has been doing so for the past 70 years.\nTalking to The Express Tribune, Sher Muhammad said \u201cOur forefathers belong to Patiala, and we used to live in Saidpuri Gate before Pakistan was founded.\u201d\nHe says before the creation of Pakistan, Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims were living happily in one neighbourhood. \u201cWhen the movement for Pakistan started, the desire for a separate homeland arose in our hearts. I participated in the movement,\u201d he elaborated while sharing his life story.\nSher Muhammad explained that in the earlier days Kartarpura, Saidpuri Gate, Bhapara Bazaar, Haripur, and Bagh Sardaran were areas within old Rawalpindi that had central status. In these areas, resided the famous traders.\nRead\u00a0PPP rebukes PML-N claiming credit for Thar coal power project\nHindu and Sikh traders mostly wore white clothes and shawls and warm woollen clothes in the winter, while women used to wear silk, banarsi and cotton sarees. He said, \u201cWhen I started my service, I used to iron shalwar kameez for one rupee.\u201d\nMy iron was made of a block of iron worth Rs200, he said adding that irons like these are no longer manufactured and coal has also become expensive. \u201cNow I charge Rs100 to iron a pair of shalwar kameez. I iron the clothes of twenty-five houses in the neighbourhood and I have raised my children with the help of this iron,\u201d he exclaimed.\nSher Muhammad has three children. His eldest son has died, while two of his children work hard to run the household. His children are the ones who pay the ironing store\u2019s rent which costs Rs5,000 per month.\nIn the past, clothes were ironed on special occasions such as Eid or other festivals. However, people are now in the habit of regularly ironing clothes and they prefer to use an ironing machine made of iron. The main reason for this is that the weight of a machine made of iron helps press and smooth out fabric so that it gives the cloth a sheen of its own.\n"

Later, the issue was resolved with the intervention of senior officers and a case was registered.

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai after showing concerns over 26 million out-of-school children and a large number of vacant seats for teachers in Pakistan has offered a helping hand and asked the prime minister to focus on the education sector to promote education.\nMalala Yousafzai in a letter to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said: \u201cCurrently, 26 million children \u2014 predominantly girls in the poorest districts of Pakistan \u2014 remain out of school. Furthermore, more than 200,000 teachers\u2019 seats are vacant nationwide.\u201d\n\u201cThis gap is severely affecting the functioning of schools and negatively impacting student retention and quality of schooling. Our collective aim should be to design a measurable, realistic plan to bring these numbers down significantly over the course of your term,\u201d she added.\nMalala further said that her organisation supported civil society and education experts in their efforts to improve teaching practices, digital education, and girls\u2019 leadership development, but still, critical work remained.\n\nNobel Laureate concerned over 26m out-of-school kids, shortage of teachers\n\nIn her letter to the PM, she said: \u201cCongratulations on your appointment as the Prime Minister of Pakistan. I wish you all the best as you begin your term in the office. In the busy months ahead, you will undoubtedly have many critical issues to contend with and agendas to advance. I would humbly ask that you see the education of girls in Pakistan as one of your most urgent and meaningful priorities.\u201d\nShe said that Pakistan has made significant progress in girls\u2019 education in the last decade, \u201cand I am proud that Malala Fund has continued to play its part. As you may know, Malala Fund has invested more than $15 million in Pakistan. Our work with the Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training has allowed us to reach more than 4,500 high schools, engaging directly with nearly 500,000 girls through our STEAM partnership.\u201d\nShe said: \u201cI know that ensuring more girls are able to access and complete school in Pakistan will not come without cost, and budgetary constraints facing the state are understandable. At Malala Fund, we are beginning advocacy work this year to promote the reform of the international financing architecture.\u201d\n\u201cThis would include efforts that focus on relieving the increasing debt burden faced by many countries. My hope is that these global efforts \u2014 including work with stakeholders such as the UN, the World Bank, the IMF, and their donors \u2014 can complement and support important work happening within Pakistan to increase the domestic budget for education,\u201d she said and added that right now, Pakistan spends less than 2 per cent of its GDP on education. In the years ahead, \u201cI hope to see this figure reach and surpass 4%, aligned with the targets outlined in your party manifesto for the 2024 general election,\u201d she told PM through letter.\n\u201cAs you [PM] develop your first 100-day plan, I look forward to working with your government to elevate girls\u2019 education as a priority. I assure you that my team in Pakistan and our grantees are working diligently with your federal and provincial governments, as well as other development partners, to advance our shared goals as rapidly and effectively as possible.\u201d\n\u201cI thank you for your attention and look forward to staying in touch, whether on the margins of the UN General Assembly week meetings in September or later this year when I hope to travel to Pakistan again,\u201d she said.\n"

After the incident, the capital police claimed that the suspect was killed by the firing of his accomplices.\nAccording to police officers, the incident took place after Sehri in Kirpa, but the case over the alleged encounter was not registered even after the passage of more than 10 hours. They further said the suspect was picked up by the police and detained at a private cell located in a rural area before the alleged encounter.\nOn Monday, the PRO through a message invited media persons to attend an important press conference of DIG Operations Syed Shahzad Nadeem Bukhari, but it was cancelled at the eleventh hour, the officers said, adding that the press conference was slated to announce the arrest of an alleged criminal wanted in a number of cases, but it was cancelled due to unknown reason.\nThe police spokesperson told Dawn the encounter occurred after Sehri and a case in this regard had not been registered. He expressed ignorance about the delay in the registration of the FIR. Replying to a question that the police picked up the suspect before the encounter, the PRO responded that the deceased was not arrested by the police.\nWhen asked about the details of the encounter, the PRO showed ignorance and said the FIR over the incident had not been registered.\nAccording to a tweet by the Islamabad police, the capital police raided an area in the remits of the Kirpa police station in response to information about the presence of proclaimed offenders.\nThe criminals started firing at the police after seeing them, however, the official remained unhurt due to protective measures, the statement said, adding that as a result of the firing by the criminals, one of their accomplices was shot dead.\nThe deceased was identified as Ahmed Shah. The suspect was wanted in over 12 cases, including a murder and robbery, it added.\nDuring the ongoing year, eight encounters occurred in the capital between the suspects and the police.\nIn these encounters, two suspects were killed and five were injured. Last year, in at least 63 encounters, 12 suspects were eliminated and 27 were incapacitated. In the same year, a policeman from the Punjab police was also killed and 10 officials of the capital police were injured in such incidents.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: As many as 10 black bears are now housed in the Rescue and Rehab Centre, formerly known as Islamabad zoo, after two more were rescued and transferred from Khushab.\nThe transfer, which took place early Tuesday morning, was arranged by the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB) in collaboration with the Four Paws team.\nThe operation commenced at 5am on Tuesday, with the IWMB staff and Four Paws team members working tirelessly to ensure the safe reception of the newly-rescued bears. Upon arrival, it was evident that both bears \u2014 Boogie and Laila \u2014 were in dire condition, with their faces bearing numerous scratches \u2014 a grim reminder of the harsh realities they endured, likely from engaging in bear baiting.\nDr Frank Goritz, who is head veterinarian at Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research Berlin, had to operate and surgically remove one of Boogie\u2019s infected eyes.\nBoth, eight years old Boogie and six to seven years old Laila had no teeth.\n\u201cBoth bears got the best treatment in the world. The Four Paws team has been working tirelessly from 8am till sundown since they arrived a few days ago to give the bears complete head to toe checkup,\u201d said Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB) Chairperson Rina Saeed Khan.\nFour Paws returned on a five-day visit on the urgent request of the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB). A team of Four Paws veterinarians and wildlife experts have supported the Pakistani wildlife authorities with the veterinary treatment and neutering of eight resident bears at the Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre.\nThe team also assisted in planned rescue and relocation of the new confiscated bears from bear baiting, dancing and breeding activities.\nThe two bears were transferred following a visit by Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb to the Rescue and Rehab Centre on Monday.\n\u201cWe requested her to transfer Boogie and Laila to the rescue centre where some of the best veterinarians will administer treatment they need.\n\u201cShe agreed immediately, for which we are grateful,\u201d said Rina Saeed Khan.\nAccording to Ms Khan, the Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre was poised to evolve into a sanctuary in the near future.\n\u201cWith ample space spanning 28 acres, the centre is well-equipped to establish permanent residences for the rescued bears,\u201d she said, adding that \u201cfurthermore, there has been keen interest from international donors to provide financial support to IWMB for this initiative\u201d.\nThe addition of these two bears to the centre underscores the ongoing efforts to provide sanctuary and care for animals rescued from such cruel practices. With proper rehabilitation and compassionate care, it was hoped that these bears would be able to heal and thrive in their newfound home, said Rina Khan optimistically.\nSince the Asiatic black bear is indigenous to Pakistan, the rescued bears will not be sent abroad like Kaavan the elephant and Baboo, the rescued Bengal tiger.\nAs half of the Four Paws team returns home Tuesday night, the remaining members would be staying behind to ensure the bears get post surgery care if required.\n\u201cTheir team is also leaving behind medication for the bears that cannot be acquired locally. They will be returning in a few weeks to assist the Punjab government to end the cruel practice of bear baiting and street dancing. Punjab is the only province where these cruel practices prevail,\u201d Rina Khan added.\n"

The rushswelled on Tuesday with passengers complaining of being overcharged by transporters.\nPakistan Railways launched special trains for Karachi, Lahore and Peshawar besides attaching additional coaches to the trains. The last special train to Karachi left on Tuesday while a train from Quetta brought passengers, said railway officials. They said every year there was a rushof people at the railway station and the management made elaborate measures to deal with it.\nThe passengers at the railway station complained that they faced hardship in getting tickets. They wanted to reserve seats but due to rushat booking stations they failed to do so.\nHowever, some passengers complained about black marketing of tickets. \u201cSome people were in the railway station selling tickets at high rates,\u201d alleged Mohammad Akhter, who was going to Lahore.\nMeanwhile, the inter-province and inter-district busterminals too witnessed a big rush of passengers. Hundreds of passengers boarded buses and wagons for Lahore, Peshawar, Bhakhar and Multan from Soan, Pirwadhai Mor and Pirwadhai general busstands.\nThe passengers complained of overcharging by transporters and overcrowded buses and wagons. They told Dawn that transporters were charging more than normal fares. \u201cI have to pay double the normal fare for Multan,\u201d said Mohammad Tanveer. He said he had no option but to pay the double fare.\nOn the other hand, Deputy Commissioner Dr Hassan Waqar Cheema said that the administration will not allow overcharging by transporters. He directed Regional Transport Authority Secretary Rashid Ali to visit the bus stand at Pirwadhai and take strict action against transporters charging high fares. He said implementation of fares was being ensured, he said.\nOn the instructions of the DC, the secretary RTA along with his staff made a surprise visit to the general bus stand at Pirwadhai. The transporters were issued challans of Rs0.2 million. Officials of the transport union met the RTA secretary. The transporters assured them of not overcharging and facilitating passengers.\nThe RTA secretary said a control room had been set up at the RTA office for redress of public grievances. Squads have also been set up for implementation of the officially fixed fares.\n"

He said the proposed Gandhara Corridor would also demonstrate that the state of Pakistan supported non-Muslims to enjoy religious freedom, as guaranteed in the Constitution and international laws.\n\u201cI would like to request you to kindly arrange my meeting with all the stakeholders of KP under your leadership at the CM House, Peshawar, on a priority basis to address the reservations that have arisen regarding the Gandhara Bill,\u201d the letter added.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: Services at Mother and Child Hospital (MCH) of the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) have been affected and a rift between the MCH head and her subordinates is adding to the misery of patients.\nAgainst this backdrop, a number of applications had been filed with the ministry, the federal ombudsperson, and other forums to highlight the state of affairs at the hospital in the federal capital. According to the subordinates, Dr Nosheela Amjad, the head of the department at MCH, lacked \u2018clinical experience\u2019 and was not able to run the hospital properly. Dr Nosheela denied this and said her subordinates were irked due to her focus on merit and discipline.\nAccording to documents available with Dawn, Associate Professor of Gynecology and Obstetrics (BS-19) Dr Nosheela was entrusted the current charge of professor on April 6, 2023. The nurses at MCH in a letter to the health ministry secretary alleged that the doctor was forcing the staffers to refer patients to her private practice in Max Health Hospital, Sector G-8. The MCH does not take patients after three months of pregnancy, but the patients can be booked in the hospital after their Max Health consultation, the letter alleged.\nAccording to the nurses\u2019 letter, the doctors are forced to tamper with the records of junior doctors if they \u201crefuse to do illegal act\u201d. The letter demanded a fact-finding inquiry into the issue.\n\nStaffers allege MCH head incompetent; Dr Nosheela says staff turned on her for enforcing discipline\n\nAnother application submitted by the Young Doctors Association (YDA) that two \u201clucrative\u201d posts i.e. director and the MCH HOD were being held simultaneously by Dr Nosheela in contravention of the judgement of the apex court.\nAn application submitted by a resident Shahid Khan, in the office of the Federal Ombudsman and available with Dawn, stated the doctors misbehaved with his wife in the labour room. The complainant alleged that when his wife tried to respond, the doctor allegedly told her that she \u201ccan kill her and no one will be able to prove it\u201d as accidents can take place during surgeries/deliveries.\nAnother application alleged that Dr Nosheela was an assistant instructor at the population ministry and was transferred to Pims after the ministry was devolved in light of 18th Amendment. It claimed that she was not competent enough to run MCH.\nA doctor working at MCH told Dawn that Dr Nosheela was from the admin cadre in the population ministry and had no experience with patients. She, however, managed to get her non-clinical experience converted into clinical experience to become the head of the department, she said. Later on, she got the additional charge of the MCH director to oversee the administrative issues which led to a conflict of interest.\n\u201cBesides that, she started her private setup at G-8 Max Health Hospital; just after one month she started issuing the policies regarding the admissions of patients to MCH and her policy is simple: mint the money from poor patients as the staff is forced to admit a limited number of patients and ask others to go to the private setup of Dr Nosheela,\u201d she alleged. \u201cPatients are booked from Pims for a private hospital in which the HOD sits. That practice should be stopped,\u201d she suggested.\nAdministration\u2019s view\nDr Nosheela rebutted the claims made by the staffers, saying the hospital staff turned on her because she was trying to ensure discipline and punctuality in the government-owned facility.\n\u201cPims is the hospital from where I got my initial training. Unfortunately, the hospital was facing the same issues in 2023, which I observed during my training. I decided to address the issues thinking that Allah has given me the power so I must deliver,\u201d she said.\nThe doctor alleged that the majority of the doctors were visiting the hospital only to mark their attendance and then leave the hospital during duty hours to deal with private deliveries.\n\u201c...they were also getting Rs 80,000 per month as non-practicing allowance [those who do not practice in private clinics get Rs 80,000 per month]. I banned and stopped payments of non-practicing allowance and I don\u2019t take it as well because I am also doing private practice,\u201d she said.\n\u201cPims had Dr Batool in the past and she was very famous for her dedication to the profession. I want to become Dr Batool. The fact is that doctors work in private hospitals till late at night and they don\u2019t bother to reach Pims in the morning. I am not going to tolerate it because I cannot allow 60 postgraduates [trainee doctors] to run the Outpatient Department (OPD) of MCH because they can make blunders,\u201d she said.\nReplying to a question, Dr Nosheela said that there was a capacity of 60 births in a day and she admitted 60 patients [including those who are not registered] on a first come first serve basis and suggested others to go somewhere else.\n\u201cPims is a tertiary care hospital and we should only have complicated and emergency cases. I never refuse complicated cases. Moreover, we check 300 patients in OPD daily. I believe that being a tertiary care hospital, we should not deal with normal deliveries at all,\u201d she said.\nReplying to a question, she said that it was correct that she and some other doctors were transferred from the devolved Ministry of Population but got the endorsement of the court when staff contacted courts against their appointments. \u201cI don\u2019t care about those who have been criticising. I just want to deliver and there is visible difference/improvement in services of MCH as compared to past,\u201d Dr Nosheela claimed.\n"

They are far-reaching educational welfare schools established for the most marginalised segment of the society.\nThe other provinces are also establishing Daanish schools to provide quality education to talented students.\nThe current federal government also intends to establish Daanish School in Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT). For this purpose, Capital Development Authority (CDA) has allocated a piece of 10 acers land.\n\u201cEstablishment of the Daanish School in ICT represents a significant step towards addressing the challenges facing the education sector in Pakistan\u2019s capital city,\u201d said an official of the Prime Minister\u2019s Office (PMO).\n\u2018By providing quality education to residents belonging to deprived sections, we can empower learners, strengthen communities, and contribute to the development of a more equitable and inclusive society. With dedication, collaboration, and innovation, we can transform education system\u2019s pedagogy from rote learning to 21st century learning and leveraged education technology to improve and track delivery,\u201d he adedd.\nThe project in Islamabad is proposed for next Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP 2024-25).\nThe school will provide access to modern quality education to students who lack opportunity of quality education. It will also overcome lack of learning opportunities through modern pedagogical techniques in education.\nThe concept will also address non-availability of qualified teachers to provide learning of subjects of contemporary education.\nIt is believed that the school will enhance access and relevance of quality education and provide opportunities for modern school education to students belonging to under privileged families and vulnerable groups of the society.\nIt will provide chance of learning opportunities through modern pedagogical techniques in education.\nThe school will also provide qualified students as work force to contribute to national economy.\nThe project is said to be fully aligned to mainstream the students belonging to families of low income groups by providing access to quality education and provide learning opportunities to children enrolled in Daanish School by principles of equality and inclusion to ensure that the students graduating from these schools are not left behind in the national stream.\n"

The meeting was attended by the DIG operations, acting DIG Security, and SSP operations.\n\nSources say commissioner\u2019s office, interior ministry working to abolish Police Order\n\nAccording to the Esta Code (Civil Establishment Code) and Rules of Business 1973, the IGP can appoint the senior-most officer to look after the top post for 90 days or till the appointment of a regular police chief.\nSince the IGP failed to appoint his stopgap replacement and the new police chief appeared reluctant to take charge, the most senior officer of the capital police will look after the office of the IGP as per the rules as mentioned earlier.\n\u2018Not the most senior officer\u2019\nSources said DIG Raza was not the most senior officer in the capital police, as DIG Awais Ahmed, currently in Kenya, is fourth in the seniority list of CTP-29 whereas DIG Raza is in the 14th place.

It may be noted that along with two other DIGs, DIG Security Awais Ahmed also applied for a 15-day leave from the commissioner but the request was declined on account of a tug-of-war between the police and local administration. The same officers had sought five-day leaves from the ex-IGP because they did not \u2018salute\u2019 a junior officer who was named as the police chief.\n"
