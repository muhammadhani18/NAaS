            "Text": "In the wake of the new year, Bahawalnagar is witnessing an alarming surge in street crimes, leaving residents grappling with increased incidents of muggings and robberies.\nDisturbingly, the police seem powerless to curb the escalating menace, leading to growing public discomfort and a surge in citizen complaints.\nIn a recent string of robberies, a police security officer's residence was targeted, raising questions about the efficacy of law enforcement in the region.\nThe officer, Umair Nazir, stationed at the DPO office, fell victim to a harrowing incident where five armed bandits seized gold jewellery worth over Rs2.2 million, cash, prize bonds, mobile phones, and even the officer's personal pistol and wireless set.\nThe FIR for this incident was lodged after a 24-hour delay, further eroding public trust in the authorities.\nThe brazenness of the criminals was evident as they broke into the officer's house, holding the family at gunpoint, and looted valuables before making a swift escape.\nThe incident has not only highlighted the vulnerability of the public but has also cast doubts on the police's credibility.\nRead\u00a0 Crime rate in Chichawatni soars\nIn another incident near the Dhaban area of Saddar police station, two bandits set up barricades and robbed ten victims of thousands of rupees.\nTravellers named Imran and Rab Nawaz, were targeted by the bandits while en route to the vegetable market, recounting the ordeal of being robbed at gunpoint.\nA separate incident unfolded within the jurisdiction of the Minchinabad police station, where two robbers targeted a Lahore\u2019s resident, making off with Rs125,000.\nAbdullah, the victim, faced the unfortunate incident while returning after attending an event.\nIn yet another incident under the Saddar Haroonabad police station, six to seven bandits forcefully entered the house of a landlord named Maqbool.\nRead\u00a0 City of Saints plagued by crime\nThe family was subjected to a terrifying ordeal as the robbers, armed and menacing, ransacked the rooms for hours, taking away seven tolas of gold jewellery and cash amounting to Rs1,672,000.\nTragically, violence erupted in the fifth incident when four bandits attempted to rob Kaleemullah.\nThe resistance from Kaleem led to a confrontation, resulting in him being shot in the left thigh by one of the robbers wielding a pistol.\nThe spate of criminal activities has prompted the police to initiate separate investigations into all the incidents. However, concerns about the district police's efficacy persist, with rising complaints and a weak grip on law and order. During the 90-day period, the district police received over 1,500 complaints, indicating a growing dissatisfaction among the public.\nIn a startling revelation during an online open court session, a complainant from Tehsil Chishtian accused each DPO appointed by political figures of receiving a hefty amount of Rs2.5 million.\nDespite mounting complaints and allegations, the DPO neither took action nor refuted the salary claims in the online open court.\nThe appointment of a specific SHO at Saddar police station is identified as a contributing factor to the deteriorating law and order situation in Bahawalnagar.\n\u00a0\n"

The popularity of fish has soared, attributed to its perceived suitability for extreme weather conditions.\nTemporary stalls offering a wide array of fresh fish have become a common sight across the city, including in the fish market, MDA Chowk, Pul Bararan and many other areas.\nAmong the options available, larger fish are being priced at Rs600 per kilogram, while smaller varieties are selling at the slightly lower rate of Rs550 per kilogram. Fish has become the go-to dish amid the prevailing harsh weather, providing not only taste but also a source of warmth and comfort.\nRead\u00a0 Winter brings boom to fish sales\nMedical experts have endorsed the consumption of fish during cold weather.

The extreme weather impacted the movement of citizens not only in Multan but also in Vehari, Lodhran and other areas.\nWith five popular theatres in the city able to seat 2,000 visitors, the reduced turnout has raised concerns. Poor conditions have not only affected citizens\u2019 willingness to venture out, but have also financially impacted the entertainment industry. Producers have been compelled to suspend shows nearly thrice a week. This interruption in regular schedules has not only impacted revenue streams but has also affected the livelihoods of artists.\nFurthermore, the health of some artists has been compromised with instances of illness, particularly flu-related, prompting them to refrain from working.\n"

I give all my customers a one month warrantee,\u201d assured Khan, who sells laptops at the Sunday Bazaar.\nUnsure of Khan\u2019s claims, Mohammad Taha, a young man spotted purchasing laptops at the market revealed that he had already bought three or four laptops from here purely because of their convenience and affordability. \u201cSo far, my experience has been very good. The laptops available here are much cheaper than the normal market price and the variety is also greater,\u201d said Taha.\nSpeaking to The Express Tribune on the sale of stolen gadgets, a spokesman of the Punjab Police said, \u201cSince 2019, it is mandatory for all those involved in the purchase and repair of mobile phones to register themselves with the app called e-Gadget Monitoring System. The registered shopkeepers are obliged to store the identity information of all the people coming for sale or repair of their mobiles, including their IMEI numbers. There has been a significant decrease in the incidents of snatching mobile phones ever since this app has come into use.\u201d\n"

Despite her government employment, she resides in a private hostel in Shadman, as her attempts to secure space in a government hostel proved futile.\nFacing challenges in her previous hostel during the 2019 pandemic, Gul now pays Rs25,000 per month in her current private hostel. While noting improved security, she acknowledges the downsides of small rooms and unsanitary washrooms.\nSyeda Batul Fatima, originally from Layyah, resides in a government working women's hostel in Lahore. Being the daughter of an additional secretary facilitated her accommodation in the government hostel. However, the facilities, mirroring those in government institutions, raise concerns, especially regarding cleanliness in washrooms.\nRead\u00a0 SCF launches new initiative to empower women labourers\nThe presence of a mess committee doesn't alleviate the situation, as women often resort to ordering food due to varying work schedules.\nDespite the absence of an official record, hundreds of private hostels operate in Punjab, each with its own regulations and rental policies.\nMazahir Shagri, operating a private hostel in Lahore, points out the challenges faced by operators, such as varying rent structures and the absence of regulatory bodies. The lack of oversight results in administrators maintaining their own records, leading to undue demands for money during inspections.\nSpeaking to The Express Tribune, the Women's Welfare Department Secretary Sumaira Samad revealed that there were currently 16 working women's hostels in Punjab, ensuring 625 beds.\n\u201cPlans are underway to establish hostels in all districts, with a budget allocation expected in the next financial year for the Women's Hostels Authority,\u201d she said.\nSamad emphasised that any working woman can stay in the hostels, irrespective of government employment. While current rents are low, there are plans to review and potentially increase them.\nRead\u00a0 Self-care: the transformative action for working women\nThe Women's Welfare Department outlined four room categories with varying rents, with big cities like Lahore having higher rates.\nThe recently approved Punjab Women Hostels Authority Act of 2023 aims to address these challenges, outlining the composition of the authority and its objectives. However, the establishment faces delays due to the caretaker government, with expectations of activation post-elections.\nAs the demand for suitable accommodation persists, the effectiveness of the Women's Hostels Authority becomes crucial in ensuring safe and adequate living conditions for working women across Punjab.\nRent details from the Women's Welfare Department indicate that a single room in Lahore, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, and Multan costs Rs1500 a month while a double room costs Rs1,000 per person.\nRead\u00a0 ADB approves $155m for women\u2019s access to finance\nThree and four-bedroom rents are Rs800 per person. All residents pay electricity and gas bills separately, with a refundable security deposit of Rs5,000 in big cities and Rs4,000 in small cities.\nThe Punjab Women Hostels Authority Act, approved in February 2023, aims to establish an authority overseeing the sector. However, its activation faces delays due to the caretaker government. The act outlines the authority's composition, including ex-officio members and representatives from various sectors.\nWhile the caretaker government's absence of a Women Development Department Minister delays the authority's establishment, there is optimism for its functionality post-elections.\nThe establishment of the Punjab Working Women Hostels Authority is seen as a crucial step in bringing hostels under a legal framework and formulating necessary rules and regulations for their effective operation.\n"

            "Text": "The ironing machine is an essential household item which serves as a basic necessity in every home. However, Sher Muhammad of Patiala still runs his business by taking it upon himself to iron people\u2019s clothes with his hand-crafted coal-powered iron at a nominal fee.\nIt can be said that iron plays an important role in shaping people\u2019s personality and surely, no one prefers to leave the house wearing clothes lined with creases. However, ironing can be a time-consuming task that may prove a challenge, especially in the case of smoothing out clothes fashioned from different kinds of fabric.\nThis is where Sher Muhammad comes in. A 75-year-old man from Patiala near Saidpuri Gate \u2013 the densest area of Rawalpindi \u2013 makes both ends meet by using a charcoal iron to provide ironing services to locals of the area and has been doing so for the past 70 years.\nTalking to The Express Tribune, Sher Muhammad said \u201cOur forefathers belong to Patiala, and we used to live in Saidpuri Gate before Pakistan was founded.\u201d\nHe says before the creation of Pakistan, Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims were living happily in one neighbourhood. \u201cWhen the movement for Pakistan started, the desire for a separate homeland arose in our hearts. I participated in the movement,\u201d he elaborated while sharing his life story.\nSher Muhammad explained that in the earlier days Kartarpura, Saidpuri Gate, Bhapara Bazaar, Haripur, and Bagh Sardaran were areas within old Rawalpindi that had central status. In these areas, resided the famous traders.\nRead\u00a0PPP rebukes PML-N claiming credit for Thar coal power project\nHindu and Sikh traders mostly wore white clothes and shawls and warm woollen clothes in the winter, while women used to wear silk, banarsi and cotton sarees. He said, \u201cWhen I started my service, I used to iron shalwar kameez for one rupee.\u201d\nMy iron was made of a block of iron worth Rs200, he said adding that irons like these are no longer manufactured and coal has also become expensive. \u201cNow I charge Rs100 to iron a pair of shalwar kameez. I iron the clothes of twenty-five houses in the neighbourhood and I have raised my children with the help of this iron,\u201d he exclaimed.\nSher Muhammad has three children. His eldest son has died, while two of his children work hard to run the household. His children are the ones who pay the ironing store\u2019s rent which costs Rs5,000 per month.\nIn the past, clothes were ironed on special occasions such as Eid or other festivals. However, people are now in the habit of regularly ironing clothes and they prefer to use an ironing machine made of iron. The main reason for this is that the weight of a machine made of iron helps press and smooth out fabric so that it gives the cloth a sheen of its own.\n"

Later, the issue was resolved with the intervention of senior officers and a case was registered. The affected traders demanded the Punjab chief minister take notice of the incident.\nA traders, Daniyal, informed the Jatli police team over the phone that the incident occurred when over 40 traders were on their way to the Lahore cattle market via the Peshawar Motorway in public transport. \nHowever, due to fog near the Balkasar Interchange, the Motorway police diverted the bus from the motorway towards the Sohawa, Chakwal GT Road.\nThe report stated that as soon as the bus covered some distance, seven robbers with pistols and a Kalashnikov in a car signalled to stop the bus. \nAs the robbers got into the vehicle, they asked the bus driver to keep moving, took all the cattle traders hostage at gunpoint, thrashed and beat them up and robbed them of their money.\nRead\u00a0Gang involved in heist busted\nThe affected traders said that they had reported the incident to Rescue 15, on which a preliminary report was lodged at the Jatli police station, Rawalpindi. The police also visited the crime scene, inspected the bus and directed all the affected traders to reach Jatli police station. \nWhen the victims reached the Jatli police station, the police officials said that the incident on GT Road did not take place in the limits of Rawalpindi district but in Chakwal district, therefore, the traders should go to Chakwal and get their report registered there.\nThe affected traders were standing outside the Jatali police station in the bitter cold and were in distress by the indifference of the police. \nThe traders demanded that action should be taken by taking notice of the improper behaviour of the police.\nThe Rawalpindi Police spokesman said that the robbery incident took place in the Dhok Amb area of Chakwal district.\nHowever, the Jatli police had rushed to the spot after receiving the information about the incident but after investigation, they found out that the area falls within the limits of Chakwal. The case of the incident will be registered by District Chakwal police.\n"
