Thousands of casualties have been reported since the fighting erupted a week ago between forces loyal to Sudan\u2019s army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and his deputy, Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, the commander of the powerful paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) who is commonly known as Hemeti.\nWHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris told reporters at a press briefing in Geneva on Friday that 413 people had been killed and 3,551 wounded in the fighting so far across Sudan. The UN migration agency said a staff member had been killed in fighting in southern Sudan when his vehicle was caught in crossfire. \n\nNine children, four humanitarian workers among victims\n\nThe humanitarian worker with the International Organisation for Migration is the fourth UN member of staff killed in less than a week, as earlier three employees of the World Food Programme were killed in the North Darfur region of eastern Sudan.\nThe UN children\u2019s agency Unicef added that at least nine children were among the dead and more than 50 children had been wounded.\nSoldiers and paramilitaries fought fierce street battles in residential areas of central and northern Khartoum, witnesses told AFP, with most of the city\u2019s five million people sheltering at home in the baking heat without electricity, food or water.\nBoth UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called separately for a ceasefire of \u201cat least\u201d three days to mark Eid, as explosions and gunfire resounded in Khartoum.\nThe RSF said they would commit to a 72-hour ceasefire starting at dawn. However, like two previous declared 24-hour ceasefires, it failed to take hold.\nThe crackle of intense gunfire continued Friday morning, with columns of black smoke rising across the capital.\nCiting Sudanese health ministry figures, the WHO spokeswoman said 20 health facilities had stopped functioning and another 12 were at risk of stopping. This would affect \u201cnot only the people who have been injured during this terrible fighting, but the people who were needing treatment before\u201d, she noted.\n\u201cIt\u2019s taking a devastating toll on the country\u2019s children,\u201d Unicef spoke\u00ad\u00adsman James Elder told reporters.\n\u201cAs long as fighting continues, children will continue to pay the price. The fighting means many families are trapped, with little or no access to electricity, terrified of running out of food, water and medicine.\u201d He said Sudan already had one of the world\u2019s highest rates of child malnutrition, with critical life-saving care now disrupted for an estimated 50,000 severely acutely malnourished children.\n\u201cWhen the bombing or shelling begins outside the hospital and where medical staff need to flee, then what?\u201d \n\u201cWe need forces to immediately cease hostilities and for all parties to respect their international obligations to protect children from harm,\u201d he said.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The world\u2019s glaciers melted at dramatic speed last year and saving them is effectively a lost cause, a UN agency said in a report on Friday, noting that record levels of greenhouse gases have caused \u201cplanetary scale changes on land, in the ocean and in the atmosphere\u201d.\nThe last eight years have been the warmest ever recorded, while concentrations of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide hit new peaks, the World Meteorological Organisation said.\n\u201cAntarctic sea ice fell to its lowest extent on record and the melting of some European glaciers was, literally, off the charts,\u201d the WMO spelled out as it launched its annual climate overview.\nThe \u2018State of the Global Climate 2022\u2019 report said that sea levels are also at a record high, having risen by an average of 4.62 millimetres per year between 2013 and 2022 \u2014 double the rate it was between 1993 and 2002.\n\nSea levels at record high, greenhouse gases in atmosphere hit new peaks, World Meteorological Organisation warns\n\nRecord high temperatures were recorded in the oceans \u2014 where around 90 per cent of the heat trapped on Earth by greenhouse gases ends up.\nRising global temperatures and rapidly melting glaciers are also bad news for Pakistan. The country is home to more than 7,000 glaciers, more than anywhere outside the poles.\nRecord monsoon rains and melting glaciers last September displaced millions of people and killed at least 1,700 in a catastrophe blamed on climate change.\n\u201cWhile greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise and the climate continues to change, populations worldwide continue to be gravely impacted by extreme weather and climate events,\u201d WMO chief Petteri Taalas said.\n\u201cFor example, in 2022, continuous drought in East Africa, record-breaking rainfall in Pakistan and record-breaking heatwaves in China and Europe affected tens of millions, drove food insecurity, boosted mass migration, and cost billions of dollars in loss and damage,\u201d he said.\nThe new WMO report is accompanied by a story map, which provides information for policymakers on how the climate change indicators are playing out, and which also shows how improved technology makes the transition to renewable energy cheaper and more accessible than ever.\nThroughout the year, hazardous climate and weather-related events drove new population displacement and worsened conditions for many of the 95 million people already living in displacement at the beginning of the year, according to the report.\nThe report also puts a spotlight on ecosystems and the environment and shows how climate change is affecting recurring events in nature, such as when trees blossom, or birds migrate.\nConcentrations of the three main greenhouse gases \u2014 carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide \u2014 reached record observed highs in 2021, the latest year for which consolidated global values are available (1984-2021).\nThe annual increase in methane concentration from 2020 to 2021 was the highest on record. Real-time data from specific locations show levels of the three greenhouse gases continued to increase in 2022.\nReference glaciers for which we have long-term observations experienced an average thickness change of over -1.3 metres between October 2021 and October 2022. This loss is much larger than the average of the last decade.\nSix of the ten most negative mass balance years on record (1950-2022) occurred since 2015. The cumulative thickness loss since 1970 amounts to almost 30 metres.\nMeasurements on glaciers in High Mountain Asia, western North America, South America and parts of the Arctic also reveal substantial glacier mass losses. There were some mass gains in Iceland and Northern Norway associated with higher-than-average precipitation and a relatively cool summer.\nAccording to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), globally the glaciers lost more than 6,000 gigatonnes of ice over the period 1993-2019. This represents an equivalent water volume of 75 lakes the size of Lac Leman (also known as Lake Geneva), the largest lake in Western Europe. The Greenland Ice Sheet ended with a negative total mass balance for the 26th year in a row.\nAs of 2021, 2.3 billion people faced food insecurity, of which 924m people faced severe food insecurity. Projections estimated 767.9m people facing undernourishment in 2021, 9.8pc of the global population. Half of these are in Asia and one-third are in Africa.\nHeatwaves in the 2022 pre-monsoon season in India and Pakistan caused a decline in crop yields. This, combined with the banning of wheat exports and restrictions on rice exports in India after the start of the conflict in Ukraine, threatened the availability, access, and stability of staple foods within international food markets and posed high risks to countries already affected by shortages of staple foods.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan\u2019s state-owned entities (SOEs) are the worst in South Asia and their combined losses growing faster than assets, resulting in a significant annual drain on scarce public resources and posing a substantial risk to the sovereign.\nOn an annual basis, they together swallow more than Rs458bn in public funds to stay afloat as their combined loans and guarantees surged to almost 10pc of GDP (Rs5.4tr) in FY21 from 3.1pc of GDP or Rs1.05tr in 2016, according to the World Bank that advised a deep-rooted reform programme to reverse the trend.\nThey \u201cimpose a significant fiscal drain and pose a substantial financial risk on the federal government\u201d, said the World Bank, adding that these entities had been incurring losses since FY16, with annual losses averaging at 0.5pc of GDP over FY16\u201320. \u201cPakistan\u2019s federal SOEs have been found to be the least profitable in the South Asia region\u201d, said the Public Expenditure Review 2023, adding that with the persistent losses, the accumulated SOE losses had become substantial, amounting to 3.1pc of GDP in FY20.\nTo cover the losses, the federal government has been providing direct fiscal support to the SOEs, in the form of subsidies, loans and equity injections, which totalled 1.4pc of GDP in FY21. In addition to direct support, the government has been also issuing guarantees for SOEs to secure loans from commercial banks. Federal government exposure to SOEs, defined as the outstanding stock of guarantees and government loans to SOEs, has been rapidly increasing and stood at 9.7pc of GDP in FY21.\nThe report noted that combined fiscal exposure against domestic and foreign loans and guarantees had been increasing rapidly with annual growth averaging 42.9pc over FY2016\u20132021. But this required a detailed risk assessment on account of contingent exposure that may arise from guarantees. In FY 2021, 32pc of the outstanding guarantees, given through the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC), were against project financing of the K-3 and K-4 nuclear power plants. The available data show that guarantees constituted the bulk of fiscal exposure, at 44.4pc of total exposure in FY21, while Cash Development Loans and foreign loans accounted for 36pc and 19.6pc of exposure, respectively.\nThe stock of outstanding government guarantees to SOEs has more than doubled since FY16. Over 75pc of the stock of guarantees is against the power sector for financing the circular debt. The stock of outstanding guarantees from the Federal Government to federal commercial SOEs has increased from 2.2pc of GDP in FY16 to 4.5pc of GDP in FY22.\nThe report said that individual SOE performance was largely dictated by sectoral performance. Although the primary reasons for SOE losses differ, they are typically related to unresolved corporate governance issues, sector regulations, an underestimation of the cost of the provision in complete restructuring and insufficient current subsidies.\nAn SOE portfolio analysis showed that individual SOE performance was influenced by sectoral policies and the level of operational autonomy by the Board of Directors and senior management. SOE losses are concentrated in the power, infrastructure, and transport sectors, and in the aggregate, outweigh profits from profitable SOEs. Although a sizable number of commercial SOEs generated profits in FY20, they were concentrated in the oil and gas sector.\n"

The fall in exports in dollar terms was around 21.3pc.\nTotal rice exports during March stood at 382,618 tonnes valuing $243,632, while Pakistan exported a total 2,907,322 tonnes of rice to earn $1,598,261 during the period July-March 2022-23.\nOf them basmati variety was 428,404 tonnes worth $456,361 and non-basmati 2,478,918 tonnes valuing $1,141,900.\nRice trade expert Ha\u00admid Malik says with the current export trend Pak\u00adistan will be able to cross the $2bn export target. \nAn official of the Rice Exporters Association of Pakistan (Reap) said export figures in terms of quantity may be down but the way the crop has been affected, the foreign sales are comparatively satisfactory as exporters are getting fair prices.\n\u201cEver high export prices and demand are there in the foreign markets. Tho\u00adugh the crop is less in quantity but in terms of the value we are set to cross the $2bn mark.\u201d\nLast year Pakistan exported rice worth $2.5bn, historically the highest figure.\nThere is a very encouraging situation on the export front but local businesses are severely hit as scarcity of foreign exch\u00adange is preventing the import of machinery and material meant for value-addition.\n\u201cMachinery imports are stuck up. Things that are ultimately meant for exports are blocked. Letters of credit for planters, harvesters, and rice processing machines are not being opened. The companies working on sustainable production agriculture are being disallowed to import solar panels,\u201d the official says requesting not to be named.\nHowever, Momin Malik, Director of Seeds at Guard Agricultural Research and Services Ltd, says as basmati rice are getting a good price, particularly in the international markets, there is a growing trend of plating basmati this year instead of non-basmati varieties, which had been claiming the basmati acreage for the last few years.\nAlso due to delays in wheat harvesting because of late sowing as well as low temperatures in March slowing down the crop\u2019s maturing process, the sale of rice seeds of coarse varieties has declined by over 10pc. For, he explains, the window for reaping a third crop of hybrid rice, between wheat and basmati rice, has narrowed down because of delay in wheat harvesting.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The success rate of the Asian  Devel\u00adopment Bank\u2019s (ADB) public sector operations declined during  2016\u20132022, Independent Evaluation Department (IED), ADB\u2019s assessing body  revealed on Wednesday.\nAccording to the \u20182023 Annual Evaluation  Review\u2019 prepared by IED, and released on Wednesday, the success rate of  ADB\u2019s public sector projects shrank primarily among infrastructure  projects in the relatively new areas of the transport and energy  sectors, however, private sector projects remained stable.\nThe  assessment found, while using a combination of quantitative and  qualitative methods, that success relied predominantly on project  factors such as complexity, risk, supervision, delegation, financing  utilization, and procurement and design readiness. It accounted for  nearly three-fourths of the explainable variations in the public sector  performance.\nThe evaluation attributes the remaining variables in  the public sector performance to country-specific factors, including  governance, political stability, fiscal management, economic  performance, and unexpected events.\nThe sovereign success rate in  2020-2022, averaged 68 per cent, continued the steady decline from 77pc  in 2016-2018. Meanwhile, in wake of the annual variation in the number  of completed and validated sovereign projects in 2016-2022, overall  sovereign project performance declined by 3.2pc annually.\nDeteriorating  infrastructure performance drove the decline of overall sovereign  performance, leading to a drop of 3.9pc annually during 2016\u20132022.\nSimilarly, declines in transport and energy projects further abetted slumping infrastructure performance.\nWeak  management and financial capacities of executing and implementing  agencies and broad project scopes were the main constraints to energy  projects, according to the IED validations of project completion  reports. Inadequate due diligence backed the design deficiencies in poor  performance of transport projects.\nADB operations in relatively  new areas of activity in transport and energy \u2014 such as rail, urban  public transport, energy efficiency and conservation, and energy sector  development and institutional reforms \u2014 also contributed to poor  sovereign performance due to inadequate consideration of developing  member countries\u2019 limited experience with new technologies, the report  said.\nAmong non-infrastructure operations, public sector  management (PSM) saw a considerable decline in South Asia and the  Pacific, which were affected by changes in government and development  priorities.\nIn contrast, education and health projects performed  better during the period. It was found that government ownership and  commitment to education and health reforms enhanced performance in these  sectors.\nThe recent uptick in infrastructure performance from  66pc in 2019\u20132021 to 68pc in 2020\u20132022 helped maintain non sovereign  operations\u2019 (NSO) stable performance during 2016-2022.\nThe  technical assistance projects that failed to deliver their planned  outcomes were generally in public expenditure and financial management,  integration of planning and budgeting, and railway development.\nSuccess  rates of financial institution projects and the legacy of private  equity funds designed years ago continued to lag behind infrastructure  projects due to internal challenges and external.\nLikewise,  financial institution project success dipped from 70pc in 2019\u20132021 to  50pc in 2020\u20132022, while no private equity fund was rated successful.\nTechnical  assistance (TA) projects that failed to deliver planned outcomes were  generally in public expenditure and financial management, integration of  planning and budgeting, and railway development.\nThe report revealed that TA projects that performed  poorly had supported reforms or knowledge products that were spread  across too many areas and had vaguely defined performance targets.\n"

Earlier, ECP had set April 20 as the final day for submission of tickets.\nAccording to party sources, over 80 per cent of tickets have been handed over to deserving candidates and there are disputes on around 20pc of seats.\n\u201cThe contentions are among the candidates who had submitted nomination papers for respective constituencies thinking they were better suited to represent their areas,\u201d the source said, adding that in some constituencies, up to 10 candidates had submitted nomination papers in hopes of getting a ticket.\nFor 297 constituencies, the party received some 1,500 applications and tickets have been awarded by the PTI chairman to 285 candidates, the source told Dawn.\nA decision on 12 seats \u2014 PP-57, PP-61, PP-124, PP-162, PP-177, PP-204, PP-221, PP-234, PP-244, PP-251, PP-253 and PP-272 \u2014 is still pending.\nFollowing the award of tickets, the PTI constituted four reconciliation committees to recommend an adjustment in the list of candidates, the source said.\nThe committees have now been converted into \u201creview committees\u201d to hear the candidates\u2019 grievances and forward their recommendations to Mr Khan.\nThe North Punjab review committee is headed by retired Brig Musadiq Abbasi, Central Punjab by Senator Ejaz Chaudhry, West Punjab by Hassan Nawaz and South Punjab by Aon Abbas Bappi.\n\u201cThere would have been no complaints or rifts if the ECP had not extended the date for submission of nomination papers,\u201d the source said. \u201cNow, with the date extended, the review committees will engage the complainants until April 26.\u201d\nThe source added that in case of any change in the earlier awards, the candidates who received the tickets and submitted them before the ECP ahead of the previous date would have to hand them over to the new candidates.\nWhen contacted, Central Punjab review committee head Senator Ejaz Chaudhry said there were individual complaints as those who were denied the tickets agitated, claiming that they were stronger candidates than those who were awarded the tickets.\nHowever, he denied the influence of any pressure groups or lobby vying for tickets.\nExceptions and surprises\nMr Khan has been saying for months that he would personally interview each aspirant and only choose the strongest one to be the PTI\u2019s candidate. However, the final list issued after the extensive interview process had several notable exceptions \u2013 such as Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Fawad Chaudhry and Hammad Azhar \u2013 which didn\u2019t go unnoticed.\nWith these heavyweights out of the race, the chief minister\u2019s seat, at this stage, apparently has only two hopefuls \u2014 newly-inducted PTI president Chaudhry Parvez Elahi and Usman Buzdar.\nMr Khan\u2019s former chief of staff Shahbaz Gill, who was allegedly tortured during custody, was also denied a ticket.\nFawad Chaudhry recently expressed his reservations about not being considered for the provincial assembly, adding that the chief minister\u2019s slot was attractive if one was interested in bringing about a change.\nHe added that he couldn\u2019t do anything, as the decision was taken by Mr Khan himself.\nHammad Azhar said the PTI chairman had informed him that his services will be needed in the federal government and this was the reason he withdrew his nomination papers for the provincial assembly seat.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Punjab minister Murad Raas has also been denied a ticket. Though Mr Raas didn\u2019t say anything publicly, party insiders claim Mr Khan was not happy with his performance as the minister.\nThey also claimed that Mr Raas was not seen in the field when party leaders and workers were facing the wrath of the state authorities.\nFormer Punjab minister for higher education Raja Yasir Humayun had also not been considered for the ticket. Mr Humayun, however, said he has always been vying for the National Assembly ticket.\nAdditionally, as per his commitment to Mr Elahi, who recently merged his faction of the PML-Q with the PTI, Mr Khan has fully facilitated ex-PML-Q leaders who tagged along with Mr Elahi and his son Moonis Elahi.\nAll 10 former MPAs, who were part of the PML-Q, have been awarded tickets and two women MPAs \u2014Baasima Chaudhry and Khadija Umar \u2014 have been placed on the list for reserved seats.\nMr Khan has also awarded the ticket to Moonis Elahi from PP-32 (Gujrat-V).\nThe PTI chief\u2019s decision to award a ticket to Mehr Abdul Sattar from PP-186 (Okara-IV) was widely welcomed. Mr Sattar was a leader of the Anjuman-i-Mizareen and had been fighting for the rights of tenants of Military Farms in Okara.\nFormer Punjab health minister and PTI Central Punjab president Dr Yasmin Rashid has been given a ticket from PP-173, Lahore, where she will face-off against PML-N chief organiser Maryam Nawaz Sharif, who had submitted her nomination papers.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The controversial law seeking to curtail the powers of the chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) to take suo motu action and form benches technically became an act of parliament on Friday.\nAnd despite a Supreme Court order halting the law\u2019s implementation, the National Assembly Secretariat formally asked the Printing Corporation of Pakistan (PCP) to publish it in the official gazette.\nAfter President Arif Alvi for a second time refused to assent to the bill passed by lawmakers in a joint sitting of the parliament on April 10, the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act 2023 has now become an act under Article 75(2) of the Constitution. This was announced officially by the National Assembly Secretariat through its official Twitter handle.\nLater, the NA Secretariat released a handout and a copy of the letter signed by Additional Secretary (Legislation) Muhammad Mushtaq written to the PCP manager, stating that he had been directed to forward a copy of the act for publication in the official gazette.\n\nNA Secretariat asks Printing Corporation of Pakistan to publish new act in official gazette\n\nSuch communication between the NA Secretariat and the PCP after the passage of the laws is a routine matter and the NA Secretariat does not issue any press releases in this regard. This time, however, it has not only issued a press release but also issued a copy of the letter in the wake of the ongoing executive-judiciary tussle over the issue of polls in two provinces.\nArticle 75(2) of the Constitution says that when the president has returned a bill to the parliament, it shall be reconsidered in a joint sitting. If it is again passed, with or without amendment, by the votes of most members of both houses, it is again referred to the president for their assent. If the bill was not signed by the president within 10 days, their assent would have been deemed granted.\nInitially, the bill was approved by the federal cabinet on March 28 and then passed by both houses of parliament \u2014 the National Assembly and Senate. However, President Alvi refused to sign it into law with the observation that it travelled \u201cbeyond the competence of parliament\u201d.\nHowever, a joint session of parliament passed it again on April 10 with certain amendments and it was then again referred to the president for his assent.\nHowever, three days later, the Supreme Court barred the government from enforcing the proposed legislation, saying the move would \u201cprevent the imminent apprehended danger that is irreparable\u201d as soon as the bill becomes an act of parliament.\n\u201cThe moment that the bill receives the assent of the president or it is deemed that such assent has been given, then from that very moment onwards and till further orders, the act that comes into being shall not have, take or be given any effect nor be acted upon in any manner,\u201d said an interim order issued by the eight-member Supreme Court bench headed by CJP Umar Ata Bandial, prompting a strong reaction from the government, which passed damning resolutions against the top court.\nOn April 19, the president, for a second time, refused to give his assent for the bill and sent it back to the parliament, maintaining that the matter was sub judice, or being considered by a judge or court.\nAccording to the legislation, a three-member bench consisting of the chief justice and the two senior-most judges of the apex court will decide whether to take up a matter suo motu. Previously, this was solely the prerogative of the chief justice.\nThe law also states that every cause, matter or appeal before the apex court would be heard and disposed of by a bench, which will be formed by a committee comprising the chief justice and the two senior-most judges.\nThe legislation also includes the right to file an appeal within 30 days of the judgement in a suo motu case and that any case involving constitutional interpretation will not have a bench of fewer than five judges.\nThe bill would allow former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and other parliamentarians disqualified by the Supreme Court under suo motu powers (such as Jahangir Tareen) to appeal their disqualification within 30 days of the law\u2019s enactment.\n"

The bill became an act on Friday.\n\u201cThe PM was told by the government\u2019s legal brains that he is \u201clegally safe\u201d if the SC takes note of the violation of its order, a source told Dawn.\nHe said the legal team had informed the premier about possible action the SC could take against him for defiance by the government of its order to hold elections to the Punjab Assembly on May 14.\nHe said Mr Sharif also discussed with the PML-N\u2019s Sardar Ayaz Sadiq and Khwaja Saad Rafique the apex court\u2019s order to evolve a consensus on the date for holding elections to the National and provincial assemblies on the same day.\nThe SC will resume proceedings on April 27 on petitions for holding elections in Punjab. The SC has made it clear that its order about the May 14 polls in Punjab would remain intact.\nConsensus unlikely\n\u201cThere seems little chance of a consensus between the ruling coalition and the PTI over a date for holding elections for the National and provincial assemblies simultaneously. This fight between parliament and SC will go to the next level, eventually proving disastrous for the democratic set-up\u201d the source feared.\nKhurram Chughtai, a lawyer, told Dawn that so far the prime minister had done nothing in violation of any order or judgement of the Supreme Court.\n\u201cIf there is anything he did which may be considered against any order of the three-member SC bench, we don\u2019t have observations by the judges disapproving of the PM\u2019s actions.\n\u201cBut on the other hand, four judges had written a dissenting note which serves as a valid defence of the prime minister,\u201d he said.\nKhurram Chughtai further said the views expressed during parliament\u2019s proceedings, and votes taken on an issue, enjoy constitutional immunity.\nAccording to the lawyer, Article 69 of the Constitution provides parliamentary privilege to both \u2014 proceedings under Article 84 and the notification on promulgation of any legislation.\n\u201cAny injunction of the Supreme Court regarding operation of any legislation has no effect on any legislation passed by parliament, Mr Chughtai said.\n"

            "Text": "While the ongoing tussle between parliament and the judiciary is likely to drag on beyond Eid, legal and constitutional experts continue to question the Supreme Court\u2019s April 4 ruling for exclusively focusing on elections to the Punjab Assembly and placing the issue of polls in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa \u2018on a back burner\u2019.\nThe two assemblies were dissolved in a similar manner just four days apart \u2014 Punjab on January 14 and KP on January 18 \u2014 but the apex court adopted different approaches in the two seemingly identical cases.\nWhile it apparently made \u2018all-out efforts\u2019 to hold polls in Punjab as early as possible, it allowed parties to take the case for KP elections to the \u201cappropriate\u201d forums, and the matter is currently before the Peshawar High Court.\nThis apparent dichotomy in the court\u2019s conduct doesn\u2019t sit right with many in the legal fraternity.\n\nLegal experts see legitimate concerns behind govt demand for elections in one go, say 90-day deadline \u2018not rigid\u2019\n\nSenior lawyer Akhtar Hussain, who represents the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) on the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP), says the apex court has been criticised for focusing only on elections to the Punjab Assembly and asking petitioners to approach \u201cany forum\u201d on the identical issue in KP.\nThere should have been a single order for both provinces, but the apex court bifurcated the matter of KP polls, strengthening the impression it was only interested in holding elections in Punjab, said Mr Hussain.\nFormer Supreme Court Bar Association president Yasin Azad termed it constitutionally incorrect to adjudicate on elections to the Punjab Assembly and ignore KP.\nMr Azad questioned whether Article 224 of the Constitution \u2014 which stipulated the 90-day deadline \u2014 did not apply to KP and asked whether the apex court had no objection to October 8 as the date for polls in that province.\n\u201cThe Supreme Court is also questioning the tenure of caretaker government in Punjab alone and its entire focus is to hold early elections in the largest province of the country,\u201d he observed.\nFormer Sindh Bar Council vice-chairman Haider Imam Rizvi assailed the apex court\u2019s decision to make no observations regarding elections in KP, terming it \u201ccontrary to the provisions of law\u201d.\n90-day deadline \u2018not rigid\u2019\nThe 90-day deadline for polls to the Punjab and KP assemblies expired on April 14 and April 18, respectively.\nOn this, Mr Hussain was of the view that the deadline could be extended under special and unavoidable circumstances.\nMr Azad also concurred, stating that the deadline can be extended under unavoidable circumstances. as provided in Article 254, and a precedent in this regard was set when the 1988 general elections were delayed.\nArticle 254 states that if any action required by the Constitution to be done within a particular period was not done in that time, it won\u2019t render the action illegal or invalid for the sole reason of tardiness.\nBut while the constitutional deadline for polls may have lapsed, Mr Rizvi said that according to articles 232 and 234 \u2014 which deal with proclamation of emergency and governor\u2019s rule \u2014 elections can also be delayed under an emergency or unavoidable circumstances.\nBefore discussing the rigidity of the 90-day deadline, the question of dissolution needs to be addressed first, he said.\n \n \n\n\u201cUnder Article 107 of the Constitution, the duration of an assembly is five years and its premature dissolution has to be fully justified through definite reasons as provided in the Constitution,\u201d Mr Rizvi said.\nCommenting on the push to remove caretaker governments following the expiry of their stipulated tenure, Mr Azad noted that the Constitution was silent on the issue.\nHe attributed the ongoing crisis to the apex court\u2019s interpretation of Article 63-A.\nAfter the 18th Amendment, Mr Azad said, issues related to the provinces must be decided by the respective high courts and the apex court may not use its extraordinary powers under Article 284(3) to intervene in provincial issues.\nHe said a case for elections to Punjab Assembly was already pending before the Lahore High Court when the chief justice took the suo-motu notice.\n\u2018Legitimate concerns\u2019 on scattered polls\nLegal experts Dawn spoke to also lent some consideration to the ruling coalition\u2019s firm stance of holding polls across the country on a single day.\nMr Hussain said that there was \u201csome substance in the government\u2019s arguments\u201d, noting that the concept of caretaker governments was introduced in view of Pakistan\u2019s history of unconstitutional rule.\nHe said it was aimed at providing a level playing field to all political parties and ensuring free and fair elections.\u201c\nIf elections in Punjab were held before general elections, there would be an elected government in the province during the elections for the National Assembly which would \u201cviolate the constitutional concept\u201d of a level-playing field, Mr Hussain added.\nAn apex court judge had also questioned how both assemblies were dissolved and whether the actions were constitutional or otherwise, he added.\nFor Mr Rizvi, not holding country-wide elections on a single day would \u201clead to another constitutional crisis\u201d as the Constitution was clear the elections must be held under interim setups to ensure transparency.\n"

            "Text": "New Delhi: Former governor of India-held Kashmir Satya Pal Malik, who made many revelations about national security and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s approach to corruption in an explosive interview to The Wire last week, has been called in by the country\u2019s apex investigating agency, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), \u201cfor questioning\u201d on April 28.\nThe Wire said the BJP-appointed governor for four other states  will be going to the CBI\u2019s guest house on Akbar Road in New Delhi to answer questions.\nMr Malik had blamed the government for the Pulwama massacre, saying had the government acceded to the request to fly the troopers instead of making them sitting ducks on the road, there would have been no tragedy. The claim has sparked protests from opposition parties, with Nationalist Congress Party chief asking the government to resign. But The Wire said the questioning could be about the corruption issues Mr Malik had raised.\n\u201cIt is reliably learnt that the \u2018questioning\u2019 will be on the Reliance Insurance issue \u2014 the scheme that RSS and BJP leader Ram Madhav was allegedly pushing Malik to pass while he was the governor of held Kashmir, and which Malik cancelled,\u201d The Wire said. On April 14, Malik had given an explosive interview to Karan Thapar for The Wire, in which he had specifically spoken of this deal.\nBharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) leader Ram Madhav, Mr Malik said, paid the then Indian held Jammu and Kashmir governor a special visit to try and get him to pass a scheme proposed by Reliance Insurance. When Mr Malik made it clear that the scheme had been cancelled and the paperwork was done, Mr Madhav left disappointed.\nMr Malik had also mentioned this incident in an interview to Prashant Tandon for DB Live, conducted before Thapar\u2019s interview. After that aired, Mr Madhav sent Mr Malik a defamation notice.\nThe multi-party petition in the Supreme Court against the role played by central agencies (including the CBI) to play to a political tune was not heard by the apex court as they claimed they could not look at issuing broad blanket rulings, but needed to look at matters case by case.\nIn the interview, Mr Malik said he didn\u2019t like to meet people before showering but he met Mr Ram Madhav who came early in the morning to see him.\n\u201cAsk him to tell me why he had shown up at the residence, what did he want to talk about? Did he want to talk about murder? One day earlier we had closed the matter and he came back again very early in the morning. He asked me if I had closed the matter on insurance and I said that I had. He asked me if the letter had gone and I said that it had. Then Ram Madhav got upset.\u201d\nMr Malik said he had initially passed this scheme but a lot of people asked him to take it back. \u201cThe first thing that happened was that government employees were really unhappy with the coming of the scheme. That is because all government employees had to pay Indian Rs8,500 a year for the scheme. Retired officers had to give more than Indian Rs20,000. So I said in Delhi, under Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS), we don\u2019t have to pay anything, so why would they pay here? And on top of that, the hospitals that had been listed in the scheme were bad hospitals. None of the hospitals were of national repute. I realised that the hospitals were bad and then good treatment would not be meted out even after taking large amounts.\u201d\n"

They say that it is not a halal animal, which is utter rubbish, although it may be endangered. It is also the Inter-Services Intelligence logo. Oh please, it is just a goat,\u201d he laughed.\nAt a stationary and gift items shop just next door, young shopkeeper Asim Minhas said that since the coins and notes were in circulation therefore he accepted them all. \u201cWhy should I refuse anything that is perfectly okay? The currency is not the problem here, it\u2019s the people\u2019s ignorance that is the problem here. I take both the coins and notes from them and if I cannot use them in the market, I just go and exchange them from SBP,\u201d he said.\nVisiting to a huge departmental store in a Clifton mall, one of the staff there, upon seeing the coin, said that it was discontinued \u2018long long ago\u2019.\nA petrol pump in Saddar also turned down the coin and the Rs75 note. \u201cMonopoly Monopoly khel raheen hain kya? [Is this play money from the board game Monopoly?]\u201d Asked the attendant there.\nWhile speaking to Dawn on the issue, a spokesperson for the State Bank of Pakistan said that both the Rs10 coin and the commemorative Rs75 note, in fact all commemorative notes or coins, introduced by the SBP, are perfectly fine and acceptable for market transactions.\n"

            "Text": "LARKANA: Several preventable diseases like measles, pertussis, resistant malaria, gastroenteritis, emphysema and malnutrition have registered an unusual rise among children who reported at the Chandka Medical College children hospital from flood-hit areas in the wake of last year\u2019s devastating deluge, according to doctors.\nProf Dr Shanti Lal, chairman of the department of pediatrics at the hospital, confirmed that majority of the cases were pouring in from flood-hit areas of Qambar-Shahdadkot, Larkana and other districts including Jhal Magsi, Gaibidero, Ratoderro, Naudero, Warah and remote areas.\nThe hospital had three units and roughly over 130 cases of the above mentioned diseases were being admitted every month from among 650 to 750 patients reporting daily at the OPD, he said.\nA number of mothers who accompanied their ailing children complained that their children had contracted the diseases specially measles despite being vaccinated.\nDr Lal said that many women were not even unaware about the vaccination or they did not have the vaccination cards with them to confirm if their children had been inoculated or not. He pointed to a five-year-old boy lying on a bed nearby who could barely open his sour eyes and said it was the outcome of measles complication.\nHe said that perhaps a big portion of population was still unaware about the vaccination and its importance, and stressed the need for giving vitamin-A to children regularly to ward off eyes diseases. The vitamin-A was only available with government hospitals, he said.\nAssociate Prof Dr Shankar Lal, in-charge of unit-II, said the cases of measles, emphysema and resistant malaria were most common among children. \u201cWe are getting complicated cases of the diseases,\u201d he said.\nHe said that possible reasons behind the outbreak of measles was the vaccine, which might have lost efficacy due to poor electricity supply. The drug\u2019s efficacy might have been compromised in the absence of or interrupted power supply to cold storage for the vaccines stocks, he said.\nPoor economic conditions, food insecurity, battered communication, high cost of transport were also among the reasons behind multiplication of diseases, he said.\nHe said that unprecedented floods had not only devastated the infrastructure but also drastically damaged primary healthcare system, which had also tremendously contributed to unusual rise in diseases, he said.\nAssistant Prof Dr Dili Jan Magsi said that cases of measles were frequently reported both in acute phase and long term complications. The cases of malnutrition among children were also on the rise, he said.\nDr Lal mentioned another serious disease, sub-acute sclerosis pan encephalitis, which was connected with malnutrition and was to develop in 10-year-old children according to books but the children younger than that age were reporting at the hospital with the complaint.\nDr Magsi stressed the need for posting exclusive pediatricians in every hospital connected with teaching hospital so as to minimize burden of consultants.\nDoctors practicing at private set-up were also frequently receiving enhanced number of the cases of measles, resistant malaria, pertussis, malnutrition and other cases in post-flood period.\n\u201cMost of the cases we treat are resistant malaria and plasmodium vivax is the most common among them,\u201d said Dr Lal.\nThe professors were of the opinion that surveillances should be enhanced, ensuring availability of standard vaccine and the issues of food security must be prioritized coupled with focusing on creating awareness among masses regarding the immunization. Also damaged infrastructure should be restored and special campaigns should be launched against measles, they said.\nAsked about the medicines, they said that there was no dearth of drugs. The CMCH was regularly supplying the medicines to the children\u2019s hospital, they added.\n"

The owner, Qurban Ali, was booked for installing the connection for his hotel by cutting the waterline of Tilak Incline.\nWasa staff disconnected the connection in the presence of the engineer and reported the matter to the Hyderabad Development Authority (HDA) director general.\nThe hotel\u2019s opening had already become a matter of litigation which was allowed in a space that was meant for school-related businesses like books, stationary etc.\nThe hotel was sealed under directives of the Hyderabad deputy commissioner by the city assistant commissioner. Later, the hotel owner filed a case in a civil court where it is being adjudicated upon. The case has been fixed for May 11. \nThe owner has claimed that he had got the premises registered in his name.\nThe Jamia Arabia School is located in the heritage property and its one room, meant for some school-related businesses, was rented out to Qurban Ali, who was found using it for his hotel with different names and had also encroached upon public space as well, it was alleged. Some traders and area activists had raised the issue on the grounds that the hotel could not be operated on the premises meant for school purposes. \n"

Hence, the function of election commissioner was to hold elections and the situation would normalise if the Election Commission of Pakistan was allowed to function accordingly, he said.\n\u201cOur jawans have been martyred during police operation against dacoits in riverine areas of upper Sindh,\u201d he said, adding that they had planned to take effective steps to minimize such incidents.\nHe said that more check-posts would be constructed on embankments in upper Sindh in a bid to stop movement of dacoits and supply of weapons to them. The government would restore peace in the riverine areas by eliminating all dacoits, he said.\nProvincial ministers Syed Nasir Hussain Shah, Mukesh Kumar Chawla, notables and PPP leaders also accompanied the chief minister.\nEarlier, Federal Minister Syed Khurshid Shah, provincial ministers Syed Sardar Ali Shah, Imtiaz Ahmed Sheikh, MNA Nawab Wasan, PPP Sindh president Nisar Ahmad Khuhro, PPP Balochistan president Mir Changez Khan Jamali and leaders of various political, social and religious organisations arrived at Jakhrani House to condole with PPP MPA Mir Mumtaz Hussain Jakhrani and Mir Aijaz Jakhrani.\n"

After the interviews aired, Baloch activists took to social media, terming it a \u201cmedia trial\u201d.\nIn conversations with Dawn, Baloch activists, parliamentarians and rights workers assert that Mahil is being paraded on TV and derided in a bid to rebuke her community, especially women activists, who have been quite vocal about the human rights situation prevailing in Balochistan.\n\nBaloch activists decry televised interviews of arrested woman; CM\u2019s spox claims media appearances meant to placate concerns about her well-being\n\nIn a report recently released by its fact-finding mission, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan observed \u201ca palpable sense of anger among ordinary citizens, many of whom went so far as to refer to Balochistan as a \u2018colony\u2019 of the state during meetings with the organisation\u201d.\nThis situation, the HRCP cautioned, should serve as a wake-up call for the state authorities.\nShakeela Naveed Dehwar, an MPA from BNP-M, has been outspoken inside and outside the Balochistan Assembly on issues confronting women in her province. There is a trace of indignation in her voice while discussing Mahil\u2019s case with Dawn.\n\u201cShe is a poor lady, who has been deliberately brought on media to give a bad name to women activism in the province because women are at the forefront in Balochistan in the protests to recover the missing persons,\u201d she said.\nHowever, Babar Yousafzai, spokesperson for the Balochistan chief minister, told Dawn: \u201cAfter gathering intelligence, our law enforcers arrested Mahil Baloch because she was a potential suicide bomber, who wanted to carry out a suicide attack in Quetta. She has confessed to be so not only in the video but also before a court of law.\u201d\n\u201cAfter being interrogated, she also confessed that her husband was associated with the BLF, which is why she was hired too after being brainwashed,\u201d Mr Yousafzai claimed.\nIn reply to a question as to why the media was allowed to interview Ms Mahil, he said: \u201cAs you know, Balochistan is a tribal society; she was [brought in front of] the media to show that she is fine, and there is no injustice being done to her.\u201d\nNasrullah Baloch, chairman of the Voice for Baloch Missing Persons, told Dawn: \u201cWe have always demanded that Baloch people should not be implicated in bogus cases. They must not be subjected to any illegality until or unless they are found guilty in a court of law.\u201d\nHe suggested that there should be a parliamentary committee, comprising all political parties, to go to Mahil Baloch to hear her out and ascertain whether her statements are being taken under duress or not.\n\u201cBecause what she is facing is against the constitution and against human rights.\u201d\nLike other female activists, Sammi Deen Baloch, the daughter of Dr Deen Mohammad Baloch, has been campaigning for the release of her father and other missing persons since the former went missing from Khuzdar while he was on a night duty at a hospital in the year 2009.\n\u201cMahil was picked up by the CTD from her place, in front of family, while her children were released next day,\u201d Ms Sammi tells Dawn.\nShe claimed that Ms Mahil\u2019s family has not been allowed to meet her.\n\u201cThis is all being done to counter the Baloch female\u2019s activism,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I am pretty sure about is that Mahil\u2019s case is not being looked into as per law, as the law itself says a confessional video recorded in detention is not acceptable,\u201d she pointed out.\nEven MPA Dehwar said that despite being a minister, her attempt to meet Ms Mahil remained fruitless. Habib Tahir, vice chair of HRCP\u2019s Balochistan chapter, while commenting on these claims and counter-claims, said: \u201cUnder these circumstances, there should be an independent commission in the Mahil case as it has become a high-profile matter. Besides, the court should order a neutral, joint investigation into the matter to determine whether she is involved or not.\u201d\nThe recent wave of Baloch women being detained has been going on since Karachi University bombing when Shari Baloch, a 31-year-old mother of two, blew herself up, killing four people, including three Chinese citizens.\n\u201cSince then, Baloch women are being detained, and the case of Mahil Baloch is not a new phenomenon. Being an MPA myself, I am watched with suspicion in Islamabad or elsewhere in the country due to my traditional Balochi clothes,\u201d Ms Dehwar says.\n"

            "Text": " \n\nEnver Baig\n\nISLAMABAD: Enver Baig, an outspoken politician and a former senator, passed away at a hospital here on Friday after a protracted illness.\nHe was 77.\n\u201cMy father is lucky as Allah has called him in the holy month of Ram\u00adazan, on Jumatul Wida, and at the time of Juma pra\u00adyers. I pray for him to be granted the highest ranks in Jannah just like he got the most auspicious day to leave this world,\u201d his eldest son Najeeb Baig told Dawn in a sombre voice.\nAfter spending more than a decade in the PPP, he parted ways with the party in August 2011. Mr Baig, who was once very close to Benazir Bhutto, used to tell his friends that after Ms Bhutto\u2019s tragic death, he was finding it difficult to stay in the party as he was not in the good books of the new leadership, mainly because of his straightforward attitude and bold stance on national issues.\nIn 2012, he joined PML-N, but did not apply for a Senate ticket, fearing there could be resistance within the party as he was a newcomer. However, when PML-N came to power after the 2013 polls, he was appointed chairman of the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP).\nAlthough Mr Baig had developed a good rapport with Nawaz Sharif, other senior leaders never really accepted him in the party.\nAfter serving the BISP for almost a year, Mr Baig resigned, reportedly after developing some differences with a key minister.\nLater, he was appointed chairman of the Pakistan Industrial Development Corpor\u00adation, but according to one of his friends, journalist Rauf Klasra, he did not attend the office for a single day.\nAnother close friend of Mr Baig\u2019s, Wasim Haqqi, told Dawn he was born in Karachi in 1945, and that his father passed away while he was still a young man.\n\u201cEnver joined his grandfather\u2019s business of manpower export \u2014 M/s Jan Muhammad and Brothers \u2014 and remained associated with it till he breathed his last. He was very close friend of veteran PPP leader Makhdoom Amin Faheem, who had introduced him to Ms Bhutto.\u201d\nOn the day Ms Bhutto was assassinated, Enver Baig was in Lahore owing to his son\u2019s wedding. Although, he was not ready to leave Rawalpindi as there was a public meeting on that day, Benazir Bhutto herself suggested he should go to Lahore and attend his son\u2019s wedding, Mr Haqqi recalled.\nFormer Senator Farhatullah Babar termed Mr Baig \u201can outspoken senator, a highly successful businessman, a sports lover and above all a very fine human being\u201d.\n\u201cIn the Senate, he spoke on issues with great clarity and conviction and always seemed well-prepared,\u201d said Mr Babar.\nMr Baig was fond of throwing parties, which made his home a hub of social and political gatherings. As a sport lover, he was keen that sports bodies were governed only by their constitutions and not on personal whims.\nIn 2007, Mr Baig asked the Public Accounts Committee to audit the PCB  and in 2009, he accused the Pakistan cricket players of being involved  in match fixing.\nMr Babar recalled that once Mr Baig moved a privilege motion against the then-chairman of Pakistan Cricket Board when the latter made some remarks in response to criticism of the PCB\u2019s failure in finalising its constitution.\nMr Babar stated that even after leaving the PPP and joining a rival political party, Mr Baig never spoke ill about his old party\u2019s leadership and always wore a smile.\nMr Baig also served as the honorary consul general of Republic of Uruguay as well as president of the Pakistan Overseas Employment Promoters Association. He headed the Senate Standing Committee on Manpower and Overseas Pakistanis and the FPCCI\u2019s Standing Committee on Diplomatic Affairs.\nMr Baig is survived by his widow, Ayesha Enver Baig and seven children \u2014 Najeeb, Ambreen, Nosheen, Naveen, Sameer, Issam and Adnan.\nHe will be laid to rest at the H-11 Graveyard on Saturday (today) at 2pm.\n"

They also deliberated on the solutions to the problems being faced by Pakistan. She said that Mr Sharif expressed good wishes for the Saudi leadership, according to dawn.com.\nWhile there was no official mention from the Saudi side about the meeting  and the PML-N did not share any photographs of it, the party\u2019s  official Twitter account shared the same statement as posted by Ms  Aurangzeb.\nThe Sharifs had reached Saudi Arabia on  April 11 to perform Umrah along with other family members. The former  prime minister had departed from London while the PML-N chief organiser  had departed from Pakistan.

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: Findings of a study on women\u2019s work burden and their effects on child labour says the Punjab government has not yet formally recognised the role of women agriculture workers who still do not benefit from legal protection regardless of their contribution to the agricultural labour force.\nThe study, \u2018Gender roles related to work burden and child labour in agriculture in Punjab\u2019, carried out by the Punjab Economic Research Institute with the support of United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), suggested that agricultural policy, extension advisory services, training activities and education strategies should recognise the central role of women in small-scale agriculture and it should be more inclusive. Citing example, it says extension advisory services and training activities should be offered to the entire households rather than only to the males.\nIn the surveyed communities, 69.1 per cent of women reported their primary occupation to be household work (which also includes agricultural work for home consumption such as tending for small ruminants) and 24.3pc reported agricultural labour as their second occupation. On the other hand, 28.7pc of surveyed men indicated they were farmers while 36pc mentioned agricultural labour as their main occupation.\nDuring planting and harvesting seasons, the demand for labour increases and women commonly work from 8 to 10 hours per day in the field on top of the 4 to 5 hours per day they need to perform their households related tasks, the study found.\n\nWomen workers do not benefit from legal protection, says study\n\nGaps in women\u2019s skills are recognised as a major barrier to diversify their roles and undertaking income-generating activities. Focusing in Multan, Bahawalpur and Multan districts, the study found that the provincial government does not offer training opportunities to women on any of the tasks that women are commonly engaged in. \n\u201cThere are no government initiatives to enhance income-generating skills for women working on these small-scale farms.\u201d Resultantly, when demands for paid skilled agriculture labour are high, men are preferred over the women, due to their skills and knowledge, the study points out.\nIt recommended that agriculture policies should be reviewed with a gender lens to engage more women in agriculture extension services, input supply, and access to finance, among others. There is a need to build rural women\u2019s capacities for increased participation across the crop value chain. The public and private sectors should offer tailor-made financial products for rural women.\nSchool curricula should include more content on good agricultural practices for small-scale farming. More women should be employed by agro dealer shops to encourage women farmers to visit the shop for crop related transactions.\nThe study suggested that enabling women to organise themselves will help in building social cohesion in rural communities and empowering women to invest in small businesses. The public and private sectors should support the establishment and strengthening of organised farmer groups, such as cooperatives and associations to streamline the women\u2019s participation.\nThere is need to address some of the key gender based constraints and their impact on child labour in these rural communities, policies and strategies. This would require strengthening parenting and community education initiatives to address harmful practices and social norms that perpetuate child labour, while collaborating with national and local governments to prevent exploitation and abuse.\nNational and provincial policies and strategies need to support increased access to quality education and provide comprehensive services to keep children educated, informed and protected. Smallholders, including tenant farmers and sharecroppers, require special attention from policymakers for improved rural extension and advisory services, farmer training, resources, information, and organised platforms for voicing their needs.\n"

            "Text": "KARACHI: When Sarfraz Ahmed, Pakistan\u2019s former captain, took to the pitch of the Jinnah Government College cricket ground years ago during his student life, the outfield was dusty and uneven. He batted on a cemented wicket, conditions so poor that spectators would park their motorcycles beyond the boundary ropes and sit on them to watch the action.\nSarfraz remains the most high profile cricketer the college has produced. The man who led Pakistan to the Champions Trophy in 2017, and staged a Test comeback earlier this year, forged a career playing on an inadequate college ground. As did his college and eventual Pakistan team-mate Anwar Ali. In 2006, the duo were part of the Pakistan side that won the U-19 World Cup; Sarfraz the skipper and fast bowler Anwar the player-of-the-final.\n\u201cI played club level as well as college-level matches from 2003-2004 in the college ground,\u201d Sarfraz told Dawn. \u201cAnd I will always remember the role this ground played in my career even through its condition was deplorable.\u201d Not anymore though.\nThe ground has been transformed, now sporting a lush green outfield and a turf pitch. A boundary wall has been erected with proper sitting arrangements now in place for those who want to witness the action.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a very different feel now,\u201d reflected Anwar, while talking to Dawn. \u201cWe played for our college whenever we got the opportunity but during our time here, there wasn\u2019t even a dugout for the players, let alone a dressing room.\u201d\nIt was due to the efforts of the college\u2019s Director Physical Education, Professor Wasim Majid Rizvi, that the ground has been revived. Prof Rizvi told Dawn that he\u2019d been trying to get the ground restoration approved by the government for the best part of a decade.\n\u201cI joined the college in 1992 and noticed that the cricket ground was the largest in any of the educational institutions in Karachi,\u201d said Prof Rizvi. \u201cThat was my motivation to develop it as there were better grounds in other institutions.\n\u201cThen, our cricket team had been dominating the Inter-College tournaments so why not give them facilities to do even better,\u201d he added, noting that apart from Sarfraz and Anwar, other former Pakistan Test cricketers namely Saleem Yousuf, Hasan Raza and Mohsin Hamid had also featured for the college\u2019s cricket team.\n\u201cThe college has a legacy of producing good cricketer,\u201d notes Professor Tariq Salahuddin, who heads the sports committee at Jinnah College and had been actively involved in the construction work at the cricket ground. The restoration work has cost Rs40million but Prof Tariq believes that it will pay off with the emergence of cricket talent.\nEarlier this year, Jinnah College won the Pakistan event of Red Bull Campus Cricket and are now set to represent the country at the world finals for a third time, having also triumphed in the nationals in 2015 and 2017. On both occasions, the team couldn\u2019t go far, their only win at the world finals coming in 2017.\nBut the difference this time around is the fact that the team has a proper ground to prepare for the world finals.\n\u201cThe college\u2019s ground is helping us a lot now during our training and practice sessions,\u201d Fahdis Bukhari, the captain of Jinnah College\u2019s present side, told Dawn. \u201cNow we can practice regularly and through proper training we would increase our strength and hopefully put up a winning show at the world finals.\u201d\nFor the college\u2019s illustrious alumnus like Sarfraz, the new facility should be a springboard for greater success.\n\u201cI hope that the ground is maintained in the future so that new players from college teams can play here and benefit from it,\u201d said Sarfraz.\n"

            "Text": "TOKYO: The former chairman of a Tokyo 2020 Olympics sponsor was handed a suspended prison sentence on Friday along with two others, in the first convictions in a spiralling bribery scandal surrounding the event.\nCorruption allegations have mushroomed in the aftermath of the pandemic-delayed Games, implicating major companies and damaging Japan\u2019s bid to host the 2030 Winter Olympics in Sapporo.\nHironori Aoki, the 84-year-old ex-head of high-street business suit retailer Aoki Holdings, received a suspended prison term of two and a half years, a Tokyo District Court spokesman told AFP.\nAoki pleaded guilty in December to accusations that he and two colleagues bribed a Tokyo 2020 board member to secure sponsorship rights, according to Japanese media.\n\u201cThese criminal acts damaged social trust in the fair operation of the Games, which attracted world attention and were important for the country,\u201d judge Kenji Yasunaga said Friday in comments reported by Jiji Press.\nAoki, who had instructed a colleague at the time to destroy evidence,  \u201cwanted to pursue the interests of his company\u201d, the judge said.\nProsecutors had sought immediate jail for the businessman, but instead the court handed down Friday\u2019s sentence, suspended for four years.\nAoki Holdings was an official partner of the 2020 Olympics \u2014 which were held largely without spectators in 2021 because of Covid \u2014 allowing the firm to use the event\u2019s logo and sell officially licensed products.\nAoki was arrested in August along with two ex-colleagues and former Tokyo 2020 board member Haruyuki Takahashi.\nThe two ex-colleagues also received suspended jail sentences on Friday, one for a year and the other for 18 months. Takahashi, who is facing several separate bribery charges, has reportedly pleaded not guilty.\nTakahashi allegedly recei\u00adved $380,000 which he understood to be  \u201cthank-you money for the beneficial and preferential treatment\u201d of Aoki Holdings, according to prosecution documents.\nAn Aoki Holdings spokeswoman told AFP:  \u201cWe take the ruling seriously and will do our utmost to prevent a recurrence and regain trust from our customers.\u201d\nOther parties involved in bribery allegations include a major publishing firm and a merchandise company licensed to sell soft toys of the Games\u2019 mascots.\nThe former president of ADK Holdings, Japan\u2019s third-largest advertising agency, has pleaded guilty to offering Takahashi over $100,000.\nMeanwhile, in a separate strand of allegations, senior Tokyo 2020 organising committee official Yasuo Mori and three others have been arrested on suspicion of rigging a string of Games-related tenders.\nAnd in February, Japan\u2019s biggest adv\u00adertising agency, Dentsu Group, was indi\u00adcted along with five other companies for allegedly violating an anti-monopoly law.\nAs investigations continue, the country\u2019s Olympic chief warned this month that Japan could push its Winter Olympics bid back four years to 2034.\nJapanese Olympic Commi\u00adttee president Yasuhiro Yam\u00ada\u00ad\u00adshita said it would be  \u201cdifficult to move ahead without gaining people\u2019s understanding\u201d following the scandals.\nThe allegations are not the first time questions have been raised about alleged impropriety around Tokyo 2020, which took place during a Covid state of emergency and against the backdrop of public anger. The then-head of Japan\u2019s Olympic Committee, Tsune\u00adkazu Takeda, stepped down in 2019 as French authorities probed his alleged involvement in payments.\n"

Imran had also instructed departments to close down their sport wings, which led to many athletes lose their jobs.\nSince Shehbaz took office after Imran\u2019s ouster through a no-confidence vote in April last year, the incumbent PM revoked his predecessor\u2019s move to restore departments in sports and eventually instructed the restoration of PCB\u2019s 2014 constitution.\n"

Thousands of casualties have been reported since the fighting erupted a week ago between forces loyal to Sudan\u2019s army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and his deputy, Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, the commander of the powerful paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) who is commonly known as Hemeti.\nWHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris told reporters at a press briefing in Geneva on Friday that 413 people had been killed and 3,551 wounded in the fighting so far across Sudan. The UN migration agency said a staff member had been killed in fighting in southern Sudan when his vehicle was caught in crossfire. \n\nNine children, four humanitarian workers among victims\n\nThe humanitarian worker with the International Organisation for Migration is the fourth UN member of staff killed in less than a week, as earlier three employees of the World Food Programme were killed in the North Darfur region of eastern Sudan.\nThe UN children\u2019s agency Unicef added that at least nine children were among the dead and more than 50 children had been wounded.\nSoldiers and paramilitaries fought fierce street battles in residential areas of central and northern Khartoum, witnesses told AFP, with most of the city\u2019s five million people sheltering at home in the baking heat without electricity, food or water.\nBoth UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called separately for a ceasefire of \u201cat least\u201d three days to mark Eid, as explosions and gunfire resounded in Khartoum.\nThe RSF said they would commit to a 72-hour ceasefire starting at dawn. However, like two previous declared 24-hour ceasefires, it failed to take hold.\nThe crackle of intense gunfire continued Friday morning, with columns of black smoke rising across the capital.\nCiting Sudanese health ministry figures, the WHO spokeswoman said 20 health facilities had stopped functioning and another 12 were at risk of stopping. This would affect \u201cnot only the people who have been injured during this terrible fighting, but the people who were needing treatment before\u201d, she noted.\n\u201cIt\u2019s taking a devastating toll on the country\u2019s children,\u201d Unicef spoke\u00ad\u00adsman James Elder told reporters.\n\u201cAs long as fighting continues, children will continue to pay the price. The fighting means many families are trapped, with little or no access to electricity, terrified of running out of food, water and medicine.\u201d He said Sudan already had one of the world\u2019s highest rates of child malnutrition, with critical life-saving care now disrupted for an estimated 50,000 severely acutely malnourished children.\n\u201cWhen the bombing or shelling begins outside the hospital and where medical staff need to flee, then what?\u201d \n\u201cWe need forces to immediately cease hostilities and for all parties to respect their international obligations to protect children from harm,\u201d he said.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The world\u2019s glaciers melted at dramatic speed last year and saving them is effectively a lost cause, a UN agency said in a report on Friday, noting that record levels of greenhouse gases have caused \u201cplanetary scale changes on land, in the ocean and in the atmosphere\u201d.\nThe last eight years have been the warmest ever recorded, while concentrations of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide hit new peaks, the World Meteorological Organisation said.\n\u201cAntarctic sea ice fell to its lowest extent on record and the melting of some European glaciers was, literally, off the charts,\u201d the WMO spelled out as it launched its annual climate overview.\nThe \u2018State of the Global Climate 2022\u2019 report said that sea levels are also at a record high, having risen by an average of 4.62 millimetres per year between 2013 and 2022 \u2014 double the rate it was between 1993 and 2002.\n\nSea levels at record high, greenhouse gases in atmosphere hit new peaks, World Meteorological Organisation warns\n\nRecord high temperatures were recorded in the oceans \u2014 where around 90 per cent of the heat trapped on Earth by greenhouse gases ends up.\nRising global temperatures and rapidly melting glaciers are also bad news for Pakistan. The country is home to more than 7,000 glaciers, more than anywhere outside the poles.\nRecord monsoon rains and melting glaciers last September displaced millions of people and killed at least 1,700 in a catastrophe blamed on climate change.\n\u201cWhile greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise and the climate continues to change, populations worldwide continue to be gravely impacted by extreme weather and climate events,\u201d WMO chief Petteri Taalas said.\n\u201cFor example, in 2022, continuous drought in East Africa, record-breaking rainfall in Pakistan and record-breaking heatwaves in China and Europe affected tens of millions, drove food insecurity, boosted mass migration, and cost billions of dollars in loss and damage,\u201d he said.\nThe new WMO report is accompanied by a story map, which provides information for policymakers on how the climate change indicators are playing out, and which also shows how improved technology makes the transition to renewable energy cheaper and more accessible than ever.\nThroughout the year, hazardous climate and weather-related events drove new population displacement and worsened conditions for many of the 95 million people already living in displacement at the beginning of the year, according to the report.\nThe report also puts a spotlight on ecosystems and the environment and shows how climate change is affecting recurring events in nature, such as when trees blossom, or birds migrate.\nConcentrations of the three main greenhouse gases \u2014 carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide \u2014 reached record observed highs in 2021, the latest year for which consolidated global values are available (1984-2021).\nThe annual increase in methane concentration from 2020 to 2021 was the highest on record. Real-time data from specific locations show levels of the three greenhouse gases continued to increase in 2022.\nReference glaciers for which we have long-term observations experienced an average thickness change of over -1.3 metres between October 2021 and October 2022. This loss is much larger than the average of the last decade.\nSix of the ten most negative mass balance years on record (1950-2022) occurred since 2015. The cumulative thickness loss since 1970 amounts to almost 30 metres.\nMeasurements on glaciers in High Mountain Asia, western North America, South America and parts of the Arctic also reveal substantial glacier mass losses. There were some mass gains in Iceland and Northern Norway associated with higher-than-average precipitation and a relatively cool summer.\nAccording to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), globally the glaciers lost more than 6,000 gigatonnes of ice over the period 1993-2019. This represents an equivalent water volume of 75 lakes the size of Lac Leman (also known as Lake Geneva), the largest lake in Western Europe. The Greenland Ice Sheet ended with a negative total mass balance for the 26th year in a row.\nAs of 2021, 2.3 billion people faced food insecurity, of which 924m people faced severe food insecurity. Projections estimated 767.9m people facing undernourishment in 2021, 9.8pc of the global population. Half of these are in Asia and one-third are in Africa.\nHeatwaves in the 2022 pre-monsoon season in India and Pakistan caused a decline in crop yields. This, combined with the banning of wheat exports and restrictions on rice exports in India after the start of the conflict in Ukraine, threatened the availability, access, and stability of staple foods within international food markets and posed high risks to countries already affected by shortages of staple foods.\n"

We are waiting for a copy of the judgement,\u201d one of the defence lawyers told the media outside the court, even as crowds, including relatives of the accused gathered outside the court, welcomed the verdicts with chants of \u201cJai Shree Ram\u201d and \u201cBharat Mata ki Jai\u201d.\nThere were a total of 86 accused in the case, but 18 of them died in the intervening period, The Wire said. The accused were facing charges under Indian Penal Code Sections 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder), 143 (unlawful assembly), 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting armed with deadly weapons), 120 (B) (criminal conspiracy), and 153 (provocation for riots), among others. The maximum punishment for these crimes is death.\n \n \n\nThe court of S.K. Baxi, special judge for Special Investigation Agency (SIT) cases, pronounced the verdict on Thursday. The prosecution and defence examined 187 and 57 witnesses, respectively, during the trial that started in 2010 and went on for nearly 13 years with six judges successively presiding over the case.\nHome Minister Amit Shah had appeared as a defence witness for Kodnani in 2017. Kodnani had requested the court to summon him to prove her alibi that she was present in the Gujarat assembly and later at the Sola Civil Hospital and not at Naroda Gam where the massacre took place.\nAmong the evidence produced by the prosecution is the video of a sting operation carried out by journalist Ashish Khetan as well as call details of Kodnani, Bajrangi and others during the relevant period. When the trial started, S.H. Vora was the presiding judge.\nHe was elevated to the Gujarat high court. His successors, Jyotsna Yagnik, K.K. Bhatt and P.B. Desai, retired during the trial.\nSpecial judge M.K. Dave who came next was transferred. Kodnani, who was a minister inthe Gujarat government, was convicted and sentenced to 28 years in jail in the Naroda Patiya killings where 97 people were massacred.\nShe was later discharged by the Gujarat High Court. The massacre at Naroda Gam was one of the nine major 2002 communal riots cases investigated by the SIT and heard by special courts.\nThe Justice Nanavati Commission that investigated the Gujarat pogroms noted the statements of witnesses that \u201cthere was no police help received by the Muslims and they were simply at the mercy of the miscreants\u201d, and that \u201cpolice help arrived only in the evening\u201d. However, several police officials deposed before the commission that they were not able to reach Naroda Gam because they were managing the more serious situation at Naroda Patiya, which was unfolding at the same time.\nThe commission observed that \u201cpolice force at the place was inadequate\u201d and that the police \u201cwere not even properly equipped\u201d. It concluded that \u201cit cannot be said that they deliberately allowed the incident to happen.\u201d\nWith regard to the involvement of political persons in the massacre, the commission said, \u201cNot only the residents of the locality but even the police present at the place have said that the leaders of VHP, Bajrang Dal, and the BJP actively participated in these incidents and at their instigation, the riots in this area occurred.\u201d\nHowever, the commission added, \u201cSince the issue with regard to the culpability of the leaders named above is under scrutiny of the judicial forums, it is not proper for this commission to express any opinion thereon and the commission, as it is a fact-finding commission.\u201d\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan\u2019s state-owned entities (SOEs) are the worst in South Asia and their combined losses growing faster than assets, resulting in a significant annual drain on scarce public resources and posing a substantial risk to the sovereign.\nOn an annual basis, they together swallow more than Rs458bn in public funds to stay afloat as their combined loans and guarantees surged to almost 10pc of GDP (Rs5.4tr) in FY21 from 3.1pc of GDP or Rs1.05tr in 2016, according to the World Bank that advised a deep-rooted reform programme to reverse the trend.\nThey \u201cimpose a significant fiscal drain and pose a substantial financial risk on the federal government\u201d, said the World Bank, adding that these entities had been incurring losses since FY16, with annual losses averaging at 0.5pc of GDP over FY16\u201320. \u201cPakistan\u2019s federal SOEs have been found to be the least profitable in the South Asia region\u201d, said the Public Expenditure Review 2023, adding that with the persistent losses, the accumulated SOE losses had become substantial, amounting to 3.1pc of GDP in FY20.\nTo cover the losses, the federal government has been providing direct fiscal support to the SOEs, in the form of subsidies, loans and equity injections, which totalled 1.4pc of GDP in FY21. In addition to direct support, the government has been also issuing guarantees for SOEs to secure loans from commercial banks. Federal government exposure to SOEs, defined as the outstanding stock of guarantees and government loans to SOEs, has been rapidly increasing and stood at 9.7pc of GDP in FY21.\nThe report noted that combined fiscal exposure against domestic and foreign loans and guarantees had been increasing rapidly with annual growth averaging 42.9pc over FY2016\u20132021. But this required a detailed risk assessment on account of contingent exposure that may arise from guarantees. In FY 2021, 32pc of the outstanding guarantees, given through the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC), were against project financing of the K-3 and K-4 nuclear power plants. The available data show that guarantees constituted the bulk of fiscal exposure, at 44.4pc of total exposure in FY21, while Cash Development Loans and foreign loans accounted for 36pc and 19.6pc of exposure, respectively.\nThe stock of outstanding government guarantees to SOEs has more than doubled since FY16. Over 75pc of the stock of guarantees is against the power sector for financing the circular debt. The stock of outstanding guarantees from the Federal Government to federal commercial SOEs has increased from 2.2pc of GDP in FY16 to 4.5pc of GDP in FY22.\nThe report said that individual SOE performance was largely dictated by sectoral performance. Although the primary reasons for SOE losses differ, they are typically related to unresolved corporate governance issues, sector regulations, an underestimation of the cost of the provision in complete restructuring and insufficient current subsidies.\nAn SOE portfolio analysis showed that individual SOE performance was influenced by sectoral policies and the level of operational autonomy by the Board of Directors and senior management. SOE losses are concentrated in the power, infrastructure, and transport sectors, and in the aggregate, outweigh profits from profitable SOEs. Although a sizable number of commercial SOEs generated profits in FY20, they were concentrated in the oil and gas sector.\n"

The fall in exports in dollar terms was around 21.3pc.\nTotal rice exports during March stood at 382,618 tonnes valuing $243,632, while Pakistan exported a total 2,907,322 tonnes of rice to earn $1,598,261 during the period July-March 2022-23.\nOf them basmati variety was 428,404 tonnes worth $456,361 and non-basmati 2,478,918 tonnes valuing $1,141,900.\nRice trade expert Ha\u00admid Malik says with the current export trend Pak\u00adistan will be able to cross the $2bn export target. \nAn official of the Rice Exporters Association of Pakistan (Reap) said export figures in terms of quantity may be down but the way the crop has been affected, the foreign sales are comparatively satisfactory as exporters are getting fair prices.\n\u201cEver high export prices and demand are there in the foreign markets. Tho\u00adugh the crop is less in quantity but in terms of the value we are set to cross the $2bn mark.\u201d\nLast year Pakistan exported rice worth $2.5bn, historically the highest figure.\nThere is a very encouraging situation on the export front but local businesses are severely hit as scarcity of foreign exch\u00adange is preventing the import of machinery and material meant for value-addition.\n\u201cMachinery imports are stuck up. Things that are ultimately meant for exports are blocked. Letters of credit for planters, harvesters, and rice processing machines are not being opened. The companies working on sustainable production agriculture are being disallowed to import solar panels,\u201d the official says requesting not to be named.\nHowever, Momin Malik, Director of Seeds at Guard Agricultural Research and Services Ltd, says as basmati rice are getting a good price, particularly in the international markets, there is a growing trend of plating basmati this year instead of non-basmati varieties, which had been claiming the basmati acreage for the last few years.\nAlso due to delays in wheat harvesting because of late sowing as well as low temperatures in March slowing down the crop\u2019s maturing process, the sale of rice seeds of coarse varieties has declined by over 10pc. For, he explains, the window for reaping a third crop of hybrid rice, between wheat and basmati rice, has narrowed down because of delay in wheat harvesting.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The success rate of the Asian  Devel\u00adopment Bank\u2019s (ADB) public sector operations declined during  2016\u20132022, Independent Evaluation Department (IED), ADB\u2019s assessing body  revealed on Wednesday.\nAccording to the \u20182023 Annual Evaluation  Review\u2019 prepared by IED, and released on Wednesday, the success rate of  ADB\u2019s public sector projects shrank primarily among infrastructure  projects in the relatively new areas of the transport and energy  sectors, however, private sector projects remained stable.\nThe  assessment found, while using a combination of quantitative and  qualitative methods, that success relied predominantly on project  factors such as complexity, risk, supervision, delegation, financing  utilization, and procurement and design readiness. It accounted for  nearly three-fourths of the explainable variations in the public sector  performance.\nThe evaluation attributes the remaining variables in  the public sector performance to country-specific factors, including  governance, political stability, fiscal management, economic  performance, and unexpected events.\nThe sovereign success rate in  2020-2022, averaged 68 per cent, continued the steady decline from 77pc  in 2016-2018. Meanwhile, in wake of the annual variation in the number  of completed and validated sovereign projects in 2016-2022, overall  sovereign project performance declined by 3.2pc annually.\nDeteriorating  infrastructure performance drove the decline of overall sovereign  performance, leading to a drop of 3.9pc annually during 2016\u20132022.\nSimilarly, declines in transport and energy projects further abetted slumping infrastructure performance.\nWeak  management and financial capacities of executing and implementing  agencies and broad project scopes were the main constraints to energy  projects, according to the IED validations of project completion  reports. Inadequate due diligence backed the design deficiencies in poor  performance of transport projects.\nADB operations in relatively  new areas of activity in transport and energy \u2014 such as rail, urban  public transport, energy efficiency and conservation, and energy sector  development and institutional reforms \u2014 also contributed to poor  sovereign performance due to inadequate consideration of developing  member countries\u2019 limited experience with new technologies, the report  said.\nAmong non-infrastructure operations, public sector  management (PSM) saw a considerable decline in South Asia and the  Pacific, which were affected by changes in government and development  priorities.\nIn contrast, education and health projects performed  better during the period. It was found that government ownership and  commitment to education and health reforms enhanced performance in these  sectors.\nThe recent uptick in infrastructure performance from  66pc in 2019\u20132021 to 68pc in 2020\u20132022 helped maintain non sovereign  operations\u2019 (NSO) stable performance during 2016-2022.\nThe  technical assistance projects that failed to deliver their planned  outcomes were generally in public expenditure and financial management,  integration of planning and budgeting, and railway development.\nSuccess  rates of financial institution projects and the legacy of private  equity funds designed years ago continued to lag behind infrastructure  projects due to internal challenges and external.\nLikewise,  financial institution project success dipped from 70pc in 2019\u20132021 to  50pc in 2020\u20132022, while no private equity fund was rated successful.\nTechnical  assistance (TA) projects that failed to deliver planned outcomes were  generally in public expenditure and financial management, integration of  planning and budgeting, and railway development.\nThe report revealed that TA projects that performed  poorly had supported reforms or knowledge products that were spread  across too many areas and had vaguely defined performance targets.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: With over Rs500 billion in annual financial bleeding, the government has decided not to set up any new state-owed entity (SOE) in future unless required for strategic reasons or under an agreement with any country and gradually off-load the majority of an existing lot of 200 entities mostly operating in losses.\nThis is part of the draft SOE Policy released by the Ministry of Finance under the requirement of the IMF programme and SOE\u2019s Governance and Operations Act 2023. \u201cThe Federal Government shall own or retain only those SOEs that are determined to be strategic as approved under SOE Triage\u201d, reads the policy and defines strategic SOEs which have significant strategic, security, or social importance that they cannot be entrusted to only private ownership. \n\u201cStrategic SOEs can be defined as those SOEs undertaking a strategic objective or owning and managing strategic assets\u201d, says the draft policy.\n\nUnveils draft policy to restructure and reduce existing SOEs\n\nThe strategic entities also include monopoly service providers and there is no effective economic regulatory oversight of their operations. However, in such cases, the federal government may explore transformation options such as outsourcing and management transfer options with sufficient safeguards embedded. The government has sought public comments on the draft policy within 15 days before its implementation.\nConditions for new setups\nThe only exemption where the federal government could consider establishing a new SOE would be that there is no private sector firm operating within the relevant sector providing the goods and/or services that the new SOE will provide and that the government wants to establish a particular market in any sector of the economy which will be supported by the creation of an SOE, provided that such SOE shall under no circumstances be given exclusivity in provision of services or goods and shall strictly adhere to the principle of competitive neutrality.\nIn case a new SOE has been formed through the corporatisation of an existing government function, the new SOE will be clearly categorised as either commercial or non-commercial and should be created if required under the law or its services could not be procured through any private sector firm due to a legal restriction. The exemption for new entities would also be there if SOE is required under any government-to-government agreement with another sovereign nation.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, SOEs may be set up as agreed by the federal government in any government-to-government agreement with other countries provided that in future, while entering into any such agreement which requires the federal government to establish an SOE, the government shall attempt to comply with the principles set out in this policy as far as possible.\nFor existing SOEs, the government would put in place a mechanism for their restructuring leading to gradual privatisation or divestment as a private-public partnership (PPP). For this, each division of the federal government which has SOEs operating within its administrative control under the Rules of Business, 1973, shall develop a reform plan under their oversight and categorise the SOEs into strategic SOEs, commercial SOEs to be privatised, SOEs required to be restructured and reformed and retained in the medium term or SOEs required to be restructured before privatisation.\nProposals for reforms  \nThe reform plan would include proposals for reforms of SOEs such as a listing of SOEs, restructuring and mergers, entering into PPPs, contracting out operations and asset sales along with transformation options and timelines to implement the process. The relevant division or ministry would be required to submit its recommendations for each such SOE to the cabinet committee on SOEs within six months of the coming into effect of the new policy.\nFor non-strategic SOEs, line ministries and divisions will develop a plan to transform these SOEs through different options including corporate restructuring, management contracts, joint ventures, PPPs, and outsourcing. In case of an SOE is facing financial or operational problems, the federal government shall require the relevant ministry, in consultation with the central monitory unit, to develop a transformation plan for financial and operational improvement of the SOE.\nPerformance benchmark\nIf an SOE is unable to perform satisfactorily financially and operationally after repeated efforts to improve performance, the federal government shall declare it a sick company in terms of section 292 of the Companies Act, 2017 and any institution, authority, committee, or person may be authorized to draw up a plan for the rehabilitation, reconstruction, and reorganization of such SOE. The Privatization Commission would then be allowed to determine the next steps for these SOEs while taking measures to protect the strategic interest of the government during the transformation process.\nUnder the policy, the government would ensure the establishment of a CMU in the Finance Division, whose primary responsibility would be to monitor the operations and performance of SOEs. The cabinet committee on SOEs would be responsible for the above process along with all matters related to appointment of board of directors, reform and restructuring process, period performance and financial review and all related matters.\nThe relevant ministries and divisions would be required to coordinate with the board of such SOE to ensure compliance with the provisions of the new policy and the act, including, the development of the business plan, Statement of Corporate Intent (SCI), the annual and bi-annual reports, the timely establishment of systems of internal controls of the SOE, and reporting to the CMU.\n"

No growth was recorded in exports since September 2022 on a year-on-year basis, according to data compiled by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS).\nIn the value-added leather sector, exports of leather garments fell by 8.43pc in 9MFY23 from a year ago. However, the export of leather gloves was slightly up 0.28pc in July-March of 2022-23. Contrary to this, the exports of raw leather also decreased by 17.93pc.\nThe export of cement dipped by 32.07pc during the first nine months this year from a year ago. The decline was also noted in the export of cement in quantity terms during the months under review.\nPakistan is one of the main suppliers of global surgical instruments. However, these instruments are re-marketed in Western countries by famous brands. As a result, the export value of these products remains very negligible. The export of surgical instruments rose 9.11pc in 9MFY23 over the same period last year. Local manufacturers of surgical instruments have demanded the government provide support in terms of cash subsidies to reduce the rising input cost.\nThe exports of pharmaceutical products also grew by 28.55pc during the months under review. The export of footwear increased by 18.69pc in 9MFY23 from a year ago. This growth was mainly contributed by an increase in the export of leather footwear, followed by canvas footwear.\nThe export of carpets dipped by 7.17pc while that of sports goods grew by 17.78pc in 9MFY23. The sales of footballs were up 33.67pc. Pakistan was the official football supplier to the FIFA World Cup held in Doha, Qatar in November 2022.\nPBS data showed the export of engineering goods posted growth of 11.22pc in 9MFY23 from a year ago. However, the export of electrical fans dipped by 9.05pc during the months under review.\nThe export of jewellery declined 43.68pc during the period under review but the exports of gems posted growth of 6.32pc. The export of furniture is up by 45.23pc, followed by an increase of 2.32pc in molasses, 100pc in handicrafts, and 3.05pc in gur and gur products, respectively.\n"

The FCA is reviewed every month as per the tariff regime applicable across the country and is usually applicable to the consumer\u2019s bills for one month only.\nThe higher FCA, on approval, would be available to all consumer categories of KE except lifeline power consumers, domestic consumers consuming up to 300 units, and agricultural consumers and electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS). The adjustment on account of monthly FCA is also applicable to domestic consumers having Time-of-Use (ToU) meters irrespective of their consumption level.\nKE said the higher FCA was primarily due to an increase in fuel prices of RLNG and costly imports of electricity from the national grid. It claimed that the price of power purchased from the national grid in March had increased by 41pc as compared with December 2022. \nSimilarly, the price of purchase for RLNG from SSGC increased by 14pc from December 2022, while RLNG purchased from Pakistan LNG Ltd (PLL) was higher by 20pc in the same period. Furnace oil prices in March decreased by 10pc from December 2022.\n"

Earlier, ECP had set April 20 as the final day for submission of tickets.\nAccording to party sources, over 80 per cent of tickets have been handed over to deserving candidates and there are disputes on around 20pc of seats.\n\u201cThe contentions are among the candidates who had submitted nomination papers for respective constituencies thinking they were better suited to represent their areas,\u201d the source said, adding that in some constituencies, up to 10 candidates had submitted nomination papers in hopes of getting a ticket.\nFor 297 constituencies, the party received some 1,500 applications and tickets have been awarded by the PTI chairman to 285 candidates, the source told Dawn.\nA decision on 12 seats \u2014 PP-57, PP-61, PP-124, PP-162, PP-177, PP-204, PP-221, PP-234, PP-244, PP-251, PP-253 and PP-272 \u2014 is still pending.\nFollowing the award of tickets, the PTI constituted four reconciliation committees to recommend an adjustment in the list of candidates, the source said.\nThe committees have now been converted into \u201creview committees\u201d to hear the candidates\u2019 grievances and forward their recommendations to Mr Khan.\nThe North Punjab review committee is headed by retired Brig Musadiq Abbasi, Central Punjab by Senator Ejaz Chaudhry, West Punjab by Hassan Nawaz and South Punjab by Aon Abbas Bappi.\n\u201cThere would have been no complaints or rifts if the ECP had not extended the date for submission of nomination papers,\u201d the source said. \u201cNow, with the date extended, the review committees will engage the complainants until April 26.\u201d\nThe source added that in case of any change in the earlier awards, the candidates who received the tickets and submitted them before the ECP ahead of the previous date would have to hand them over to the new candidates.\nWhen contacted, Central Punjab review committee head Senator Ejaz Chaudhry said there were individual complaints as those who were denied the tickets agitated, claiming that they were stronger candidates than those who were awarded the tickets.\nHowever, he denied the influence of any pressure groups or lobby vying for tickets.\nExceptions and surprises\nMr Khan has been saying for months that he would personally interview each aspirant and only choose the strongest one to be the PTI\u2019s candidate. However, the final list issued after the extensive interview process had several notable exceptions \u2013 such as Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Fawad Chaudhry and Hammad Azhar \u2013 which didn\u2019t go unnoticed.\nWith these heavyweights out of the race, the chief minister\u2019s seat, at this stage, apparently has only two hopefuls \u2014 newly-inducted PTI president Chaudhry Parvez Elahi and Usman Buzdar.\nMr Khan\u2019s former chief of staff Shahbaz Gill, who was allegedly tortured during custody, was also denied a ticket.\nFawad Chaudhry recently expressed his reservations about not being considered for the provincial assembly, adding that the chief minister\u2019s slot was attractive if one was interested in bringing about a change.\nHe added that he couldn\u2019t do anything, as the decision was taken by Mr Khan himself.\nHammad Azhar said the PTI chairman had informed him that his services will be needed in the federal government and this was the reason he withdrew his nomination papers for the provincial assembly seat.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Punjab minister Murad Raas has also been denied a ticket. Though Mr Raas didn\u2019t say anything publicly, party insiders claim Mr Khan was not happy with his performance as the minister.\nThey also claimed that Mr Raas was not seen in the field when party leaders and workers were facing the wrath of the state authorities.\nFormer Punjab minister for higher education Raja Yasir Humayun had also not been considered for the ticket. Mr Humayun, however, said he has always been vying for the National Assembly ticket.\nAdditionally, as per his commitment to Mr Elahi, who recently merged his faction of the PML-Q with the PTI, Mr Khan has fully facilitated ex-PML-Q leaders who tagged along with Mr Elahi and his son Moonis Elahi.\nAll 10 former MPAs, who were part of the PML-Q, have been awarded tickets and two women MPAs \u2014Baasima Chaudhry and Khadija Umar \u2014 have been placed on the list for reserved seats.\nMr Khan has also awarded the ticket to Moonis Elahi from PP-32 (Gujrat-V).\nThe PTI chief\u2019s decision to award a ticket to Mehr Abdul Sattar from PP-186 (Okara-IV) was widely welcomed. Mr Sattar was a leader of the Anjuman-i-Mizareen and had been fighting for the rights of tenants of Military Farms in Okara.\nFormer Punjab health minister and PTI Central Punjab president Dr Yasmin Rashid has been given a ticket from PP-173, Lahore, where she will face-off against PML-N chief organiser Maryam Nawaz Sharif, who had submitted her nomination papers.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The controversial law seeking to curtail the powers of the chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) to take suo motu action and form benches technically became an act of parliament on Friday.\nAnd despite a Supreme Court order halting the law\u2019s implementation, the National Assembly Secretariat formally asked the Printing Corporation of Pakistan (PCP) to publish it in the official gazette.\nAfter President Arif Alvi for a second time refused to assent to the bill passed by lawmakers in a joint sitting of the parliament on April 10, the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act 2023 has now become an act under Article 75(2) of the Constitution. This was announced officially by the National Assembly Secretariat through its official Twitter handle.\nLater, the NA Secretariat released a handout and a copy of the letter signed by Additional Secretary (Legislation) Muhammad Mushtaq written to the PCP manager, stating that he had been directed to forward a copy of the act for publication in the official gazette.\n\nNA Secretariat asks Printing Corporation of Pakistan to publish new act in official gazette\n\nSuch communication between the NA Secretariat and the PCP after the passage of the laws is a routine matter and the NA Secretariat does not issue any press releases in this regard. This time, however, it has not only issued a press release but also issued a copy of the letter in the wake of the ongoing executive-judiciary tussle over the issue of polls in two provinces.\nArticle 75(2) of the Constitution says that when the president has returned a bill to the parliament, it shall be reconsidered in a joint sitting. If it is again passed, with or without amendment, by the votes of most members of both houses, it is again referred to the president for their assent. If the bill was not signed by the president within 10 days, their assent would have been deemed granted.\nInitially, the bill was approved by the federal cabinet on March 28 and then passed by both houses of parliament \u2014 the National Assembly and Senate. However, President Alvi refused to sign it into law with the observation that it travelled \u201cbeyond the competence of parliament\u201d.\nHowever, a joint session of parliament passed it again on April 10 with certain amendments and it was then again referred to the president for his assent.\nHowever, three days later, the Supreme Court barred the government from enforcing the proposed legislation, saying the move would \u201cprevent the imminent apprehended danger that is irreparable\u201d as soon as the bill becomes an act of parliament.\n\u201cThe moment that the bill receives the assent of the president or it is deemed that such assent has been given, then from that very moment onwards and till further orders, the act that comes into being shall not have, take or be given any effect nor be acted upon in any manner,\u201d said an interim order issued by the eight-member Supreme Court bench headed by CJP Umar Ata Bandial, prompting a strong reaction from the government, which passed damning resolutions against the top court.\nOn April 19, the president, for a second time, refused to give his assent for the bill and sent it back to the parliament, maintaining that the matter was sub judice, or being considered by a judge or court.\nAccording to the legislation, a three-member bench consisting of the chief justice and the two senior-most judges of the apex court will decide whether to take up a matter suo motu. Previously, this was solely the prerogative of the chief justice.\nThe law also states that every cause, matter or appeal before the apex court would be heard and disposed of by a bench, which will be formed by a committee comprising the chief justice and the two senior-most judges.\nThe legislation also includes the right to file an appeal within 30 days of the judgement in a suo motu case and that any case involving constitutional interpretation will not have a bench of fewer than five judges.\nThe bill would allow former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and other parliamentarians disqualified by the Supreme Court under suo motu powers (such as Jahangir Tareen) to appeal their disqualification within 30 days of the law\u2019s enactment.\n"

The bill became an act on Friday.\n\u201cThe PM was told by the government\u2019s legal brains that he is \u201clegally safe\u201d if the SC takes note of the violation of its order, a source told Dawn.\nHe said the legal team had informed the premier about possible action the SC could take against him for defiance by the government of its order to hold elections to the Punjab Assembly on May 14.\nHe said Mr Sharif also discussed with the PML-N\u2019s Sardar Ayaz Sadiq and Khwaja Saad Rafique the apex court\u2019s order to evolve a consensus on the date for holding elections to the National and provincial assemblies on the same day.\nThe SC will resume proceedings on April 27 on petitions for holding elections in Punjab. The SC has made it clear that its order about the May 14 polls in Punjab would remain intact.\nConsensus unlikely\n\u201cThere seems little chance of a consensus between the ruling coalition and the PTI over a date for holding elections for the National and provincial assemblies simultaneously. This fight between parliament and SC will go to the next level, eventually proving disastrous for the democratic set-up\u201d the source feared.\nKhurram Chughtai, a lawyer, told Dawn that so far the prime minister had done nothing in violation of any order or judgement of the Supreme Court.\n\u201cIf there is anything he did which may be considered against any order of the three-member SC bench, we don\u2019t have observations by the judges disapproving of the PM\u2019s actions.\n\u201cBut on the other hand, four judges had written a dissenting note which serves as a valid defence of the prime minister,\u201d he said.\nKhurram Chughtai further said the views expressed during parliament\u2019s proceedings, and votes taken on an issue, enjoy constitutional immunity.\nAccording to the lawyer, Article 69 of the Constitution provides parliamentary privilege to both \u2014 proceedings under Article 84 and the notification on promulgation of any legislation.\n\u201cAny injunction of the Supreme Court regarding operation of any legislation has no effect on any legislation passed by parliament, Mr Chughtai said.\n"

            "Text": "While the ongoing tussle between parliament and the judiciary is likely to drag on beyond Eid, legal and constitutional experts continue to question the Supreme Court\u2019s April 4 ruling for exclusively focusing on elections to the Punjab Assembly and placing the issue of polls in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa \u2018on a back burner\u2019.\nThe two assemblies were dissolved in a similar manner just four days apart \u2014 Punjab on January 14 and KP on January 18 \u2014 but the apex court adopted different approaches in the two seemingly identical cases.\nWhile it apparently made \u2018all-out efforts\u2019 to hold polls in Punjab as early as possible, it allowed parties to take the case for KP elections to the \u201cappropriate\u201d forums, and the matter is currently before the Peshawar High Court.\nThis apparent dichotomy in the court\u2019s conduct doesn\u2019t sit right with many in the legal fraternity.\n\nLegal experts see legitimate concerns behind govt demand for elections in one go, say 90-day deadline \u2018not rigid\u2019\n\nSenior lawyer Akhtar Hussain, who represents the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) on the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP), says the apex court has been criticised for focusing only on elections to the Punjab Assembly and asking petitioners to approach \u201cany forum\u201d on the identical issue in KP.\nThere should have been a single order for both provinces, but the apex court bifurcated the matter of KP polls, strengthening the impression it was only interested in holding elections in Punjab, said Mr Hussain.\nFormer Supreme Court Bar Association president Yasin Azad termed it constitutionally incorrect to adjudicate on elections to the Punjab Assembly and ignore KP.\nMr Azad questioned whether Article 224 of the Constitution \u2014 which stipulated the 90-day deadline \u2014 did not apply to KP and asked whether the apex court had no objection to October 8 as the date for polls in that province.\n\u201cThe Supreme Court is also questioning the tenure of caretaker government in Punjab alone and its entire focus is to hold early elections in the largest province of the country,\u201d he observed.\nFormer Sindh Bar Council vice-chairman Haider Imam Rizvi assailed the apex court\u2019s decision to make no observations regarding elections in KP, terming it \u201ccontrary to the provisions of law\u201d.\n90-day deadline \u2018not rigid\u2019\nThe 90-day deadline for polls to the Punjab and KP assemblies expired on April 14 and April 18, respectively.\nOn this, Mr Hussain was of the view that the deadline could be extended under special and unavoidable circumstances.\nMr Azad also concurred, stating that the deadline can be extended under unavoidable circumstances. as provided in Article 254, and a precedent in this regard was set when the 1988 general elections were delayed.\nArticle 254 states that if any action required by the Constitution to be done within a particular period was not done in that time, it won\u2019t render the action illegal or invalid for the sole reason of tardiness.\nBut while the constitutional deadline for polls may have lapsed, Mr Rizvi said that according to articles 232 and 234 \u2014 which deal with proclamation of emergency and governor\u2019s rule \u2014 elections can also be delayed under an emergency or unavoidable circumstances.\nBefore discussing the rigidity of the 90-day deadline, the question of dissolution needs to be addressed first, he said.\n \n \n\n\u201cUnder Article 107 of the Constitution, the duration of an assembly is five years and its premature dissolution has to be fully justified through definite reasons as provided in the Constitution,\u201d Mr Rizvi said.\nCommenting on the push to remove caretaker governments following the expiry of their stipulated tenure, Mr Azad noted that the Constitution was silent on the issue.\nHe attributed the ongoing crisis to the apex court\u2019s interpretation of Article 63-A.\nAfter the 18th Amendment, Mr Azad said, issues related to the provinces must be decided by the respective high courts and the apex court may not use its extraordinary powers under Article 284(3) to intervene in provincial issues.\nHe said a case for elections to Punjab Assembly was already pending before the Lahore High Court when the chief justice took the suo-motu notice.\n\u2018Legitimate concerns\u2019 on scattered polls\nLegal experts Dawn spoke to also lent some consideration to the ruling coalition\u2019s firm stance of holding polls across the country on a single day.\nMr Hussain said that there was \u201csome substance in the government\u2019s arguments\u201d, noting that the concept of caretaker governments was introduced in view of Pakistan\u2019s history of unconstitutional rule.\nHe said it was aimed at providing a level playing field to all political parties and ensuring free and fair elections.\u201c\nIf elections in Punjab were held before general elections, there would be an elected government in the province during the elections for the National Assembly which would \u201cviolate the constitutional concept\u201d of a level-playing field, Mr Hussain added.\nAn apex court judge had also questioned how both assemblies were dissolved and whether the actions were constitutional or otherwise, he added.\nFor Mr Rizvi, not holding country-wide elections on a single day would \u201clead to another constitutional crisis\u201d as the Constitution was clear the elections must be held under interim setups to ensure transparency.\n"

But a meeting is scheduled for April 26, they assured the judges.\nAround the same time, a number of lawyers, PTI leaders and senior officers of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) were patiently waiting inside Courtroom No.1, believing that the judges will assemble in court since the CJP \u2014 before closing morning proceedings \u2014 had fixed further hearing for 4pm. The parties waited until 5:20pm, when the court staff informed them that the proceedings would be held on April 27.\nPolitical parties impress CJP\nMeanwhile, in an order that was released later, the CJP obse\u00adr\u00adved that positive statements of lea\u00adders representing all major pol\u00aditical parties with respect to the simultaneous conduct of general elections \u201cgives cause for optimism that they would agree to the election date sooner rather than later\u201d.\n\u201cWe are cognisant that if political dialogue extends to address all grievances, then it is likely to be a lengthy process and the correct forum for that is the political arena and political institutions,\u201d the order said, adding that the court did not find any reservations to the negotiations being centred solely on a one-point agenda, namely, consensual fixation of election date for which was a constitutional and legal question.\nThe court stressed that it was important that such a result was accomplished expeditiously because its order to fix election to the Punjab Assembly on May 14 was in the field. Since the judgement holds the field, therefore, its ruling was binding on all judicial and executive authorities in the country under Article 189 and Article 190 of the constitution, the order reiterated.\nNeed for flexibility\nEarlier, Jamaat-i-Islami chief Sirajul Haq \u2014 who recently met Prime Minister Imran Khan and PTI Chairman Imran Khan \u2014 told the court that dialogue and consultation was not just an option in public affairs, but a duty as enunciated in the Holy Quran.\nFor a political dialogue, it was essential for all participants to be flexible about their respective positions and the approach of the parties should not be dictated by ego or pride, he said, suggesting a timeframe under which two important events ought to be accounted for: firstly, the wheat harvesting season in May and secondly the occasion of Haj.\nAccording to him, general elections could be held immediately thereafter, tentatively sometime in July. \u201cWe can emerge victorious\u2026 if the polls were held in a way that no one could point fingers\u2026 this was only possible if PDM coalition partners, as well as the PTI, take a step back from their stated positions.\u201d\nIf the constitutional mandate of 90 days could now become 105 days then there is no harm if the same is further extended to 205 days, he suggested. Mr Haq also clarified that he was not acting on the establishment\u2019s behalf.\nOn behalf of the Pakistan Peoples Party Parliamentarians (PPPP), Farooq H Naek stated that a process for conducting dialogue has been initiated within the coalition partners and that it was agreed that heads of all political parties will meet with the opposition parties to arrive at a consensus date for simultaneous elections.\nKhawaja Saad Rafique appeared on behalf of Pakistan PML-N and endorsed the statement of the PPP leader and expressed the willingness of his party to enter into negotiations with all political parties for elections simultaneously.\nLikewise, PPP\u2019s Qamar Zaman Kaira, Engineer Sabir Hussain Kaimkhani of the MQM-P, Tariq Bashir Cheema of the PML-Q, Israrullah Tareen of the BAP, and Sardar Ayaz Sadiq of the PML-N who was instructed to speak on behalf of the BNP-Mengal, also addressed the court and supported the views expressed by Farooq H. Naek and Saad Rafique.\nOpposed to open-ended process\nMeanwhile, senior PTI leader Shah Mahmood Hussain Qureshi assured the court his party was willing to move forward within the framework of the Constitution to negotiate a date for the simultaneous elections.\nHowever, he emphasised that the process of negotiations should not be open-ended and not be turned into a ploy for delaying elections, which was the apprehension of his party. He also emphasised that such a process should be regulated by a timeframe to ensure that the outcome was accomplished expeditiously, failing which the court\u2019s decision for May 14 elections should be complied with.\n"

            "Text": "\u2022 FO confirms minister will attend SCO summit in Goa next month\n\u2022 No word on whether he will meet Indian premier or his counterpart\nISLAMABAD: Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari will be the first Pakistani foreign minister to visit India in nearly 12 years, as the Foreign Office confirmed on Thursday that he would attend a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in Goa next month.\nThis is also the first time since 2016 that the most senior Foreign Office representative would visit India.\nMr Bhutto-Zardari will be leading the Pakistan delegation to the SCO Council of Foreign Ministers (CFM), which will take place in the Indian city of Goa on May 4 and 5, Foreign Office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahrah Baloch announced at a weekly media briefing.\nShe said the foreign minister would be attending the meeting at the invitation of his Indian counterpart Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, who currently heads the foreign ministers\u2019 council of SCO, which is a regional political and security bloc whose members include Russia, China, India and Pakistan.\n\u201cOur participation in the meeting reflects Pakistan\u2019s commitment to the SCO charter and processes and the importance that Pakistan accords to the region in its foreign policy priorities,\u201d Ms Baloch said.\nShe recalled that Mr Bhutto-Zardari also attended the last year\u2019s meeting of the SCO foreign ministers\u2019 council held in Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan.\nMs Baloch, however, did not confirm if the foreign minister was to meet Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi or his Indian counterpart. She also did not reveal the composition of the Pakis\u00adtani delegation and the exact duration of Mr Bhutto-Zardari\u2019s stay in India.\n \n \n\n\u201cI have always said that when decisions are taken, we will make formal announcements. Now that this decision has been taken, we will be making preparations for the visit,\u201d she said to a question at the briefing.\n\u201cIn the coming days, as decisions are taken, we will be making further announcements. I must underline, however, that the upcoming visit of the foreign minister is not a bilateral visit but a visit in the SCO context,\u201d she said.\nMr Bhutto-Zardari\u2019s India visit will be the first by a Pakistani foreign minister in nearly 12 years. In 2011, the then top Pakistani diplomat, Hina Rabbani Khar, visited India. In 2016, Foreign Secretary Aizaz Chaudhry travelled to India on a daylong visit.\nBilawal to seek parties\u2019 input\nSeparately, Foreign Minister Bhutto-Zardari also confirmed that he would be attending the upcoming SCO moot in India, according to a Dawn.com report.\n\u201cIt will be a gathering of foreign ministers and I will go there as a representative of Pakistan,\u201d he told reporters at a press conference in Islamabad.\nHe said his participation in the conference would illustrate Pakistan\u2019s commitment to SCO rules. He said that since he would be representing the country, he would be contacting all political parties prior to his departure to seek their input.\nTo a question about the possibility of discussing bilateral ties during the trip, he said SCO rules and regulations clearly stated that the forum was not to be used for raising bilateral matters.\nSudan chaos\nRegarding the \u201cworrying\u201d developments in Sudan, Ms Baloch told the briefing that the Foreign Office was closely monitoring the safety and security of the Pakistani community present there.\nLast week, violence erupted in Sudan between the forces of two generals who seized power in a 2021 coup. The Pakistani embassy in Khartoum was hit by three bullets last week and the chancery building was damaged as well.\nThe number of Pakistanis in Sudan was somewhere around 1,500. \u201cOur Embassy has advised them to stay indoors for their own safety in view of the developments that are taking place in the country right now,\u201d she said.\nCPEC \u2018crown jewel\u2019\nWhen asked to comment on the impression that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), initially termed a \u2018game-changer\u2019, appeared to have become a burden for Pakistan, Ms Baloch said the multibillion-dollar infrastructure project was the crown jewel of Pakistan-China economic collaboration.\n\u201cIt is an important project to which both Pakistan and China are fully committed. We believe that CPEC has provided enormous benefits to the people of Pakistan,\u201d she said.\nShe said the energy projects that have come on line as a result of Chinese investments under the CPEC framework demonstrated their importance for Pakistan\u2019s economy and its development.\nSimilarly, the people of Pakistan were already benefiting from the road infrastructure and the motorway projects developed under CPEC, she said, adding that anyone who travelled on these roads could appreciate the economic significance of these infrastructure projects.\nShe said the development of Gwadar Port was also a major achievement under CPEC. \u201cWe believe that all these projects are contributing and have the potential to further contribute to Pakistan\u2019s development and prosperity,\u201d she said.\n"

Speaking about talks, he said talks between political parties should be held within parliament, not through any other institutions.\nNo talks with Imran\nJUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman also ruled out the possibility of holding talks with Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chief Imran Khan who was bent on creating hurdles for the country.\n \n \n\nAddressing a press conference in Dera Ismail Khan, the JUI-F chief wondered how a dialogue could be held with a person who said that he would accept the elections only after getting a two-thirds majority in parliament. He alleged that the PTI chief wanted things to get done according to his wishes as he had already said that he would dissolve the assemblies even if he got a simple majority.\nHe regretted that Imran Khan, who should have been disqualified by now, was being made the centre of national politics. \u201cWhy did Imran Khan dissolve the assemblies? If they are disbanded deliberately, then it is stupid and he should be kept out of politics. He is incompetent and we consider him incompetent,\u201d the JUI-F leader thundered.\nHe asked that if holding elections within 90 days was a constitutional obligation then how it was possible that a date given by the PTI chief after the stipulated time could be acceptable. He said that there was a time when decisions used to be implemented through guns and now the decisions were being imposed through a hammer of court and the government was forced to hold talks with a person who did not have any regard for the national interest and integrity.\nOn the other hand, PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry, who was earlier in favour of direct dialogue, took a new turn and said talks could only be held with the government under the watch of the SC.\nPM slams SC order\nEarlier, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif slammed the Supreme Court\u2019s order to stop the enforcement of a proposed law that regulated the powers of the chief justice of Pakistan.\n \n \n\nAddressing a ceremony held to mark the launch of the Constitution app in the capital, the premier said that there was no example in the world where a law that had not even taken its applicable shape was suspended by a court.\n\u201cThe judiciary can interpret the Constitution that is their right, but the judiciary cannot rewrite the Constitution as this is only parliament\u2019s authority,\u201d he added. The premier went on to say that the \u201cparliament will use its constitutional and legal rights on this\u201d matter. \u201cIt is expected from the judiciary, the Supreme Court bench and bar that they will become the Constitution\u2019s protector,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWithout delving into any political conversation, I want to say that we are undivided on this that indisputably, we won\u2019t hesitate for a moment to sacrifice our political assets to save the state.\u201d\nLater, speaking to Shahzeb Khanzada of Geo News, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said the government had reached out to the PTI for talks and an \u201cunderstanding\u201d had been reached that the two sides would again touch base on April 26.\n\u201cThis is the position of talks,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAs a representative of my institution, on its behalf, I am telling you that we have to protect our turf. We will not take dictation from any other constitutional institution. We will not give the money [for conducting polls] because parliament has refused to do so, which is its right under the Constitution,\u201d he said.\n"

However, as soon as we complete the initial phase of government formation, you will see a tangible change,\u201d he said in his address after being sworn in by President Barrister Sultan Mahmood.\n\u201cI need time to improve this system, so I urge all of my allies to support me with patience and courage.\u201d\nOn the Kashmir dispute, Mr Haq made it clear that the state of Jammu and  Kashmir was an indivisible unity and no formula for its division could  be implemented in his presence.\n\nPTI members arrive, then walk out of oath-taking ceremony; election of new speaker postponed\n\n\u201cAs head of the government of the  base camp of the freedom movement, I assure our brethren across the  divide [in India-held territory] that I will convey their voice with all  my strength at home and abroad for the early accomplishment of our  common cause.\u201d\nMr Haq, who was the Legislative Assembly\u2019s speaker since August 2021, was elected unopposed as leader of the house in the pre-dawn election after forming a 12-member \u2018forward bloc\u2019 in the PTI and forging an alliance with the 19-member combined opposition, comprising PPP and PML-N lawmakers.\nWhen polling was held, all 48 members, present in the house, voted for him. Earlier reports suggested he had secured 31 votes, but this information was later revised when it emerged that all present in the house had voted for him.\n \n \n\nTwo legislators from PTI and one each from the two opposition parties did not show up.\nThe oath-taking ceremony was attended, among others, by almost all opposition and \u2018forward bloc\u2019 members. Some other PTI legislators, who initially arrived to attend the event, however, walked out before the ceremony began, reportedly after receiving phone calls from Pervez Khattak.\n\u201cWe have been told by our leadership that until Mr Haq clarifies his position, we should stay away from the functions featuring him,\u201d former senior minister Khawaja Farooq Ahmed, one of the people who moved away from the ceremony, told Dawn.\nMr Haq, who comes from a well-known political family of Bhimber district, regretted that while AJK possessed complete infrastructure of a full-fledged state it was not being used for the service of common people but for the luxuries of a specific class. Post-election address\nEarlier, in his speech on the floor of the house, after the announcement of the election result, the PM maintained that he would not have any justification to stay in power if he failed to establish rule of law and serve the masses.\n\u201cIn such a situation, I will quit the office on my own.\u201d\nMr Haq, who has returned to the assembly for a second time since 2006, reiterated his commitment to fulfilling his obligations as the leader of house.\n\u201cApart from the assembly members, every citizen of the state has the right to hold me accountable in case they notice a contradiction in my words and deeds.\u201d\nMr Haq, 53, made it clear that he had contested the prime minister\u2019s election as an independent candidate with the support of the combined opposition, who he referred to as PDM, and thanked the PTI lawmakers who voted for him.\nShortly after the new PM\u2019s oath, President Mahmood also administered the oath of office to PML-N\u2019s Waqar Noor and PPP\u2019s Faisal Mumtaz Rathore as cabinet members. Their portfolios are yet to be announced.\nSpeaker\u2019s election postponed\nIn a related development, the assembly secretariat cancelled the schedule for election of speaker, after PTI lawmaker Chaudhry Maqbool Gujjar submitted his nomination papers against Chaudhry Latif Akbar of PPP.\nThe combined opposition and the \u2018forward bloc\u2019 had entered into an agreement to elect the prime minister and speaker unopposed.\nHowever, when Mr Gujjar submitted his papers, the new ruling alliance got the schedule revoked on the grounds that the election of speaker could not be conducted because the outgoing speaker had not yet resigned from the office.\n"

The central bank currently has some $4.4 billion in foreign exchange reserves, scarcely enough to cover four weeks of controlled imports.\nEnergy imports make up most of the country\u2019s external payments.\nUnder the deal, Pakistan will buy only crude, not refined fuels, Mr Malik told Reuters late on Wednesday. Imports are expected to reach 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) if the first transaction goes through smoothly, he said.\n\u201cOur orders are in, we have placed that already,\u201d he said, confirming source-based information that the country would not buy refined products.\nA source in Moscow who is familiar with the negotiations told Reuters that the final deal was reached in recent days.\nThe Russian government did not respond to a request for comment.\nMajor Russian oil companies have discussed the possible supply of oil to Pakistan over recent months, two trading sources familiar with the talks said but declined to disclose the names of possible suppliers.\nOne of the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Russia plans to supply Urals crude to Pakistan.\nIslamabad imported 154,000 bpd of oil in 2022, around steady with the previous year, data from analytics firm Kpler showed.\nThe crude was predominantly supplied by the world\u2019s top exporter Saudi Arabia followed by the United Arab Emirates. The 100,000 bpd from Russia in theory greatly reduces Pakistan\u2019s need for Middle Eastern fuel.\nAsked about the impact of the Russian imports on local pricing, Mr Malik said that would be apparent once the crude had been refined and was ready to sell.\nThe US dollar historically has been the currency of oil trade, but the Ukraine war has eroded its dominance as Russia avoids receiving a currency it has been largely blocked from using by Western sanctions.\nPakistan\u2019s economic crisis meanwhile means it is desperately short of hard currency.\nMr Malik declined to say whether the Chinese yuan and the UAE dirham would be used for transactions. He also did not comment on the rate of imports. \u201cI will not disclose anything about the commercial side of the deal,\u201d he said.\nPakistan\u2019s Refinery Limited (PRL) will initially refine the Russian crude in a trial run, followed by Pak-Arab Refinery Limited (Parco) and other refineries, he said.\nAs part of sanctions on Moscow, Western nations have imposed a $60 a barrel price cap on purchases of Russian oil to try to limit Russia\u2019s revenues for fighting in Ukraine.\nIndia and China, however, have paid prices above the cap, according to traders and Reu\u00adters calculations. Russian Ene\u00adrgy Minister Nikolay Shulginov led a delegation to Islamabad in January, after which he said oil exports to Pakistan could begin after March.\nMr Malik in turn took a delegation to Moscow to negotiate the deal late last year.\nPakistan and IMF have been locked in negotiations since early February for the release of a $1.1bn tranche of a $6.5bn bailout agreed in 2019.\n"

            "Text": "New Delhi: Former governor of India-held Kashmir Satya Pal Malik, who made many revelations about national security and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s approach to corruption in an explosive interview to The Wire last week, has been called in by the country\u2019s apex investigating agency, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), \u201cfor questioning\u201d on April 28.\nThe Wire said the BJP-appointed governor for four other states  will be going to the CBI\u2019s guest house on Akbar Road in New Delhi to answer questions.\nMr Malik had blamed the government for the Pulwama massacre, saying had the government acceded to the request to fly the troopers instead of making them sitting ducks on the road, there would have been no tragedy. The claim has sparked protests from opposition parties, with Nationalist Congress Party chief asking the government to resign. But The Wire said the questioning could be about the corruption issues Mr Malik had raised.\n\u201cIt is reliably learnt that the \u2018questioning\u2019 will be on the Reliance Insurance issue \u2014 the scheme that RSS and BJP leader Ram Madhav was allegedly pushing Malik to pass while he was the governor of held Kashmir, and which Malik cancelled,\u201d The Wire said. On April 14, Malik had given an explosive interview to Karan Thapar for The Wire, in which he had specifically spoken of this deal.\nBharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) leader Ram Madhav, Mr Malik said, paid the then Indian held Jammu and Kashmir governor a special visit to try and get him to pass a scheme proposed by Reliance Insurance. When Mr Malik made it clear that the scheme had been cancelled and the paperwork was done, Mr Madhav left disappointed.\nMr Malik had also mentioned this incident in an interview to Prashant Tandon for DB Live, conducted before Thapar\u2019s interview. After that aired, Mr Madhav sent Mr Malik a defamation notice.\nThe multi-party petition in the Supreme Court against the role played by central agencies (including the CBI) to play to a political tune was not heard by the apex court as they claimed they could not look at issuing broad blanket rulings, but needed to look at matters case by case.\nIn the interview, Mr Malik said he didn\u2019t like to meet people before showering but he met Mr Ram Madhav who came early in the morning to see him.\n\u201cAsk him to tell me why he had shown up at the residence, what did he want to talk about? Did he want to talk about murder? One day earlier we had closed the matter and he came back again very early in the morning. He asked me if I had closed the matter on insurance and I said that I had. He asked me if the letter had gone and I said that it had. Then Ram Madhav got upset.\u201d\nMr Malik said he had initially passed this scheme but a lot of people asked him to take it back. \u201cThe first thing that happened was that government employees were really unhappy with the coming of the scheme. That is because all government employees had to pay Indian Rs8,500 a year for the scheme. Retired officers had to give more than Indian Rs20,000. So I said in Delhi, under Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS), we don\u2019t have to pay anything, so why would they pay here? And on top of that, the hospitals that had been listed in the scheme were bad hospitals. None of the hospitals were of national repute. I realised that the hospitals were bad and then good treatment would not be meted out even after taking large amounts.\u201d\n"

            "Text": "NEW DELHI: In a direct attack on the Modi government, Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar said the government does not have any right to stay in power when it can\u2019t protect Indian soldiers.\nSpeaking at a farmers\u2019 congregation at Purandar, in Maharashtra\u2019s Pune district, Mr Pawar referred to former Jammu and Kashmir governor Satya Pal Malik\u2019s interview with The Wire\u2019s Karan Thapar.\nIn the interview, Mr Malik candidly admitted to the mistakes that led to the Pulwama attack of 2019, including instructions by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and National Security Agency chief Ajit Doval for him to keep quiet on the matter.\nThe Congress party has also demanded a white paper on the Pulwama terror attack after the stunning revelations by Mr Malik that the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) Jawans became easy targets as the Narendra Modi government denied their request to travel by aircraft from Jammu to Srinagar.\nA group of farmers\u2019 and khap panchayat leaders from East Punjab and Haryana have reportedly also expressed solidarity with Mr Malik over the revelations he made over the Pulwama attack, and asked him to \u201ccarry on\u201d.\nThe government and the BJP have maintained silence at the revelations made by Mr Malik, a BJP leader who was appointed governor by the Modi government.\nThey have not responded to the views of former army chief Gen Shankar Roychowdhury, who said: \u201cThe primary  responsibility behind the loss of lives in Pulwama rests on the government headed by the Prime Minister, who is advised by the national security adviser.\u201d\nWhite Paper\nAccording to The Wire, two military veterans said that in previous terror attacks, such as the Mumbai bomb explosions and the Pathankot attack in 2016, inquiries were held and findings made public. This was essential to establish the truth, fix responsibility, and strengthen India\u2019s national security, they said.\n\u201cTherefore, we demand that the government of India publish a White Paper on the Pulwama attacks, describing how the attacks took place, what were the \u2018intelligence failures\u2019, why troops were denied aircraft, what security lapses occurred and the role of CRPF, ministry of home affairs, ministry of defence, National Security Adviser and the Prime Minister\u2019s Office,\u201d the Congress demanded.\nAccording to the Indian Express, a number of leaders from farmers\u2019 organisations and khap panchayats expressed support for Malik on Sunday. \u201cSatyapal Malik bravely exposed Pulwama. Farmers are his shield. He must carry on. All farmer organisations are with him,\u201d Balbir Singh Rajewal, a farmers\u2019 leader from East Punjab, said.\n\u201cIn Kandela village of Jind district, Sarvjatiy Kandela held a meeting under the chairmanship of Om Prakash Kandela to express solidarity with Malik. After the meeting, khap spokesperson Jagat Singh Redhu demanded a probe by a Supreme Court judge into the issues raised by the former governor, claiming Malik \u201ccan\u2019t level allegations without facts\u201d,\u201d the newspaper reported.\nDuring the year-long farmers\u2019 agitation against the central government\u2019s now-repealed farm laws, Malik, a BJP leader, had expressed solidarity with the farmers and even claimed to have approached the prime minister on their behalf.\nIn his speech, Mr Pawar pointed out: \u201cAlthough many things have happened in the country, the fact of these incidents has not come to the fore. There is an area called Pulwama where 40 soldiers had been killed. The story behind this was brought forward by former Jammu and Kashmir governor Satya Pal Malik, a BJP appointee to the position,\u201d he said.\nRepeating Malik\u2019s lines, Pawar said that the revelations were of a serious nature.\n\u201cAt that time (Pulwama attack), the necessary equipment and planes were not provided to soldiers, so they had to face death.\n"

CDA officials said that work was being executed as per scheduled and it will be completed within the deadline of June this year.\nHowever, they said that the Railway bridge (near PWD interchange) is a huge structure and it could take some extra time.\n\u201cThe project could be extended for two to three months,\u201d said an engineer of CDA. He, however, said that extra efforts were being made to complete the work within this deadline.\n\nCDA official says extension of deadline not uncommon in projects with large amount of work\n\n\u201cIn such a huge amount of work, extension of a few months in contract is not a big deal. Our focus is quality as the expressway is a highly busy road, therefore, we do not want to complete it in a rash manner,\u201d said an official and added that expansion of the road project will be comfortably complete by June this year.\n\u201cBut yes, the Railway bridge, which is part of this 2-km road project will take extra time. The eastern side of the bridge is near the completion stage and once it is completed then we will move towards the western side,\u201d he said.\nIt is relevant to note here that currently, three projects are in progress on the expressway from Korang Bridge to GT road.\nFurthermore, work on the second project, Korang bridge has also seen considerable delay. It was started in 2021 and was supposed to be completed in December 2021. However, a private contractor abandoned it halfway. \nLater on last year, the CDA engaged FWO for remainder work. Now, the bridge is being given final touches and it is said that in the next two months, it could be opened for traffic.\nExpansion from PWD to G.T. Road\nUnder this portion, FWO is expanding the road from existing two lanes to four lanes, besides construction of two major bridges (Sohan and Binder) and work is in progress with full pace.\nCDA officials said that work could be completed within the deadline of June 2024.\nThis project worth almost Rs11 billion was started last year and according to the PC-I of the project, it will be completed in 18 months. In last September, the CDA issued a commencement letter to the contractor, which was the main document to start the project.\nAfter the PWD, the four-lane Expressway narrows down to two lanes, causing bottlenecks and disrupting traffic on almost a daily basis. \nThis is one of the main roads of the federal capital and caters to both light and heavy traffic, particularly plying between Islamabad and Lahore. \nIts widening was announced many times but last year it was formally started and currently, work on it is in progress. \nThe two lane road is being widened to four lanes and once widening is completed the motorists, who face traffic congestion on a daily basis, will take a huge sigh of relief.\n"

In 2017, the CDA cancelled the lease and sealed the building since the plot was meant for the construction of a hotel, but the developer had built and sold residential apartments instead.\nHowever, a three-member bench of the Supreme Court in January 2019 restored the lease and ruled that if M/s BNP defaulted on furnishing a guarantee or payment of any installment on its due date, the civic agency would have the right, after giving a 30-day notice, to terminate the lease.\nThe CDA last month canceled the lease of the plot for One Constitution Avenue project over default.\nDuring the hearing of the matter before the apex court, the then counsel for the CDA had objected on one of the members of the bench, asking him to recuse for being a lawyer of the builder in the past. His objection was overruled by the bench.\nEarlier this month, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Maryam Nawaz also criticised the same judge, saying he was connected with a controversial lease to high-rise apartments.\nThe builder of One Constitution Avenue in March filed a petition in the IHC, saying PAC Chairman Khan had written letters to various regulators and authorities for taking action against the group.\nHe requested the court to set aside the directions given to the investigation agencies and regulators against the builder.\nJustice Farooq issued notices to the respondents, including PAC, CDA and others and also restrained the investigation agencies from their proceedings initiated against the builder on the direction of PAC.\nThe court, however, allowed the regulator and the investigation agencies \u201cto continue with any investigation or inquiry prior to the directives [of PAC].\u201d\nHowever, in a subsequent meeting, PAC again issued direction to the investigation agencies to complete the probe against the builder.\nThe builder then filed a contempt petition against PAC and the IHC issued notice to the committee.\nThe case was fixed for hearing on April 18. The lawyer of the builder was present inside the courtroom, but since the CDA\u2019s counsel was not in attendance, it was adjourned till May 25.\n"

Later, a passerby came to rescue him when they heard screams of the child and he was shifted to Tehsil Headquarters (THQ) hospital Hazro from where he was shifted to Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) Islamabad due to his critical condition.\nAccording to Dr Mohammad Naeem, medical superintendent of THQ hospital - the child lost his left eye and sustained other critical injuries. Surgery is not available in the district. Deputy District Officer (Health) Dr Abdul Rasheed said that the victim was provided anti-rabies vaccination (ARV) and other basic treatment and the boy is said to be out of danger. Responding to a question, he said that the boy was in a state of shock and referred to Pims for better cure as pediatric and ophthalmologist facility is not available in the area.\n\u201cSoon after the incident came into the notice of local administration, the entire sanitation staff of the municipal committee was mobilised and a massive operation against stray dogs in the Chach area was launched,\u201d said Assistant Commissioner Kamran Ashraf. He said that different teams were constituted and on the recommendation of former chairman of union council as well as notables, the operation was launched in hotspot areas. He said that around 100 stray dogs were neutralised during the operation to eliminate stray dogs from the area causing constant threats to masses.\nThe relatives of the boy said that the menace has increased manifold in their areas for which they have been complaining to the civic agencies without any result so far as they do not feel their basic responsibilities. They said that the population of stray dogs could not be reduced due to sheer negligence of relevant civic agencies.\nMeanwhile, PTI leader Changaiz Khan said that a \u201cgrand operation\u201d against stray and feral dogs must be initiated in the town, adding how despite constantly asking relevant officers to address the growing population of canines for the past two-and-a-half years, there has been no action.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: Haemophilia management requires prophylactic, routine and emergency treatment in addition to rehabilitation services and facilities.\nDespite these challenges, there is reason for hope in the form of promising advances in medical research leading to new treatment medicines and even cures for haemophilia patients.\nWorld Health Organisation (WHO) Global Adviser on Blood Regulation, Availability and Safety Prof Hasan Abbas Zaheer said this in a statement.\nHe added that while some of the medicines, given to patients, were registered with the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap) a number of them were not available as new medicines were frequently introduced due to continuous advancements and research in the medical sector.\n\u201cPatients in Pakistan pay exorbitant fees for Drap-registered medicines and lack of proper diagnosis for the bleeding disorder patients,\u201d he said, adding that haemophilia affects the body\u2019s ability to form blood clots and remains to be a challenge for both patients and healthcare providers in Pakistan.\n\u201cAlthough treatment options have improved over the years, management of haemophilia still presents many challenges for those living with the condition in developing countries including Pakistan,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIf someone is diagnosed with haemophilia or another bleeding disorder, it means that the person has a deficiency or absence of some clotting factors in their blood, which can lead to prolonged bleeding spontaneously, after injury or surgery. Fortunately, there are diagnostic tests available to confirm the diagnosis of haemophilia, such as routine and advanced blood and genetic tests. Once a proper diagnosis is established, treatment options are available in the form of medicines registered by Drap which help to control bleeding and prevent complications,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIn addition, there are also efforts underway in Pakistan to improve the quality of life for haemophilia and other bleeding disorder patients. Patient advocacy groups are working to raise awareness about these bleeding conditions to improve access to care and support services,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWith proper diagnosis and treatment, people living with haemophilia can lead healthy and fulfilling lives. With continued investment in research and development, and a focus on improving access to care, we can hope to see better outcomes for those living with bleeding disorders,\u201d he said.\nTalking to Dawn, Dr Zaheer suggested to Drap to expedite the process of registration of new medicines because patients suffer due to delays in the registration process.\n\u201cA number of new medicines are introduced, time to time, in the market but it becomes difficult to bring them in Pakistan, through a legal channel, due to which patients have been suffering,\u201d he said.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The Capital Development Authority (CDA) has reiterated that it will hold a balloting for plots to be allotted to the land affected people of D-13, but would not entertain community land without an endorsement from the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) revenue department.\nThe CDA is going to hold the balloting through Nadra next month, but there are reports that a number of people possess community land (shamlat). However, a senior officer of the CDA on Thursday told Dawn that not a single case of communal land will be entertained without the endorsement from the revenue department.\nHe, however, said the CDA wanted to clear compensation cases of people in all the stalled sectors, including D-13, as without this the civic agency could not take possession of sectors to start development. He said D-13, E-13, F-13, C-13, C-14, H-16 and I-17 were lying pending just because of the compensation cases. A few months ago, the then CDA deputy commissioner Khalid Masood Satti through a letter had requested the additional deputy commissioner (revenue) for determination of the share of shamlat land of several villages that fall in C-13, D-13 and E-13.\nAccording to a source, several years ago, the CDA had allotted plots in D-13 allegedly on the basis of shamlat land without determination from the ICT\u2019s revenue department, which was why there was a need to properly check the status of all allotted plots in the sector.\nThe letter, dated March 10, stated: \u201cLand falling in village Shah Allah Ditta has been acquired for Sector C-13, D-13 and E-1 in year 2008. It has come to the notice of undersigned that share of Shamlat land of some of the villages like Juhangi Syedaan, Shah Allah Ditta, Bhekar Fateh Bukhsh and Dharaik Mohri has not been determined yet among the landowners.\u201d\nIt said due to non-determination of the share of shamlat land, CDA\u2019s rehabilitation benefits could not be released to landowners who were pressing hard for their compensation.\n\u201cIt is pertinent to mention here that an inquiry is also under trial in CDA, wherein a report of subject matters needs to be submitted,\u201d the letter stated.\n\u201cThis issue warrants a proper investigation to check all such plots, which had been allotted on the basis of shamlat land,\u201d an official said.\nRecently, after suspecting major fraud and tampering in records of the three sectors, member estate Afnan Alam had requested the administration wing of the CDA for constitution of a high-level committee to examine the records while an FIR was also registered against several officials of the civic agency for allotting three plots in D-13/3 on the basis of bogus claims.\n"

Most buildings in Raja Bazaar, Satellite Town, Commercial Market, Murree Road, Liaquat Road, City Saddar Road, China Market and adjoining areas, right next to RMC offices, have been constructed without approval of the civic body as building by-laws have been violated.\nCivic body officials of the building and regulation departments did not pay heed to several complaints by individuals and local residents about illegal construction.\nIn Satellite Town, Raja Bazaar and adjoining areas, it was found that people have constructed commercial plazas without allocating 25 feet of parking space and no fire safety measures have been taken.\n\nSurvey highlights illegal construction in cantonment remains unchecked\n\nAccording to building by-laws, all commercial plaza owners should allocate basements of buildings for parking besides leaving 25 feet on the front side and basements for this purpose.\nThere is no single plaza in cantonment areas which has been allocated space for parking. As a result, visitors to the main commercial area especially in Raja Bazaar are facing problems in finding a space for parking.\nCommissioner Rawalpindi Division Liaquat Ali Chatha has asked civic bodies in the garrison city to take action against those building owners who converted parking space in basements into shops.\nHe said that government institutions would not turn a blind eye on the delay of building plan approvals and they would facilitate people to fulfill legal requirements for approval of building plans.\nHe said that 36 such plazas have been identified in the city which showed basement parking in their maps but later built shops there.\nThe basements of three of these plazas have been emptied and regular parking has been started there.\nHe directed the environment department to take an undertaking from all building owners while issuing the no objection certificate (NOC) that it will be cancelled in case of any change in the map without permission.\nHe expressed these views while presiding over the Environment Committee meeting.Additional Commissioner (Coordination) Syed Nazarat Ali, Fatima Jinnah Women University (FJWU) dean of environment science, Dr Azra Rafiq, deputy director (environment) Mohammad Rafiq and other relevant officers participated in the meeting.\nIn this meeting of the Environment Approval Committee, a total of 27 cases were presented by the sub-committee, out of which 25 were approved while two were deferred due to various objections.\nAccording to details, a total of 10 cases of petrol pumps were presented on this occasion, of which seven were from Rawalpindi district and three from Jhelum district.\nCommissioner Rawalpindi raised objection in two cases and deferred them while giving approval to 11 cases. He said that the response to the objections raised by the committee on the remaining cases should be presented in the next meeting so that after removing all objections, progress could be made.\n"

The trend of aerial firing also put the lives of staff \u2013 dedicated round the clock and operating at the flight lines \u2013 in danger, the authorities said.\nThe authorities also urged the district administration of Rawalpindi to impose Section 144 in the surrounding areas of the base \u2013 Fazal Town, Khuram Colony, Muslim Town, Dhoke Gangal, Lalyal, Chah Sultan, Dhoke Khabba, Dhoke Elahi Baksh and Dhoke Farman Ali.\n\nCPO says search operations underway, comprehensive plan chalked out for Eid\n\nIn addition, the authorities also asked the police to launch a search operation around the Nur Khan base to curb this tendency. A comprehensive security plan should be devised in order to curb the tendency of indiscriminate aerial firing on \u2018Chand Raat\u2019 and Eid.\nAn aerial firing incident caused the closure of the flight operation at Nur Khan Airbase on February 24 and also disturbed the prime minister\u2019s departure to Lahore. The prime minister\u2019s cavalcade car used by the security team was also hit by an aerial stray bullet that penetrated through its roof when it was parked at the base terminal. However, the driver remained unhurt.\nThe incident had sparked panic among the senior police officers who rushed to the spot, collected evidence and launched an investigation after registration of FIR with the Airport police. Subsequently, two deputy superintendents of police (DSPs) and three station house officers (SHOs) were removed over their failure to implement a ban on kite flying and aerial firing.\nFollowing the incident, a JIT was also constituted by the chief minister to investigate the aerial firing incident which caused the closure of flight operations at Nur Khan Airbase.\nIn February this year, the authorities had suggested that it would be only possible with stringent measures like the effective implementation of Section 144 that the menace of aerial firing would be brought under control.\nWhen contacted, CPO Syed Khalid Mehmood Hamdani said that police were being deployed in the areas surrounding the PAF base to check the aerial firing and added that search operations were also underway in the residential areas to curb this practice. He said a comprehensive security plan has been chalked out to keep a check on the aerial firing and one-wheeling on \u2018Chand Raat\u2019 and Eidul Fitr.\n"

As a result, the US now has a firm grip on Europe.\nThese remarks were made by Dr Anatol Lieven, Director Eurasia Programme, Quincy Institute, at a webinar on \u201cRusso-Ukraine conflict: costs and consequences for Europe and Asia\u201d organised by the Center for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), Islamabad.\nPakistan needs to forge closest possible links with countries like Brazil, South Africa and other nations in Africa while avoiding any clash with India.\nAccording to a statement, he noted that Europe will never go far as US against China, partly for economic reasons because the cooperation and conflict in international relations were largely driven by interests.\n\u201cStates and other international actors engage in cooperative or conflictual behaviour based on their perceived economic, strategic, ideological or even cultural interests,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt has also been noticed in Germany and elsewhere that a break in Russian supplies has been colossally profitable to the US which in part is supplying Europe its own gas at vastly increased prices.

If there was real US pressure to seriously break off economic relations with China, which is the second greatest market for German markets, it would cause great anxiety and anger in Germany,\u201d he noted.\n\u201cWhen it comes to the Ukraine war, for US, there is undoubtedly in Washington an element of pure cynicism, desire to create a military ally in Europe which will cripple Russia reserve. But if you look at American liberals and the left, you do see partly an exaggerated portrayal of Russia as an aggressive force,\u201d he said.\nDr Lieven said if anyone looked at the composition of western governments, its multicoloured, but the assumption of civilisation superiority remained absolute.\n\u201cNow the West is talking in terms of democracy and human rights and so forth but in the end it implies we are a superior civilisation. Historically, any civilisation worth a name that is Chinese, Roman, never thinks it\u2019s a civilisation but a civilisation per se,\u201d he said.\nSpeaking about Pakistan, he added that it needed to forge the closest possible links with countries like Brazil, South Africa and other countries in Africa while avoiding any clash with India.\n\u201cAnd, also strengthening itself economically because Americas tactic will be to pick off countries one by one being the weakest. America cannot afford to build sanctions on Brazil, Indonesia and allies in the Middle East as that would drive these countries in the arms of China,\u201d he said.\nAfghanistan like Iraq, Libya has been swept under the carpet in the West and the Russian invasion of Ukraine has helped that. If China sees a real need of exploring Afghan minerals and energy it could be a consequence of growing US economic pressure on Beijing, but at the moment there is no economic imperative for China to get involved in Afghanistan,\u201d he said.\n"

The mention of the Rs10 coin made him frown, something new for the otherwise quite pleasant fellow.\n\nRs10 coin and Rs75 note issued by SBP have not gained public acceptance\n\n\u201cNow I have collected a little sack full of these Rs10 coins. No one wants them,\u201d he said.\nThen remembering something, he opened his cash register to bring out several Rs75 currency notes, which the SBP had issued just last year. The green-coloured banknote was issued to commemorate the 75th independence day of Pakistan.\nThe note has portraits of four founders Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, Dr Allama Mohammad Iqbal, Mohtarma Fatima Jinnah and Sir Syed Ahmed Khan on its front.\nIt carries the signature of SBP Governor Jameel Ahmad, and yet it is not accepted in the market.\n\u201cSimilarly, this note is also not accepted. I have so many 75 rupees notes because, again, I have been taking it from customers but no one wants it from me,\u201d he shrugged.\n\u201cSome people have even told me strange stories that the note has been rejected by the public and thus recalled by the SBP,\u201d he laughed.\n\u201cThey say that the image of the Markhor on the reverse side of the note is the problem. They say that it is not a halal animal, which is utter rubbish, although it may be endangered. It is also the Inter-Services Intelligence logo. Oh please, it is just a goat,\u201d he laughed.\nAt a stationary and gift items shop just next door, young shopkeeper Asim Minhas said that since the coins and notes were in circulation therefore he accepted them all. \u201cWhy should I refuse anything that is perfectly okay? The currency is not the problem here, it\u2019s the people\u2019s ignorance that is the problem here. I take both the coins and notes from them and if I cannot use them in the market, I just go and exchange them from SBP,\u201d he said.\nVisiting to a huge departmental store in a Clifton mall, one of the staff there, upon seeing the coin, said that it was discontinued \u2018long long ago\u2019.\nA petrol pump in Saddar also turned down the coin and the Rs75 note. \u201cMonopoly Monopoly khel raheen hain kya? [Is this play money from the board game Monopoly?]\u201d Asked the attendant there.\nWhile speaking to Dawn on the issue, a spokesperson for the State Bank of Pakistan said that both the Rs10 coin and the commemorative Rs75 note, in fact all commemorative notes or coins, introduced by the SBP, are perfectly fine and acceptable for market transactions.\n"

            "Text": "LARKANA: Several preventable diseases like measles, pertussis, resistant malaria, gastroenteritis, emphysema and malnutrition have registered an unusual rise among children who reported at the Chandka Medical College children hospital from flood-hit areas in the wake of last year\u2019s devastating deluge, according to doctors.\nProf Dr Shanti Lal, chairman of the department of pediatrics at the hospital, confirmed that majority of the cases were pouring in from flood-hit areas of Qambar-Shahdadkot, Larkana and other districts including Jhal Magsi, Gaibidero, Ratoderro, Naudero, Warah and remote areas.\nThe hospital had three units and roughly over 130 cases of the above mentioned diseases were being admitted every month from among 650 to 750 patients reporting daily at the OPD, he said.\nA number of mothers who accompanied their ailing children complained that their children had contracted the diseases specially measles despite being vaccinated.\nDr Lal said that many women were not even unaware about the vaccination or they did not have the vaccination cards with them to confirm if their children had been inoculated or not. He pointed to a five-year-old boy lying on a bed nearby who could barely open his sour eyes and said it was the outcome of measles complication.\nHe said that perhaps a big portion of population was still unaware about the vaccination and its importance, and stressed the need for giving vitamin-A to children regularly to ward off eyes diseases. The vitamin-A was only available with government hospitals, he said.\nAssociate Prof Dr Shankar Lal, in-charge of unit-II, said the cases of measles, emphysema and resistant malaria were most common among children. \u201cWe are getting complicated cases of the diseases,\u201d he said.\nHe said that possible reasons behind the outbreak of measles was the vaccine, which might have lost efficacy due to poor electricity supply. The drug\u2019s efficacy might have been compromised in the absence of or interrupted power supply to cold storage for the vaccines stocks, he said.\nPoor economic conditions, food insecurity, battered communication, high cost of transport were also among the reasons behind multiplication of diseases, he said.\nHe said that unprecedented floods had not only devastated the infrastructure but also drastically damaged primary healthcare system, which had also tremendously contributed to unusual rise in diseases, he said.\nAssistant Prof Dr Dili Jan Magsi said that cases of measles were frequently reported both in acute phase and long term complications. The cases of malnutrition among children were also on the rise, he said.\nDr Lal mentioned another serious disease, sub-acute sclerosis pan encephalitis, which was connected with malnutrition and was to develop in 10-year-old children according to books but the children younger than that age were reporting at the hospital with the complaint.\nDr Magsi stressed the need for posting exclusive pediatricians in every hospital connected with teaching hospital so as to minimize burden of consultants.\nDoctors practicing at private set-up were also frequently receiving enhanced number of the cases of measles, resistant malaria, pertussis, malnutrition and other cases in post-flood period.\n\u201cMost of the cases we treat are resistant malaria and plasmodium vivax is the most common among them,\u201d said Dr Lal.\nThe professors were of the opinion that surveillances should be enhanced, ensuring availability of standard vaccine and the issues of food security must be prioritized coupled with focusing on creating awareness among masses regarding the immunization. Also damaged infrastructure should be restored and special campaigns should be launched against measles, they said.\nAsked about the medicines, they said that there was no dearth of drugs. The CMCH was regularly supplying the medicines to the children\u2019s hospital, they added.\n"

            "Text": "HYDERABAD: The Market police have registered a case against owner of a hotel, which was opened on the premises of a heritage property housing a government school, on Thursday for illegally installing a commercial water supply connection.\nThe case was lodged by Water and Sanitation Agency assistant executive engineer Mohammad Ali Samoo under Sections 430 and 427 PPC vide crime No. 60/23. The owner, Qurban Ali, was booked for installing the connection for his hotel by cutting the waterline of Tilak Incline.\nWasa staff disconnected the connection in the presence of the engineer and reported the matter to the Hyderabad Development Authority (HDA) director general.\nThe hotel\u2019s opening had already become a matter of litigation which was allowed in a space that was meant for school-related businesses like books, stationary etc.\nThe hotel was sealed under directives of the Hyderabad deputy commissioner by the city assistant commissioner. Later, the hotel owner filed a case in a civil court where it is being adjudicated upon. The case has been fixed for May 11. \nThe owner has claimed that he had got the premises registered in his name.\nThe Jamia Arabia School is located in the heritage property and its one room, meant for some school-related businesses, was rented out to Qurban Ali, who was found using it for his hotel with different names and had also encroached upon public space as well, it was alleged. Some traders and area activists had raised the issue on the grounds that the hotel could not be operated on the premises meant for school purposes. \n"

Hence, the function of election commissioner was to hold elections and the situation would normalise if the Election Commission of Pakistan was allowed to function accordingly, he said.\n\u201cOur jawans have been martyred during police operation against dacoits in riverine areas of upper Sindh,\u201d he said, adding that they had planned to take effective steps to minimize such incidents.\nHe said that more check-posts would be constructed on embankments in upper Sindh in a bid to stop movement of dacoits and supply of weapons to them. The government would restore peace in the riverine areas by eliminating all dacoits, he said.\nProvincial ministers Syed Nasir Hussain Shah, Mukesh Kumar Chawla, notables and PPP leaders also accompanied the chief minister.\nEarlier, Federal Minister Syed Khurshid Shah, provincial ministers Syed Sardar Ali Shah, Imtiaz Ahmed Sheikh, MNA Nawab Wasan, PPP Sindh president Nisar Ahmad Khuhro, PPP Balochistan president Mir Changez Khan Jamali and leaders of various political, social and religious organisations arrived at Jakhrani House to condole with PPP MPA Mir Mumtaz Hussain Jakhrani and Mir Aijaz Jakhrani.\n"

            "Text": "KARACHI: The Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), insisting that Karachi\u2019s population is around 35 million, has appealed to all the ethnic groups living in the metropolis to take to the street against \u201cinjustice with them by resorting to unfair digital census.\u201d \nMQM-P convener Khaliq Maqbool Siddiqui on Thursday said it was a \u201cnational consensus\u201d that under this unfair digital census the actual population of the city could never be counted.  \nWhile the census in Karachi, like other parts of the country, is continuing, the key partner of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) government at the Centre still sounds dissatisfied. It warned that it would not accept any \u201cmanipulated number\u201d of the city population. \nAddressing a press conference at the party\u2019s temporary headquarters in Bahadurabad, Dr Siddiqui also referred to \u201cserious flaws\u201d in the design of the digital census which suggested \u201cill intention\u201d of the authorities from the day one. He also questioned the role of parties criticising the digital census, saying that practically they were \u201cdoing only politics\u201d as they were making no credible practical moves. \n\u201cHow can one justify the higher number of blocks, set for the digital census, in rural Sindh than in Karachi and other urban areas of the province?\u201d he argued. \u201cThen in Karachi and Hyderabad, one block represents a total of 187 households but in rural Sindh a single block represents 250 households. In a rough calculation, more than five million population of Karachi has been compromised through this design. This is absolutely unjust and unfair count of population.\u201d \nThe MQM-P leader said that before 1970s, the total population of Hyderabad and Sukkur was not even 40 percent of the Karachi\u2019s population. After the 1970s, he added, the city witnessed a \u201cmassive influx\u201d of people due to different local, regional and economic issues. \n\u201cCan this be possible that after facing such an influx and immigration of people from different parts of the country and neighbouring countries, the city population started declining? Now we firmly believe that there\u2019s a national consensus that population of Karachi could not be counted correctly under this design of digital census,\u201d he said. \nDr Siddiqui said that it was MQM-P which pushed the authorities to go for another census after serious flaws in the National Census 2017 and if the numbers of urban areas of Sindh are \u201cmanipulated through \u201cmaneuvering\u201d, then his party would put up a stiff resistance.  \nCriticising those who, according to him, \u201care doing politics only for point scoring,\u201d he said that mere lip-service would not help Karachiites. \n\u201cOnly placing banners for \u2018rights of Karachi\u2019 and \u2018true population count\u2019 won\u2019t work,\u201d he said. \u201cIt demands consistent struggle and political commitment. I appeal to all the ethnic entities living in Karachi to come out of their homes. This injustice in the name of census is not against any single community. It\u2019s against everyone living in Karachi. This is even worse than [what was done before the] East Pakistan debacle.\u201d \nHe questioned the entire census exercise saying that the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) had issued computerised national identity cards (CNICs) and Form B to around 19.1 million people who had mentioned Karachi as their place of residence. \n\u201cThis means around 19.1 million people are registered with Nadra having Karachi addresses in their CNICs and Form B. This is only data of residents of the metropolis. In addition, hundreds of thousands of people are living here but their place of residence mentioned on their CNICs is other than Karachi,\u201d he said.\n"

Therefore, he referred to the Election Act\u2019s Article 69 and demanded elections should be held on one day, he said.\nHe asked why Sindh would go for premature polls and said holding two elections separately was a \u2018big question mark\u2019. \nHe said that PPP would contest election from its own platform. When Chief Justice appreciated Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari\u2019s move for negotiations then why he did not condemn Imran Khan at the same time for skipping talks. \nHe said why a unilateral verdict was being imposed on the collective wisdom of the parliament and why political parties were being asked to hammer out consensus. \nHe said that Punjab and KP assemblies were dissolved without any cogent reason and Pervaiz Illahi had said on record that all relevant rules had been violated in the process of dissolution of the assembly.\nFlanked by former district president PPP Abdul Fatah Bhutto, general secretary PPP Larkana city Khair Mohammad Shaikh and others, Khuhro He said that it was a big question to decide whether Punjab and KP assemblies had been dissolved rightly and where the May 14 date had come from and was it not the violation of the constitution. \nKhuhro reiterated that holding elections on one day would be the only solution to the present crisis. At this juncture, the country was facing difficult situation, which it had never experienced before when political system was being traumatized in such a manner. The judiciary was interfering in the parliament\u2019s authority which should not have happened, he said.\nHe said in answer to a question that Chief Justice was not Supreme Court in the same way as federal cabinet did not mean the prime minister. Supreme Court\u2019s job was to deliver verdicts based on constitution and not to damage political system, he remarked. \nHe recalled that an elected prime minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was hanged under a split verdict. Justices Naseem Hassan Shah and Anwarul Haq had admitted decades later that they were under pressure. It was unfortunate history of the country that the apex court had condoned four Martial Laws and even authorised military dictator Gen Pervez Musharraf to amend the constitution which he had not asked for, he said.\n"

            "Text": "HYDERABAD: A Sindh High Court bench of Hyderabad circuit has issued notices to Sindh University Vice Chancellor (VC) Prof Dr Mohammad Siddique Kalhoro and Registrar Ghulam Mohammad Bhutto over a contempt of court application filed against them by a university officer.\nComprising Justices Adnanul Karim Memon and Justice Moha-mmad Faisal Kamal Alam, the division bench fixed the matter for hearing on Aug 15 with directives to the respondents or their representatives to appear in person before the court. \nThe application for the contempt of court was filed for non-compliance of court\u2019s Dec 1, 2022, order regarding promotion of the petitioner.\nThe court disposed of a petition on Dec 1,2022 while observing that \u201cin view of what has been discussed above without touching merits of case, we deem it proper to refer matter of the petitioners to the syndicate of the university to address the questions involved and after providing meaningful hearing to all concerned decide the subject issue within one month\u201d. The petition was filed by Ghulam Nabi Kaka and four others.\nThe present contempt plea was filed by Ghulam Nabi Kaka and he appeared in person before the court to argue his case. He said contemnor-1 was the VC, who was also the chairman of the syndicate. Despite a lapse of over one month, the process was not initiated by \u2018the contemnors\u2019 to date, which showed abuse of law. He said the conduct of the contemnors showed that they didn\u2019t have any respect for court\u2019s order.\nHe said that as applicant he had moved applications to the contemnors seeking compliance of the order on Jan 27,2023 and March 7,2023. He added that his case for promotion was not considered in the light of observations made by a biased committee constituted for the purpose on the grounds of not having attained requisite time period in BPS-19.\nHe said the apex court and high courts had ruled against \u2018holding of additional charges\u2019, but the contemnors were themselves were holding two charges simultaneously. He said the VC held additional charge of BS-21 despite being in BS-22 while the SU registrar held an additional charge at Government College University. He alleged that more people were given favours by the contemnors to hold additional charges.\nHe said the applicant would stand retire from the service after attaining the age of superannuation on Sept 1,2024 and contemnors were using delaying tactics to linger on his case. He prayed the court to initiate contempt proceedings against the contemnors for committing violation of the Dec 1,2022 order.\n"

        "Details": {
            "Text": "LAHORE: The Lahore Development Authority (LDA) has decided to get the Lahore Division Mater Plan-2050 reviewed by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) \u2013 a renowned Swiss non-government organisation and the Urban Unit of the Punjab Planning and Development Department.\nThe review will be conducted soon after the LDA gets certified copies of the Lahore High Court\u2019s detailed judgment under which the implementation of the plan was suspended in January, 2023.\nThe LDA has also directed the officers concerned of its metropolitan wing to only entertain the applications seeking approval of new housing schemes or land subdivisions under the Master Plan-2016, Dawn has learnt.\n\u201cIn its short order on Jan 10, 2023, the LHC had suspended enforcement of the new master plan-2050 approved by the LDA\u2019s governing body in a meeting presided over by the then chief minister Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi. The LHC, during hearing was also of the view that the plan should have been shared with some independent experts or entities for consultation before being approved by the LDA\u2019s governing body. The court, besides suspending the plan with a direction to not implement it, also sought its reviwe by the WWF and the Urban Unit, keeping in view the growing urban issues in the Punjab capital,\u201d a senior LDA official explained while talking to Dawn on Friday.\n\u201cWe are ready to do so, as the authorities concerned have directed us to follow the court order. But the court is yet to issue the detailed judgment. And as soon as we get it, we will engage WWF and the Urban Unit in this regard,\u201d the official requesting anonymity added.\nThe official said that following the court orders, the LDA is entertaining only those applications seeking approval of housing schemes and land subdivisions under the Master Plan 2016.\nTo another question, he said since the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) has also launched a thorough probe into the plan involving ex-CM Elahi and others associated with him in it, the LDA has handed over the relevant record to the bureau officers.\n\u201cWe are also ready to face inquiry if called by the NAB. We will cooperate with the inquiry officers and satisfy them,\u201d he added.\nThe court, while suspending operation of Lahore\u2019s Master Plan 2050 observed in January this year, said the random and aimless development projects of the government had made it difficult for the citizens to breathe. It also termed such projects a threat to the economy of the country.\nThe court suspended the plan\u2019s operation after being told in a petition that the approval of the plan by LDA was clearly a \u201cmanaged affair\u201d and designed to extend undue benefits to the land mafia and land developers. The petition alleged that the LDA miserably failed to consider the devastating impact the plan was likely to have on the already deteriorated environment of Lahore. It also said the Master Plan, which was to define how Lahore division would look like in the coming years, had actually left the people of the city at the whims of land developers, pointing out that the plan envisaged reduction in the green area despite Lahore\u2019s worsening air quality index (AQI) that deteriorated by 10.7 per cent each year, causing pulmonary diseases among its population and burdening the health facilities.\nA couple of days before the LHC hearing and order, an LDA team, led by the then director general Aamir Ahmad Khan, had also held a press conference on January 20 and claimed to have added 33,000 undeveloped acres of brown areas (the land allocated/notified for housing projects) into the green areas in the Lahore Master Plan-2050. According to the team, on the north side of Lahore (Kala Shah Kaku and Muridke sides in Sheikhupura district), the master plan team had taken 27,000 acres out of the undeveloped brown areas and declared them as green ones for agricultural use. Similarly, another 6,000 acres were also taken out of the brown areas along the Bambawala-Ravi-Bedian (BRB) Canal and marked them as green area or the National Strategic Policies in the master plan. The team had also claimed that the area (around 20,000 acres) which had been turned into brown was, in fact, already declared as brown in Master Plan 2004. However, in 2016, it was again declared green.\nMeanwhile, many acres were converted into built-up areas, prompting many people to approach the court over the declaration of brown areas as green ones in 2004. It had also said that some other chunks of land (12,000 acres) that were never considered for brown areas, but required to be made brown keeping in view the increasing demand and growth towards south, were finally added to the brown areas for the first time in the plan 2050.\nOn the other hand, the NAB has launched an investigation into allegations of illegal approval of the plan on Dec 21, last year, leveled against the former chief minister. On April 11, the NAB Lahore also wrote a letter to the LDA director general, asking him to nominate a focal person, conversant with the matters related to the approval of the master plan, to assist the bureau\u2019s combined investigation team in the analysis of the data, reports, surveys and other such documents.\nEarlier, on Dec 30, last year, the new plan had come into force after the LDA notified it for the public at large. The plan envisaged a new city centre in Gulberg and contained details of the city\u2019s future growth/expansion, settlement and plans. The master plan included a regional plan of Lahore Division, as well as master plans of major urban settlements falling within the division. It revealed that in case of the Lahore district, a northern area within district Sheikhupura has been planned to accommodate the growing population.\nFor the three districts of Sheikhupura, Nankana and Kasur, master plans of major urban settlements had been prepared.\nIt also incorporated plans and policies of three other authorities notified by the Punjab government \u2013 Walled City of Lahore Authority, Punjab Central Business Districts Development Authority and Ravi Urban Development Authority.\n"

Around 65pc of reference plots have been harvested and overall 50pc of crop stands harvested: in south, harvesting ratio might have gone beyond 80pc. Though the department has still not calculated the final yield, it should not anyway be less than 20m tonnes. By how much margin, the province crosses 20m tonnes, cannot be said with certainty at this point in time.  \n\nTimely sowing and cooler March being cited main reasons for healthy yield\n\nThe department would be in a better position to assess it after the Eid holidays, when harvesters return to field and the rest of the 9.10 million hectors are harvested, he says confidently.  \nIn the recent meeting of the FCA, the committee had feared 1.6m tonnes loss \u2013 26.81m tonnes of production against 28.40m target \u2013 but it mainly comes from drop in area under the wheat crop, says Muhammad Jawad \u2013 a wheat watcher and trader from the city. Against the target of 9.3 million hectors, the crop was sown only on 9.1m hectors. This loss of 200,000 hectors now translates into losses. Otherwise, the Punjab\u2019s average yield may not be less than last year, which was 30.89 maunds per acre. This season, it may be little up because of timely sowing and crop escaping the heatwave throughout its life cycle, he assures.\nExplaining the loss of areas, Abad Khan, a farmer from the central Punjab, says that wheat has been losing to competing options. Edible oil crops (like sunflower) had outshone it, hogged substantial area and pushed wheat out. This year\u2019s timely wheat sowing was the result of cotton failure last year. With many better performing seed varieties of cotton, the challenge would return to wheat next year. \nHowever, with substantial increase in wheat price, its economic aspect should improve and it should be able to compete with other crops. But, how much it does, only time would tell, he concludes.\nThough the field reports are positive, the Food Department\u2019s policy of suppressing inter-district movement is creating doubt in farmers\u2019 mind that all might not be as good as the Crop Reporting and the Agriculture Department is portraying, describes Muhammad Latif, a farmer from Sheikhupura district. If these reports are true, the Punjab government should have told its Food Department to free the wheat trade and let people enjoy some drop in prices because of abundance of commodity. But, it has not been the case, which leaves different arms of the provincial government behaving differently \u2013 contradicting each other \u2013 and sowing doubts among the farmers. It needs to be checked who is telling the truth and who is not, he demands.\n"

            "Text": "Ever since I mentioned in these columns that the pre-Akbar era can be classified as \u2018ancient\u2019 Lahore, and the following time as merely \u2018old\u2019 Lahore, readers have wished to know which of the ancient \u2018wonders\u2019 remain.\nIt is worth recalling these \u2018wonders\u2019, but allow me the luxury of drawing the timeline to pre and post-700 years. That adds a lot of credence to the list. So in this column let me narrate, very briefly, which are those seven \u2018wonders\u2019 of Ancient Lahore that need reminding.\nThe very oldest monument of Lahore is the Temple of Lava, situated inside the Lahore Fort. Prince Lava was one of two sons of the ruler Rama, call him a \u2018god\u2019 as the Hindus recall him. Lahore or the habitation that emerged on the mounds of Lahore, was named after Lava. His other brother was Kush, after whom Kasur was named. Just to clarify that Lahore was also known by several other names, but Lahore of Lava is the one that prevailed.\nJust one geographic fact needs to be kept in mind. The ground level of the temple equated with that outside the fort. So a safe assumption could be made that the temple was a pre-fort structure. We do know that the Lahore Fort was originally a mud-wall structure, hence the temple was a pre-wall construction.\nOver time it has been worked on many times, but the present structure is an Akbar-era one. The ground level remains the same, which is 25-foot below the inner fort ground level. The exact timeline of the original temple is difficult to gauge. Hence it can safely be assumed as the oldest \u2018ancient\u2019 monument of Lahore.\nNext on the list is Tibbi-wala Shiwala inside Tibbi Bazaar inside Taxali Gate. This again is a pre-Islamic structure whose ground level is \u2018one-and-a-half storeys\u2019 below the existing ground level. Now if we assume one storey to be 12 feet this would mean about 18-20 feet below the current ground level. Just as a measure the Shahi Hammam ground level stands 12 feet below the existing ground level. Mind you in days of old a \u2018storey\u2019 was 15-foot plus, depending on the construction.\nSo just how old is the \u2018shiwala\u2019? This is very difficult to gauge, unless the foundation stones are carbon-dated, which is a pastime our archaeologists do not indulge in. What we do know about this \u2018shiwala\u2019 is that Kanhiya Lal in his book tells us that this ancient structure\u2019s dome matched the outer ground level.\nSo almost 200 years ago this was the observation. We also know that the dome level was raised on the orders of Maharajah Ranjit Singh, who authorised Raja Dina Nath, whose house still exists inside Delhi Gate opposite the mosque of Wazir Khan, to undertake this task. Hence the dome level was slightly raised.\nThird on the \u2018ancient\u2019 list comes the tomb of Ali Makhdum of Hajwer, known better as Data Ganj Bakhsh, or more correctly Abu\u2019l Hasan Ali al Hujweri. He came to Lahore from Ghazni in Afghanistan along with Masud, son of Mahmud, in the year 1039, and died in Lahore in 1072. The original grave of Ali Hajweri is 15 feet below the present ground level. The tomb has been reconstructed several times with a mosque in recent times constructed nearby.\nFourth on our list is the grave of Mahmud\u2019s Georgian white slave Ayaz. This grave, now in the middle of Rang Mahal at the end of Shahalam Bazaar, was originally located outside the ancient mud-walled city in an open space of the \u2018rehra maidan\u2019 to the east of the city. Once Akbar expanded the city with baked-brick walls, it ended up in the middle of the new Akbar-era city.\nNext we move to the fifth monument in our list of seven \u2018wonders\u2019 of the Ancient Lahore. That is the grave of Qutbuddin Aibak, the first slave ruler of Lahore (1194-1205 AD). He died after a horse-fall while playing polo to the south of the ancient city, and was buried at the place where he fell. Today that is part of the Anarkali Bazaar.\nWhen ZA Bhutto came to power he, among his first orders was, to get a tomb built on the grave of Aibak. He gave a press statement that \u201chow could a nation live with its finest ruler lying unknown in a servant quarter off Anarkali Bazaar\u201d. So it was that an impressive tomb was built for Aibak and the road renamed Aibak Road. As a young journalist then at the airport he would invariably ask me about progress on the tomb.\nThen we move on to the famous Niwin Masjid inside Lohari Bazaar near Chowk Matti on Kuchha Dogran. This well-known ancient mosque was first built in 1460 during the Lodi rule of Bahlul Lodi. In the Sikh rule this was one mosque that remained untouched, as it was 25-foot below the ground level. Plus probably as it was a very small mosque barely able to accommodate 100 people, it was considered not of any importance.\nLastly, we must mention the tomb, and much later a mosque, of Pir Sirajuddin of Sheraz. Located inside Lohari Gate in Jaura Mari in Mohallah Pir Sherazi, it represents a 700-year old sage who came to Lahore from Bukhara in the Tughlaq period. The Pir was known for the miracles that he predicted. Very soon he became famous in the city and people flocked to consult him.\nSo we have these seven \u2018ancient\u2019 wonders of Lahore that can still be seen. They are \u2018wonders\u2019 because they have survived the seven terrible massacres and invasions that the city of Lahore has been through, always managing to re-emerge with greater glory.\nAll of these ancient monuments are the least known among our scholars and people of our city. Probably this reflects the level of learning that people have of our wonderful ancient city. Of all our recent past rulers, probably only ZAB worried most about these matters. The others one need not bother about.\n"

            "Text": "LAHORE: The Lahore Development Authority (LDA) and the Metropolitan Corporation of Lahore (MCL) have miserably failed to remove encroachments and clear various major city roads and markets, especially -- Madina Road (Township) and Lower Mall (Aiwan-i-Adl Road ) -- of obstacles, causing a great inconvenience to the public at large as well as serious civic issues, including traffic congestion, dust and noise pollution, parking etc.\nThe situation has worsened as no one from the MCL, district administration and the LDA seems ready to launch a major operation to clear these roads of all sorts of encroachments due to [probable] fear keeping in view some tragic incidents that happened during various operations in the past, Dawn has learnt.\n\u201cMadina Road, perhaps is a very critical point in terms of taking any step in the public interest, as no one dared visit this area after February 2014, the time when a major anti-encroachment operation had been launched and it finally turned into a head-one religious/sectarian fight among the government teams, shopkeepers and clerics due to falling of a street-gate inscribed with the Quranic verses,\u201d said Ikram, a resident of township street linking to Madina Road.\nHe termed the road a most dangerous among all city roads of Lahore, as the shopkeepers foiled all bids of the government during various anti-encroachment operations.\n\nTownship\u2019s Madina Road and Aiwan-i-Adl sorest points in terms of vehicular movement\n\n\u201cThe operations, especially the one conducted in February 2014, led to scuffles among the officials and the shopkeepers, loss of property, injuries to people and giving rise to religious and sectarian issues,\u201d he added.\nAshraf, another resident, said the February 2014 action also triggered hate, leading to day-long protest and setting various trucks, machinery etc, brought there by the government team for operation, on fire.\n\u201cThe officials had also fled reportedly from the scene after the protesters came in front of them to thrash them,\u201d he recalled. He said the encroachers have shrunk the road to half of its total width, making the people unable to even move on foot.\nAccording to him, since no one dared to even launch a minor clean-up operation on this road after 2014, the current situation has become terrible for motorists, shoppers and pedestrians.\n\u201cIt seems the government (LDA teams) has excluded this road from the list of critical areas in terms of encroachment/hurdles,\u201d he said.\nOn the other hand, constant traffic jams at Lower Mall (Aiwan-i-Adl /Civil Secretariat to Kutchery/DC office chowk) due to a huge parking lot made by the lawyers allegedly has been affecting the public at large badly.\n\u201cPassing through the area in front of Aiwan-i-Adal (200 to 300 meters stretch after passing Civil Secretariat) is considered to be an uphill task,\u201d Aslam, a resident of nearby locality, told this reporter.\nTalking to Dawn, MCL\u2019s Chief Officer Ali Abbas Bukhari admitted the facts, stating that the motorists have been facing a great deal of inconvenience due to illegal parking lot developed by lawyers in front of Aiwan-i-Adl.\n\u201cNot only the motorists, the public offices including the commissioner office (now shifted to jail road) too had issues with this parking lot,\u201d he added. He pledged to discuss the issue with the lawyers in a bid to end this parking lot.\n\u201cThe Lahore Parking Company has also proposed two parking plazas near this road,\u201d he said, adding that the parking lot developed by the lawyers should be handed over to the LPC for better management.\nWhen contacted, Lahore Commissioner Muhammad Ali Randhawa, who also holds charge of the office of LDA director general, said a major anti-encroachment operation on all major and small roads would be launched after Eid holidays. \u201cWe are very conscious about this issue, as it affects the public directly. Therefore, we have planned a major operation across Lahore soon after Eid,\u201d he added.\n"

            "Text": "QUETTA: Despite being behind bars, Mahil Baloch continues to appear in the media, making confessional statements.\nThe 27-year-old single mother of two, who belongs to the Gumazi area of Kech district, was arrested by the Counterterrorism Depar\u00adtment (CTD) of Balochistan in March this year.\nAuthorities accused her of being a member of the banned Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF) and alleged that she was planning a suicide attack.\nBut unusually for such a case, the under-custody Mahil has recently been interviewed by a number of media outlets. After the interviews aired, Baloch activists took to social media, terming it a \u201cmedia trial\u201d.\nIn conversations with Dawn, Baloch activists, parliamentarians and rights workers assert that Mahil is being paraded on TV and derided in a bid to rebuke her community, especially women activists, who have been quite vocal about the human rights situation prevailing in Balochistan.\n\nBaloch activists decry televised interviews of arrested woman; CM\u2019s spox claims media appearances meant to placate concerns about her well-being\n\nIn a report recently released by its fact-finding mission, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan observed \u201ca palpable sense of anger among ordinary citizens, many of whom went so far as to refer to Balochistan as a \u2018colony\u2019 of the state during meetings with the organisation\u201d.\nThis situation, the HRCP cautioned, should serve as a wake-up call for the state authorities.\nShakeela Naveed Dehwar, an MPA from BNP-M, has been outspoken inside and outside the Balochistan Assembly on issues confronting women in her province. There is a trace of indignation in her voice while discussing Mahil\u2019s case with Dawn.\n\u201cShe is a poor lady, who has been deliberately brought on media to give a bad name to women activism in the province because women are at the forefront in Balochistan in the protests to recover the missing persons,\u201d she said.\nHowever, Babar Yousafzai, spokesperson for the Balochistan chief minister, told Dawn: \u201cAfter gathering intelligence, our law enforcers arrested Mahil Baloch because she was a potential suicide bomber, who wanted to carry out a suicide attack in Quetta. She has confessed to be so not only in the video but also before a court of law.\u201d\n\u201cAfter being interrogated, she also confessed that her husband was associated with the BLF, which is why she was hired too after being brainwashed,\u201d Mr Yousafzai claimed.\nIn reply to a question as to why the media was allowed to interview Ms Mahil, he said: \u201cAs you know, Balochistan is a tribal society; she was [brought in front of] the media to show that she is fine, and there is no injustice being done to her.\u201d\nNasrullah Baloch, chairman of the Voice for Baloch Missing Persons, told Dawn: \u201cWe have always demanded that Baloch people should not be implicated in bogus cases. They must not be subjected to any illegality until or unless they are found guilty in a court of law.\u201d\nHe suggested that there should be a parliamentary committee, comprising all political parties, to go to Mahil Baloch to hear her out and ascertain whether her statements are being taken under duress or not.\n\u201cBecause what she is facing is against the constitution and against human rights.\u201d\nLike other female activists, Sammi Deen Baloch, the daughter of Dr Deen Mohammad Baloch, has been campaigning for the release of her father and other missing persons since the former went missing from Khuzdar while he was on a night duty at a hospital in the year 2009.\n\u201cMahil was picked up by the CTD from her place, in front of family, while her children were released next day,\u201d Ms Sammi tells Dawn.\nShe claimed that Ms Mahil\u2019s family has not been allowed to meet her.\n\u201cThis is all being done to counter the Baloch female\u2019s activism,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I am pretty sure about is that Mahil\u2019s case is not being looked into as per law, as the law itself says a confessional video recorded in detention is not acceptable,\u201d she pointed out.\nEven MPA Dehwar said that despite being a minister, her attempt to meet Ms Mahil remained fruitless. Habib Tahir, vice chair of HRCP\u2019s Balochistan chapter, while commenting on these claims and counter-claims, said: \u201cUnder these circumstances, there should be an independent commission in the Mahil case as it has become a high-profile matter. Besides, the court should order a neutral, joint investigation into the matter to determine whether she is involved or not.\u201d\nThe recent wave of Baloch women being detained has been going on since Karachi University bombing when Shari Baloch, a 31-year-old mother of two, blew herself up, killing four people, including three Chinese citizens.\n\u201cSince then, Baloch women are being detained, and the case of Mahil Baloch is not a new phenomenon. Being an MPA myself, I am watched with suspicion in Islamabad or elsewhere in the country due to my traditional Balochi clothes,\u201d Ms Dehwar says.\n"

            "Text": " \n\nEnver Baig\n\nISLAMABAD: Enver Baig, an outspoken politician and a former senator, passed away at a hospital here on Friday after a protracted illness.\nHe was 77.\n\u201cMy father is lucky as Allah has called him in the holy month of Ram\u00adazan, on Jumatul Wida, and at the time of Juma pra\u00adyers. I pray for him to be granted the highest ranks in Jannah just like he got the most auspicious day to leave this world,\u201d his eldest son Najeeb Baig told Dawn in a sombre voice.\nAfter spending more than a decade in the PPP, he parted ways with the party in August 2011. Mr Baig, who was once very close to Benazir Bhutto, used to tell his friends that after Ms Bhutto\u2019s tragic death, he was finding it difficult to stay in the party as he was not in the good books of the new leadership, mainly because of his straightforward attitude and bold stance on national issues.\nIn 2012, he joined PML-N, but did not apply for a Senate ticket, fearing there could be resistance within the party as he was a newcomer. However, when PML-N came to power after the 2013 polls, he was appointed chairman of the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP).\nAlthough Mr Baig had developed a good rapport with Nawaz Sharif, other senior leaders never really accepted him in the party.\nAfter serving the BISP for almost a year, Mr Baig resigned, reportedly after developing some differences with a key minister.\nLater, he was appointed chairman of the Pakistan Industrial Development Corpor\u00adation, but according to one of his friends, journalist Rauf Klasra, he did not attend the office for a single day.\nAnother close friend of Mr Baig\u2019s, Wasim Haqqi, told Dawn he was born in Karachi in 1945, and that his father passed away while he was still a young man.\n\u201cEnver joined his grandfather\u2019s business of manpower export \u2014 M/s Jan Muhammad and Brothers \u2014 and remained associated with it till he breathed his last. He was very close friend of veteran PPP leader Makhdoom Amin Faheem, who had introduced him to Ms Bhutto.\u201d\nOn the day Ms Bhutto was assassinated, Enver Baig was in Lahore owing to his son\u2019s wedding. Although, he was not ready to leave Rawalpindi as there was a public meeting on that day, Benazir Bhutto herself suggested he should go to Lahore and attend his son\u2019s wedding, Mr Haqqi recalled.\nFormer Senator Farhatullah Babar termed Mr Baig \u201can outspoken senator, a highly successful businessman, a sports lover and above all a very fine human being\u201d.\n\u201cIn the Senate, he spoke on issues with great clarity and conviction and always seemed well-prepared,\u201d said Mr Babar.\nMr Baig was fond of throwing parties, which made his home a hub of social and political gatherings. As a sport lover, he was keen that sports bodies were governed only by their constitutions and not on personal whims.\nIn 2007, Mr Baig asked the Public Accounts Committee to audit the PCB  and in 2009, he accused the Pakistan cricket players of being involved  in match fixing.\nMr Babar recalled that once Mr Baig moved a privilege motion against the then-chairman of Pakistan Cricket Board when the latter made some remarks in response to criticism of the PCB\u2019s failure in finalising its constitution.\nMr Babar stated that even after leaving the PPP and joining a rival political party, Mr Baig never spoke ill about his old party\u2019s leadership and always wore a smile.\nMr Baig also served as the honorary consul general of Republic of Uruguay as well as president of the Pakistan Overseas Employment Promoters Association. He headed the Senate Standing Committee on Manpower and Overseas Pakistanis and the FPCCI\u2019s Standing Committee on Diplomatic Affairs.\nMr Baig is survived by his widow, Ayesha Enver Baig and seven children \u2014 Najeeb, Ambreen, Nosheen, Naveen, Sameer, Issam and Adnan.\nHe will be laid to rest at the H-11 Graveyard on Saturday (today) at 2pm.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: Findings of a study on women\u2019s work burden and their effects on child labour says the Punjab government has not yet formally recognised the role of women agriculture workers who still do not benefit from legal protection regardless of their contribution to the agricultural labour force.\nThe study, \u2018Gender roles related to work burden and child labour in agriculture in Punjab\u2019, carried out by the Punjab Economic Research Institute with the support of United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), suggested that agricultural policy, extension advisory services, training activities and education strategies should recognise the central role of women in small-scale agriculture and it should be more inclusive. Citing example, it says extension advisory services and training activities should be offered to the entire households rather than only to the males.\nIn the surveyed communities, 69.1 per cent of women reported their primary occupation to be household work (which also includes agricultural work for home consumption such as tending for small ruminants) and 24.3pc reported agricultural labour as their second occupation. On the other hand, 28.7pc of surveyed men indicated they were farmers while 36pc mentioned agricultural labour as their main occupation.\nDuring planting and harvesting seasons, the demand for labour increases and women commonly work from 8 to 10 hours per day in the field on top of the 4 to 5 hours per day they need to perform their households related tasks, the study found.\n\nWomen workers do not benefit from legal protection, says study\n\nGaps in women\u2019s skills are recognised as a major barrier to diversify their roles and undertaking income-generating activities. Focusing in Multan, Bahawalpur and Multan districts, the study found that the provincial government does not offer training opportunities to women on any of the tasks that women are commonly engaged in. \n\u201cThere are no government initiatives to enhance income-generating skills for women working on these small-scale farms.\u201d Resultantly, when demands for paid skilled agriculture labour are high, men are preferred over the women, due to their skills and knowledge, the study points out.\nIt recommended that agriculture policies should be reviewed with a gender lens to engage more women in agriculture extension services, input supply, and access to finance, among others. There is a need to build rural women\u2019s capacities for increased participation across the crop value chain. The public and private sectors should offer tailor-made financial products for rural women.\nSchool curricula should include more content on good agricultural practices for small-scale farming. More women should be employed by agro dealer shops to encourage women farmers to visit the shop for crop related transactions.\nThe study suggested that enabling women to organise themselves will help in building social cohesion in rural communities and empowering women to invest in small businesses. The public and private sectors should support the establishment and strengthening of organised farmer groups, such as cooperatives and associations to streamline the women\u2019s participation.\nThere is need to address some of the key gender based constraints and their impact on child labour in these rural communities, policies and strategies. This would require strengthening parenting and community education initiatives to address harmful practices and social norms that perpetuate child labour, while collaborating with national and local governments to prevent exploitation and abuse.\nNational and provincial policies and strategies need to support increased access to quality education and provide comprehensive services to keep children educated, informed and protected. Smallholders, including tenant farmers and sharecroppers, require special attention from policymakers for improved rural extension and advisory services, farmer training, resources, information, and organised platforms for voicing their needs.\n"

He claimed that 3,500 PTI workers were arrested and added differences between the government and opposition continued to increase because of the \u201csenseless violence\u201d.\n\u201cWe have connections with each other, we are parliamentarians and we meet each other and we can have some sort of negotiations with them but it is not possible when such violence is being inflicted upon us,\u201d he said, urging the government to lower political temperature to kick start talks.\nSpeaking about the April 27 deadline set by the SC, PTI stalwart Shah Mehmood Qureshi told media persons that the courts have given a date and \u201cwhatever we have to do, we have to do it\u201d without jumping the deadline. \nHe, however, added that the developments in court would be discussed with the party its chief. \u201cWe will return after discussing it with our leader,\u201d he said.\nConcern over verdicts\nOn the other hand, Railways Minister Saad Rafique expressed reservations over previous court decisions, saying that consultation among allied parties in the government was underway to resolve the issue. \nA decision has not been reached on whether to pursue legal recourse or explore alternative avenues to address the matter, APP quoted him as saying in a media talk outside the Supreme Court.\nThe minister noted that any deviation from holding elections simultaneously in all four federating units and the federal capital could have severe implications and complicated issues. According to Mr Rafique, timely and synchronised elections across the country were key to maintaining national unity as per civil society organisations and the Election Commission of Pakistan.\nHe added that the government had submitted its point of view on the application given by a citizen requesting simultaneous provincial and federal elections.\n\u2018Elections for all\u2019\nMeanwhile, Jamaat-i-Islami leader Sirajul Haq said the Pakistan Democratic Movement and the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf were poles apart, but elections were not limited to these two players alone.\n\u201cEvery party has a point of view but the election is for everyone. I told the SC and the CJ that the ball that they have kept with themselves should be given to the politicians so that they can decide when and where the elections should take place,\u201d he told media persons.\n\u201cOur advice is that the Centre and provinces should have a caretaker government because if PDM at the Centre then fair polls would not take place,\u201d he added. In case, the Punjab elections take place on May 14 and a new government comes to power and conducts general elections, even then elections will not be transparent, he added.\n"

If the PML-N had any doubts, they would have certainly awarded tickets to its candidates, the source added.\n\u201cThe Sharifs think that even if the SC sticks to its decision to hold the Punjab elections on May 14 after the failure of political parties to reach a consensus on the same-day polls for all provincial and national assemblies, the federal coalition with the help of the powers-that-be would find a way to achieve its target,\u201d he claimed.\nA federal cabinet member told Dawn that the ruling coalition was ready for any sacrifice to forestall elections that were being held only in \u2018one province\u2019.\n\u201cAlthough PML-N leaders and former lawmakers have submitted their nomination papers for the May 14 polls, party Quaid Nawaz Sharif and others have decided not to award tickets to the aspirants to give a clear message to the apex court that PML-N does not accept its decision,\u201d he said.\nThe PML-N, however, has not boycotted the elections as it has not asked its candidates to withdraw their papers.\nPML-N chief organiser Maryam Nawaz and PM Shehbaz Sharif\u2019s son Hamza Shehbaz are in the run. Ms Nawaz is contesting on four seats while Mr Hamza on three.\n\u2018Big coward\u2019\nReacting to the PML-N\u2019s decision on tickets, PTI chief Imran Khan termed Nawaz Sharif a \u201cbig coward\u201d, saying the \u201cabsconder\u201d was leading a party of cowards.\n\u201cSeeing its defeat \u2018written on the wall\u2019, the Sharifs and PDM are running away from elections,\u201d Mr Khan said while talking to supporters during Iftar on Thursday.\nMeanwhile, PTI central president Chaudhry Parvez Elahi said PML-N had lost its respect and worth among the masses by keeping away from the May 14 elections.\nMr Elahi was speaking at a meeting with former federal minister Chaudhry Wajahat Hussain, Overseas Pakistanis Hong Kong president Chaudhry Gulzar Mohammad, former Lahore Bar president Asim Cheema, Chaudhry Akram and former minister Muhammad Akram at his residence.\nMr Elahi said PML-N is running away from elections just to save itself from a humiliating defeat at the hands of people.\nLashing out at the Sharifs\u2019 decision not to award the party tickets, he observed that PML-N wanted to create an undemocratic process in the country.\nThe PTI president said PDM was ready for negotiations on the Supreme Court\u2019s order but not prepared to hold elections.\n\u201cIf incompetent rulers do not give up their stubbornness, the consequences can be serious,\u201d he cautioned and added that political parties never closed doors of negotiations.\nMr Elahi declared that Pakistan\u2019s politics was incomplete without Imran Khan and asserted that PDM would have to negotiate with Imran Khan in any case. He said everyone needed to find a safe way for the welfare of people.\nMeanwhile, PTI leader Dr Yasmin Rashid said that those PTI aspirants who did not get party tickets for Punjab Assembly elections should work to play their role in the National Assembly and local government elections.\n"

Besides, the facility ended in March 2021, he said.\nTherefore, the statement by the PAC chairman \u201cis misleading and inappropriate\u201d, Mr Tarin said.\nHis rebuttal came after the Public Accounts Committee, which oversees government spending, on Wednesday demanded a list of the 600 business people who were reportedly issued around $3bn loans from commercial banks at zero markups during the Covid-19 pandemic under the PTI government.\n\u201cUnder which laws were these 600 individuals issued these loans?\u201d the committee chairman asked during a meeting held at the Parliament House.\nThe committee was informed that banks offered these loans at concessionary rates during the pandemic.\nThe facility was aimed at encouraging investment during the economic slump caused by the spread of the coronavirus.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The Health Inequ\u00adality Data Repository (HIDR), laun\u00adched by World Health Organisation (WHO), shows that in just a decade, the rich-poor gap in health service coverage among women, newborns and children in low- and middle-income countries has nearly halved.  \nThe report also revealed that in these countries eliminating wealth-related inequality in under-five mortality could help save the lives of 1.8 million children. \nIn high-income countries, hypertension is more common among men than women and obesity rates are similar among men and women. By contrast, in low-income countries, hypertension rates are similar amo\u00adng women and men, but obesity rates are higher among women than men.\nThe HIDR is the most comprehensive global collection of publicly available disaggregated data and evidence on population health and its determinants. The repository allows for tracking health inequalities across population groups and over time by breaking down data according to group characteristics, ranging from education level to ethnicity. \n\nUnicef says Covid-19 has disrupted childhood immunisation\n\nAccording to a statement issued by WHO, the HIDR includes nearly 11 million data points and consists of 59 data sets from over 15 sources. The data includes measurements of over 2000 indicators broken down by 22 dimensions of inequality, including demographic, socioeconomic and geographical factors.  \nTopics covered include the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); Covid-19; reproductive, maternal and child health; immunisation; HIV; tuberculosis; malaria; nutrition; health care; non-communicable diseases and environmental health. \n\u201cThe ability to direct services to those who need them the most is vital to advancing health equity and improving lives. Designed as a one-stop-shop for data on health inequality, the Repository will help us move beyond only counting births and deaths, to disaggregating health data according to sex, age, education, region and more,\u201d said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. \u201cIf we are truly committed to leaving no one behind, we must figure out who is being missed.\u201d  \nReleasing the HIDR, WHO has called on countries to adopt routine health inequality monitoring, make disaggregated data publicly available, expand data collection and increase capacity for analysis and reporting.  \nCovid-19 disrupts immunisation\nUnicef has warned that the Covid-19 pandemic has severely disrupted childhood immunisation, with 67 million children are missing out entirely or partially on routine immunisation between 2019 and 2021, leaving them vulnerable to a range of preventable diseases.  \nIn a report titled, State of the World\u2019s Children Report released on Thursday, Unicef says with vaccination coverage levels decreasing in 112 countries, children born just before or during the pandemic are now moving past the age when they would normally be vaccinated, underscoring the need for urgent action to catch up on those who were missed and prevent deadly disease outbreaks. \n\u201cRight now, far too many children across the world are not getting the vaccines they need to protect them against death and serious disease,\u201d the report notes. \nIt says that one in five children worldwide are now zero-dose or under-vaccinated, meaning they have missed out entirely or partially on routine immunisation. Those are levels we have not seen since 2008.  \nZero-dose children are those who have not received their first diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus vaccine (DTP1). Under-vaccinated children are those who received one dose, but not a third protective dose.  \nThe report says diseases are now reappearing in countries where they had previously been controlled. Meanwhile, surges of cases in nations that had not yet eliminated the diseases are also seen. Those include cholera, measles and polio outbreaks. \nRegions of East Africa, the Middle East and South Asia, that hadn\u2019t experienced large-scale outbreaks in over a decade, were impacted. \nMore than three out of four of the world\u2019s zero-dose children live in 20 countries. They live in the remotest of rural areas, urban slums, crisis-affected regions, and migrant and refugee communities. These children urgently need to be reached with vaccines. \nThe Covid-19 pandemic has been a disaster for childhood immunisation, but even before the pandemic, the warning signs were there.  \nThe report has urged governments to urgently identify and reach all children, especially those who missed vaccinations during the Covid-19 pandemic; strengthen demand for vaccines, including by building confidence; prioritise funding to immunisation services and primary health care; and build resilient health systems through investment in female health workers, innovation and local manufacturing.\n"

Separate meetings of the zonal and district moon-sighting committees were also held at their provincial headquarters in Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar and Quetta.\n\u201cThe sky was partially cloudy in some parts of the country, including Islam\u00adabad and we have been in contact with all the zonal committees. However, no information regarding the sighting of the Shawwal moon has been received from any part of Pakis\u00adtan,\u201d Maulana Azad said.\n\u201cIt was unanimously decided that the first of Shawwal will be on April 22,\u201d he said. Shortly after the announcement was made, the Ministry of Religious Affairs issued a notification stating that Shawwal 1, 1444 AH, would begin on Saturday.\nSeparately, an unofficial moon-sighting committee headed by Mufti Shahabuddin Popalzai met in Peshawar and concurred that the moon had not been sighted and therefore Eid would be celebrated on Saturday.\nEarlier on Thursday, the Pakistan Meteoro\u00adlogical Department said there was no chance of moon sighting on Thursday.  The government has announced a five-day holiday for Eid from April 21 to 25. \nMeanwhile, Eidul Fitr in Saudi Arabia will be celebrated on Friday (today), the official Saudi Press Agency said on its Twitter account, citing a royal court statement.\n"

The policeman along with some civilians was injured.\nTayyab\u2019s death took the number of the police personnel martyred in Swabi during Ramazan to three. Earlier, an assistant sub-inspector and another policeman were martyred when militants lobbed a grenade on their vehicle in Yar Hussain Bazaar.\nThe funeral prayers of the martyred constable were held at Shahmansoor police lines. \nDistrict police officer Najamul Hassain, politicians, relatives and local people in large numbers attended the funeral.\nA police team saluted the coffin of the martyred cop. Later, his body was dispatched to his native Shewa village, where he was laid to rest with full official honour.\nDPO Najamul Hassain paid rich tribute to the fallen policeman, saying Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police continued to render tremendous sacrifices for protection of the motherland.\nARRESTED: DSP headquarters Jawad Khan said on Friday the police had arrested a robber, namely Abdur Rehman, who had been looting people at gunpoint for quite some time.\nThe DSP also shared a video of Abdur Rehman with reporters, in which he purportedly admits having looted about 30 people since 2022. He also admitted that he had also looted cash from people coming out of ATMs.\nExplaining his modus operandi, the robber said he would give lift to people on his motorcycle, taken them to a secluded place and loot them at gunpoint.\nASSISTANCE SOUGHT: The differently-abled people on Friday complained despite their repeated demands no one came forward to give them special Eid packages this year.\nSpeaking at a meeting here, Rehman Sher, president of Khidmt-i-Mazooran, said special people could not work and had to depend totally on others to make both ends meet amid the record inflation. He said such people deserved assistance to help them celebrate Eidul Fitr like other people.\nHe said the differently-abled people hoped that like previous years non-government organisations, the government and philanthropists would help them financially, but to no avail. \n"

This is an attack on our resources,\u201d he said.\nMr Kundi said that the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz had \u201cpushed him to the wall\u201d and therefore, he would decide his future course of action soon.\n"

He said the leaseholders were resisting the TMA bid to re-auction its properties and fix rent as per the market rate.\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity, the official told Dawn that the TMA had no concrete policy to charge the leaseholders as per the rates prevalent in the market.\nThe official said the first 33-year lease period had expired 1988. In the first auction, the leaseholders were to pay an annual lump sum rent of a few hundred rupees with a 30 per cent increase every three years. He added that the second auction was made in 1988, whereby 10 per cent annual increase was to be paid by the leaseholders with nominal annual rents.\nThe official said the third auction had been pending since 2021, adding the occupants of 600 shops were now paying only Rs7,000 to Rs15,000 per annum. He said the open market rent of a shop in Kohat was Rs30,000 per month.\nThe official said the leaseholders had also not paid premiums at the time of the auctions.\nHowever, he said the owners of newly-auctioned shops and plazas were paying Rs5,700 monthly rent after having a premium of Rs3 million.\nHe also claimed some TMA leaseholders had sub-let shops for Rs35,000 per month, but the municipal body overlooked it.\nHe said after the 1955 auction, the leaseholders paid rent annually, while the rent was paid monthly by the leaseholders under the 1988 auction.\nMeanwhile, sources confided to Dawn that TMA staff received bribes from leaseholders to put off the re-auction of shops and plazas.\nThey said the occupants of the plots were not vacating the shops on the pretext that they had constructed shops by selling their jewellery.\nNADRA CENTRE: Social, political circles and students have assailed the authorities for shifting the Nadra facilitation centre from the Old Bus Stand area to the Bacha Khan library and sealing its two halls for the purpose.\nSocial activists Pir Shah Nawaz, Majid Falook Advocate and others said libraries needed complete silence so that people could study there with full concentration.\nThey said the decision would deprive the readers of a calm environment to study and a good source of learning.\nThey threatened to move the Peshawar High Court against the decision.\n"

            "Text": "PESHAWAR: The State Life Insurance Corporation (SLIC) has restored free healthcare services on Sehat Card Plus after their suspension for 24 hours over non-payment of dues to it by the caretaker government.\nThe resumption of services was notified after payment of Rs2 billion to the insurance company, prompting the insurer to ask the empanelled hospitals to resume the services immediately and start hospitalisation of patients under Sehat Card Plus programme.\nOn Wednesday, the insurance company had issued instructions to all the hospitals to suspend free health services under the programme immediately.\nSpeaking at a news conference, Prof Abid Jameel, the adviser on health to caretaker chief minister, said that Rs2 billion was paid to the insurance firm and a similar amount would be given to it after Eidul Fitr.\n\u201cOwing to non-payment of Rs238 billion dues to the provincial government by the centre, the province is facing difficulties including suspension of Sehat Card Plus scheme. The issue has been brought into the notice of chief minister. Our government had no intension to do away with the free health insurance scheme,\u201d he said.\n\nThe health card scheme was suspended over non-payment of dues to SLIC\n\nHowever, he said that they had planned to bring improvement in the scheme so that people could receive quality services.\nProf Abid, a former head of oncology department at Hayatabad Medical Complex, said that nowhere in the world 100 per cent population received free health services. There would be no financial issues in the province if the cashless treatment facilities were provided only to deserving people, he added.\nHe said that so far, 66 per cent patients received free services in private hospitals and 34 per cent in public sector health facilities. Some of the private hospitals were not eligible to be empanelled for SCP but the former government included those facilities in the programme, he said.\nProf Abid said that the caretaker government was considering solid measures to make the services on SCP more transparent. \u201cFor this purpose a committee comprising the officials of health department and healthcare commission will be tasked to carry out inspections of the empanelled hospitals and decide about their eligibility,\u201d he added.\nEarlier, former provincial health minister Taimur Khan Jhagra criticised the caretaker setup for suspending the programme and said that SCP started by the PTI government was benefitting 120,000 people per month.\n\u201cThere is no issue of money but the government hasn\u2019t paid any instalment to the insurance company during the past two months, which led to suspension of the programme,\u201d he said. He added that the caretaker government distributed substandard wheat flour worth Rs20 billion among people without any lawful authorisation but it could not give Rs4 billion to the company to keep the programme going.\nMr Jhagra said that the caretakers should stay away from taking policy decisions. He warned them of drastic consequences if they continued intervention in policy matters.\nHe said that SCP was legally protected. He said that province\u2019s total budgetary outlay was Rs1300 billion and only Rs30 billion was the annual expenditure of SCP.\n\u201cThe caretakers, who should be neutral, are bent upon taking the facilities from the poor people,\u201d said the former minister. He said that the PDM government stopped free health services in Punjab when Maryam Nawaz asked Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to do so.\nHe said that the caretakers left aside their constitutional duty of holding free and fair elections and started indulging in matters that didn\u2019t come in their domain.\n"

            "Text": "SWABI: The consumers in Topi tehsil headquarters on Thursday staged a protest demonstration against the butchers for overcharging them and violating the official price list.\nThey said that butchers continued to fleece people during the entire month of Ramazan and the district administration officials were reluctant to take action against them.\nThey chanted slogans against the officials and butchers. They said that official rate of beef was Rs500 per kilogram. They said that Utman Jirga members allowed butchers to sell beef at Rs550 but they were selling it at Rs700 per kilogram on Wednesday across the district. They added that butchers increased the price to Rs800 per kilogram on Thursday that enraged the consumers.\nThe protesters said that officials were not taking action against butchers for fleecing people. They said that the administration should ensure sale of meat at official rate across the district.\nFazal Khaliq, president of Utman Jirga, said that they made efforts but butchers were not ready to listen to them because they knew that the administration was not ready to take action against them.\nIMPOUNDED: Police impounded about 300 motorcycles here on Thursday for not having registration numbers.\nDPO Najamul Hussain told journalists that they launched a campaign against unregistered motorcycles to prevent street crimes and incidents of terrorism in the district. \u201cAs a responsible citizen, get a number plate for your motorcycle and register it as soon as soon possible,\u201d he asked people.\nThe DPO also visited Tarbela to review security of China camp at Tarbela Dam on Thursday.\nHe visited the camp and various checkpoints. He was accompanied by DSP Roshan Zeb Khan and other officers. \u201cI have reviewed the measures taken for security and instructed the officials and security personnel to be more alert and vigilant,\u201d he said.\nHe directed the police officials to use jackets and helmets during duty hours. He also checked the recording of CCTV cameras installed at the checkpoints.\n"

            "Text": "KARACHI: When Sarfraz Ahmed, Pakistan\u2019s former captain, took to the pitch of the Jinnah Government College cricket ground years ago during his student life, the outfield was dusty and uneven. He batted on a cemented wicket, conditions so poor that spectators would park their motorcycles beyond the boundary ropes and sit on them to watch the action.\nSarfraz remains the most high profile cricketer the college has produced. The man who led Pakistan to the Champions Trophy in 2017, and staged a Test comeback earlier this year, forged a career playing on an inadequate college ground. As did his college and eventual Pakistan team-mate Anwar Ali. In 2006, the duo were part of the Pakistan side that won the U-19 World Cup; Sarfraz the skipper and fast bowler Anwar the player-of-the-final.\n\u201cI played club level as well as college-level matches from 2003-2004 in the college ground,\u201d Sarfraz told Dawn. \u201cAnd I will always remember the role this ground played in my career even through its condition was deplorable.\u201d Not anymore though.\nThe ground has been transformed, now sporting a lush green outfield and a turf pitch. A boundary wall has been erected with proper sitting arrangements now in place for those who want to witness the action.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a very different feel now,\u201d reflected Anwar, while talking to Dawn. \u201cWe played for our college whenever we got the opportunity but during our time here, there wasn\u2019t even a dugout for the players, let alone a dressing room.\u201d\nIt was due to the efforts of the college\u2019s Director Physical Education, Professor Wasim Majid Rizvi, that the ground has been revived. Prof Rizvi told Dawn that he\u2019d been trying to get the ground restoration approved by the government for the best part of a decade.\n\u201cI joined the college in 1992 and noticed that the cricket ground was the largest in any of the educational institutions in Karachi,\u201d said Prof Rizvi. \u201cThat was my motivation to develop it as there were better grounds in other institutions.\n\u201cThen, our cricket team had been dominating the Inter-College tournaments so why not give them facilities to do even better,\u201d he added, noting that apart from Sarfraz and Anwar, other former Pakistan Test cricketers namely Saleem Yousuf, Hasan Raza and Mohsin Hamid had also featured for the college\u2019s cricket team.\n\u201cThe college has a legacy of producing good cricketer,\u201d notes Professor Tariq Salahuddin, who heads the sports committee at Jinnah College and had been actively involved in the construction work at the cricket ground. The restoration work has cost Rs40million but Prof Tariq believes that it will pay off with the emergence of cricket talent.\nEarlier this year, Jinnah College won the Pakistan event of Red Bull Campus Cricket and are now set to represent the country at the world finals for a third time, having also triumphed in the nationals in 2015 and 2017. On both occasions, the team couldn\u2019t go far, their only win at the world finals coming in 2017.\nBut the difference this time around is the fact that the team has a proper ground to prepare for the world finals.\n\u201cThe college\u2019s ground is helping us a lot now during our training and practice sessions,\u201d Fahdis Bukhari, the captain of Jinnah College\u2019s present side, told Dawn. \u201cNow we can practice regularly and through proper training we would increase our strength and hopefully put up a winning show at the world finals.\u201d\nFor the college\u2019s illustrious alumnus like Sarfraz, the new facility should be a springboard for greater success.\n\u201cI hope that the ground is maintained in the future so that new players from college teams can play here and benefit from it,\u201d said Sarfraz.\n"

            "Text": "TOKYO: The former chairman of a Tokyo 2020 Olympics sponsor was handed a suspended prison sentence on Friday along with two others, in the first convictions in a spiralling bribery scandal surrounding the event.\nCorruption allegations have mushroomed in the aftermath of the pandemic-delayed Games, implicating major companies and damaging Japan\u2019s bid to host the 2030 Winter Olympics in Sapporo.\nHironori Aoki, the 84-year-old ex-head of high-street business suit retailer Aoki Holdings, received a suspended prison term of two and a half years, a Tokyo District Court spokesman told AFP.\nAoki pleaded guilty in December to accusations that he and two colleagues bribed a Tokyo 2020 board member to secure sponsorship rights, according to Japanese media.\n\u201cThese criminal acts damaged social trust in the fair operation of the Games, which attracted world attention and were important for the country,\u201d judge Kenji Yasunaga said Friday in comments reported by Jiji Press.\nAoki, who had instructed a colleague at the time to destroy evidence,  \u201cwanted to pursue the interests of his company\u201d, the judge said.\nProsecutors had sought immediate jail for the businessman, but instead the court handed down Friday\u2019s sentence, suspended for four years.\nAoki Holdings was an official partner of the 2020 Olympics \u2014 which were held largely without spectators in 2021 because of Covid \u2014 allowing the firm to use the event\u2019s logo and sell officially licensed products.\nAoki was arrested in August along with two ex-colleagues and former Tokyo 2020 board member Haruyuki Takahashi.\nThe two ex-colleagues also received suspended jail sentences on Friday, one for a year and the other for 18 months. Takahashi, who is facing several separate bribery charges, has reportedly pleaded not guilty.\nTakahashi allegedly recei\u00adved $380,000 which he understood to be  \u201cthank-you money for the beneficial and preferential treatment\u201d of Aoki Holdings, according to prosecution documents.\nAn Aoki Holdings spokeswoman told AFP:  \u201cWe take the ruling seriously and will do our utmost to prevent a recurrence and regain trust from our customers.\u201d\nOther parties involved in bribery allegations include a major publishing firm and a merchandise company licensed to sell soft toys of the Games\u2019 mascots.\nThe former president of ADK Holdings, Japan\u2019s third-largest advertising agency, has pleaded guilty to offering Takahashi over $100,000.\nMeanwhile, in a separate strand of allegations, senior Tokyo 2020 organising committee official Yasuo Mori and three others have been arrested on suspicion of rigging a string of Games-related tenders.\nAnd in February, Japan\u2019s biggest adv\u00adertising agency, Dentsu Group, was indi\u00adcted along with five other companies for allegedly violating an anti-monopoly law.\nAs investigations continue, the country\u2019s Olympic chief warned this month that Japan could push its Winter Olympics bid back four years to 2034.\nJapanese Olympic Commi\u00adttee president Yasuhiro Yam\u00ada\u00ad\u00adshita said it would be  \u201cdifficult to move ahead without gaining people\u2019s understanding\u201d following the scandals.\nThe allegations are not the first time questions have been raised about alleged impropriety around Tokyo 2020, which took place during a Covid state of emergency and against the backdrop of public anger. The then-head of Japan\u2019s Olympic Committee, Tsune\u00adkazu Takeda, stepped down in 2019 as French authorities probed his alleged involvement in payments.\n"

            "Text": "LAHORE: While the tenure of Pakistan Cricket Board\u2019s Interim Management Committee stood expired on Friday, no decision was taken by the board\u2019s patron-in-chief Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif by the filing of this report to provide clarity about the Committee\u2019s future.\nThere was lack of response from the premier\u2019s office in spite of it receiving two summaries from the Ministry of Inter-provincial Coordination; the first requesting the patron to appoint two nominees to run for the elections of PCB chairman post and the other seeking a two-four week extension in the Committee\u2019s tenure.\nThe Najam Sethi-led Interim Management Committee was formed in December last year following instructions from the prime minister\u2019s office, which saw former PCB chairman Ramiz Raja ousted and the board\u2019s 2019 constitution revoked and replaced by the 2014 charter.\nThe PM Office back then had defined a four-month tenure for the Management Committee, two months less than what the current constitution requires in case of dissolution of the body\u2019s Board of Governors.\nThe confusion over Sethi and his Management Committee\u2019s legality, however, is unlikely to prolong and it\u2019s likely to be granted its due extension of two months required to complete the elections at the district level and in the remaining seven out of a total of 16 regions.\nDawn understands that the Board of Governors will be constituted within the next two weeks with a good number of departments committed to form their teams according to the 2014 constitution \u2014 in which departments and regions form domestic cricket structure.\nOnce the Board of Governors is complete, four elected presidents of the regions and as many departments affiliated with the PCB cast their votes to elect PCB chairman\n\u201cIt is not a big issue even if the prime minister announces his two nominees for the Board of Governors as it will be formed most probably by the first week of May,\u201d a source close to the situation told Dawn on Friday.\n\u201cSome forty-three small and big departments have already restored their [cricket] teams and there is no big issue remaining in completing the Board of Governors in the next two weeks,\u201d he added.\nDuring Imran Khan\u2019s reign as the prime minister from 2018 to 2022, the PCB adopted the 2019 constitution, which saw departments and regions replaced by six provincial association sides. Imran had also instructed departments to close down their sport wings, which led to many athletes lose their jobs.\nSince Shehbaz took office after Imran\u2019s ouster through a no-confidence vote in April last year, the incumbent PM revoked his predecessor\u2019s move to restore departments in sports and eventually instructed the restoration of PCB\u2019s 2014 constitution.\n"

            "Text": "LONDON: Conor Benn has been provisionally suspen\u00added from boxing and charged over the alleged use of a prohibited substance, UK Anti-Doping announced on Thursday.\nA catchweight bout against British rival Chris Eubank Jr scheduled for October last year was cancelled after trace amounts of women\u2019s fertility drug, clomifene, which elevates testosterone levels in men, were found in Benn\u2019s urine.\nBenn had denied intentionally or knowingly ingesting any banned substances.\nIn February, the World Boxing Council cleared Benn of a doping offence after it ruled a  \u201chighly elevated consumption of eggs\u201d constituted a  \u201creasonable explanation\u201d for his positive finding.\nBut this week Boxing News reported that Benn had been provisionally suspended, prompting an angry response from the 26-year-old on Twitter.\nUKAD said Thursday that its standard policy was not to publicly disclose that an athlete had been charged or provisionally suspended before a charge had  \u201cbeen resolved\u201d.\nBut a spokesman said there were  \u201climited and rare examples\u201d where it would deviate from that.\n\u201cFollowing reports in the media and comments made by professional boxer Mr Conor Benn on Tuesday April 18, 2023, and in exceptional circumstances, UK Anti-Doping confirms that Mr Benn was notified and provisionally suspended by UKAD on March 15, 2023 in accordance with the UK Anti-Doping Rules,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\u201cWhilst provisionally suspended Mr Benn is prohibited from participating in any capacity (or assisting another athlete in any capacity) in a competition, event or activity that is organised, convened, authorised or recognised by the British Boxing Board of Control or any other World Anti-Doping Code-compliant sport.\u201d UKAD also confirmed that it charged Benn on April 3 with a violation for the alleged use of clomifene.\nBenn tweeted on Thursday:  \u201cAnother day, another attempt to create a headline with my name...I have respected my confidentiality obligations. Yet each day brings a new leak and a misrepresentation of what\u2019s actually happening.\n\u201cI have not been sanctioned by anyone & I\u2019m not banned from boxing. I remain free to fight in events that are not sanctioned by the BBBoC. I don\u2019t even have a BBBoC licence.\u201d\nOctober\u2019s proposed bout was intended to be a continuation of the Benn v Eubank feud in which the rivals\u2019 fathers \u2014 Nigel Benn and Chris Eubank \u2014 battled it out in two ferocious contests in the early 1990s.\nA catchweight of 157 pounds (71.2 kilograms) was agreed for the fight, meaning Benn would have had to move up two weight divisions and Eubank lose three pounds.\n"

            "Text": "RAWALPINDI: After months of speculation, Mickey Arthur has finally arrived. \nThe former Pakistan head coach has returned to the men\u2019s national team setup in a directorial role and seems to be clear about his goals in his second stint. Building match-winners is what the South African will be focused on.\nIn this role, according to a Pakistan Cricket Board press release, Arthur will be involved in \u201cdesigning, formulating and overseeing strategies\u201d for the Pakistan team.\nThe 54-year-old will not be available to accompany the national squad in person for most of his time given his ongoing contract with English County side Derbyshire. \nThe coach, however, will be a part of the coaching staff for this year\u2019s ICC Men\u2019s Cricket World Cup, Pakistan\u2019s tour to Australia and the home series against the West Indies. He will also be present with the side for Pakistan\u2019s matches against India in the Asia Cup this year.\nArthur has brought together support staff of his own choice, which is being lead by head coach Grant Bradburn and comprises of batting coach Andrew Puttick \u2014 both already with the national side \u2014 and bowling coach Morne Morkel, who is set to join later.\n\u201cThey say Pakistan stays in your blood; it definitely stays in your blood,\u201d Arthur said during a press conference here at the Pindi Cricket Stadium on Thursday. \u201cI always knew there was a time that I was very emotionally attached to this cricket team, very emotionally attached to this country. \u201cIt\u2019s a privilege for me; in fact, to come back and help, hopefully win a World Cup, get us to number one in the world in all formats of the game because we certainly got the talent, certainly got the players.\u201d\nClearly excited to be back with the players he worked with the in his stint as the Pakistan head coach from 2016 to 2019, Arthur said he was looking to churn out the best out of the now superstars in the likes of captain Babar Azam, Shaheen Shah Afridi and Shadab Khan.\nThe former Australia coach, however, is also a believer in creating competition for places, which, he said, would always keep the top players on their toes.\n\u201cThe challenge is to keep pushing them, the challenge is to challenge them to everyday become better players,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only better players, but match-winners for Pakistan. \n\u201cBut it\u2019s also very good to bring in some young players because in a team dynamic and as a team evolves, you need to have those young players pushing the senior players for places, and that\u2019s how you build a healthy team environment.\u201d \nArthur believed the environment was required to get the best out of what he called \u201cthe talent second to none\u201d; winning World Cups and achieving top spots across all three formats.\n\u201cI looked at the team last night when did a presentation to our players, he said.  \u201cThe talent in that dressing room is second to none. \n\u201cYou look around in that room, we\u2019ve got a talent to win a World Cup, we\u2019ve got a talent to be number one in the world in all formats and that\u2019s going to be the challenge off late down to the blokes.\u201d \nThere were concerns over Arthur being appointed in an \u201conline\u201d role and eyebrows were raised over the coach\u2019s limited availability. Arthur was of the view that the remote nature of the job will have no affect on his performance whatsoever.\n\u201cFirst of all, there is no such thing like an online coach, he said. \u201cYou build relationships with the players, you know exactly what the players require and you give it to them. \n\u201cIn the last five years I\u2019ve watched every game Pakistan have played virtually on television. I know the players backwards; I know exactly what they are thinking technically. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve already spoken over the last couple of days with our players. I know exactly what they need; I know what they are required to be successful. I also know what\u2019s required to be successful in terms of leading a team.\u201d\nArthur was confident that in his absence, his support staff will deliver at the top level.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got an incredible support staff that we\u2019ve put together, he observed. \u201cThe support staffs are very trustworthy, very honourable but very, very good cricket coaches. \n\u201cUnder my guidance, the players are going to get the best possible coaching available but also, I\u2019m giving them a very clear path and a very clear direction.\u201d \nSETHI DEFENDS CHOICE\nThe PCB\u2019s interim Management Committee chairman Najam Sethi wanted no one else but Arthur on board as Saqlain Mushtaq\u2019s replacement as the Pakistan head coach since the former took office earlier this year. And Sethi\u2019s vision materialised, although in a slightly different setting.\nSethi, despite having to go through extended negotiations with Arthur to rope the coach in, did not relent under pressure to consider local coaches over foreigners.\nHaving worked with Arthur when he was the PCB chairman back in 2016, Sethi backed his man again, calling him a \u201ctop professional\u201d, while also expressing his reluctance to trust coaches that have worked in the domestic system.  \n\u201cI am of the view and have experienced it as well, that by and large, the professionalism of foreign coaches is that of high-quality and it has no room for culture-related issues and likes and dislikes, he admitted. \u201cThey are focused on the job and goal-oriented. \n\u201cWe are competing against the top professional sides in the world that have employed top professional coaches. We too should then get the services of the top professional coaches and display top professionalism. \n\u201cBy saying this I don\u2019t mean that there are no professional coaches in Pakistan, but generally speaking, at some point or the other, they end up getting influenced by cultural issues.\u201d \n\u2018PAKISTAN MAY TRAVEL TO INDIA\u2019\nMeanwhile, Sethi conceded that Pakistan may well travel to India for the World Cup despite the ongoing deadlock between the PCB and its counterpart across the border over the matter.\nAfter the Board of Control for Cricket in India straightforwardly ruled out that the Indian side will visit Pakistan for September\u2019s Asia cup, the PCB had threatened the BCCI for a similar action in return when India host the World Cup.\nThe PCB had also proposed a \u201chybrid model\u201d to the Asian Cricket Council for the Asia Cup, which would see India playing their matches at neutral venues while the remaining tournament takes place in Pakistan.\nThe board will put forward a similar proposal in front of the International Cricket Council for the World Cup as well, but by then, the situation may be different, given Pakistan\u2019s foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto\u2019s upcoming visit to India for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation meeting.\n\u201cWe are being told that the ice will melt and if that happens then India may consider coming to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy,\u201d said Sethi. \u201cWe are also being told that [we could play] the Asia Cup at a neutral venue and travel to India for the World Cup.\u201d\nSethi, however, said the PCB\u2019s current narrative was the same as before. \n\u201cWe are of the view that if the ice has to melt, it should be from India\u2019s side since we\u2019ve always welcomed the idea of playing against them in Pakistan. \n\u201cThe whole world is coming here, so India should also come and then, on reciprocal basis we can go there and play.\u201d\n"

Thousands of casualties have been reported since the fighting erupted a week ago between forces loyal to Sudan\u2019s army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and his deputy, Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, the commander of the powerful paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) who is commonly known as Hemeti.\nWHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris told reporters at a press briefing in Geneva on Friday that 413 people had been killed and 3,551 wounded in the fighting so far across Sudan. The UN migration agency said a staff member had been killed in fighting in southern Sudan when his vehicle was caught in crossfire. \n\nNine children, four humanitarian workers among victims\n\nThe humanitarian worker with the International Organisation for Migration is the fourth UN member of staff killed in less than a week, as earlier three employees of the World Food Programme were killed in the North Darfur region of eastern Sudan.\nThe UN children\u2019s agency Unicef added that at least nine children were among the dead and more than 50 children had been wounded.\nSoldiers and paramilitaries fought fierce street battles in residential areas of central and northern Khartoum, witnesses told AFP, with most of the city\u2019s five million people sheltering at home in the baking heat without electricity, food or water.\nBoth UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called separately for a ceasefire of \u201cat least\u201d three days to mark Eid, as explosions and gunfire resounded in Khartoum.\nThe RSF said they would commit to a 72-hour ceasefire starting at dawn. However, like two previous declared 24-hour ceasefires, it failed to take hold.\nThe crackle of intense gunfire continued Friday morning, with columns of black smoke rising across the capital.\nCiting Sudanese health ministry figures, the WHO spokeswoman said 20 health facilities had stopped functioning and another 12 were at risk of stopping. This would affect \u201cnot only the people who have been injured during this terrible fighting, but the people who were needing treatment before\u201d, she noted.\n\u201cIt\u2019s taking a devastating toll on the country\u2019s children,\u201d Unicef spoke\u00ad\u00adsman James Elder told reporters.\n\u201cAs long as fighting continues, children will continue to pay the price. The fighting means many families are trapped, with little or no access to electricity, terrified of running out of food, water and medicine.\u201d He said Sudan already had one of the world\u2019s highest rates of child malnutrition, with critical life-saving care now disrupted for an estimated 50,000 severely acutely malnourished children.\n\u201cWhen the bombing or shelling begins outside the hospital and where medical staff need to flee, then what?\u201d \n\u201cWe need forces to immediately cease hostilities and for all parties to respect their international obligations to protect children from harm,\u201d he said.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The world\u2019s glaciers melted at dramatic speed last year and saving them is effectively a lost cause, a UN agency said in a report on Friday, noting that record levels of greenhouse gases have caused \u201cplanetary scale changes on land, in the ocean and in the atmosphere\u201d.\nThe last eight years have been the warmest ever recorded, while concentrations of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide hit new peaks, the World Meteorological Organisation said.\n\u201cAntarctic sea ice fell to its lowest extent on record and the melting of some European glaciers was, literally, off the charts,\u201d the WMO spelled out as it launched its annual climate overview.\nThe \u2018State of the Global Climate 2022\u2019 report said that sea levels are also at a record high, having risen by an average of 4.62 millimetres per year between 2013 and 2022 \u2014 double the rate it was between 1993 and 2002.\n\nSea levels at record high, greenhouse gases in atmosphere hit new peaks, World Meteorological Organisation warns\n\nRecord high temperatures were recorded in the oceans \u2014 where around 90 per cent of the heat trapped on Earth by greenhouse gases ends up.\nRising global temperatures and rapidly melting glaciers are also bad news for Pakistan. The country is home to more than 7,000 glaciers, more than anywhere outside the poles.\nRecord monsoon rains and melting glaciers last September displaced millions of people and killed at least 1,700 in a catastrophe blamed on climate change.\n\u201cWhile greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise and the climate continues to change, populations worldwide continue to be gravely impacted by extreme weather and climate events,\u201d WMO chief Petteri Taalas said.\n\u201cFor example, in 2022, continuous drought in East Africa, record-breaking rainfall in Pakistan and record-breaking heatwaves in China and Europe affected tens of millions, drove food insecurity, boosted mass migration, and cost billions of dollars in loss and damage,\u201d he said.\nThe new WMO report is accompanied by a story map, which provides information for policymakers on how the climate change indicators are playing out, and which also shows how improved technology makes the transition to renewable energy cheaper and more accessible than ever.\nThroughout the year, hazardous climate and weather-related events drove new population displacement and worsened conditions for many of the 95 million people already living in displacement at the beginning of the year, according to the report.\nThe report also puts a spotlight on ecosystems and the environment and shows how climate change is affecting recurring events in nature, such as when trees blossom, or birds migrate.\nConcentrations of the three main greenhouse gases \u2014 carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide \u2014 reached record observed highs in 2021, the latest year for which consolidated global values are available (1984-2021).\nThe annual increase in methane concentration from 2020 to 2021 was the highest on record. Real-time data from specific locations show levels of the three greenhouse gases continued to increase in 2022.\nReference glaciers for which we have long-term observations experienced an average thickness change of over -1.3 metres between October 2021 and October 2022. This loss is much larger than the average of the last decade.\nSix of the ten most negative mass balance years on record (1950-2022) occurred since 2015. The cumulative thickness loss since 1970 amounts to almost 30 metres.\nMeasurements on glaciers in High Mountain Asia, western North America, South America and parts of the Arctic also reveal substantial glacier mass losses. There were some mass gains in Iceland and Northern Norway associated with higher-than-average precipitation and a relatively cool summer.\nAccording to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), globally the glaciers lost more than 6,000 gigatonnes of ice over the period 1993-2019. This represents an equivalent water volume of 75 lakes the size of Lac Leman (also known as Lake Geneva), the largest lake in Western Europe. The Greenland Ice Sheet ended with a negative total mass balance for the 26th year in a row.\nAs of 2021, 2.3 billion people faced food insecurity, of which 924m people faced severe food insecurity. Projections estimated 767.9m people facing undernourishment in 2021, 9.8pc of the global population. Half of these are in Asia and one-third are in Africa.\nHeatwaves in the 2022 pre-monsoon season in India and Pakistan caused a decline in crop yields. This, combined with the banning of wheat exports and restrictions on rice exports in India after the start of the conflict in Ukraine, threatened the availability, access, and stability of staple foods within international food markets and posed high risks to countries already affected by shortages of staple foods.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan\u2019s state-owned entities (SOEs) are the worst in South Asia and their combined losses growing faster than assets, resulting in a significant annual drain on scarce public resources and posing a substantial risk to the sovereign.\nOn an annual basis, they together swallow more than Rs458bn in public funds to stay afloat as their combined loans and guarantees surged to almost 10pc of GDP (Rs5.4tr) in FY21 from 3.1pc of GDP or Rs1.05tr in 2016, according to the World Bank that advised a deep-rooted reform programme to reverse the trend.\nThey \u201cimpose a significant fiscal drain and pose a substantial financial risk on the federal government\u201d, said the World Bank, adding that these entities had been incurring losses since FY16, with annual losses averaging at 0.5pc of GDP over FY16\u201320. \u201cPakistan\u2019s federal SOEs have been found to be the least profitable in the South Asia region\u201d, said the Public Expenditure Review 2023, adding that with the persistent losses, the accumulated SOE losses had become substantial, amounting to 3.1pc of GDP in FY20.\nTo cover the losses, the federal government has been providing direct fiscal support to the SOEs, in the form of subsidies, loans and equity injections, which totalled 1.4pc of GDP in FY21. In addition to direct support, the government has been also issuing guarantees for SOEs to secure loans from commercial banks. Federal government exposure to SOEs, defined as the outstanding stock of guarantees and government loans to SOEs, has been rapidly increasing and stood at 9.7pc of GDP in FY21.\nThe report noted that combined fiscal exposure against domestic and foreign loans and guarantees had been increasing rapidly with annual growth averaging 42.9pc over FY2016\u20132021. But this required a detailed risk assessment on account of contingent exposure that may arise from guarantees. In FY 2021, 32pc of the outstanding guarantees, given through the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC), were against project financing of the K-3 and K-4 nuclear power plants. The available data show that guarantees constituted the bulk of fiscal exposure, at 44.4pc of total exposure in FY21, while Cash Development Loans and foreign loans accounted for 36pc and 19.6pc of exposure, respectively.\nThe stock of outstanding government guarantees to SOEs has more than doubled since FY16. Over 75pc of the stock of guarantees is against the power sector for financing the circular debt. The stock of outstanding guarantees from the Federal Government to federal commercial SOEs has increased from 2.2pc of GDP in FY16 to 4.5pc of GDP in FY22.\nThe report said that individual SOE performance was largely dictated by sectoral performance. Although the primary reasons for SOE losses differ, they are typically related to unresolved corporate governance issues, sector regulations, an underestimation of the cost of the provision in complete restructuring and insufficient current subsidies.\nAn SOE portfolio analysis showed that individual SOE performance was influenced by sectoral policies and the level of operational autonomy by the Board of Directors and senior management. SOE losses are concentrated in the power, infrastructure, and transport sectors, and in the aggregate, outweigh profits from profitable SOEs. Although a sizable number of commercial SOEs generated profits in FY20, they were concentrated in the oil and gas sector.\n"

The fall in exports in dollar terms was around 21.3pc.\nTotal rice exports during March stood at 382,618 tonnes valuing $243,632, while Pakistan exported a total 2,907,322 tonnes of rice to earn $1,598,261 during the period July-March 2022-23.\nOf them basmati variety was 428,404 tonnes worth $456,361 and non-basmati 2,478,918 tonnes valuing $1,141,900.\nRice trade expert Ha\u00admid Malik says with the current export trend Pak\u00adistan will be able to cross the $2bn export target. \nAn official of the Rice Exporters Association of Pakistan (Reap) said export figures in terms of quantity may be down but the way the crop has been affected, the foreign sales are comparatively satisfactory as exporters are getting fair prices.\n\u201cEver high export prices and demand are there in the foreign markets. Tho\u00adugh the crop is less in quantity but in terms of the value we are set to cross the $2bn mark.\u201d\nLast year Pakistan exported rice worth $2.5bn, historically the highest figure.\nThere is a very encouraging situation on the export front but local businesses are severely hit as scarcity of foreign exch\u00adange is preventing the import of machinery and material meant for value-addition.\n\u201cMachinery imports are stuck up. Things that are ultimately meant for exports are blocked. Letters of credit for planters, harvesters, and rice processing machines are not being opened. The companies working on sustainable production agriculture are being disallowed to import solar panels,\u201d the official says requesting not to be named.\nHowever, Momin Malik, Director of Seeds at Guard Agricultural Research and Services Ltd, says as basmati rice are getting a good price, particularly in the international markets, there is a growing trend of plating basmati this year instead of non-basmati varieties, which had been claiming the basmati acreage for the last few years.\nAlso due to delays in wheat harvesting because of late sowing as well as low temperatures in March slowing down the crop\u2019s maturing process, the sale of rice seeds of coarse varieties has declined by over 10pc. For, he explains, the window for reaping a third crop of hybrid rice, between wheat and basmati rice, has narrowed down because of delay in wheat harvesting.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The success rate of the Asian  Devel\u00adopment Bank\u2019s (ADB) public sector operations declined during  2016\u20132022, Independent Evaluation Department (IED), ADB\u2019s assessing body  revealed on Wednesday.\nAccording to the \u20182023 Annual Evaluation  Review\u2019 prepared by IED, and released on Wednesday, the success rate of  ADB\u2019s public sector projects shrank primarily among infrastructure  projects in the relatively new areas of the transport and energy  sectors, however, private sector projects remained stable.\nThe  assessment found, while using a combination of quantitative and  qualitative methods, that success relied predominantly on project  factors such as complexity, risk, supervision, delegation, financing  utilization, and procurement and design readiness. It accounted for  nearly three-fourths of the explainable variations in the public sector  performance.\nThe evaluation attributes the remaining variables in  the public sector performance to country-specific factors, including  governance, political stability, fiscal management, economic  performance, and unexpected events.\nThe sovereign success rate in  2020-2022, averaged 68 per cent, continued the steady decline from 77pc  in 2016-2018. Meanwhile, in wake of the annual variation in the number  of completed and validated sovereign projects in 2016-2022, overall  sovereign project performance declined by 3.2pc annually.\nDeteriorating  infrastructure performance drove the decline of overall sovereign  performance, leading to a drop of 3.9pc annually during 2016\u20132022.\nSimilarly, declines in transport and energy projects further abetted slumping infrastructure performance.\nWeak  management and financial capacities of executing and implementing  agencies and broad project scopes were the main constraints to energy  projects, according to the IED validations of project completion  reports. Inadequate due diligence backed the design deficiencies in poor  performance of transport projects.\nADB operations in relatively  new areas of activity in transport and energy \u2014 such as rail, urban  public transport, energy efficiency and conservation, and energy sector  development and institutional reforms \u2014 also contributed to poor  sovereign performance due to inadequate consideration of developing  member countries\u2019 limited experience with new technologies, the report  said.\nAmong non-infrastructure operations, public sector  management (PSM) saw a considerable decline in South Asia and the  Pacific, which were affected by changes in government and development  priorities.\nIn contrast, education and health projects performed  better during the period. It was found that government ownership and  commitment to education and health reforms enhanced performance in these  sectors.\nThe recent uptick in infrastructure performance from  66pc in 2019\u20132021 to 68pc in 2020\u20132022 helped maintain non sovereign  operations\u2019 (NSO) stable performance during 2016-2022.\nThe  technical assistance projects that failed to deliver their planned  outcomes were generally in public expenditure and financial management,  integration of planning and budgeting, and railway development.\nSuccess  rates of financial institution projects and the legacy of private  equity funds designed years ago continued to lag behind infrastructure  projects due to internal challenges and external.\nLikewise,  financial institution project success dipped from 70pc in 2019\u20132021 to  50pc in 2020\u20132022, while no private equity fund was rated successful.\nTechnical  assistance (TA) projects that failed to deliver planned outcomes were  generally in public expenditure and financial management, integration of  planning and budgeting, and railway development.\nThe report revealed that TA projects that performed  poorly had supported reforms or knowledge products that were spread  across too many areas and had vaguely defined performance targets.\n"

Earlier, ECP had set April 20 as the final day for submission of tickets.\nAccording to party sources, over 80 per cent of tickets have been handed over to deserving candidates and there are disputes on around 20pc of seats.\n\u201cThe contentions are among the candidates who had submitted nomination papers for respective constituencies thinking they were better suited to represent their areas,\u201d the source said, adding that in some constituencies, up to 10 candidates had submitted nomination papers in hopes of getting a ticket.\nFor 297 constituencies, the party received some 1,500 applications and tickets have been awarded by the PTI chairman to 285 candidates, the source told Dawn.\nA decision on 12 seats \u2014 PP-57, PP-61, PP-124, PP-162, PP-177, PP-204, PP-221, PP-234, PP-244, PP-251, PP-253 and PP-272 \u2014 is still pending.\nFollowing the award of tickets, the PTI constituted four reconciliation committees to recommend an adjustment in the list of candidates, the source said.\nThe committees have now been converted into \u201creview committees\u201d to hear the candidates\u2019 grievances and forward their recommendations to Mr Khan.\nThe North Punjab review committee is headed by retired Brig Musadiq Abbasi, Central Punjab by Senator Ejaz Chaudhry, West Punjab by Hassan Nawaz and South Punjab by Aon Abbas Bappi.\n\u201cThere would have been no complaints or rifts if the ECP had not extended the date for submission of nomination papers,\u201d the source said. \u201cNow, with the date extended, the review committees will engage the complainants until April 26.\u201d\nThe source added that in case of any change in the earlier awards, the candidates who received the tickets and submitted them before the ECP ahead of the previous date would have to hand them over to the new candidates.\nWhen contacted, Central Punjab review committee head Senator Ejaz Chaudhry said there were individual complaints as those who were denied the tickets agitated, claiming that they were stronger candidates than those who were awarded the tickets.\nHowever, he denied the influence of any pressure groups or lobby vying for tickets.\nExceptions and surprises\nMr Khan has been saying for months that he would personally interview each aspirant and only choose the strongest one to be the PTI\u2019s candidate. However, the final list issued after the extensive interview process had several notable exceptions \u2013 such as Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Fawad Chaudhry and Hammad Azhar \u2013 which didn\u2019t go unnoticed.\nWith these heavyweights out of the race, the chief minister\u2019s seat, at this stage, apparently has only two hopefuls \u2014 newly-inducted PTI president Chaudhry Parvez Elahi and Usman Buzdar.\nMr Khan\u2019s former chief of staff Shahbaz Gill, who was allegedly tortured during custody, was also denied a ticket.\nFawad Chaudhry recently expressed his reservations about not being considered for the provincial assembly, adding that the chief minister\u2019s slot was attractive if one was interested in bringing about a change.\nHe added that he couldn\u2019t do anything, as the decision was taken by Mr Khan himself.\nHammad Azhar said the PTI chairman had informed him that his services will be needed in the federal government and this was the reason he withdrew his nomination papers for the provincial assembly seat.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Punjab minister Murad Raas has also been denied a ticket. Though Mr Raas didn\u2019t say anything publicly, party insiders claim Mr Khan was not happy with his performance as the minister.\nThey also claimed that Mr Raas was not seen in the field when party leaders and workers were facing the wrath of the state authorities.\nFormer Punjab minister for higher education Raja Yasir Humayun had also not been considered for the ticket. Mr Humayun, however, said he has always been vying for the National Assembly ticket.\nAdditionally, as per his commitment to Mr Elahi, who recently merged his faction of the PML-Q with the PTI, Mr Khan has fully facilitated ex-PML-Q leaders who tagged along with Mr Elahi and his son Moonis Elahi.\nAll 10 former MPAs, who were part of the PML-Q, have been awarded tickets and two women MPAs \u2014Baasima Chaudhry and Khadija Umar \u2014 have been placed on the list for reserved seats.\nMr Khan has also awarded the ticket to Moonis Elahi from PP-32 (Gujrat-V).\nThe PTI chief\u2019s decision to award a ticket to Mehr Abdul Sattar from PP-186 (Okara-IV) was widely welcomed. Mr Sattar was a leader of the Anjuman-i-Mizareen and had been fighting for the rights of tenants of Military Farms in Okara.\nFormer Punjab health minister and PTI Central Punjab president Dr Yasmin Rashid has been given a ticket from PP-173, Lahore, where she will face-off against PML-N chief organiser Maryam Nawaz Sharif, who had submitted her nomination papers.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The controversial law seeking to curtail the powers of the chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) to take suo motu action and form benches technically became an act of parliament on Friday.\nAnd despite a Supreme Court order halting the law\u2019s implementation, the National Assembly Secretariat formally asked the Printing Corporation of Pakistan (PCP) to publish it in the official gazette.\nAfter President Arif Alvi for a second time refused to assent to the bill passed by lawmakers in a joint sitting of the parliament on April 10, the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act 2023 has now become an act under Article 75(2) of the Constitution. This was announced officially by the National Assembly Secretariat through its official Twitter handle.\nLater, the NA Secretariat released a handout and a copy of the letter signed by Additional Secretary (Legislation) Muhammad Mushtaq written to the PCP manager, stating that he had been directed to forward a copy of the act for publication in the official gazette.\n\nNA Secretariat asks Printing Corporation of Pakistan to publish new act in official gazette\n\nSuch communication between the NA Secretariat and the PCP after the passage of the laws is a routine matter and the NA Secretariat does not issue any press releases in this regard. This time, however, it has not only issued a press release but also issued a copy of the letter in the wake of the ongoing executive-judiciary tussle over the issue of polls in two provinces.\nArticle 75(2) of the Constitution says that when the president has returned a bill to the parliament, it shall be reconsidered in a joint sitting. If it is again passed, with or without amendment, by the votes of most members of both houses, it is again referred to the president for their assent. If the bill was not signed by the president within 10 days, their assent would have been deemed granted.\nInitially, the bill was approved by the federal cabinet on March 28 and then passed by both houses of parliament \u2014 the National Assembly and Senate. However, President Alvi refused to sign it into law with the observation that it travelled \u201cbeyond the competence of parliament\u201d.\nHowever, a joint session of parliament passed it again on April 10 with certain amendments and it was then again referred to the president for his assent.\nHowever, three days later, the Supreme Court barred the government from enforcing the proposed legislation, saying the move would \u201cprevent the imminent apprehended danger that is irreparable\u201d as soon as the bill becomes an act of parliament.\n\u201cThe moment that the bill receives the assent of the president or it is deemed that such assent has been given, then from that very moment onwards and till further orders, the act that comes into being shall not have, take or be given any effect nor be acted upon in any manner,\u201d said an interim order issued by the eight-member Supreme Court bench headed by CJP Umar Ata Bandial, prompting a strong reaction from the government, which passed damning resolutions against the top court.\nOn April 19, the president, for a second time, refused to give his assent for the bill and sent it back to the parliament, maintaining that the matter was sub judice, or being considered by a judge or court.\nAccording to the legislation, a three-member bench consisting of the chief justice and the two senior-most judges of the apex court will decide whether to take up a matter suo motu. Previously, this was solely the prerogative of the chief justice.\nThe law also states that every cause, matter or appeal before the apex court would be heard and disposed of by a bench, which will be formed by a committee comprising the chief justice and the two senior-most judges.\nThe legislation also includes the right to file an appeal within 30 days of the judgement in a suo motu case and that any case involving constitutional interpretation will not have a bench of fewer than five judges.\nThe bill would allow former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and other parliamentarians disqualified by the Supreme Court under suo motu powers (such as Jahangir Tareen) to appeal their disqualification within 30 days of the law\u2019s enactment.\n"

            "Text": "LAHORE: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif held a meeting with his legal team and some PML-N leaders on Friday, vowing to hold the parliament \u2018supreme\u2019 in the face of apex court decisions regarding elections to the Punjab Assembly and staying implementation of the SC (Practice and Procedure) law.\nLegal brains of the party \u2014 federal Law Minister Azam Nazir Tarar, Attorney General Mansoor Usman and former law minister Zahid Hamid \u2014 briefed the premier about the possible consequences the government could face after the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023, became law despite the apex court\u2019s order.\nThe SC had halted implementation of the bill seeking to curtail the Chief Justice of Pakistan\u2019s (CJP) powers to take suo motu notices and constituting benches. The bill became an act on Friday.\n\u201cThe PM was told by the government\u2019s legal brains that he is \u201clegally safe\u201d if the SC takes note of the violation of its order, a source told Dawn.\nHe said the legal team had informed the premier about possible action the SC could take against him for defiance by the government of its order to hold elections to the Punjab Assembly on May 14.\nHe said Mr Sharif also discussed with the PML-N\u2019s Sardar Ayaz Sadiq and Khwaja Saad Rafique the apex court\u2019s order to evolve a consensus on the date for holding elections to the National and provincial assemblies on the same day.\nThe SC will resume proceedings on April 27 on petitions for holding elections in Punjab. The SC has made it clear that its order about the May 14 polls in Punjab would remain intact.\nConsensus unlikely\n\u201cThere seems little chance of a consensus between the ruling coalition and the PTI over a date for holding elections for the National and provincial assemblies simultaneously. This fight between parliament and SC will go to the next level, eventually proving disastrous for the democratic set-up\u201d the source feared.\nKhurram Chughtai, a lawyer, told Dawn that so far the prime minister had done nothing in violation of any order or judgement of the Supreme Court.\n\u201cIf there is anything he did which may be considered against any order of the three-member SC bench, we don\u2019t have observations by the judges disapproving of the PM\u2019s actions.\n\u201cBut on the other hand, four judges had written a dissenting note which serves as a valid defence of the prime minister,\u201d he said.\nKhurram Chughtai further said the views expressed during parliament\u2019s proceedings, and votes taken on an issue, enjoy constitutional immunity.\nAccording to the lawyer, Article 69 of the Constitution provides parliamentary privilege to both \u2014 proceedings under Article 84 and the notification on promulgation of any legislation.\n\u201cAny injunction of the Supreme Court regarding operation of any legislation has no effect on any legislation passed by parliament, Mr Chughtai said.\n"

            "Text": "While the ongoing tussle between parliament and the judiciary is likely to drag on beyond Eid, legal and constitutional experts continue to question the Supreme Court\u2019s April 4 ruling for exclusively focusing on elections to the Punjab Assembly and placing the issue of polls in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa \u2018on a back burner\u2019.\nThe two assemblies were dissolved in a similar manner just four days apart \u2014 Punjab on January 14 and KP on January 18 \u2014 but the apex court adopted different approaches in the two seemingly identical cases.\nWhile it apparently made \u2018all-out efforts\u2019 to hold polls in Punjab as early as possible, it allowed parties to take the case for KP elections to the \u201cappropriate\u201d forums, and the matter is currently before the Peshawar High Court.\nThis apparent dichotomy in the court\u2019s conduct doesn\u2019t sit right with many in the legal fraternity.\n\nLegal experts see legitimate concerns behind govt demand for elections in one go, say 90-day deadline \u2018not rigid\u2019\n\nSenior lawyer Akhtar Hussain, who represents the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) on the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP), says the apex court has been criticised for focusing only on elections to the Punjab Assembly and asking petitioners to approach \u201cany forum\u201d on the identical issue in KP.\nThere should have been a single order for both provinces, but the apex court bifurcated the matter of KP polls, strengthening the impression it was only interested in holding elections in Punjab, said Mr Hussain.\nFormer Supreme Court Bar Association president Yasin Azad termed it constitutionally incorrect to adjudicate on elections to the Punjab Assembly and ignore KP.\nMr Azad questioned whether Article 224 of the Constitution \u2014 which stipulated the 90-day deadline \u2014 did not apply to KP and asked whether the apex court had no objection to October 8 as the date for polls in that province.\n\u201cThe Supreme Court is also questioning the tenure of caretaker government in Punjab alone and its entire focus is to hold early elections in the largest province of the country,\u201d he observed.\nFormer Sindh Bar Council vice-chairman Haider Imam Rizvi assailed the apex court\u2019s decision to make no observations regarding elections in KP, terming it \u201ccontrary to the provisions of law\u201d.\n90-day deadline \u2018not rigid\u2019\nThe 90-day deadline for polls to the Punjab and KP assemblies expired on April 14 and April 18, respectively.\nOn this, Mr Hussain was of the view that the deadline could be extended under special and unavoidable circumstances.\nMr Azad also concurred, stating that the deadline can be extended under unavoidable circumstances. as provided in Article 254, and a precedent in this regard was set when the 1988 general elections were delayed.\nArticle 254 states that if any action required by the Constitution to be done within a particular period was not done in that time, it won\u2019t render the action illegal or invalid for the sole reason of tardiness.\nBut while the constitutional deadline for polls may have lapsed, Mr Rizvi said that according to articles 232 and 234 \u2014 which deal with proclamation of emergency and governor\u2019s rule \u2014 elections can also be delayed under an emergency or unavoidable circumstances.\nBefore discussing the rigidity of the 90-day deadline, the question of dissolution needs to be addressed first, he said.\n \n \n\n\u201cUnder Article 107 of the Constitution, the duration of an assembly is five years and its premature dissolution has to be fully justified through definite reasons as provided in the Constitution,\u201d Mr Rizvi said.\nCommenting on the push to remove caretaker governments following the expiry of their stipulated tenure, Mr Azad noted that the Constitution was silent on the issue.\nHe attributed the ongoing crisis to the apex court\u2019s interpretation of Article 63-A.\nAfter the 18th Amendment, Mr Azad said, issues related to the provinces must be decided by the respective high courts and the apex court may not use its extraordinary powers under Article 284(3) to intervene in provincial issues.\nHe said a case for elections to Punjab Assembly was already pending before the Lahore High Court when the chief justice took the suo-motu notice.\n\u2018Legitimate concerns\u2019 on scattered polls\nLegal experts Dawn spoke to also lent some consideration to the ruling coalition\u2019s firm stance of holding polls across the country on a single day.\nMr Hussain said that there was \u201csome substance in the government\u2019s arguments\u201d, noting that the concept of caretaker governments was introduced in view of Pakistan\u2019s history of unconstitutional rule.\nHe said it was aimed at providing a level playing field to all political parties and ensuring free and fair elections.\u201c\nIf elections in Punjab were held before general elections, there would be an elected government in the province during the elections for the National Assembly which would \u201cviolate the constitutional concept\u201d of a level-playing field, Mr Hussain added.\nAn apex court judge had also questioned how both assemblies were dissolved and whether the actions were constitutional or otherwise, he added.\nFor Mr Rizvi, not holding country-wide elections on a single day would \u201clead to another constitutional crisis\u201d as the Constitution was clear the elections must be held under interim setups to ensure transparency.\n"

            "Text": "New Delhi: Former governor of India-held Kashmir Satya Pal Malik, who made many revelations about national security and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s approach to corruption in an explosive interview to The Wire last week, has been called in by the country\u2019s apex investigating agency, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), \u201cfor questioning\u201d on April 28.\nThe Wire said the BJP-appointed governor for four other states  will be going to the CBI\u2019s guest house on Akbar Road in New Delhi to answer questions.\nMr Malik had blamed the government for the Pulwama massacre, saying had the government acceded to the request to fly the troopers instead of making them sitting ducks on the road, there would have been no tragedy. The claim has sparked protests from opposition parties, with Nationalist Congress Party chief asking the government to resign. But The Wire said the questioning could be about the corruption issues Mr Malik had raised.\n\u201cIt is reliably learnt that the \u2018questioning\u2019 will be on the Reliance Insurance issue \u2014 the scheme that RSS and BJP leader Ram Madhav was allegedly pushing Malik to pass while he was the governor of held Kashmir, and which Malik cancelled,\u201d The Wire said. On April 14, Malik had given an explosive interview to Karan Thapar for The Wire, in which he had specifically spoken of this deal.\nBharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) leader Ram Madhav, Mr Malik said, paid the then Indian held Jammu and Kashmir governor a special visit to try and get him to pass a scheme proposed by Reliance Insurance. When Mr Malik made it clear that the scheme had been cancelled and the paperwork was done, Mr Madhav left disappointed.\nMr Malik had also mentioned this incident in an interview to Prashant Tandon for DB Live, conducted before Thapar\u2019s interview. After that aired, Mr Madhav sent Mr Malik a defamation notice.\nThe multi-party petition in the Supreme Court against the role played by central agencies (including the CBI) to play to a political tune was not heard by the apex court as they claimed they could not look at issuing broad blanket rulings, but needed to look at matters case by case.\nIn the interview, Mr Malik said he didn\u2019t like to meet people before showering but he met Mr Ram Madhav who came early in the morning to see him.\n\u201cAsk him to tell me why he had shown up at the residence, what did he want to talk about? Did he want to talk about murder? One day earlier we had closed the matter and he came back again very early in the morning. He asked me if I had closed the matter on insurance and I said that I had. He asked me if the letter had gone and I said that it had. Then Ram Madhav got upset.\u201d\nMr Malik said he had initially passed this scheme but a lot of people asked him to take it back. \u201cThe first thing that happened was that government employees were really unhappy with the coming of the scheme. That is because all government employees had to pay Indian Rs8,500 a year for the scheme. Retired officers had to give more than Indian Rs20,000. So I said in Delhi, under Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS), we don\u2019t have to pay anything, so why would they pay here? And on top of that, the hospitals that had been listed in the scheme were bad hospitals. None of the hospitals were of national repute. I realised that the hospitals were bad and then good treatment would not be meted out even after taking large amounts.\u201d\n"

CDA officials said that work was being executed as per scheduled and it will be completed within the deadline of June this year.\nHowever, they said that the Railway bridge (near PWD interchange) is a huge structure and it could take some extra time.\n\u201cThe project could be extended for two to three months,\u201d said an engineer of CDA. He, however, said that extra efforts were being made to complete the work within this deadline.\n\nCDA official says extension of deadline not uncommon in projects with large amount of work\n\n\u201cIn such a huge amount of work, extension of a few months in contract is not a big deal. Our focus is quality as the expressway is a highly busy road, therefore, we do not want to complete it in a rash manner,\u201d said an official and added that expansion of the road project will be comfortably complete by June this year.\n\u201cBut yes, the Railway bridge, which is part of this 2-km road project will take extra time. The eastern side of the bridge is near the completion stage and once it is completed then we will move towards the western side,\u201d he said.\nIt is relevant to note here that currently, three projects are in progress on the expressway from Korang Bridge to GT road.\nFurthermore, work on the second project, Korang bridge has also seen considerable delay. It was started in 2021 and was supposed to be completed in December 2021. However, a private contractor abandoned it halfway. \nLater on last year, the CDA engaged FWO for remainder work. Now, the bridge is being given final touches and it is said that in the next two months, it could be opened for traffic.\nExpansion from PWD to G.T. Road\nUnder this portion, FWO is expanding the road from existing two lanes to four lanes, besides construction of two major bridges (Sohan and Binder) and work is in progress with full pace.\nCDA officials said that work could be completed within the deadline of June 2024.\nThis project worth almost Rs11 billion was started last year and according to the PC-I of the project, it will be completed in 18 months. In last September, the CDA issued a commencement letter to the contractor, which was the main document to start the project.\nAfter the PWD, the four-lane Expressway narrows down to two lanes, causing bottlenecks and disrupting traffic on almost a daily basis. \nThis is one of the main roads of the federal capital and caters to both light and heavy traffic, particularly plying between Islamabad and Lahore. \nIts widening was announced many times but last year it was formally started and currently, work on it is in progress. \nThe two lane road is being widened to four lanes and once widening is completed the motorists, who face traffic congestion on a daily basis, will take a huge sigh of relief.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The owner of an \u2018irregular\u2019 skyscraper - One Constitution Avenue - has sought contempt proceedings against the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC).\nThe owner and builder, M/s BNP (Private) Limited, has filed a petition in Islamabad High Court (IHC), seeking contempt proceedings against PAC Chairman Noor Alam Khan for defying its directions.\nRecently, PAC had directed NAB to investigate the non-payment of Rs17 billion by the group after it expressed its inability to clear the outstanding installments. \nThe committee in a recent meeting also issued direction to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) to probe money trail of those who had bought luxurious apartments in the skyscraper built on land meant for a five-star hotel.\n<In March, IHC had restrained investigation agencies from proceedings against builder on direction of PAC, says petition\nSince the auction of the plot in 2005, the project has been mired in controversies. \nThe CDA had auctioned the 13.5 acres for Rs4.8 billion, but without getting full amount it handed over possession of the plot to the group.\nThe project also remained on the radar of the FIA and NAB. In 2017, the CDA cancelled the lease and sealed the building since the plot was meant for the construction of a hotel, but the developer had built and sold residential apartments instead.\nHowever, a three-member bench of the Supreme Court in January 2019 restored the lease and ruled that if M/s BNP defaulted on furnishing a guarantee or payment of any installment on its due date, the civic agency would have the right, after giving a 30-day notice, to terminate the lease.\nThe CDA last month canceled the lease of the plot for One Constitution Avenue project over default.\nDuring the hearing of the matter before the apex court, the then counsel for the CDA had objected on one of the members of the bench, asking him to recuse for being a lawyer of the builder in the past. His objection was overruled by the bench.\nEarlier this month, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Maryam Nawaz also criticised the same judge, saying he was connected with a controversial lease to high-rise apartments.\nThe builder of One Constitution Avenue in March filed a petition in the IHC, saying PAC Chairman Khan had written letters to various regulators and authorities for taking action against the group.\nHe requested the court to set aside the directions given to the investigation agencies and regulators against the builder.\nJustice Farooq issued notices to the respondents, including PAC, CDA and others and also restrained the investigation agencies from their proceedings initiated against the builder on the direction of PAC.\nThe court, however, allowed the regulator and the investigation agencies \u201cto continue with any investigation or inquiry prior to the directives [of PAC].\u201d\nHowever, in a subsequent meeting, PAC again issued direction to the investigation agencies to complete the probe against the builder.\nThe builder then filed a contempt petition against PAC and the IHC issued notice to the committee.\nThe case was fixed for hearing on April 18. The lawyer of the builder was present inside the courtroom, but since the CDA\u2019s counsel was not in attendance, it was adjourned till May 25.\n"

            "Text": "TAXILA: An eight-year-old boy was injured after being mauled by stray dogs in Hazro town of Attock.\nThe incident was reported in Khagwani village in Chach area of Hazro tehsil when Ayan Shah was going to a local mosque to offer prayers when a pack of stray dogs attacked him. Later, a passerby came to rescue him when they heard screams of the child and he was shifted to Tehsil Headquarters (THQ) hospital Hazro from where he was shifted to Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) Islamabad due to his critical condition.\nAccording to Dr Mohammad Naeem, medical superintendent of THQ hospital - the child lost his left eye and sustained other critical injuries. Surgery is not available in the district. Deputy District Officer (Health) Dr Abdul Rasheed said that the victim was provided anti-rabies vaccination (ARV) and other basic treatment and the boy is said to be out of danger. Responding to a question, he said that the boy was in a state of shock and referred to Pims for better cure as pediatric and ophthalmologist facility is not available in the area.\n\u201cSoon after the incident came into the notice of local administration, the entire sanitation staff of the municipal committee was mobilised and a massive operation against stray dogs in the Chach area was launched,\u201d said Assistant Commissioner Kamran Ashraf. He said that different teams were constituted and on the recommendation of former chairman of union council as well as notables, the operation was launched in hotspot areas. He said that around 100 stray dogs were neutralised during the operation to eliminate stray dogs from the area causing constant threats to masses.\nThe relatives of the boy said that the menace has increased manifold in their areas for which they have been complaining to the civic agencies without any result so far as they do not feel their basic responsibilities. They said that the population of stray dogs could not be reduced due to sheer negligence of relevant civic agencies.\nMeanwhile, PTI leader Changaiz Khan said that a \u201cgrand operation\u201d against stray and feral dogs must be initiated in the town, adding how despite constantly asking relevant officers to address the growing population of canines for the past two-and-a-half years, there has been no action.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: Haemophilia management requires prophylactic, routine and emergency treatment in addition to rehabilitation services and facilities.\nDespite these challenges, there is reason for hope in the form of promising advances in medical research leading to new treatment medicines and even cures for haemophilia patients.\nWorld Health Organisation (WHO) Global Adviser on Blood Regulation, Availability and Safety Prof Hasan Abbas Zaheer said this in a statement.\nHe added that while some of the medicines, given to patients, were registered with the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap) a number of them were not available as new medicines were frequently introduced due to continuous advancements and research in the medical sector.\n\u201cPatients in Pakistan pay exorbitant fees for Drap-registered medicines and lack of proper diagnosis for the bleeding disorder patients,\u201d he said, adding that haemophilia affects the body\u2019s ability to form blood clots and remains to be a challenge for both patients and healthcare providers in Pakistan.\n\u201cAlthough treatment options have improved over the years, management of haemophilia still presents many challenges for those living with the condition in developing countries including Pakistan,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIf someone is diagnosed with haemophilia or another bleeding disorder, it means that the person has a deficiency or absence of some clotting factors in their blood, which can lead to prolonged bleeding spontaneously, after injury or surgery. Fortunately, there are diagnostic tests available to confirm the diagnosis of haemophilia, such as routine and advanced blood and genetic tests. Once a proper diagnosis is established, treatment options are available in the form of medicines registered by Drap which help to control bleeding and prevent complications,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIn addition, there are also efforts underway in Pakistan to improve the quality of life for haemophilia and other bleeding disorder patients. Patient advocacy groups are working to raise awareness about these bleeding conditions to improve access to care and support services,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWith proper diagnosis and treatment, people living with haemophilia can lead healthy and fulfilling lives. With continued investment in research and development, and a focus on improving access to care, we can hope to see better outcomes for those living with bleeding disorders,\u201d he said.\nTalking to Dawn, Dr Zaheer suggested to Drap to expedite the process of registration of new medicines because patients suffer due to delays in the registration process.\n\u201cA number of new medicines are introduced, time to time, in the market but it becomes difficult to bring them in Pakistan, through a legal channel, due to which patients have been suffering,\u201d he said.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The Capital Development Authority (CDA) has reiterated that it will hold a balloting for plots to be allotted to the land affected people of D-13, but would not entertain community land without an endorsement from the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) revenue department.\nThe CDA is going to hold the balloting through Nadra next month, but there are reports that a number of people possess community land (shamlat). However, a senior officer of the CDA on Thursday told Dawn that not a single case of communal land will be entertained without the endorsement from the revenue department.\nHe, however, said the CDA wanted to clear compensation cases of people in all the stalled sectors, including D-13, as without this the civic agency could not take possession of sectors to start development. He said D-13, E-13, F-13, C-13, C-14, H-16 and I-17 were lying pending just because of the compensation cases. A few months ago, the then CDA deputy commissioner Khalid Masood Satti through a letter had requested the additional deputy commissioner (revenue) for determination of the share of shamlat land of several villages that fall in C-13, D-13 and E-13.\nAccording to a source, several years ago, the CDA had allotted plots in D-13 allegedly on the basis of shamlat land without determination from the ICT\u2019s revenue department, which was why there was a need to properly check the status of all allotted plots in the sector.\nThe letter, dated March 10, stated: \u201cLand falling in village Shah Allah Ditta has been acquired for Sector C-13, D-13 and E-1 in year 2008. It has come to the notice of undersigned that share of Shamlat land of some of the villages like Juhangi Syedaan, Shah Allah Ditta, Bhekar Fateh Bukhsh and Dharaik Mohri has not been determined yet among the landowners.\u201d\nIt said due to non-determination of the share of shamlat land, CDA\u2019s rehabilitation benefits could not be released to landowners who were pressing hard for their compensation.\n\u201cIt is pertinent to mention here that an inquiry is also under trial in CDA, wherein a report of subject matters needs to be submitted,\u201d the letter stated.\n\u201cThis issue warrants a proper investigation to check all such plots, which had been allotted on the basis of shamlat land,\u201d an official said.\nRecently, after suspecting major fraud and tampering in records of the three sectors, member estate Afnan Alam had requested the administration wing of the CDA for constitution of a high-level committee to examine the records while an FIR was also registered against several officials of the civic agency for allotting three plots in D-13/3 on the basis of bogus claims.\n"

The mention of the Rs10 coin made him frown, something new for the otherwise quite pleasant fellow.\n\nRs10 coin and Rs75 note issued by SBP have not gained public acceptance\n\n\u201cNow I have collected a little sack full of these Rs10 coins. No one wants them,\u201d he said.\nThen remembering something, he opened his cash register to bring out several Rs75 currency notes, which the SBP had issued just last year. The green-coloured banknote was issued to commemorate the 75th independence day of Pakistan.\nThe note has portraits of four founders Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, Dr Allama Mohammad Iqbal, Mohtarma Fatima Jinnah and Sir Syed Ahmed Khan on its front.\nIt carries the signature of SBP Governor Jameel Ahmad, and yet it is not accepted in the market.\n\u201cSimilarly, this note is also not accepted. I have so many 75 rupees notes because, again, I have been taking it from customers but no one wants it from me,\u201d he shrugged.\n\u201cSome people have even told me strange stories that the note has been rejected by the public and thus recalled by the SBP,\u201d he laughed.\n\u201cThey say that the image of the Markhor on the reverse side of the note is the problem. They say that it is not a halal animal, which is utter rubbish, although it may be endangered. It is also the Inter-Services Intelligence logo. Oh please, it is just a goat,\u201d he laughed.\nAt a stationary and gift items shop just next door, young shopkeeper Asim Minhas said that since the coins and notes were in circulation therefore he accepted them all. \u201cWhy should I refuse anything that is perfectly okay? The currency is not the problem here, it\u2019s the people\u2019s ignorance that is the problem here. I take both the coins and notes from them and if I cannot use them in the market, I just go and exchange them from SBP,\u201d he said.\nVisiting to a huge departmental store in a Clifton mall, one of the staff there, upon seeing the coin, said that it was discontinued \u2018long long ago\u2019.\nA petrol pump in Saddar also turned down the coin and the Rs75 note. \u201cMonopoly Monopoly khel raheen hain kya? [Is this play money from the board game Monopoly?]\u201d Asked the attendant there.\nWhile speaking to Dawn on the issue, a spokesperson for the State Bank of Pakistan said that both the Rs10 coin and the commemorative Rs75 note, in fact all commemorative notes or coins, introduced by the SBP, are perfectly fine and acceptable for market transactions.\n"

            "Text": "LARKANA: Several preventable diseases like measles, pertussis, resistant malaria, gastroenteritis, emphysema and malnutrition have registered an unusual rise among children who reported at the Chandka Medical College children hospital from flood-hit areas in the wake of last year\u2019s devastating deluge, according to doctors.\nProf Dr Shanti Lal, chairman of the department of pediatrics at the hospital, confirmed that majority of the cases were pouring in from flood-hit areas of Qambar-Shahdadkot, Larkana and other districts including Jhal Magsi, Gaibidero, Ratoderro, Naudero, Warah and remote areas.\nThe hospital had three units and roughly over 130 cases of the above mentioned diseases were being admitted every month from among 650 to 750 patients reporting daily at the OPD, he said.\nA number of mothers who accompanied their ailing children complained that their children had contracted the diseases specially measles despite being vaccinated.\nDr Lal said that many women were not even unaware about the vaccination or they did not have the vaccination cards with them to confirm if their children had been inoculated or not. He pointed to a five-year-old boy lying on a bed nearby who could barely open his sour eyes and said it was the outcome of measles complication.\nHe said that perhaps a big portion of population was still unaware about the vaccination and its importance, and stressed the need for giving vitamin-A to children regularly to ward off eyes diseases. The vitamin-A was only available with government hospitals, he said.\nAssociate Prof Dr Shankar Lal, in-charge of unit-II, said the cases of measles, emphysema and resistant malaria were most common among children. \u201cWe are getting complicated cases of the diseases,\u201d he said.\nHe said that possible reasons behind the outbreak of measles was the vaccine, which might have lost efficacy due to poor electricity supply. The drug\u2019s efficacy might have been compromised in the absence of or interrupted power supply to cold storage for the vaccines stocks, he said.\nPoor economic conditions, food insecurity, battered communication, high cost of transport were also among the reasons behind multiplication of diseases, he said.\nHe said that unprecedented floods had not only devastated the infrastructure but also drastically damaged primary healthcare system, which had also tremendously contributed to unusual rise in diseases, he said.\nAssistant Prof Dr Dili Jan Magsi said that cases of measles were frequently reported both in acute phase and long term complications. The cases of malnutrition among children were also on the rise, he said.\nDr Lal mentioned another serious disease, sub-acute sclerosis pan encephalitis, which was connected with malnutrition and was to develop in 10-year-old children according to books but the children younger than that age were reporting at the hospital with the complaint.\nDr Magsi stressed the need for posting exclusive pediatricians in every hospital connected with teaching hospital so as to minimize burden of consultants.\nDoctors practicing at private set-up were also frequently receiving enhanced number of the cases of measles, resistant malaria, pertussis, malnutrition and other cases in post-flood period.\n\u201cMost of the cases we treat are resistant malaria and plasmodium vivax is the most common among them,\u201d said Dr Lal.\nThe professors were of the opinion that surveillances should be enhanced, ensuring availability of standard vaccine and the issues of food security must be prioritized coupled with focusing on creating awareness among masses regarding the immunization. Also damaged infrastructure should be restored and special campaigns should be launched against measles, they said.\nAsked about the medicines, they said that there was no dearth of drugs. The CMCH was regularly supplying the medicines to the children\u2019s hospital, they added.\n"

The owner, Qurban Ali, was booked for installing the connection for his hotel by cutting the waterline of Tilak Incline.\nWasa staff disconnected the connection in the presence of the engineer and reported the matter to the Hyderabad Development Authority (HDA) director general.\nThe hotel\u2019s opening had already become a matter of litigation which was allowed in a space that was meant for school-related businesses like books, stationary etc.\nThe hotel was sealed under directives of the Hyderabad deputy commissioner by the city assistant commissioner. Later, the hotel owner filed a case in a civil court where it is being adjudicated upon. The case has been fixed for May 11. \nThe owner has claimed that he had got the premises registered in his name.\nThe Jamia Arabia School is located in the heritage property and its one room, meant for some school-related businesses, was rented out to Qurban Ali, who was found using it for his hotel with different names and had also encroached upon public space as well, it was alleged. Some traders and area activists had raised the issue on the grounds that the hotel could not be operated on the premises meant for school purposes. \n"

Hence, the function of election commissioner was to hold elections and the situation would normalise if the Election Commission of Pakistan was allowed to function accordingly, he said.\n\u201cOur jawans have been martyred during police operation against dacoits in riverine areas of upper Sindh,\u201d he said, adding that they had planned to take effective steps to minimize such incidents.\nHe said that more check-posts would be constructed on embankments in upper Sindh in a bid to stop movement of dacoits and supply of weapons to them. The government would restore peace in the riverine areas by eliminating all dacoits, he said.\nProvincial ministers Syed Nasir Hussain Shah, Mukesh Kumar Chawla, notables and PPP leaders also accompanied the chief minister.\nEarlier, Federal Minister Syed Khurshid Shah, provincial ministers Syed Sardar Ali Shah, Imtiaz Ahmed Sheikh, MNA Nawab Wasan, PPP Sindh president Nisar Ahmad Khuhro, PPP Balochistan president Mir Changez Khan Jamali and leaders of various political, social and religious organisations arrived at Jakhrani House to condole with PPP MPA Mir Mumtaz Hussain Jakhrani and Mir Aijaz Jakhrani.\n"

            "Text": "LAHORE: The Lahore Development Authority (LDA) has decided to get the Lahore Division Mater Plan-2050 reviewed by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) \u2013 a renowned Swiss non-government organisation and the Urban Unit of the Punjab Planning and Development Department.\nThe review will be conducted soon after the LDA gets certified copies of the Lahore High Court\u2019s detailed judgment under which the implementation of the plan was suspended in January, 2023.\nThe LDA has also directed the officers concerned of its metropolitan wing to only entertain the applications seeking approval of new housing schemes or land subdivisions under the Master Plan-2016, Dawn has learnt.\n\u201cIn its short order on Jan 10, 2023, the LHC had suspended enforcement of the new master plan-2050 approved by the LDA\u2019s governing body in a meeting presided over by the then chief minister Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi. The LHC, during hearing was also of the view that the plan should have been shared with some independent experts or entities for consultation before being approved by the LDA\u2019s governing body. The court, besides suspending the plan with a direction to not implement it, also sought its reviwe by the WWF and the Urban Unit, keeping in view the growing urban issues in the Punjab capital,\u201d a senior LDA official explained while talking to Dawn on Friday.\n\u201cWe are ready to do so, as the authorities concerned have directed us to follow the court order. But the court is yet to issue the detailed judgment. And as soon as we get it, we will engage WWF and the Urban Unit in this regard,\u201d the official requesting anonymity added.\nThe official said that following the court orders, the LDA is entertaining only those applications seeking approval of housing schemes and land subdivisions under the Master Plan 2016.\nTo another question, he said since the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) has also launched a thorough probe into the plan involving ex-CM Elahi and others associated with him in it, the LDA has handed over the relevant record to the bureau officers.\n\u201cWe are also ready to face inquiry if called by the NAB. We will cooperate with the inquiry officers and satisfy them,\u201d he added.\nThe court, while suspending operation of Lahore\u2019s Master Plan 2050 observed in January this year, said the random and aimless development projects of the government had made it difficult for the citizens to breathe. It also termed such projects a threat to the economy of the country.\nThe court suspended the plan\u2019s operation after being told in a petition that the approval of the plan by LDA was clearly a \u201cmanaged affair\u201d and designed to extend undue benefits to the land mafia and land developers. The petition alleged that the LDA miserably failed to consider the devastating impact the plan was likely to have on the already deteriorated environment of Lahore. It also said the Master Plan, which was to define how Lahore division would look like in the coming years, had actually left the people of the city at the whims of land developers, pointing out that the plan envisaged reduction in the green area despite Lahore\u2019s worsening air quality index (AQI) that deteriorated by 10.7 per cent each year, causing pulmonary diseases among its population and burdening the health facilities.\nA couple of days before the LHC hearing and order, an LDA team, led by the then director general Aamir Ahmad Khan, had also held a press conference on January 20 and claimed to have added 33,000 undeveloped acres of brown areas (the land allocated/notified for housing projects) into the green areas in the Lahore Master Plan-2050. According to the team, on the north side of Lahore (Kala Shah Kaku and Muridke sides in Sheikhupura district), the master plan team had taken 27,000 acres out of the undeveloped brown areas and declared them as green ones for agricultural use. Similarly, another 6,000 acres were also taken out of the brown areas along the Bambawala-Ravi-Bedian (BRB) Canal and marked them as green area or the National Strategic Policies in the master plan. The team had also claimed that the area (around 20,000 acres) which had been turned into brown was, in fact, already declared as brown in Master Plan 2004. However, in 2016, it was again declared green.\nMeanwhile, many acres were converted into built-up areas, prompting many people to approach the court over the declaration of brown areas as green ones in 2004. It had also said that some other chunks of land (12,000 acres) that were never considered for brown areas, but required to be made brown keeping in view the increasing demand and growth towards south, were finally added to the brown areas for the first time in the plan 2050.\nOn the other hand, the NAB has launched an investigation into allegations of illegal approval of the plan on Dec 21, last year, leveled against the former chief minister. On April 11, the NAB Lahore also wrote a letter to the LDA director general, asking him to nominate a focal person, conversant with the matters related to the approval of the master plan, to assist the bureau\u2019s combined investigation team in the analysis of the data, reports, surveys and other such documents.\nEarlier, on Dec 30, last year, the new plan had come into force after the LDA notified it for the public at large. The plan envisaged a new city centre in Gulberg and contained details of the city\u2019s future growth/expansion, settlement and plans.

            "Text": "LAHORE: As the wheat harvesting picks pace in Punjab, optimism about the final yield figures is growing as well: for the first time since the crop life cycle began, the provincial planners sound confident that they could cross 20 million tonnes mark.  \nThe Federal Committee on Agriculture (FCA) had assigned a target of 21m tonnes, which the province is set to miss by a million tonnes, but at one point in time, it had feared much more losses because of torrential rains, wind and hailstorms at wrong times damaging the crop.  \nHowever, two most crucial positive factors \u2013 timely sowing and the month of March staying cooler \u2013 seem to have outweighed negative factors like heavy rains hitting the crop at wrong time and wind and hailstorms lashing and flattening the crop in the last four weeks.\n\u201cIn the end, the fact that 90 per cent of wheat was sown by the end of November has proven crucial for the final figures,\u201d explains an official of the Crop Reporting Service, who are monitoring cutting of crop for final assessment. Around 65pc of reference plots have been harvested and overall 50pc of crop stands harvested: in south, harvesting ratio might have gone beyond 80pc. Though the department has still not calculated the final yield, it should not anyway be less than 20m tonnes. By how much margin, the province crosses 20m tonnes, cannot be said with certainty at this point in time.  \n\nTimely sowing and cooler March being cited main reasons for healthy yield\n\nThe department would be in a better position to assess it after the Eid holidays, when harvesters return to field and the rest of the 9.10 million hectors are harvested, he says confidently.  \nIn the recent meeting of the FCA, the committee had feared 1.6m tonnes loss \u2013 26.81m tonnes of production against 28.40m target \u2013 but it mainly comes from drop in area under the wheat crop, says Muhammad Jawad \u2013 a wheat watcher and trader from the city. Against the target of 9.3 million hectors, the crop was sown only on 9.1m hectors. This loss of 200,000 hectors now translates into losses. Otherwise, the Punjab\u2019s average yield may not be less than last year, which was 30.89 maunds per acre. This season, it may be little up because of timely sowing and crop escaping the heatwave throughout its life cycle, he assures.\nExplaining the loss of areas, Abad Khan, a farmer from the central Punjab, says that wheat has been losing to competing options. Edible oil crops (like sunflower) had outshone it, hogged substantial area and pushed wheat out. This year\u2019s timely wheat sowing was the result of cotton failure last year. With many better performing seed varieties of cotton, the challenge would return to wheat next year. \nHowever, with substantial increase in wheat price, its economic aspect should improve and it should be able to compete with other crops. But, how much it does, only time would tell, he concludes.\nThough the field reports are positive, the Food Department\u2019s policy of suppressing inter-district movement is creating doubt in farmers\u2019 mind that all might not be as good as the Crop Reporting and the Agriculture Department is portraying, describes Muhammad Latif, a farmer from Sheikhupura district. If these reports are true, the Punjab government should have told its Food Department to free the wheat trade and let people enjoy some drop in prices because of abundance of commodity. But, it has not been the case, which leaves different arms of the provincial government behaving differently \u2013 contradicting each other \u2013 and sowing doubts among the farmers. It needs to be checked who is telling the truth and who is not, he demands.\n"

        "Details": {
            "Text": "Ever since I mentioned in these columns that the pre-Akbar era can be classified as \u2018ancient\u2019 Lahore, and the following time as merely \u2018old\u2019 Lahore, readers have wished to know which of the ancient \u2018wonders\u2019 remain.\nIt is worth recalling these \u2018wonders\u2019, but allow me the luxury of drawing the timeline to pre and post-700 years. That adds a lot of credence to the list. So in this column let me narrate, very briefly, which are those seven \u2018wonders\u2019 of Ancient Lahore that need reminding.\nThe very oldest monument of Lahore is the Temple of Lava, situated inside the Lahore Fort. Prince Lava was one of two sons of the ruler Rama, call him a \u2018god\u2019 as the Hindus recall him. Lahore or the habitation that emerged on the mounds of Lahore, was named after Lava. His other brother was Kush, after whom Kasur was named. Just to clarify that Lahore was also known by several other names, but Lahore of Lava is the one that prevailed.\nJust one geographic fact needs to be kept in mind. The ground level of the temple equated with that outside the fort. So a safe assumption could be made that the temple was a pre-fort structure. We do know that the Lahore Fort was originally a mud-wall structure, hence the temple was a pre-wall construction.\nOver time it has been worked on many times, but the present structure is an Akbar-era one. The ground level remains the same, which is 25-foot below the inner fort ground level. The exact timeline of the original temple is difficult to gauge. Hence it can safely be assumed as the oldest \u2018ancient\u2019 monument of Lahore.\nNext on the list is Tibbi-wala Shiwala inside Tibbi Bazaar inside Taxali Gate. This again is a pre-Islamic structure whose ground level is \u2018one-and-a-half storeys\u2019 below the existing ground level. Now if we assume one storey to be 12 feet this would mean about 18-20 feet below the current ground level. Just as a measure the Shahi Hammam ground level stands 12 feet below the existing ground level. Mind you in days of old a \u2018storey\u2019 was 15-foot plus, depending on the construction.\nSo just how old is the \u2018shiwala\u2019? This is very difficult to gauge, unless the foundation stones are carbon-dated, which is a pastime our archaeologists do not indulge in. What we do know about this \u2018shiwala\u2019 is that Kanhiya Lal in his book tells us that this ancient structure\u2019s dome matched the outer ground level.\nSo almost 200 years ago this was the observation. We also know that the dome level was raised on the orders of Maharajah Ranjit Singh, who authorised Raja Dina Nath, whose house still exists inside Delhi Gate opposite the mosque of Wazir Khan, to undertake this task. Hence the dome level was slightly raised.\nThird on the \u2018ancient\u2019 list comes the tomb of Ali Makhdum of Hajwer, known better as Data Ganj Bakhsh, or more correctly Abu\u2019l Hasan Ali al Hujweri. He came to Lahore from Ghazni in Afghanistan along with Masud, son of Mahmud, in the year 1039, and died in Lahore in 1072. The original grave of Ali Hajweri is 15 feet below the present ground level. The tomb has been reconstructed several times with a mosque in recent times constructed nearby.\nFourth on our list is the grave of Mahmud\u2019s Georgian white slave Ayaz. This grave, now in the middle of Rang Mahal at the end of Shahalam Bazaar, was originally located outside the ancient mud-walled city in an open space of the \u2018rehra maidan\u2019 to the east of the city. Once Akbar expanded the city with baked-brick walls, it ended up in the middle of the new Akbar-era city.\nNext we move to the fifth monument in our list of seven \u2018wonders\u2019 of the Ancient Lahore. That is the grave of Qutbuddin Aibak, the first slave ruler of Lahore (1194-1205 AD). He died after a horse-fall while playing polo to the south of the ancient city, and was buried at the place where he fell. Today that is part of the Anarkali Bazaar.\nWhen ZA Bhutto came to power he, among his first orders was, to get a tomb built on the grave of Aibak. He gave a press statement that \u201chow could a nation live with its finest ruler lying unknown in a servant quarter off Anarkali Bazaar\u201d. So it was that an impressive tomb was built for Aibak and the road renamed Aibak Road. As a young journalist then at the airport he would invariably ask me about progress on the tomb.\nThen we move on to the famous Niwin Masjid inside Lohari Bazaar near Chowk Matti on Kuchha Dogran. This well-known ancient mosque was first built in 1460 during the Lodi rule of Bahlul Lodi. In the Sikh rule this was one mosque that remained untouched, as it was 25-foot below the ground level. Plus probably as it was a very small mosque barely able to accommodate 100 people, it was considered not of any importance.\nLastly, we must mention the tomb, and much later a mosque, of Pir Sirajuddin of Sheraz. Located inside Lohari Gate in Jaura Mari in Mohallah Pir Sherazi, it represents a 700-year old sage who came to Lahore from Bukhara in the Tughlaq period. The Pir was known for the miracles that he predicted. Very soon he became famous in the city and people flocked to consult him.\nSo we have these seven \u2018ancient\u2019 wonders of Lahore that can still be seen. They are \u2018wonders\u2019 because they have survived the seven terrible massacres and invasions that the city of Lahore has been through, always managing to re-emerge with greater glory.\nAll of these ancient monuments are the least known among our scholars and people of our city. Probably this reflects the level of learning that people have of our wonderful ancient city. Of all our recent past rulers, probably only ZAB worried most about these matters. The others one need not bother about.\n"

            "Text": "QUETTA: Despite being behind bars, Mahil Baloch continues to appear in the media, making confessional statements.\nThe 27-year-old single mother of two, who belongs to the Gumazi area of Kech district, was arrested by the Counterterrorism Depar\u00adtment (CTD) of Balochistan in March this year.\nAuthorities accused her of being a member of the banned Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF) and alleged that she was planning a suicide attack.\nBut unusually for such a case, the under-custody Mahil has recently been interviewed by a number of media outlets. After the interviews aired, Baloch activists took to social media, terming it a \u201cmedia trial\u201d.\nIn conversations with Dawn, Baloch activists, parliamentarians and rights workers assert that Mahil is being paraded on TV and derided in a bid to rebuke her community, especially women activists, who have been quite vocal about the human rights situation prevailing in Balochistan.\n\nBaloch activists decry televised interviews of arrested woman; CM\u2019s spox claims media appearances meant to placate concerns about her well-being\n\nIn a report recently released by its fact-finding mission, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan observed \u201ca palpable sense of anger among ordinary citizens, many of whom went so far as to refer to Balochistan as a \u2018colony\u2019 of the state during meetings with the organisation\u201d.\nThis situation, the HRCP cautioned, should serve as a wake-up call for the state authorities.\nShakeela Naveed Dehwar, an MPA from BNP-M, has been outspoken inside and outside the Balochistan Assembly on issues confronting women in her province. There is a trace of indignation in her voice while discussing Mahil\u2019s case with Dawn.\n\u201cShe is a poor lady, who has been deliberately brought on media to give a bad name to women activism in the province because women are at the forefront in Balochistan in the protests to recover the missing persons,\u201d she said.\nHowever, Babar Yousafzai, spokesperson for the Balochistan chief minister, told Dawn: \u201cAfter gathering intelligence, our law enforcers arrested Mahil Baloch because she was a potential suicide bomber, who wanted to carry out a suicide attack in Quetta. She has confessed to be so not only in the video but also before a court of law.\u201d\n\u201cAfter being interrogated, she also confessed that her husband was associated with the BLF, which is why she was hired too after being brainwashed,\u201d Mr Yousafzai claimed.\nIn reply to a question as to why the media was allowed to interview Ms Mahil, he said: \u201cAs you know, Balochistan is a tribal society; she was [brought in front of] the media to show that she is fine, and there is no injustice being done to her.\u201d\nNasrullah Baloch, chairman of the Voice for Baloch Missing Persons, told Dawn: \u201cWe have always demanded that Baloch people should not be implicated in bogus cases. They must not be subjected to any illegality until or unless they are found guilty in a court of law.\u201d\nHe suggested that there should be a parliamentary committee, comprising all political parties, to go to Mahil Baloch to hear her out and ascertain whether her statements are being taken under duress or not.\n\u201cBecause what she is facing is against the constitution and against human rights.\u201d\nLike other female activists, Sammi Deen Baloch, the daughter of Dr Deen Mohammad Baloch, has been campaigning for the release of her father and other missing persons since the former went missing from Khuzdar while he was on a night duty at a hospital in the year 2009.\n\u201cMahil was picked up by the CTD from her place, in front of family, while her children were released next day,\u201d Ms Sammi tells Dawn.\nShe claimed that Ms Mahil\u2019s family has not been allowed to meet her.\n\u201cThis is all being done to counter the Baloch female\u2019s activism,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I am pretty sure about is that Mahil\u2019s case is not being looked into as per law, as the law itself says a confessional video recorded in detention is not acceptable,\u201d she pointed out.\nEven MPA Dehwar said that despite being a minister, her attempt to meet Ms Mahil remained fruitless. Habib Tahir, vice chair of HRCP\u2019s Balochistan chapter, while commenting on these claims and counter-claims, said: \u201cUnder these circumstances, there should be an independent commission in the Mahil case as it has become a high-profile matter. Besides, the court should order a neutral, joint investigation into the matter to determine whether she is involved or not.\u201d\nThe recent wave of Baloch women being detained has been going on since Karachi University bombing when Shari Baloch, a 31-year-old mother of two, blew herself up, killing four people, including three Chinese citizens.\n\u201cSince then, Baloch women are being detained, and the case of Mahil Baloch is not a new phenomenon. Being an MPA myself, I am watched with suspicion in Islamabad or elsewhere in the country due to my traditional Balochi clothes,\u201d Ms Dehwar says.\n"

I pray for him to be granted the highest ranks in Jannah just like he got the most auspicious day to leave this world,\u201d his eldest son Najeeb Baig told Dawn in a sombre voice.\nAfter spending more than a decade in the PPP, he parted ways with the party in August 2011. Mr Baig, who was once very close to Benazir Bhutto, used to tell his friends that after Ms Bhutto\u2019s tragic death, he was finding it difficult to stay in the party as he was not in the good books of the new leadership, mainly because of his straightforward attitude and bold stance on national issues.\nIn 2012, he joined PML-N, but did not apply for a Senate ticket, fearing there could be resistance within the party as he was a newcomer. However, when PML-N came to power after the 2013 polls, he was appointed chairman of the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP).\nAlthough Mr Baig had developed a good rapport with Nawaz Sharif, other senior leaders never really accepted him in the party.\nAfter serving the BISP for almost a year, Mr Baig resigned, reportedly after developing some differences with a key minister.\nLater, he was appointed chairman of the Pakistan Industrial Development Corpor\u00adation, but according to one of his friends, journalist Rauf Klasra, he did not attend the office for a single day.\nAnother close friend of Mr Baig\u2019s, Wasim Haqqi, told Dawn he was born in Karachi in 1945, and that his father passed away while he was still a young man.\n\u201cEnver joined his grandfather\u2019s business of manpower export \u2014 M/s Jan Muhammad and Brothers \u2014 and remained associated with it till he breathed his last. He was very close friend of veteran PPP leader Makhdoom Amin Faheem, who had introduced him to Ms Bhutto.\u201d\nOn the day Ms Bhutto was assassinated, Enver Baig was in Lahore owing to his son\u2019s wedding. Although, he was not ready to leave Rawalpindi as there was a public meeting on that day, Benazir Bhutto herself suggested he should go to Lahore and attend his son\u2019s wedding, Mr Haqqi recalled.\nFormer Senator Farhatullah Babar termed Mr Baig \u201can outspoken senator, a highly successful businessman, a sports lover and above all a very fine human being\u201d.\n\u201cIn the Senate, he spoke on issues with great clarity and conviction and always seemed well-prepared,\u201d said Mr Babar.\nMr Baig was fond of throwing parties, which made his home a hub of social and political gatherings. As a sport lover, he was keen that sports bodies were governed only by their constitutions and not on personal whims.\nIn 2007, Mr Baig asked the Public Accounts Committee to audit the PCB  and in 2009, he accused the Pakistan cricket players of being involved  in match fixing.\nMr Babar recalled that once Mr Baig moved a privilege motion against the then-chairman of Pakistan Cricket Board when the latter made some remarks in response to criticism of the PCB\u2019s failure in finalising its constitution.\nMr Babar stated that even after leaving the PPP and joining a rival political party, Mr Baig never spoke ill about his old party\u2019s leadership and always wore a smile.\nMr Baig also served as the honorary consul general of Republic of Uruguay as well as president of the Pakistan Overseas Employment Promoters Association. He headed the Senate Standing Committee on Manpower and Overseas Pakistanis and the FPCCI\u2019s Standing Committee on Diplomatic Affairs.\nMr Baig is survived by his widow, Ayesha Enver Baig and seven children \u2014 Najeeb, Ambreen, Nosheen, Naveen, Sameer, Issam and Adnan.\nHe will be laid to rest at the H-11 Graveyard on Saturday (today) at 2pm.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: Findings of a study on women\u2019s work burden and their effects on child labour says the Punjab government has not yet formally recognised the role of women agriculture workers who still do not benefit from legal protection regardless of their contribution to the agricultural labour force.\nThe study, \u2018Gender roles related to work burden and child labour in agriculture in Punjab\u2019, carried out by the Punjab Economic Research Institute with the support of United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), suggested that agricultural policy, extension advisory services, training activities and education strategies should recognise the central role of women in small-scale agriculture and it should be more inclusive. Citing example, it says extension advisory services and training activities should be offered to the entire households rather than only to the males.\nIn the surveyed communities, 69.1 per cent of women reported their primary occupation to be household work (which also includes agricultural work for home consumption such as tending for small ruminants) and 24.3pc reported agricultural labour as their second occupation. On the other hand, 28.7pc of surveyed men indicated they were farmers while 36pc mentioned agricultural labour as their main occupation.\nDuring planting and harvesting seasons, the demand for labour increases and women commonly work from 8 to 10 hours per day in the field on top of the 4 to 5 hours per day they need to perform their households related tasks, the study found.\n\nWomen workers do not benefit from legal protection, says study\n\nGaps in women\u2019s skills are recognised as a major barrier to diversify their roles and undertaking income-generating activities. Focusing in Multan, Bahawalpur and Multan districts, the study found that the provincial government does not offer training opportunities to women on any of the tasks that women are commonly engaged in. \n\u201cThere are no government initiatives to enhance income-generating skills for women working on these small-scale farms.\u201d Resultantly, when demands for paid skilled agriculture labour are high, men are preferred over the women, due to their skills and knowledge, the study points out.\nIt recommended that agriculture policies should be reviewed with a gender lens to engage more women in agriculture extension services, input supply, and access to finance, among others. There is a need to build rural women\u2019s capacities for increased participation across the crop value chain. The public and private sectors should offer tailor-made financial products for rural women.\nSchool curricula should include more content on good agricultural practices for small-scale farming. More women should be employed by agro dealer shops to encourage women farmers to visit the shop for crop related transactions.\nThe study suggested that enabling women to organise themselves will help in building social cohesion in rural communities and empowering women to invest in small businesses. The public and private sectors should support the establishment and strengthening of organised farmer groups, such as cooperatives and associations to streamline the women\u2019s participation.\nThere is need to address some of the key gender based constraints and their impact on child labour in these rural communities, policies and strategies. This would require strengthening parenting and community education initiatives to address harmful practices and social norms that perpetuate child labour, while collaborating with national and local governments to prevent exploitation and abuse.\nNational and provincial policies and strategies need to support increased access to quality education and provide comprehensive services to keep children educated, informed and protected. Smallholders, including tenant farmers and sharecroppers, require special attention from policymakers for improved rural extension and advisory services, farmer training, resources, information, and organised platforms for voicing their needs.\n"

The policeman along with some civilians was injured.\nTayyab\u2019s death took the number of the police personnel martyred in Swabi during Ramazan to three. Earlier, an assistant sub-inspector and another policeman were martyred when militants lobbed a grenade on their vehicle in Yar Hussain Bazaar.\nThe funeral prayers of the martyred constable were held at Shahmansoor police lines. \nDistrict police officer Najamul Hassain, politicians, relatives and local people in large numbers attended the funeral.\nA police team saluted the coffin of the martyred cop.

He also admitted that he had also looted cash from people coming out of ATMs.\nExplaining his modus operandi, the robber said he would give lift to people on his motorcycle, taken them to a secluded place and loot them at gunpoint.\nASSISTANCE SOUGHT: The differently-abled people on Friday complained despite their repeated demands no one came forward to give them special Eid packages this year.\nSpeaking at a meeting here, Rehman Sher, president of Khidmt-i-Mazooran, said special people could not work and had to depend totally on others to make both ends meet amid the record inflation.

This is an attack on our resources,\u201d he said.\nMr Kundi said that the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz had \u201cpushed him to the wall\u201d and therefore, he would decide his future course of action soon.\n"

He said the leaseholders were resisting the TMA bid to re-auction its properties and fix rent as per the market rate.\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity, the official told Dawn that the TMA had no concrete policy to charge the leaseholders as per the rates prevalent in the market.\nThe official said the first 33-year lease period had expired 1988. In the first auction, the leaseholders were to pay an annual lump sum rent of a few hundred rupees with a 30 per cent increase every three years. He added that the second auction was made in 1988, whereby 10 per cent annual increase was to be paid by the leaseholders with nominal annual rents.\nThe official said the third auction had been pending since 2021, adding the occupants of 600 shops were now paying only Rs7,000 to Rs15,000 per annum. He said the open market rent of a shop in Kohat was Rs30,000 per month.\nThe official said the leaseholders had also not paid premiums at the time of the auctions.\nHowever, he said the owners of newly-auctioned shops and plazas were paying Rs5,700 monthly rent after having a premium of Rs3 million.\nHe also claimed some TMA leaseholders had sub-let shops for Rs35,000 per month, but the municipal body overlooked it.\nHe said after the 1955 auction, the leaseholders paid rent annually, while the rent was paid monthly by the leaseholders under the 1988 auction.\nMeanwhile, sources confided to Dawn that TMA staff received bribes from leaseholders to put off the re-auction of shops and plazas.\nThey said the occupants of the plots were not vacating the shops on the pretext that they had constructed shops by selling their jewellery.\nNADRA CENTRE: Social, political circles and students have assailed the authorities for shifting the Nadra facilitation centre from the Old Bus Stand area to the Bacha Khan library and sealing its two halls for the purpose.\nSocial activists Pir Shah Nawaz, Majid Falook Advocate and others said libraries needed complete silence so that people could study there with full concentration.\nThey said the decision would deprive the readers of a calm environment to study and a good source of learning.\nThey threatened to move the Peshawar High Court against the decision.\n"

            "Text": "KARACHI: When Sarfraz Ahmed, Pakistan\u2019s former captain, took to the pitch of the Jinnah Government College cricket ground years ago during his student life, the outfield was dusty and uneven. He batted on a cemented wicket, conditions so poor that spectators would park their motorcycles beyond the boundary ropes and sit on them to watch the action.\nSarfraz remains the most high profile cricketer the college has produced. The man who led Pakistan to the Champions Trophy in 2017, and staged a Test comeback earlier this year, forged a career playing on an inadequate college ground. As did his college and eventual Pakistan team-mate Anwar Ali. In 2006, the duo were part of the Pakistan side that won the U-19 World Cup; Sarfraz the skipper and fast bowler Anwar the player-of-the-final.\n\u201cI played club level as well as college-level matches from 2003-2004 in the college ground,\u201d Sarfraz told Dawn. \u201cAnd I will always remember the role this ground played in my career even through its condition was deplorable.\u201d Not anymore though.\nThe ground has been transformed, now sporting a lush green outfield and a turf pitch. A boundary wall has been erected with proper sitting arrangements now in place for those who want to witness the action.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a very different feel now,\u201d reflected Anwar, while talking to Dawn. \u201cWe played for our college whenever we got the opportunity but during our time here, there wasn\u2019t even a dugout for the players, let alone a dressing room.\u201d\nIt was due to the efforts of the college\u2019s Director Physical Education, Professor Wasim Majid Rizvi, that the ground has been revived. Prof Rizvi told Dawn that he\u2019d been trying to get the ground restoration approved by the government for the best part of a decade.\n\u201cI joined the college in 1992 and noticed that the cricket ground was the largest in any of the educational institutions in Karachi,\u201d said Prof Rizvi. \u201cThat was my motivation to develop it as there were better grounds in other institutions.\n\u201cThen, our cricket team had been dominating the Inter-College tournaments so why not give them facilities to do even better,\u201d he added, noting that apart from Sarfraz and Anwar, other former Pakistan Test cricketers namely Saleem Yousuf, Hasan Raza and Mohsin Hamid had also featured for the college\u2019s cricket team.\n\u201cThe college has a legacy of producing good cricketer,\u201d notes Professor Tariq Salahuddin, who heads the sports committee at Jinnah College and had been actively involved in the construction work at the cricket ground. The restoration work has cost Rs40million but Prof Tariq believes that it will pay off with the emergence of cricket talent.\nEarlier this year, Jinnah College won the Pakistan event of Red Bull Campus Cricket and are now set to represent the country at the world finals for a third time, having also triumphed in the nationals in 2015 and 2017. On both occasions, the team couldn\u2019t go far, their only win at the world finals coming in 2017.\nBut the difference this time around is the fact that the team has a proper ground to prepare for the world finals.\n\u201cThe college\u2019s ground is helping us a lot now during our training and practice sessions,\u201d Fahdis Bukhari, the captain of Jinnah College\u2019s present side, told Dawn. \u201cNow we can practice regularly and through proper training we would increase our strength and hopefully put up a winning show at the world finals.\u201d\nFor the college\u2019s illustrious alumnus like Sarfraz, the new facility should be a springboard for greater success.\n\u201cI hope that the ground is maintained in the future so that new players from college teams can play here and benefit from it,\u201d said Sarfraz.\n"

            "Text": "TOKYO: The former chairman of a Tokyo 2020 Olympics sponsor was handed a suspended prison sentence on Friday along with two others, in the first convictions in a spiralling bribery scandal surrounding the event.\nCorruption allegations have mushroomed in the aftermath of the pandemic-delayed Games, implicating major companies and damaging Japan\u2019s bid to host the 2030 Winter Olympics in Sapporo.\nHironori Aoki, the 84-year-old ex-head of high-street business suit retailer Aoki Holdings, received a suspended prison term of two and a half years, a Tokyo District Court spokesman told AFP.\nAoki pleaded guilty in December to accusations that he and two colleagues bribed a Tokyo 2020 board member to secure sponsorship rights, according to Japanese media.\n\u201cThese criminal acts damaged social trust in the fair operation of the Games, which attracted world attention and were important for the country,\u201d judge Kenji Yasunaga said Friday in comments reported by Jiji Press.\nAoki, who had instructed a colleague at the time to destroy evidence,  \u201cwanted to pursue the interests of his company\u201d, the judge said.\nProsecutors had sought immediate jail for the businessman, but instead the court handed down Friday\u2019s sentence, suspended for four years.\nAoki Holdings was an official partner of the 2020 Olympics \u2014 which were held largely without spectators in 2021 because of Covid \u2014 allowing the firm to use the event\u2019s logo and sell officially licensed products.\nAoki was arrested in August along with two ex-colleagues and former Tokyo 2020 board member Haruyuki Takahashi.\nThe two ex-colleagues also received suspended jail sentences on Friday, one for a year and the other for 18 months. Takahashi, who is facing several separate bribery charges, has reportedly pleaded not guilty.\nTakahashi allegedly recei\u00adved $380,000 which he understood to be  \u201cthank-you money for the beneficial and preferential treatment\u201d of Aoki Holdings, according to prosecution documents.\nAn Aoki Holdings spokeswoman told AFP:  \u201cWe take the ruling seriously and will do our utmost to prevent a recurrence and regain trust from our customers.\u201d\nOther parties involved in bribery allegations include a major publishing firm and a merchandise company licensed to sell soft toys of the Games\u2019 mascots.\nThe former president of ADK Holdings, Japan\u2019s third-largest advertising agency, has pleaded guilty to offering Takahashi over $100,000.\nMeanwhile, in a separate strand of allegations, senior Tokyo 2020 organising committee official Yasuo Mori and three others have been arrested on suspicion of rigging a string of Games-related tenders.\nAnd in February, Japan\u2019s biggest adv\u00adertising agency, Dentsu Group, was indi\u00adcted along with five other companies for allegedly violating an anti-monopoly law.\nAs investigations continue, the country\u2019s Olympic chief warned this month that Japan could push its Winter Olympics bid back four years to 2034.\nJapanese Olympic Commi\u00adttee president Yasuhiro Yam\u00ada\u00ad\u00adshita said it would be  \u201cdifficult to move ahead without gaining people\u2019s understanding\u201d following the scandals.\nThe allegations are not the first time questions have been raised about alleged impropriety around Tokyo 2020, which took place during a Covid state of emergency and against the backdrop of public anger. The then-head of Japan\u2019s Olympic Committee, Tsune\u00adkazu Takeda, stepped down in 2019 as French authorities probed his alleged involvement in payments.\n"

            "Text": "LAHORE: While the tenure of Pakistan Cricket Board\u2019s Interim Management Committee stood expired on Friday, no decision was taken by the board\u2019s patron-in-chief Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif by the filing of this report to provide clarity about the Committee\u2019s future.\nThere was lack of response from the premier\u2019s office in spite of it receiving two summaries from the Ministry of Inter-provincial Coordination; the first requesting the patron to appoint two nominees to run for the elections of PCB chairman post and the other seeking a two-four week extension in the Committee\u2019s tenure.\nThe Najam Sethi-led Interim Management Committee was formed in December last year following instructions from the prime minister\u2019s office, which saw former PCB chairman Ramiz Raja ousted and the board\u2019s 2019 constitution revoked and replaced by the 2014 charter.\nThe PM Office back then had defined a four-month tenure for the Management Committee, two months less than what the current constitution requires in case of dissolution of the body\u2019s Board of Governors.\nThe confusion over Sethi and his Management Committee\u2019s legality, however, is unlikely to prolong and it\u2019s likely to be granted its due extension of two months required to complete the elections at the district level and in the remaining seven out of a total of 16 regions.\nDawn understands that the Board of Governors will be constituted within the next two weeks with a good number of departments committed to form their teams according to the 2014 constitution \u2014 in which departments and regions form domestic cricket structure.\nOnce the Board of Governors is complete, four elected presidents of the regions and as many departments affiliated with the PCB cast their votes to elect PCB chairman\n\u201cIt is not a big issue even if the prime minister announces his two nominees for the Board of Governors as it will be formed most probably by the first week of May,\u201d a source close to the situation told Dawn on Friday.\n\u201cSome forty-three small and big departments have already restored their [cricket] teams and there is no big issue remaining in completing the Board of Governors in the next two weeks,\u201d he added.\nDuring Imran Khan\u2019s reign as the prime minister from 2018 to 2022, the PCB adopted the 2019 constitution, which saw departments and regions replaced by six provincial association sides. Imran had also instructed departments to close down their sport wings, which led to many athletes lose their jobs.\nSince Shehbaz took office after Imran\u2019s ouster through a no-confidence vote in April last year, the incumbent PM revoked his predecessor\u2019s move to restore departments in sports and eventually instructed the restoration of PCB\u2019s 2014 constitution.\n"

            "Text": "NEW DELHI: After over a month-long chase, police have taken Sikh preacher Amritpal Singh into custody on Sunday morning, The Wire said. However, now the Sikh leader\u2019s incarceration has turned into a political football with an eye on a key by-poll to the Lok Sabha in Jalandhar.\nWhile Punjab police in a tweet claimed that Amritpal was arrested in Punjab\u2019s Moga district, others say he had surrendered himself before the police in Rode village, Moga. Rode village is the birth place of late Sikh militant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, who Amritpal idolises. It is from this village that Amritpal\u2019s dastarbandi was held before he took over Waris Punjab De, a pressure group late actor-activist Deep Sidhu created.\nSeveral news channels in Punjab are broadcasting statements of Bhindranwale\u2019s brother Jasbir Rode who claimed that Amrtipal had arrived in Rode village on Saturday night. Early in the morning, he prayed at the gurudwara in the village and then addressed the Sikh Sangat before police took him into custody.\n\u201cIf he had been arrested by the police [without surrendering], why was he being allowed to address the gathering inside a gurudwara?\u201d a villager asked.\n\nDiffering claims emerge regarding Sikh preacher\u2019s detention\n\nHe said police will of course present its narrative that he was arrested. But the reality is that he has himself surrendered to the police. Visuals of police taking Amritpal into custody from the gurudwara are already going around on social media. He is seen in his traditional Sikh attire. There are reports that he will soon be shifted to Dibrugarh central jail in Assam where his other colleagues were taken after their arrest. The last person who was sent there was Amritpal\u2019s close aide Pappalpreet, who, police said, helped him escape police arrest after a crackdown operation began on March 18.\nWhile the hunt for the Khalistan sympathiser Amritpal Singh is finally over, the leaders of the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Punjab, including chief minister Bhagwant Mann, are patting themselves on the back.\nMann said in a video message on Sunday that the government handled the law and order situation well and Amritpal was arrested without any bloodshed.\n\u201cWe could have arrested him earlier too. But we did not want any violence or firing,\u201d Mann said, justifying the delay in the arrest. In contrast to statements and videos suggesting that Amritpal surrendered himself in Moga district\u2019s Rode village, Mann claimed, \u201cWe got to know Amritpal\u2019s location late last night. I did not sleep. I was taking minute-by-minute updates from senior police officials till the time he was arrested.\u201d\nMann added, \u201cI want the youth of Punjab to have degrees in their hands, and not get brainwashed into doing illegal activities.\u201d There is a reason AAP is turning up the messaging after Amritpal\u2019s arrest. The state will see a crucial by-election to the Jalandhar parliamentary constituency on May 10. Even as this seat is a reserved constituency and Dalits make up almost 45 per cent of the total 1.7 million voters, AAP knows that hysteria around law and order and prevailing Sikh issues are likely to play a vital role in shaping the election.\nThe Wire explained the background. \u201cGiven that Punjab has a troubled history around the demand for a separate state in the \u201980s and those days are still fresh in public memory, the opposition parties will go full throttle to blame the AAP government for allowing radical elements to expand and hijack the state at the cost of public harmony and safety.\u201d But with the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) is painting AAP\u2019s Amritpal operation as anti-Sikh and the BJP is highlighting the Khalistan threat to target Hindu voters. Some point out that this issue may provide fertile ground for polarisation in the upcoming election.\nPolitical observer Harjeshwar Singh, quoted by The Wire, does not believe the Jalandhar by-election is getting too polarised for the simple reason that Amritpal did not enjoy much ground support \u2013 his support was hyped in the media. But he believes that law and order will be a buzzword on which AAP has been on a sticky wicket since the beginning, due to a string of high-profile murders and the expansion of radical forces.\n"

The report said that The White House declined to verify the assessment\u2019s authenticity, although it was labelled top-secret and bore the logo of the Defense Department\u2019s organisations.\nThe classified documents were posted online as part of a wider leak by Massachusetts Air National Guard member Jack Teixeria, who federal authorities said shared them with friends on a private Discord server.\nCurrent and former US officials told the Post that the leaked reports support earlier warnings that terrorist cells could return to life in Afghanistan.\nThe Biden administration, however, defended its counter-terrorism policies in a statement to the newspaper.\nThe United States \u201cmaintains the ability to remove terrorists from the battlefield without permanent troop presence on the ground,\u201d National Security Council Spokesperson Adrienne Watson told the Post.\nNathan Sales, the State Department\u2019s coordinator for counterterrorism told the Post that IS \u201chas the ambition to attack American interests in the region and ultimately the US homeland itself.\u201d\nHe urged Washington to make an urgent plan to attack the group\u2019s leadership and infrastructure.\nThe Afghan Taliban has rejected the US intelligence assessment as incorrect.\nA spokesperson for the Taliban\u2019s Political Office, Suhail Shaheen, said IS \u201chas been suppressed\u201d and the report \u201cdoes not reflect ground realities in Afghanistan.\u201d\n\u201cSuch reports reflect personal desires\u201d of their authors, he said, adding: \u201cThe fact is that the [IS] has no physical presence in Afghanistan as it had during the invasion.\u201d\n"

            "Text": "\n\nRehan Ahmed\n\n \nImaginative Pakistanis adjusted to make the most of their trimmed Eid budgets and celebrate the biggest festival of the Muslim calendar.\nWhere there was a need, parents swallowed the pride, even endangered life, to access whatever resources they could garner from wherever possible to buy joy for children and participate in festivities.\nEid economy, marketeers projected, shrunk uniformly by about 40 per cent online and offline to about Rs432 billion in 2023, the lowest in a decade. Spending on the holy occasion was highest in 2018 when the Eid economy crossed a trillion mark to clock at Rs1.1 trillion.\nThe expenditure dropped in subsequent years with the economic slowdown and dipped to less than half of the highest mark of Rs480bn in 2021 amidst lockdowns, sanctions on social gatherings and Covid fears.\n\nEid economy shrunk by about 40pc to roughly Rs432 billion in 2023 \u2014 the lowest in a decade\n\nThe political chaos might have had its impact, but the pent-up demand of two horrific pandemic years drove the Eid market up to Rs720bn in 2022.\nHowever, this was roughly the same level as almost a decade ago. In 2013, an intelligent guess, based on an extensive informal exercise of household spending on heads like, clothing, footwear, food, accessories, gifts and Eidi (cash distribution), etc, valued the Eid economy at Rs700bn.\nHyperinflation, massive lay-offs with suspension and shutdowns, pay cuts and an uncertain future did take its toll on the Eid economy in 2023. The official data (remittance inflows, pre-Eid bank withdrawals and the volume of new currency notes disbursed in Ramazan) will arrive with a lag.\nThe request to the State Bank for some indicative data that may help gauge the market trend was not dismissed by officials, but the material did not arrive on time for the story.\nAbid Qamar, the chief spokesperson of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), responded thus: \u201cThe information is readily available as the relevant officers are still working on the subject. It will take a day or two to compile the data for sharing. As for remittance, the SBP release data on a monthly basis is not Eid specific.\u201d\nThe projections, therefore, are based on interviews with businessmen, retail and wholesale leaders from all the provinces and consultants tracking online shopping trends.\n\u201cThe generosity and empathy of Pakistanis for their less fortunate country persons is exemplary. The culture of giving and money transferred to the deserving made up at least 10pc of the projected volume of spending at Eid in Pakistan this year.\n\u201cThe plunge in spending would have been much sharper had Pakistanis not been caring and sharing. Besides charities, better-off families have their orbits of needy persons who they support on occasion. It often includes not just their home staff but also their dependents,\u201d said a businessman sounding more like a nationalist thinker.\nThe leaders of the retail sector, besides the regular ones in Karachi, including Nasim Khan from Balochistan and Naeem Mir from Punjab reported very low footfall in markets. \u201cIt did not feel like Eid during the first twenty-five days of Ramzan for the better part of the day in markets. The rush is visibly less, even in peak hours in the evenings. Many customers can be seen returning empty handed,\u201d said Mr Mir.\nAbid Umer, a marketing consultant advising a host of local and global brands, confirmed sluggish business on online platforms this year on Eid. \u201cThe online market lacks the usual excitement levels of customers for similar reasons \u2014 the erosion of buying capacity owing to record high inflation in the country. It is safe to say that the market shrunk by 40pc.\u201d\nTalking over the phone, he said there was variance in consumer behaviour and preferences among different segments of shoppers, but the spirit was not upbeat generally though the base of online shopping has expanded with time.\n\u201cLike elsewhere in Pakistan, many people switched to online purchases during the pandemic to avoid risky trips to bazaars. Many, particularly youth, are allured to online shopping platforms by attractive deals and sale offers by companies and virtual shopping malls. With higher customer trust and improvement in payment options and swift delivery services, the practice has become normalised with even older people joining in for convenience,\u201d he added.\nIn Karachi, jewellers dealing in the sale and purchase of used ornament were kept busy. \u201cThe number of walk-in customers has dwindled. Mostly old customers are returning to sell or exchange ornaments,\u201d Mohammad Manana told this scribe when approached in his shop in Saddar to get the feel of the busy old market.\n\u201cThe exchange rate has rendered most imported consumer items beyond the reach of commoners. The children\u2019s wear segment that used to be dominated by Chinese, Thai and Indonesian stocks is now ruled by local companies,\u201d a retailer at Bohri Bazar said.\nMajyd Aziz, Chairman of the Economic Council of Employers Federation of Pakistan, responded to the query and said, \u201c2023 commenced on a sombre note with mills working much below capacity. The decrease in footfall of garments buyers and unstitched fabrics proves that millers rightly gauged the situation.\u201d He said many market visitors indulged in window shopping as their budgets hardly cover basics.\n\u201cWhen demand for even garments plummets, what can anyone expect from big-ticket items? The sharp spike in automobile prices has pushed it beyond the means of the earlier buyers\u2019 base. Construction cost hike put plans of home renovations on hold.\u201d\nHe said galloping inflation eats up the gains of remittance recipients. \u201cThis year will be remembered as the worst year for Eid business.\u201d\nGohar Eijaz, former All Pakistan Textile Manufacturers Association leader, believes that demand for cars and imported home appliances fell by 60pc this Eid.\n\u201cPeople are spending on basics such as garments and footwear with difficulty. They don\u2019t even aspire to buy durables right now. The cost of raw materials has shot through the roof due to devaluation and manufacturers are struggling to secure their margins.\u201d\nMoin Fudda, the chairman board of directors of Central Depository Company and former MD KSE (now Pakistan Stock Exchange) who sits as an independent director on multiple boards, also mentioned widespread philanthropy in the country to ease the hardships of the poor.\nHe thought the lifestyle of the rich might not be affected, but the current economic situation has compromised the shopping capacity of the middle class this Eid.\nKhurram Mukhtar, a textile tycoon from Faisalabad, believed that sales suffered this Eid significantly. \u201cThe drop seems to be in the vicinity of 40-50pc. People are struggling to cover food, rentals and other regular family needs. It would be na\u00efve to expect liberal spending by them on Eid.\u201d\n\u201cThe closure of textile units depressed the supply of fabric in the market and drove prices higher. Two days before Eid, wholesalers and retailers are still unable to offload old, finished stocks,\u201d he concluded.\n"

            "Text": "Training highly employable individuals is one of the key objectives of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). However, holding a HE qualification seems not to be enough anymore to secure a place in the workforce.\nThis is primarily because of HEI\u2019s lack of alignment of their degree programmes with the changing needs of the job market and subsequent failure to cater to the employers\u2019 expectations.\nThe outcomes include graduates\u2019 low employability, employers\u2019 dissatisfaction with their skill set, and a general sense of discontentment and disappointment among graduates as well as employers.\nWhat needs the most in HE is a consideration for updated, market-oriented, and demand-driven knowledge and skills, which are critical to the modern economy. The lack of market orientation of the HE has also sabotaged the potential of entrepreneurship, creating job opportunities as poorly trained youth have lower chances of setting-up successful businesses.\n\nPakistani universities have become parking places for unemployed youth\n\nThe situation is more complicated and precarious in the Pakistani HE system. A 2022 study by the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics shows that 31 per cent of university graduates are unemployed however, the unemployment rate of women with a university qualification is as high as 51pc.\nThis means that at least one-third of the educated youth in Pakistan is unemployed. This ongoing crisis of unemployment of educated youth in Pakistan is mainly because of the curriculums of the degree programmes HEIs offer.\nMost of these degree programmes focus on academic knowledge without a clear link with the job market and impart limited practical skills, which are insufficient for the job market.\nIn addition to the gaps in specific and field-related skills, there are shortcomings pertaining to general skills development which is appreciated in the job market. For example, effective communication and problem-solving skills are highly valued by employers, but graduates often struggle with these essential skills.\nThis clearly shows that HEIs in Pakistan have failed to prepare their graduates to live up to the expectations of employers. Pakistani HEIs\u2019 lack of relevance and alignment with the job market has not only failed Pakistani youth to realise their dreams but has also resulted in a very low premium on HE for graduates.\nDespite the low premium on HE and poor employability, the enrolment in higher education programmes is increasing day by day as well as the new programmes which are being launched by HEIs.\nThis is because HE in Pakistani society is a mark of social status and distinction, and the aspiring middle class does not want to be left behind. Hence, despite the atmosphere of uncertainty and poor prospects, parents try to finance the HE of their children.\nAs a result, Pakistani universities have become parking places for unemployed youth. Furthermore, the average age of students in HE programmes is very high because young people choose to further their education without thinking about their suitability for these programmes and expected returns.\nHowever, since HE requires significant investment, which has an opportunity cost, it is very important for HEIs to ensure better career prospects for those who invest in it. It is also important to understand that Pakistani HEIs\u2019 output indicators do not include graduate employability.\nFurthermore, developing students\u2019 competencies for the job market is not reflected in the faculty\u2019s and university\u2019s performance matrices either. This means faculty of HEIs have no incentives or motivation to prepare their students for the job market.\nBesides, the practice of rote learning in the Pakistani education system, which has an incentive in terms of good grades, also discourages real learning and developing competencies. Similarly, teachers teach a set curriculum and aim to finish the syllabus, which results in the absence of essential skill development.\nDue to this misplaced focus, a vast majority of students in HEIs struggle with effective communication, creativity, and problem-solving, the skills that employers highly value.\nEffective and robust HE is undoubtedly an important driver of a nation\u2019s social and economic progress. Thus, Pakistani HEIs must prioritise enablement as this will not only empower graduates to transition to the professional world but will also enable them to become useful members of society.\nHE, with these attributes, would help resolve complex problems in society, generate more opportunities, and create a social impact. This means the HE sector must be a research-based modern skill and knowledge hub that could supply trained manpower with market-oriented and demand-driven knowledge and skills.\nThis would require revamping and upgrading the HE, including the curricula of all degree programmes to meet the requirements of the job market.\nIt is needless to say that the Pakistani job market has the potential to absorb more HE graduates if their skill development is appropriate and aligned with the requirements of the job market. Hence, HEIs must shift their focus to the development of competencies of their students.\nCompetencies such as critical thinking, communication and presentation skills, and attainment of some practical knowledge could help young people secure a job and HEIs to enhance the employability of their graduates.\nThe modern job market demands dynamic employees with a knack for working in physical as well as virtual environments and are able to excel in the increased complexity of economic systems.\nLikewise, there is a growing non-conventional job market of consulting, freelancing, and gig work. This offers instant start, greater work flexibility, autonomy, exposure, self-learning, and rapid growth in income.\nHowever, HEIs have hardly taken any concrete steps to tap this opportunity, and graduates are not very zealous about this either. On the contrary, HEIs, as well as graduates, seem to be clueless about the skills required for this new and emerging job market.\nThis could be because this is not a substitute for a pakki nokri, and neither is there a promise for one in this new job market. But, hey, this is the next-gen \u2014 the old time is slowly going down in flames. So let us brace ourselves for this brave new world and take a fresh start.\nThe writer is an academic with a PhD in Economics and works as the Director Research Programmes for Social Protection Resource Centre (SPRC) Islamabad\n"

            "Text": "Pakistan as a state is still functional though there are fears that a prolonged political-cum-constitutional crisis may eventually paralyse it \u2014 at least temporarily. On the surface, life is normal, though very tough for the majority of Pakistanis.\nBut at deeper levels, the normalcy of national life remains under threat. Regardless of the outcome of the ongoing political/constitutional crisis revolving around elections in Punjab, the need for adjustments in the relationship between the state organs and their affiliate bodies will remain in place.\nHow those adjustments are made, or whether they are delayed again, will redefine the characteristics of our national life for a long time to come \u2014and have a telling impact on the national economy both in the short and long run.\nIs there a realisation of such a possibility at the highest levels of the state organs, including the parliament, superior judiciary and the government \u2014as well as \u201cthe all-powerful establishment\u201d? Do recent events indicate that the realisation is there? How best can things be sorted out to avoid such a possibility? Your guess is as good as mine. No one can say anything, for sure. Let\u2019s hope for the best.\n\nThe arrangement of foreign funds to avoid further depletion in forex reserves and to qualify for IMF\u2019s tranche will not automatically address the increasing economic issues\n\nHaving said that, let\u2019s look at how fast the economy keeps deteriorating amidst all the political/constitutional chaos. The latest update of the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) shows that large-scale manufacturing (LSM) output in July-Feb 2022-23 fell 5.56 per cent, and the year-on-year decline in February alone was 11.59pc.\nThe bureau\u2019s detailed data on the country\u2019s external trade of goods also reveals that during July-March 2022-23, Pakistan\u2019s food imports were almost double its food exports \u2014 $7.334bn against $3.815bn.\nThis sharp decline in LSM output can be expected to become even sharper at the end of the fiscal year in June, and the ratio of food exports to food imports cannot be expected to change significantly in April-June.\nLarge-scale manufacturing witnessed a worsening energy crisis and fatter energy bills after February. And, political chaos in the industry that always takes a toll on manufacturing has also gone from bad to worse after February.\nSimilarly, there is nothing in sight to suggest that the food imports bill will fall in April-June, and that too amidst softening of import restrictions from the beginning of this month. Nor is there anything to encourage us to believe that food exports will grow significantly during this quarter.\nDeclining LSM output also reduces the growth of small-scale industries, more so when the entire economy is in trouble as it is right now. And that causes a fall in total industrial output and leads to unemployment. That is what we have been experiencing in Pakistan.\nIn the absence of industrial growth, agriculture can be a game changer for the economy. But due to last year\u2019s super floods and record escalation in input prices, including energy prices, agriculture, too, isn\u2019t doing well. In fact, that is one big reason for the current year\u2019s big rise in food imports and a huge decline in some food exports.\nDuring July-March 2022-23, Pakistan had to import 14.7pc more wheat than in July-March 2021-22. During the same period, it exported about 19pc less rice volume than in a year-ago period. That, in turn, led to a greater outflow of foreign exchange than the inflow.\nOverall trade merchandise trade deficit in July-March 2022-23 stood around $22.9 billion despite all the tariff and non-tariff restrictions introduced earlier to contain it.\nIn the recent past, much hope was pinned on services exports for compensating partly for the deficit in merchandise trade. But the latest PBS stats reveal that in July-Feb 2022-23, services exports grew just 6.5pc on-year to $4.78bn \u2014 and the country booked a small services trade deficit of $340bn as services imports consumed around $5.12bn.\nIt is obvious that in services trade, too, Pakistan can either book a nominal deficit at the end of the fiscal year in June or, in the best-case scenario, report a small surplus \u2014 too little to impact overall external trade.\nSo, the country will enter the new fiscal year in July with a somewhat contained but volume-wise still large external trade deficit, negative growth in the industry and very low or no growth in agriculture.\nAccording to the already published estimates of the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Pakistan\u2019s economic growth in FY23 (ending in June) will be somewhere between 0.4pc-0.6pc.\nWith the industrial sector going through one of the most testing times in Pakistan\u2019s history, agriculture suffering massively in the wake of the super floods, and the services sector remaining depressed, the new fiscal year will open with huge challenges for policymakers.\nAre politicians and (supposedly) apolitical forces that share the current \u201chybrid regime\u201d prepared to meet those challenges? Well, it\u2019s difficult to say based on what has so far been shared with the media at large.\nInstead, politicians and their backers in \u201cthe establishment\u201d are apparently doing too little to end the further deepening of the current political/constitutional crisis that keeps compounding the economic challenges.\nAll that the people in power are telling the nation is how tirelessly the civil-military leadership has worked in recent weeks to win assurances of further forex support from friendly countries. That is undoubtedly an achievement in the current environment.\nBut the arrangement of foreign funds to avoid further depletion in forex reserves and to qualify for the IMF funds will not automatically address all structural economic issues that challenge us now, and that will challenge more severely in the next fiscal year. What the country needs urgently is a clear, detailed Economic Revival Roadmap. Where\u2019s that?\n"

            "Text": "\n\n\n \nThe history of well-established, principled and long-standing partnerships based on cooperation between China and Pakistan dates back to the earliest years when Pakistan was one of the first major countries to recognise the People\u2019s Republic of China.\nThis \u2018time-tested and all-weather\u2019 friendship is built on the strong pillars of bilateral cooperation on socio-economic grounds. Continuing the harmonious legacy of trust and collaboration, China has become the largest trade partner of Pakistan after the Free Trade Agreement was signed in 2006, where both countries have agreed to eliminate tariffs on a number of products.\nSimilarly, China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is a multi-billion-dollar infrastructure- development project consisting of a network of highways, railways, pipelines, special economic zones, power plants, and multiple other ventures.\nA consortium of Chinese investors, including the China Financial Futures Exchange, Shanghai Stock Exchange, and Shenzhen Stock Exchange, have purchased up to 40 per cent stake in the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX).\n\nDespite strong ties, Pakistan has been unable to significantly benefit from its relationship with China owing to incompatibilities between the socio-economic structures of the two countries\n\nIn spite of these developments, Pakistan has not achieved substantiate success in translating these endeavours into sustainable partnership programmes, which might further bring foreign direct investment (FDI), portfolio investment, transfer of technology, and knowledge exchange schemes between the two nations.\nSeveral multilayered challenges are observed at state-to-state, business-to-business, and people-to-people levels, which have affected the economic cooperation between the two countries.\nRegarding the state-to-state structural crisis, infrastructure gaps are of preliminary concern for the economic policymakers of Pakistan. The country needs to become more resourceful in terms of transportation, energy, technical and knowledge expertise, and communication framework.\nThe colonial nature of Pakistan\u2019s administrative structure and the western orientations of the majority of bureaucrats (with their dual western nationalities and academic degrees from western universities) are also among the significant challenging factors.\nOn the other hand, Deng Xiaoping\u2019s revolutionary reforms of 1978 completely transformed the nature of Chinese bureaucracy. A famous quote by Deng Xiaoping states that it does not matter if the cat is white or black. As long as it can catch mice, it is a good cat.\nConsequently, the Chinese have become result-oriented regardless of the socialist or capitalist nature of their counterpart. Delays in implementing some of the joint projects under CPEC by Pakistan\u2019s administrative and legal institutions annoyed these result-oriented Chinese.\nTerrorism in Pakistan, with its serious security implications, is probably the most important issue for both countries. The western border of Pakistan is the most sensitive and rather much more dangerous because of the historic designs of the roots of terrorist organisations in nearby regions. These organisations have proven to be serious threats to Chinese investors, engineers and workers.\nOn the political front, political parties, through proper communication channels, can facilitate diplomatic relations between the two countries. It can lead to a greater understanding of these nations on subject matters and hence enhance their level of cooperation.\nUnfortunately, no one major political party in Pakistan has any formulations of socialist traditions, values and principles. On the contrary, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), because of its central role in decision-making, is the ultimate socialist platform to deal with.\nHistorically, Pakistan, as a member of the South Asia Treaty Organisation, has always acted as a frontline state for capitalist powers against communist regimes of Asia. Pakistan also has a long history of military coups and authoritarian regimes, which always suppressed left-leaning political parties and their agendas.\nPoverty, inequality, corruption, mismanagement and underdevelopment have also made Pakistan a fertile ground for populist leaders and their movements. These leaders and parties, through popular slogans of being the only solution for all the prevalent issues, manipulate the sentiments of the masses. Through the knowledge of this reality, one can conclude that Pakistan needs to engage China on the political front as this is the only pragmatic solution.\nOn the business front, China has two developmental platforms in the form of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and the private sector. Former belong to government-controlled organisations, with their national goals and objectives, and which play a key role in a country\u2019s economic growth and social stability.\nSOEs have a stronghold in the sectors like energy, transportation, and telecommunications but have yet to make considerable progress in digital technology and e-commerce.\nOn the other hand, Pakistan\u2019s IT industry and academia are facing a significant crisis in terms of lacking the necessary equipment and talented manpower. Consequently, Pakistan lacks in terms of generating a digital economy.\nChina\u2019s private sector comprises companies which are particularly entrenched in electronics, electricity, textile, tech and E-commerce. These companies include Alibaba, Tencent, and Huawei etc.\nComparatively, Pakistan\u2019s private sector can not offer a valued contribution through product and process innovation. Contrastively, India has attracted a considerable amount of FDI from China over time.\nLast but not least, it is important to discuss the issues of People-people contact. In terms of establishing such contact between the people of the two countries, language difference acts as a major barrier.\nThough English can act as a mediating mode of communication, meaningful communication of ideas for developing mutual understanding is still an issue.\nBoth China and Pakistan have diverse religious ethnicities with different beliefs and spiritual paradigms. Pakistani society needs to be inculcated with pluralistic visions about the values, ideas, and religious perspectives of other nations. The lack of such pluralistic attitudes makes it more difficult for Chinese nationals to feel safe in Pakistan. Thus, it also affects their willingness to visit and establish relationships with the local people.\nBecause of the direct impact of these hurdles, Pakistan has failed to benefit much from its neighbour, despite its relationsip with the $17.73 trillion economy.\nThe writer is an assistant professor (PhD Financial Economics) at the National University of Modern Languages, Islamabad.

            "Text": "\n\nResidents of Keti Bundar, badly hit by sea intrusion in Thatta, transport drinking water cans to their village.\u2014Umair Ali\n\n \nFor Ahmed Khan Jat, the unending sea intrusion has deprived the area of its agricultural diversity and prosperity in the Indus Delta. The Indus Delta, which witnessed rich farming activities in the past, has become a painful saga of brackish seawater intrusion.\nFrom the experts\u2019 point of view, it is primarily due to inadequate Indus River flows to check intrusion in the delta. The river is the principal source of keeping the delta\u2019s ecology alive with consistent freshwater flows, which is no longer the case.\n\u201cAround 28 Dehs (revenue villages) have been devoured by the sea, but four are still fed by the irrigation canal although with inadequate flows for agriculture,\u201d said Mr Jat, alluding to the Kotri barrage\u2019s non-perennial Pinyari\u2019s irrigation supplies amidst the chronic mismanagement of the irrigation system.\nHis elderly fellow, Allah Warayo, another farmer, agreed with him. \u201cRice has been a common crop here as climate is best suited to its cultivation,\u201d he said.\n\nMany villages had to relocate and much agricultural land has been lost owing to the increase of brackish water\n\n\u201cThe delta was known for sesame and millet production. Our area used to witness ships anchoring on the coast in the colonial area, but soil erosion by seawater intrusion is permanent. We grew sesame back in 1981, but since then, my land has been barren,\u201d he remarked.\nMany farmers share similar stories about the loss of agricultural land and diversity after river flows were stored upstream in the northern plains. Sea intrusion was evident in lower Sindh\u2019s coastal districts.\nThe current Sujawal and Thatta districts form a larger part of the Indus Delta, said to be the seventh largest in the world. Silt deposits that Indus used to bring in tonnes to reclaim land are a story of the past.\nThe Indus Delta spans around 600,000ha and gets water only during the floods season, as witnessed in 2010, 2015 and 2022, although it is prone to natural disasters, including cyclones.\nA varying flow of 0.6m-0.9m cusecs had passed downstream Kotri and had some positive impact on the delta\u2019s ecology though temporarily.\nAltaf Siyal, dean of agricultural engineering faculty, Sindh Agriculture University (SAU) Tandojam, regularly works on sea intrusion. He believed the intrusion phenomenon is more pronounced in Sujawal than in Thatta.\n\u201cLand in Sujawal is flat. The mangrove population in Thatta is higher than in Sujawal, and the land is not that flat. Furthermore, wind direction in Sujawal triggers soil erosion, so Thatta has some resistance to intrusion,\u201d he said.\nTidal floodplains in Sujawal are assessed at 0.41mha, which is double that of Thatta\u2019s 0.2mha. \u201cIt is indicative of conversion of farmland into tidal floodplains,\u201d he said.\nFigures show Pakistan\u2019s coastline stretches over 1,050km along the Arabian Sea. A recent Sindh irrigation department\u2019s document on its proposed scheme of sea dyke construction in coastal parts of Thatta stated that around 80 per cent of the Indus River\u2019s flows to the delta decreased between 1935 to 2017.\nIt said that the delta had 17 creeks that used to receive freshwater flows, but now the active delta is reduced to only 10pc of its original size and is further undermined by climate change phenomenon.\nSeawater intrusion destroyed the coastal belt, mangroves and, above all, land loss, leading to migration. Communities keep shifting from one place to other after seawater ate up villages\u2019 land.\n\u201cOur village [Mitho Khan Jalbani] used to be 18km away from the sea in 2018. Now it is 8km away. We can get groundwater at a depth of 25ft,\u201d said Yaqoob Jalbani, a resident of Sujawal in union council Joigo Jalbani.\nUnending sea intrusion pushed the provincial irrigation department to plan the construction of a protective dyke. The project\u2019s cost was estimated at Rs4.52 billion, and it was to be federally funded completely.\nThe feasibility report was prepared in July 2021. A modified PC-I, at a revised cost of Rs4.96bn, was sent to the federal ministry for the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council\u2019s approval.\nAuthenticated data regarding the loss of fertile agricultural land still eludes experts to determine the actual loss of land due to sea intrusion.\nNational Institute of Oceanography, in collaboration with the Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources (PCRWR), Suparco and Pakistan Navy, lately started the project of monitoring seawater intrusion along the Pakistan coast (Balochistan/Sindh) at the cost of Rs731m in February 2021 after the release of funds.\n\u201cData gathered in the project will become a benchmark. Digital evaluation model technique is being applied, and drone-led surveys are being conducted in the Indus Delta covering Badin, Thatta, Sujawal and Karachi,\u201d said an official associated with the scheme.\nAccording to a PCRWR official, the project will reveal scientific findings about salt accumulation in groundwater. \u201cWe will know whether the groundwater table is increasing,\u201d he said. Piezometers are installed in Karachi, Thatta, Badin, Tando Mohammad Khan and even Hyderabad at different locations under the project guidelines.\n"

            "Text": "While businesses and domestic consumers have been hit hard by the worsening power crisis in Sindh, its solar, coal and wind power projects are unable to dispatch their entire output to the national grid for want of adequate transmission facilities.\nThe energy crisis has remained unabated though the province is blessed with abundant wind, solar and coal resources with cost-effective access through air, land and sea routes.\nThe situation has induced Sindh Cabinet to take what is described as a landmark decision to initiate power generation, transmission and distribution within the province. The move aims to provide electricity to consumers at cheaper rates, improve energy equity and eliminate energy poverty in the province.\nSindh Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Sepra) will be set up to end the province\u2019s dependence on the centre for fixing tariffs and managing loadshedding as provided under 7(4) of the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority(Nepra) Act. The draft Sepra law will be presented in the next session of the Sindh Assembly for enactment. \nSindh had earlier decided to form a provincial transmission and distribution company, and a transmission licence was obtained from Nepra on November 5, 2019. For unknown reasons, the initiative remained dormant.\n\nFresh private sector investment needs to be mobilised for new power generation, transmission and distribution projects \n\nNow the inability to convert rupees into dollars by Sindh Engro Coal Mining and Engineering Company (SECMC)  has reportedly created a backlog of non-payment worth $60 million to a Chinese mining operator. The company\u2019s output feeds coal power plants in Thar, generating 1,360 megawatts of electricity. China Machinery Engineering Corporation has reportedly cut its output by half and informed SECMC that it might halt production in a month.\nSECMC sources said in 2022, the company had made a profit of Rs8.47 billion and its cash and other assets \u2014 which can be converted into cash within a year \u2014 stood at Rs104.4bn, up 38 per cent from 2021.    \nSindh\u2019s move to set up Sepra follows the federal government\u2019s decision to devolve ex-Wapda distribution companies (Discos) to the provinces. Punjab has already completed feasibility studies of a power firm \u2014 Punjab Provincial Grid Company \u2014 and another for managing solar power supply for district and session courts.\nSubject to necessary due diligence by its finance department, Punjab may reportedly consider giving its consent to the centre\u2019s proposal to take over Discos located in the province only to the extent of transfer of assets, and not liabilities, along with management control.\nThe devolution of Discos posting enormous transmission and distribution losses is no less challenging than the stuck-up strategic privatisation of other loss-making state-owned enterprises (SOEs) surviving on oxygen tanks.\n\nAlmost two-thirds of the power plants are operating at less than 20pc utilisation\n\nAlmost two-thirds of the power plants are operating at less than 20pc of the utilisation factor. A World Bank report has estimated the government\u2019s support to the 14 largest loss-making SoEs at 0.8pc of GDP and support to all SOEs at 1.4pc of GDP for FY21.\nIt is time for fresh private sector investment to be mobilised for new power generation, transmission and distribution projects. The professionals and skilled workers in sick units can find jobs and pursue better careers in new enterprises with a future.\nThe solution to the poly-crisis lies in a bottom-up approach. What can be best managed at the provincial level should be outside the ambit of the federal government. Similarly, what can be managed by district governments should not be in the provincial domain. And the three tiers of autonomous government must cooperate to promote the common good while being responsible to each other. This calls for a new charter of rights and responsibilities.\nIn an article titled \u2018Stresses on the Federation, \u2019 Dr Hafiz Pasha says there is a strong need to strictly adhere to constitutional provisions in inter-governmental relations to strengthen the federation.\nTo quote a World Bank economist, the cash-strapped centre continues to spend every year Rs710bn or nearly 1.7pc of the country\u2019s GDP by running 17 devolved ministries and financing development projects in areas that, as provided by the constitution, fall under the provincial domain.\nAnd the huge duplicate spending is contributing to higher fiscal deficits and public debts besides keeping many federation initiatives underfunded.\nCiting fiscal constraints, the federal government has slashed its Public Sector Development Programme to Rs600n from Rs800b budgeted for the current fiscal year.\n\u201cThe socio-political-economic structure is highly concentrated in a tiny elite, where mobility for the majority is nearly impossible,\u201d states the book \u2018Big Capital in an Unequal World: The Micro-politics of Wealth in Pakistan\u2019 authored by political scientist Rosia Armytage. The tickle-down mantra has turned out to be fiction.\nAnd one may add that when capital crosses national boundaries, it losses its links with national social progress. So does centralisation not based on democracy.  \nThe separation of two aspects of democracy, autonomy and majority, makes democracy dysfunctional, according to a social scientist. This leaves the governments tinkering at the margins, with a much-reduced capacity to address the fundamental structural imbalances.\n"

According to PwC, companies that invest in and deliver superior experiences to both consumers and employees are able to charge a premium of as much as 16pc for their products and services. So how do leaders design EX to better align with CX? 1) Identify where the biggest gaps exist. 2) Find creative ways to directly connect employees and customers regardless of whether \u201ccustomer service\u201d is in their job description. 3) Integrate customer and employee journey maps to identify and diagnose customer problems. A map that correlates and calibrates the journeys of customers with the journeys of employees helps identify employee pain points that negatively impact the customer as well. 4) Integrate KPIs from both areas into a single view with a dynamic report instead of using separate datasets.\n(Adapted from \u201cEngaged Employees Create Better Customer Experiences,\u201d by Denise Lee Yohn, published by the Harvard Business Review)\nIndia\u2019s AI jobpocalpse\nIf the sort of technology underpinning ChatGPT displaces software engineers, no single country would be impacted more than India, home to over 5m coders. Not long ago, India\u2019s outsourcing firms were so hungry for talent that they didn\u2019t even mind if an engineer\u2019s background was in chemicals or mining. Training people through in-house coding drills was routine. Fresh-faced recruits are still highly valued in the sector, which builds software systems for global customers like Wall Street banks, Silicon Valley tech titans and the world\u2019s largest airlines and retailers. India\u2019s (and Asia\u2019s) largest outsourcer has made 46,000 campus offers this year. These days, generative artificial intelligence and ChatGPT start and dominate every client conversation.

The government is betting $38 billion on the country\u2019s potential to become the next hub for the video-game industry. There are approximately 21 million gamers in the country, according to analysts at Niko Partners. That\u2019s about 58pc of the population, compared with the US\u2019s 66pc. By 2026, the games market in the Middle East and North Africa is expected to grow by 56pc to $2.79bn.\n(Adapted from \u201cSaudi Arabia Is Investing $38 Billion To Become A Video-Game Hub,\u201d by Cecilia D\u2019Anastasio, published on April 3, 2023, by Bloomberg)\nLaid off on a work visa\nIn the US, work visa holders have 60 days to find a new employer to sponsor them after being laid off. Factors like hiring freezes, a large number of highly qualified candidates entering the job market, visa sponsorship limitations, and the added layer of cultural and language barriers, can make the job search difficult. While some people can buy more time by changing their visa category, for most, the best option is to find an employer who will sponsor them on their current visa. If you\u2019re a young professional on a visa who has recently been laid off, what can you do? 1) LinkedIn is still one of the best platforms to get connected with people and find new opportunities. 2) Drop a direct message or email people in your network.

            "Text": "A draft report, a pre-feasibility study (Pre-FS) on the potential for Energy Transition Mechanism (ETM) Opportunities in Pakistan, prepared by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to guide Pakistan on the decarbonisation of its energy sector has drawn a lot of criticism from numerous local and international advocacy and community-based organisations working for the promotion of cleaner and sustainable energy sources.\nThe ADB\u2019s ETM initiative aims to help willing countries reduce their carbon footprints through low-carbon investments and the deployment of clean energy technology. This way, they can strike the right balance between energy security, affordability and sustainability for the development of ecosystems that can sustain their economic development and alleviate poverty while spurring growth arising from the energy transition.\nWhen contacted to get the ADB and consultant\u2019s comments on the criticism against the report, its consultant Aman Ullah Mangrio said any query should be sent to the Ministry of Climate Change, which is the owner of the ETM project. \u201cIt\u2019s not appropriate for me to respond. Suffice to say the project is still in its early stages,\u201d he said by telephone.\nIn their comments on the report, organisations like the Alliance for Climate Justice and Clean Energy (ACJCE), the US-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) and Go Green, have more or less raised similar concerns over the ETM scheme report. \n\nConcerns range from lack of transparency to selection of power plants for early retirement \n\nTheir concerns range from lack of transparency to selection of power plants for early retirement to retention of gas-based generation to the preference given to expensive hydropower over variable renewable energy, and so on.\nThe first concern pertains to the lack of transparency and openness, which is against the lender\u2019s own policy of engaging with stakeholders and communities in an open and transparent manner. \nThe communities engaged constitute only those that have power plants and owner companies. The study neither includes nor considers the broader communities that are being impacted by the polluting power plants. There is no indication of carrying out an assessment for compensating the communities and areas that are adversely impacted due to the polluting assets, these groups argue.\nThese groups also highlight limitations to the ADB\u2019s Just Transition criteria. The document says the communities directly related to assets through employment will be resettled to other sources of employment, including any possible replacement clean energy projects. \nBut the missing part is the prioritisation of those areas where these assets are situated to create the potential for employment in clean energy projects. \nThis can end up disqualifying areas where there is a concentration of fossil fuel projects and prioritising those areas where there is imagined potential for clean energy resources, like sites conducive for solar energy and wind energy generation.\n\nTransmission bottlenecks cannot be \u2018assumed to persist\u2019 for 10-20 years \u2014 this is particularly important as the transmission will have a major impact on prospective investments, the type of investment  and its location\n\n\u201cThus, the areas where fossil fuel-based power generation is situated remain disadvantaged. And of course, there\u2019s no guarantee that the operators and engineers from a coal power project would simply shift to work on a solar, wind, or other renewable energy project, let alone that it would provide viable job options for local communities.\u201d\nThe clean energy groups have also expressed their surprise over the exclusion of gas-fired thermal power plants from the scheme\u2019s scope. They say this was a big issue since Pakistan is facing the worst economic crisis of time, and the energy crisis is the main contributor. \n\u201cThe major reason behind the energy crisis is the less reliance on local resources for fulfilling energy demands leading Pakistan to rely on imported energy sources with vulnerabilities attached.\n\u201cThe recent trends in the energy mix of Pakistan and government policies is to diversify its energy mix by minimising the share of residual fuel oil power plants and increasing the share of gas-based power plants and coal-based power plants. \n\u201cHowever, recent geopolitical incidents like the Russia-Ukraine war have totally changed the dynamics of the global gas market in the last year. The long-term contracts of EU countries with Qatari companies for ensuring the supply of LNG and less bargaining power of low and middle-income countries like Pakistan to ensure the required supply is a case in point.\n\u201cThe natural gas resources from Pakistan are shrinking and the cost of importing LNG is constantly putting a huge drain on foreign exchange reserves and the overall fiscal space available. Thus, the inclusion of indigenous natural gas-fired power plants and imported LNG-based power plants is justified considering the criteria like the security of supply and financial viability of the power plant. \n\u201cRecently, the government plans to expedite the process of privatisation of two LNG power plants \u2014 1320 MW each \u2014 that include Baloki power plant and Haveli Bahadur Shah power plant, as it is finding it difficult to finance their operations smoothly. In such a visible scenario, one wonders what criteria is causing the ADB to not consider gas-fired power plants under the ETM process.\u201d\nThey believe that the ADB\u2019s policy of considering gas as a transition fuel will not be the right remedy considering the climatic and economic vulnerabilities prevailing in Pakistan. \nGas-fired power plants have huge environmental costs in the form of air pollution like methane and other toxic sulfates. No wonder Pakistan has the most polluted metropolitan cities in the world. \nPlus, the infrastructure required, like LNG terminals (FSRU) for increasing LNG import volume, poses serious environmental and ecological threats. \u201cTherefore, we urge ADB to reconsider its decision not to incorporate gas-fired power plants in its Pre-FS studies for ETM Pakistan,\u201d state the comments. \nAccording to the IEEFA, the issue of the power sector\u2019s circular debt is highly pressing as its value reaches an unsustainable level of Rs2.5 trillion. \n\u201cAn ETM that targets the removal/repurposing of imported fuel-dependent assets can go a long way in lessening the burden of additional circular debt by reducing the accrual of both forex-dependent capacity payments and increasing fuel prices due to price volatility of imported fossil fuels.\u201d\nThese groups call for focusing on transmission and grid modernisation as these constraints are responsible for almost one-third of the installed capacity not being available to the system. \nTherefore, any recommendations for an energy transition mechanism should include prioritisation of investments in grid modernisation and de-bottlenecking to accommodate higher shares of variable renewable energy as well as increasing volumes of delivered power to consumers. \nTransmission bottlenecks cannot be \u2018assumed to persist\u2019 for 10-20 years. This is particularly important as the transmission will have a major impact on prospective investments, the type of investment and its location.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: After a lull of several days, a new leaked conversation has stirred up a storm in the country\u2019s political landscape, but this time the people involved aren\u2019t key political players.\nThe latest leaked audio purportedly features a conversation between two women, one of whom is said to be the mother-in-law of a top-ranking serving judge of the Supreme Court, while the other is spouse of one of the PTI\u2019s legal advisers \u2014 Khawaja Tariq Rahim.\nWhile the identities of the women in question could not be independently verified, the clip \u2014 which has been widely circula\u00adted on social and mainstream media \u2014 has evoked a stern reaction from across the political divide, along with calls for a thorough probe.\nIn their conversation, the two women were purportedly discussing a sub juice matter regarding the suo motu notice by CJP Umar Ata Bandial on the delay of elections to Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa assemblies.\n\nFresh clip purportedly features SC judge\u2019s relative, PTI leader\u2019s wife discussing early elections, bill to regulate top judge\u2019s power and martial law\n\nA three-member Supreme Court judge \u2014 comprising the chief justice, Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Munib Akhtar \u2014 is hearing the said case.\nIn the leaked conversation, the two women can be heard discussing the chief justice\u2019s prerogative to take suo motu notice, the law regulating the top judge\u2019s power and the possibility of snap elections and martial law.\nThe voice believed to belong to Mr Rahim\u2019s wife could be heard saying that she had sent a message to CJP Bandial stating that there were hundreds of thousands of people supporting and praying for him.\n\u201cI was present at the Lahore rally [and] hundreds of thousands of people were there,\u201d she said while referring to the PTI\u2019s rally at Minar-i-Pakistan last month.\n\u201cJust like that there are hundreds of thousands of people in every city and you can imagine how many people are praying for you,\u201d said the voice.\nIn reply, the voice of a woman said to be related to a serving Supreme Court justice, criticised the government whom she said was questioning the CJP\u2019s decision to exercise his power of taking the suo motu notice.\n\u201cNow they are saying why we got the authority to do it \u2026 and also questioning why suo motu [notice] was taken,\u201d the voice says.\n\u201cThis was his [the CJP\u2019s] right,\u201d the other voice replies while calling the chief justice\u2019s critics \u201ctraitors of this country\u201d.\nThe two women also discussed early elections, with one purportedly expressing the desire for polls \u201cas early as possible\u201d.\n\u201cIf elections are not held, then martial law will be enforced,\u201d the PTI leader\u2019s wife replied. \u201cThey [the incumbent government] can\u2019t stay. That\u2019s it\u201d\n\u201cThey are not ready to enforce martial law,\u201d the judge\u2019s relative replied in an apparent reference to the military\u2019s reluctance to intervene.\n\u201cThey\u2019re completely ready,\u201d the voice said to be a PTI leader\u2019s wife said before the clip ends.\n\u2018Unfortunate and serious offence\u2019\nReacting to the leaked conversation, senior lawyer Shuaib Shaheen termed it \u201cunfortunate\u201d adding that recording a private conversation was \u201ca serious offence\u201d.\nHe urged CJP Bandial to take notice of the matter and seek answers from the state.\nHe also censured the media for broadcasting an unverified audio.\n\u201cFor the sake of argument, if we presume the audio to be genuine, even then no one could point fingers towards the [senior SC judge],\u201d said Mr Shaheen.\nAnother senior lawyer Raja Inam Ameen Minhas called for a thorough investigation into the issue.\n\u201cIt should be investigated as it is not a routine audio leak. It is apparently related to the final arbitrator of Pakistan, therefore, this is a highly sensitive matter as well,\u201d said Mr Minhas who was the former president of Islamabad High Court Bar Association.\n\u201cA comprehensive investigation is indispensable to restore the trust of the judiciary in the eyes of a common man,\u201d he added.\n\u201cIf the audio is found to be fake, then exemplary punishment should be handed to those who tried to benefit from it.\u201d\n\u201cIn case the clip is genuine, then the law should take its course,\u201d Mr Minhas added.He said that the chief justice was due to retire in the next few months and he must clear his name before leaving the office.\n"

However, the nature of the explosion could not be independently confirmed by the time this report went to press.\n\nMalakand DIG says explosion occurred at weapons depot; three suspected militants killed in Lakki Marwat\n\nHowever, speaking to media persons later at night, DIG Malakand Nasir Mehmood Satti said the incident was not a result of any terrorist activity or suicide blast but \u201ccarelessness\u201d as per the initial investigation. He said the explosion occurred at a weapon storage facility inside an old office of the Counter Terrorism Department on the premises of the police station.\nThe police officer, however, said a probe was still underway in light of emerging evidence.\n20 trapped under rubble\nThe blast, which shattered the roof of the police station, the CTD office, and a mosque located inside the station, was also followed by a fire. According to senior police officials, at least 20 policemen were trapped under the roof, which collapsed due to the intensity of the explosion.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \nImdad Khan, an injured policeman at Saidu Teaching Hospital (STH) said that he was inside the kitchen with other policemen when the powerful blast ripped through the building. \u201cPortion of the kitchen building collapsed. A huge fire also erupted after the blast,\u201d he told Dawn, adding that he heard multiple blasts.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \nIn a comment on the number of blasts, the DIG said since the explosion occurred at the depot due to ammunition stored there, minor blasts also followed.\nEmergency was declared in health facilities soon after the explosion and Rescue 1122 teams rushed to the spot. Security was put on high alert following the explosion and the area was cordoned off by law enforcement agencies.\nMeanwhile, the Swat Olasi Pasoon announced a protest against the blast in Mingora today.\nThree killed in Lakki\nAmong the three slain militants was the alleged killer of a retired military officer who was shot dead at his residence by armed men on Sunday. \n\u201cA total of three militants including Nouman, who had targeted retired colonel Muqarab Khan, were gunned down in an exchange of fire at the house of a militant commander Zubair of the Tipu Gul group in Paharkhel Tal area within jurisdiction of Lakki Marwat police station,\u201d a senior CTD official disclosed.\nThe police said the ex-army officer, who had served in an intelligence agency, was receiving guests at his Hujra on the second day of Eidul Fitr when two unidentified armed men entered the Hujra and fired at him. \nCol Khan was killed while the armed men who had held others in the Hujra hostage at gunpoint managed to escape from the scene, the officials said.\nLaw enforcement personnel attempted to chase the assailants but they sped away on a motorbike towards Darga, a riverine forest.\nOn Monday, the officials said, Bannu CTD personnel received information about a hideout of militants. As they reached the hideout, the militants opened fire on them, they said, adding that it seemed around 10 heavily armed militants were well prepared for the encounter.\n\u201cThree militants, including Nouman, were killed and another militant, Tehseenullah, sustained injuries,\u201d a senior CTD official said. \nHowever, he said, the CTD believed other militants had sustained injuries and could be present in the area terming it the reason why a search operation was launched in the area by police and the security forces.\nThe officials said Inspector Javed Iqbal and Constable Irfan of the CTD were seriously wounded and shifted to the Combined Military Hospital, Bannu, and Khalif Gulnawaz Hospital.\nSenior CTD officials said that following the search operation, it was confirmed that an organised militant group was involved in the targeted killing of the retired military officer.\n"

The two former speakers agreed to meet on Wednesday. That was also confirmed by Defence Minister Khawaja Asif in a statement. However, Imran Khan said his party had not received a \u201cformal invitation\u201d from the ruling alliance to initiate talks.\nMeanwhile, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) called off its protest scheduled to be staged on Tuesday across Sindh against piecemeal elections.

He also said the PTI was not doing politics for personal gains but to drive the country out of crises.\n \n \n\nAnswering another question about Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari\u2019s proposed visit to India, Mr Khan said he had \u201csevered relationships with India\u201d when they had snatched Kashmiris\u2019 statehood by revoking Article 370 on August 5, 2019. He asserted that Kashmiris\u2019 martyrdoms should not go to waste and they must be given their due rights. \u201cPakistan can go for normalization of relations with India if it withdraws its decision of snatching statehood from Kashmiris,\u201d he said.\nA day earlier in his video-link address to the party workers at Zaman Park, Mr Khan said the PTI wanted to bring change through the power of the vote but the opponents were running away from elections. \u201cThe PTI\u2019s opponents should be put on ECL before holding elections so that they should not run away from the country,\u201d Mr Khan suggested.\nThe PTI chief said he along with his party workers was fighting a war for real independence in a peaceful manner. \u201cReal independence is the core objective of my party\u2019s struggle.\u201d\nHe said only those nations progressed that upheld rule of law, while those committing injustices failed. In Pakistan, he regretted, the powerful were getting NROs, while the weak were being picked by unknown people and tortured.\n \n \n\nMr Khan regretted that PTI\u2019s Instagram coordinator Attaur Rehman was picked and no one knew about his whereabouts for the past six days.\nThe PTI chief also tweeted that it had been five days since the PTI activist was abducted. \u201cWe demand his immediate release and an end to abductions & torture of our social media activists. These young people have committed no crime and are being penalised simply for being part of PTI\u2019s social media team,\u201d he wrote on his Twitter handle.\nTickets for Punjab polls\nPTI chief Imran Khan has called a meeting of review committees\u2019 heads and district presidents to explain the complaints of the candidates who were not given tickets.\nSources say many aspirants were complaining and submitting certain proofs to explain that they were better-suited candidates in their respective constituencies.\nThey say Mr Khan would listen to party leaders on complaints and may decide to alter his decision regarding the award of the tickets.\nWhile some 1,500 candidates had submitted their nomination papers to the Election Commission of Pakistan, Mr Khan said he could interview some 1,000 candidates before deciding about the award of party tickets. The PTI is supposed to take a decision about the change of party ticket candidate by Tuesday (today) night because Wednesday (tomorrow) would be the last date for submitting fresh party tickets.\nAnswering a question, Mr Khan said he would also interview women candidates looking for nomination on reserved seats. He said the criteria to select women candidates would be their loyalty towards the party and their capacity to contribute to the assembly.\n"

But at the time, no one could have imagined that within the span of 20-odd months, the party would lose its premier and its cadres would split into multiple factions.\nIndeed, matters seemed to come to a head on Monday night during a huddle at Zaman Park, where the party announced its intention to sit on the opposition benches in the AJK assembly and announced Khawaja Farooq Ahmed as the leader of the opposition.\nBut when Sardar Tanveer Ilyas came to power in April last year, after a successful no confidence motion against his predecessor and fellow party leader Sardar Abdul Qayyum Niazi, it was assumed that despite lacking political experience and skills peculiar to AJK, he would be able to complete his term.\nBut after he was shown the door following unprecedented judicial action by the AJK courts, the PTI\u2019s numerical strength in the house dwindled to 31 \u2014 four more than the simple majority needed to elect a new leader of the house.\nStill, it should not have been too difficult for the party to elevate another from within its ranks to serve as his successor, had the party\u2019s top leadership not been plagued by indecisiveness \u2014 their attention and energies being focused elsewhere.\nPolitical analysts attribute the party\u2019s \u2018defeat\u2019 in the recent election of the AJK PM to the unnecessary delay incurred by the PTI leadership in declaring their candidate for the prime minister\u2019s slot following the disqualification of Mr Ilyas.\n\u201cAfter the rejection of the former prime minister\u2019s plea for interim relief by the Supreme Court, Imran Khan should have nominated a senior and committed member of his parliamentary party for the office without wasting time,\u201d maintains Naila Altaf Kayani, a renowned social and political analyst based in Muzaffarabad.\nBut he dilly-dallied too long and, eventually, the matter spiralled out of his party\u2019s hands, she said.\nFestering rivalry\nNot many are privy to the rivalry of sorts that has existed between Chaudhry Anwa\u00adrul Haq, the new prime minister from the PTI\u2019s so-called \u2018forward bloc\u2019, and President Sultan Mahmood right from the time that the former joined PTI, shortly before the July 2021 polls. Interestingly, he was bro\u00adu\u00adght to the party fold by none other than the man he replaced in the AJK premier\u2019s seat.\nHowever, the relationship between Mr Haq and his benefactor became strained. Adding to this was his apparently friendliness with the PPP, which constitutes a larger chunk of the combined opposition, which gave the government cause for concern.\nAs speaker, Mr Haq is said to have encouraged the opposition to requisition sessions that he would drag on with longer gaps, sometimes spanning weeks. The recent assembly session, which saw him elected leader of the house, was summoned by him in the last week of February.\n \n \n\nAfter the erstwhile prime minister was disqualified, Imran Khan had proposed three names \u2014 acting premier Khawaja Farooq Ahmed, Azhar Sadiq and Mr Haq\u2019s \u2014 and asked the party to choose from amongst them.\nHowever, President Mahmood is said to have activated his supporters within the PTI to ensure that someone else was elected to the coveted office rather than anyone from amongst the three named by the PTI chief.\nIt was around the same time that Mr Khan asked Pervez Khattak and Asad Qaiser to rush to Muzaffarabad, but they failed to get the president to budge from his demand.\nThe issue then dragged on for a number of days, much to the detriment of the PTI\u2019s cause.\nConfusion within PTI ranks\nA day before leaving Muzaffarabad, Mr Khattak had reportedly asked the acting prime minister to arrange two votes. In response, he was asked how that could be done in the absence of a proper nomination by the leadership.\nOn the other hand, reports emerged on April 14 that PPP regional chief Chaudhry Yasin had been nominated as the opposition\u2019s joint candidate. Although this was denied by three senior PPP leaders, Mr Yasin claimed he only needed six votes from the PTI to clinch victory.\nAccording to sources close to him, Mr Haq had assured Chaudhry Yasin that five to seven PTI legislators would help him achieve his goal.\nHowever, some senior PPP leaders were keen to strike a deal with Mr Mahmood and a three-member committee met the AJK president and agreed to support his pick; Chaudhry Rasheed.\nBut things were not going in his favour, and by the time the dust settled, the president was left with only five members backing him.\nAmid this uncertainty, Mr Haq assured PTI leaders he could manage some votes from within PPP to form the government. This seemed to sit well with Pervez Khattak, who not only gave him the go-ahead, but advised PTI lawmakers through voice notes to vote for him.\nAccording to a PTI leader, the party\u2019s central leadership was under the impression that Mr Haq will be able to break the PPP and PML-N\u2019s ranks.\n\u201cBut they had no idea that he would join forces with the entire opposition along with his so-called forward bloc,\u201d he said.\nSoon after Mr Haq emerged as a candidate, former PM Ilyas released a video message making it clear that the PTI had not named anyone as its candidate and accused the then-speaker of playing a double game.\n\u201cOn one hand he was assuring PTI leaders that he was saving the party, and on the other hand he had struck a deal with the local establishment,\u201d said Mr Ilyas, a reference to the powers that be, whom Asad Qaiser had also assailed with a veiled warning during his presser in Muzaffarabad a few days ago.\nThe final blow came when Mr Haq made it clear in his victory speech that the PTI was not in a position to win the election. Pervez Khattak then personally sent voice notes to many PTI legislators asking them to avoid attending the event. Nevertheless, there were at least 13 PTI legislators in attendance at the oath-taking ceremony.\nZaman Park huddle\nOver the weekend, Mr Khattak informed PTI legislators that Imran Khan had invited the parliamentary party to his Zaman Park residence on Monday evening to discuss the situation.\nInitially. it was assumed most members of the parliamentary party would make it to the Lahore meeting. But as it turned out, only seven \u2013 Khawaja Farooq Ahmed, Abdul Qayyum Niazi, Sardar Muhammad Hussain, Hamid Raza, Chaudhry Maqbool, Deevan Ghulam Mohiuddin and Iqbal Mao \u2013 drove to Zaman Park to meet with Mr Khan.\nIt was learnt that while President Mahmood recalled his supporters from halfway, Mr Ilyas had also avoided attending the meeting.\nIn a statement issued by his political adviser Iftikhar Rasheed, the former PM attributed the low turnout at the Zaman Park meeting to \u201cundue interference, wrong information and strategy that have seriously damaged the party by dividing its clear majority and handing over a specific group to the PDM.\u201d\n\u201cTherefore, PTI workers and legislators are not bound to attend meeting convened by Khattak or follow his viceroyalty style orders and messages,\u201d the statement said, adding that Mr Ilyas would announce important political decisions in a couple of days after consulting with MLAs and senior party leaders.\u201c\nA statement issued after the meeting, however, hinted at the tough spot the party finds itself in.\nAlongside Khawaja Farooq Ahmed\u2019s appointment as the new leader of the opposition in AJK assembly, Imran Khan also named former premier Sardar Abdul Qayyum Niazi as the party\u2019s new regional president in place of Sardar Tanveer Ilyas. Mr Khan also directed Mr Ahmed to summon a meeting of the parliamentary party, with strict instructions that only those who attend the meeting would be allowed to sit on the opposition benches, while those who stay away will have no connection with the PTI.\n"

Tarek Fatah has passed the baton on\u2026 his revolution will continue with all who knew and loved him. Will you join us? 1949-2023,\u201d Fatah\u2019s daughter Natasha, herself a journalist, shared the news on Twitter.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Hindustan Times, he was born in Karachi, Pakistan before emigrating to Canada in 1987.\nHe was a columnist and radio and television commentator, both in Canada and abroad, with a huge social media following, the paper quoted the Toronto Sun as saying.\nFatah, who died at 73, was also a political activist with fiercely Right-wing views, and was often derided by Muslims around the world.\nHe termed himself \u201ca secular Muslim\u201d who clashed with Islamic ideology and was critical  of Muslim states, especially Pakistan. He also authored books such as The Jew is Not My Enemy: Unveiling the Myths that Fuel Muslim Anti-Semitism, and Chasing a Mirage: The Tragic Illusion of an Islamic State.\nFatah was a deeply divisive figure, but never seemed deterred by controversy. He was criticised for peddling \u2018fake news\u2019 when he tweeted morphed images claimed to be from a religious seminary, The Quint reported.\nHe was also a vocal supporter of several conspiracy theories, and often took up contrarian positions.\nAccording to Scroll.in, Fatah supported Donald Trump\u2019s plan to ban Muslims from entering the United States. He was also beloved by the Indian Right, being invited to events such as the India Ideas Conclave and the Jaipur Dialogues, described by Scroll.in as \u201cRight-wing intellectual summits\u201d.\n"

            "Text": "PARIS: Scientists said on Monday they have developed the first mobile printer that can produce thumbnail-sized patches able to deliver mRNA Covid vaccines, hoping the tabletop device will help immunise people in remote regions.\nWhile many hurdles remain and the 3D printer is likely years away from becoming available, experts hailed the  \u201cexciting\u201d finding.\nThe device prints two-centimetre-wide patches which each contain hundreds of tiny needles that administer a vaccine when pressed against the skin. These  \u201cmicroneedle patches\u201d offer a range of advantages over traditional jabs in the arm, including that they can be self-administered, are relatively painless, could be more palatable to the vaccine-hesitant and can be stored at room temperature for long periods of time.\nThe popular mRNA Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna need to be refrigerated, which has caused distribution complications \u2014 particularly in developing countries that have condemned the unequal distribution of doses during the pandemic.\nThe new printer was tested with the Pfizer and Moderna jabs, according to a study in the journal Nature Biotechnology, but the goal of the international team of researchers behind it is for it to be adapted to whatever vaccines are needed.\nRobert Langer, co-founder of Moderna and one of the study\u2019s authors, said that he hoped the printer could be used for  \u201cthe next Covid, or whatever crisis occurs\u201d.\nAna Jaklenec, a study author also from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the printer could be sent to areas such as refugee camps or remote villages to  \u201cquickly immunise the local population,\u201d in the event of a fresh outbreak of a disease like Ebola.\nVacuum-sealed \nMicroneedle patch vaccines are already under development for Covid and a range of other diseases, including polio, measles and rubella. But the patches have long struggled to take off because producing them is an expensive, laborious process often involving large machines for centrifugation.\nTo shrink that process down, the researchers used a vacuum chamber to suck the printer  \u201cink\u201d into the bottom of their patch moulds, so it reaches the points of the tiny needles. The vaccine ink is made up of lipid nanoparticles containing mRNA vaccine molecules, as well as a polymer similar to sugar water.\nOnce allowed to dry, the patches can be stored at room temperature for at least six months, the study found. The patches even survived a month at a balmy 37 degrees Celsius (99 Fahrenheit).\nMice which were given a vaccine patch produced a similar level of antibody response to others immunised via a traditional injection, the study said. The printed patches are currently being tested on primates, which if successful would lead to trials on humans.\nThe printer can make 100 patches in 48 hours. But modelling suggested that \u2014 with improvements \u2014 it could potentially print thousands a day, the researchers said.\n\u201cAnd you can have more than one printer,\u201d Langer added. Joseph DeSimone, a chemist at Stanford University not involved in the research, said that  \u201cthis work is particularly exciting as it realises the ability to produce vaccines on demand\u201d.\n"

He took notice over the torture and mistreatment of NA Additional Secretary Shamoon Hashmi and his family. \nThe speaker has sought a report over the incident from police chief of the capital, it said, adding that he further directed the inspector general of police (IGP) to conduct a transparent investigation over the incident and punish the accused as per law. \nThis mistreatment of citizens and their families is against the norms of a civilised society. It is unfortunate and it should not have happened to families, the statement added. \nProtecting the rights of honourable citizens is the prime responsibility of the government, the speaker said, adding that those who misbehave with people should be dealt with according to law. \nLaw enforcement agencies should ensure the protection of citizens and those who mistreat people and take the law into their hands should be punished, he added. \nMr Hashmi\u2019s cousin visited a food shop in Gol Market when staff at the shop started abusing him and female members of his family, they said, adding that all of a sudden a group of 25 members of staff started attacking them with iron rods and glass bottles. Afterwards, they were dragged on the ground. \nAfter getting this information, police reached the spot, they said, adding that over the incident, a case was registered with Kohsar police station and nine persons were arrested and taken into custody on three days physical remand from the court of law for further legal procedure.\n"

However, unfortunately we had to face traffic jams in most places. The worst situation was on Murree Road, from Faizabad to Rawal Dam, due to a police check post which created a bottleneck and resultantly there was a long queue of vehicles,\u201d he said.\n\u201cOn the other hand police officials remained on the check post,\u201d he said.\nAnother resident Aftab Ahmed said that on second day of Eid he had planned to go to Pir Sohawa, along with his family, but he was disappointed to see that the road was closed by traffic police.\n\u201cWe reached there in the evening and were informed by police that the road had been closed because of the traffic jam on the road.

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: A large number of people on Monday gathered at the residence of former senator Enver Baig to offer Fateha and pay tributes to him.\nMr Baig passed away on April 21 at a local hospital at the age of 77. The funeral of the outspoken politician was held at the H-11 graveyard on April 22.\nOn Monday, a large number of people reached at his house in F-7/2 to offer Fateha for the departed soul.\nAccording to Wasim Haqqi, a close friend of Mr Baig, those who visited the house included former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, his sister Saadia Abbasi, National Assembly SpeakerRaja Pervaiz Ashraf, former chairman Senate Wasim Sajjad, Gen Ehsan, Barrister Khawar, Omar Ayub, Zamarud Khan, ambassadors Riaz Khokhar and Abdul Basit.\nMr Haqqi said Mr Baig was the only person in the federal capital who provided an opportunity to politicians, diplomats and journalists to meet each other without caring about their party affiliation and nature of job.\n\u201cHe was very social and had very good relations with diplomats, media and officers of armed forces,\u201d he said.\nIt is worth mentioning here that after spending more than a decade in the PPP, Mr Baig parted ways with the party in August 2011. Mr Baig, who was once very close to Benazir Bhutto, used to tell his friends that after Ms Bhutto\u2019s tragic death he was finding it difficult to stay in the party as he was not in the good books of the new leadership, mainly because of his straightforward attitude and bold stance on national issues.\nIn 2012, he joined the PML-N, but did not apply for a Senate ticket, fearing there could be resistance within the party as he was a newcomer. However, when PML-N came to power after the 2013 polls, he was appointed as the chairman of the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP).\nAlthough Mr Baig had developed a good rapport with Nawaz Sharif, other senior leaders never really accepted him in the party.\nAfter serving the BISP for almost a year, Mr Baig resigned, reportedly after developing differences with a key minister.\nLater, he was appointed as the chairman of the Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation, but according to one of his friends, journalist Rauf Klasra, he did not join the office for a single day.\n"

He said the federal government had now asked the local administration to start work on the project to connect Islamabad Expressway with Motorway Chowk via Peshawar Road.\nThe official said that the new route will improve traffic management and facilitate travellers coming from Rawat, DHA and adjoining areas. He said the new corridor would also improve the condition of roads and squares in the area.\nThe RDA was tasked with making a plan for the new project and the civic agency estimated the cost at Rs20 billion. However, he said, the provincial government had asked the RDA to conduct a feasibility study first.\nWhen contacted, RDA Director General Saif Anwar Jappa said that they had started homework on the feasibility study on which Rs80 million would be spent.\nThe feasibility study would be reflected in the fiscal year 2023-24 and after allocation of funds the RDA would hire a consultant for it. He said that the feasibility study was likely to complete within six months after which work on the project would be started.\nAccording to the initial plan, the RDA would construct the 22km signal-free corridor from Koral Chowk to Motorway Chowk which would have five underpasses and one flyover.\nHe said the underpasses will be constructed on the Mall in front of Pearl Continental Hotel, General Headquarters (GHQ) Chowk, General Post Office Chowk and Military Hospital Chowk.\n\u201cThe flyover will be constructed at Qasim Market besides an underpass at Golra Mor on Peshawar Road,\u201d he said and added that U-turns would also be established in different areas.\nHe said there was also a demand of cantonment authorities to establish a bus route from Kutchery Chowk to Motorway Chowk.\nThe project would provide an opportunity to travelers from Islamabad and Rawalpindi to reach the Islamabad airport via the motorway without wasting time. He said a bus service was also likely to start for the airport from the garrison city.\nHe said the RDA would also start work on the Kutchery Chowk remodeling project and after completion of both the projects traffic rush on the Mall, Peshawar Road, old Airport Road and G.T. Road would end.\nHe said PC-2 had already been sent to the Punjab Planning and Development Department for allocation of funds in the next fiscal year.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: As World Immunisation Week is observed in the last week of April, Health Minister Abdul Qadir Patel urged parents to get their children aged up to two years vaccinated against 12 deadly diseases.\nThe week aims to promote the use of vaccines to protect people of all ages against infectious diseases. This year\u2019s theme \u2018The Big Catch-up\u2019 urges greater engagement around immunisation globally to promote the role of vaccines in bringing people together, and improving the health and well-being of everyone, everywhere.\nIn his message, to mark the start of World Immunization Week, Mr Patel said that the ultimate goal of World Immunisation Week was to ensure that more children were protected from vaccine-preventable diseases, allowing them to live happier and healthier lives.\n\u201cThe Week also provides an opportunity to raise awareness of the value of vaccines and the urgent need to find and vaccinate all missed-out children. Government of Pakistan has committed to ensure that safe and effective vaccines are available and delivered nationwide and reach every child. In this regard, I would take this opportunity to acknowledge and highlight the efforts of our frontline health workers and the Expanded Programme of Immunisation (EPI) teams across Pakistan working tirelessly to reach every child, including those living in the most vulnerable and remote communities,\u201d he said.\n\nOfficial says Pakistan aims to achieve universal immunisation coverage\n\n\u201cI am also grateful to our International donors and development partners for their commitment and support in meeting our goal of providing free of cost vaccines to every child in Pakistan,\u201d the minister added.\nFederal Health Secretary Dr Muhammad Fakhre Alam, in his message, said that the ultimate goal of World Immunisation Week was to acheive 100 per cent immunity against these diseases.\n\u201cOn behalf of the Ministry of Health, I take this opportunity to urge all stakeholders, i.e. religious leaders, academia, doctors, media persons, civil society organisations, parliamentarians, immunisation partners and donor organisations and especially the parents and our frontline health workers to play their role in order to achieve our ultimate goal of universal immunisation coverage i.e. 100pc fully immunised children,\u201d he said.\nFederal Director of Immunisation Director General Dr Muhammad Ahmad Kazi said that it was an opportunity to remind families and communities how effective vaccines can be, and to encourage people to take action to ensure that more children, and increasingly people in other age groups are vaccinated against Covid-19 and immunised against deadly diseases.\n\u201cWe know that a significant number of unimmunised children come from urban slums, hard to reach and security-compromised areas. These children are in dire need of basic services such as primary health care, education, clean drinking water and sanitation. We now have to focus our resources to find novel means to trace these unvaccinated zero-dose children,\u201d he added.\nCoordinator National Emergency Operations Center Dr Shahzad Baig said that polio still threatened the futures of too many children.\n\u201cLet us protect all children with polio vaccines, especially those who have never been vaccinated. Because until we end polio for good, polio anywhere puts everyone at risk. We\u2019re striving to make sure kids in even the most marginalised areas can access polio vaccines, other essential care, and a healthier future,\u201d he said.\nIt is worth mentioning that routine childhood immunisation is a set of inoculations, given from birth to the age of 15 months. This vaccination protects children against tuberculosis, polio, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, haemophilus influenza type B, hepatitis B, diarrhoea, pneumonia, typhoid, measles and rubella.\n\u201cVaccines bring us closer to community cohesion and compassion. With equal access to lifesaving vaccines, children can attend school, grow into healthy adults, parents can make their livelihood, and communities can thrive into a prosperous healthier society,\u201d said Dr Palitha Mahipala, WHO Representative in Pakistan.\nWorld Immunisation Week is a reminder that timely vaccination is the first line of defence against communicable diseases\u2019 said Abdullah Fadil, Unicef Representative in Pakistan.\nReiterating Unicef\u2019s resolve to vaccinate every child in Pakistan, he said, \u201cVaccines save millions of lives every year, especially those of children who are more susceptible to due to low immunity. Vaccination is a safe and effective way to help them survive, thrive and reach their full potential in life.\u201d\n"

However, it was observed that shopkeepers and vendors took advantage of the situation as they sold food items and drinks at exorbitant rates whereas young people were seen harassing and teasing some families. \nPicnic spots in Taxila and Hassanabdal witnessed traditional festivities on Eidul Fitr as thousands of visitors, including women and children, thronged recreational places to make the best of their holidays. As shopping malls and commercial centres remained closed, people turned to nearby open-air recreational places. Khanpur Dam, Taxila Museum, Wah Gardens, Aqua Fun, Sher Shah Suri Park, Muqbara Lala Rukh and different ancient sites presented a hospitable ambience to families that came for outdoor entertainment. \nThe road leading towards Khanpur Dam witnessed heavy traffic congestion as people rushed towards the scenic spot to enjoy pleasant weather and entertain themselves on the banks of the dam. \nAccording to official figures, over 2,000 people visited the Taxila Museum, over 1,500 people visited Wah Gardens, more than 1,200 people visited Sher Shah Suri Park and almost 400 people visited the Muqbara Lala Rukh. Similarly, over 1,000 people, including visitors from Rawalpindi and Islamabad, visited Khanpur Dam. \nMoreover, some families pointed out that shopkeepers charged too much money for substandard edible items and quality products were not available. \nIt was observed that vendors at these places took full advantage of the situation as authorities failed to control the quality and rates of commodities. There seemed to be no check and balance in this regard and shopkeepers were given a free hand. \nThey arbitrarily increased prices of food and cold drinks, while contractors increased the rates for rides including the all-time favourite dodgem-car, boat ride, electronic swings and airgun shoot.  \nMoreover, the prices of local delights like lemon soda, chana chaat, dahi bhallay and french-fries were also increased. It was also observed that the administration of public and private recreational points turned their back towards groups of young people who were seen teasing families. \n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The reinstatement and regularisation of political appointments has become a bone of contention between a parliamentary committee and the Islamabad High Court (IHC) as the latter has again suspended the former\u2019s recommendation to regularise contractual employees of the Capital Development Authority (CDA).\nEarlier, last month, IHC suspended the recommendations of a Special Committee of the National Assembly regarding reinstatement of 358 political appointments of Employees Old-Age Benefits Institution (EOBI).\nIHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq last week issued a stay order against the restoration of CDA\u2019s employees. CDA\u2019s employees challenged the order of the NA Committee headed by Abdul Qadir Mandokhel.\nArguing before the court, the counsel for the petitioner said that the committee exceeded its authority/jurisdiction by making recommendations for regularisation of contractual employees.\nThe court after preliminary hearing in this matter suspended the NA committee\u2019s decision and sought a reply from the NA Secretariat and from CDA.\n\nPetitioner\u2019s counsel says committee had no authority to make recommendations about matter\n\nDuring the hearing, CDA\u2019s counsel Kashif Ali Malik opposed the suspension of the committee\u2019s recommendations. Previously, Mr Mandokhel recommended reinstatement of those EOBI employees who were terminated under the direction of the Supreme Court.\nThe EOBI is the pension, old age benefits and social insurance institution of the government. It operates under the control of Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development\nThe apex court in 2014 issued the direction of terminating services of 358 employees appointed on the recommendations of politicians belonging to the then political government.\nThose who recommended the appointments included the then prime minister Syed Yousaf Raza Gillani, Faryal Talpur, Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Makhdoom Shahabuddin, Nazar M Gondal, Nadeem Afzal Chan, Raja Riaz, Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, Raja Riaz, Malik Bilal Rehman, Hameedullah Jan Afridi, Faisal Kareem Kundi, Akhuzada Chattan, Najamuddin Khan, Ghulam Ahmed Bilour, Munir Khan Orakzai, Anwar Saifullah Khan, Ruksana Bangash, Arbab Alamgir Khan, Syed Khursheed Ahmed Shah, Fahmida Mirza, Nasir Hussain Shah, Shagufta Jammani, Farooq Sattar, Riaz Pirzada, Qamar Zaman Kaira and others.\nThe Special Committee of the NA recommended reinstatement of the sacked employees of EOBI. However, upon the refusal of Zulfikar Haider, federal secretary (Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis) and chairman EOBI Board of Trustees, the committee moved a privilege motion against him as well as the chairperson of EOBI.\nThe committee directed Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) to initiate probe on the assets of Mr Haider. Secretary (overseas Pakistanis) who is the chairman of the EOBI Board petitioned before the IHC against the direction of the committee.\nHis counsel Syed Ashfaq Hussain Naqvi argued before the court that by virtue of the impugned directions/recommendations, a process has been issued to take penal action against the petitioner.\nIt was submitted that previously, recommendations were made for reinstatement of employees and the matter was already subjudice before the IHC.\nAccording to the counsel, the language used by the special committee against the petitioner, who is a BS-22 officer was uncalled for and remanding his case to the FIA was against the principles of natural justice.\nThe petition stated that the chairman of the committee was abusing his authority by issuing the directions about a matter which has not only been finally decided by the Supreme Court but even the proceedings of the committee are sub judice before \u201cthis honorable court with restraining order holding in field\u201d.\nThe petition requested the court to set aside the recommendations of the committee.\nIt also requested the court to declare the committee\u2019s direction of summoning the petitioner and chairperson EOBI and referring inquiry against Mr Haider to the FIA.\n"

            "Text": "KARACHI: The Sindh Environmental Protection Tribunal has linked the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) approval of the Malir Expressway project with implementation of certain conditions including mitigating the risk of urban flooding, transparent acquisition of land for the project and to address the grievances of affected people.\nHowever, the tribunal noted that it was not inclined to set aside the EIA approval accorded by the Sindh Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa) or to stop the construction work as the project was in the larger interest of public.\nIt also directed the Sindh government to constitute a complaint redressal & implementation committee within a month to monitor the project, implement the conditions and consider the complaints of affectees as well to advice Sepa to cancel EIA approval if the conditions were not implemented.\nOn April 15, the three-member tribunal comprising its chairman retired Justice Nisar Ahmed Shaikh and members Mohammad Arif Khan and Abdul Rauf Memon had allowed the authorities to continue the construction work on the project and also ordered constitution of a committee to be headed by a grade-20 officer for monitoring of the project.\n\nIn its 37-page detailed verdict, tribunal asks govt to acquire land in transparent manner, attend to grievances of residents\n\nIn its 37-page detailed judgement on an appeal filed by residents of Malir and an environmentalist against the EIA approval of the project, the tribunal said that the compliance and implementation of all the conditions was the responsibility of Sepa and the Malir Expressway Ltd, which is undertaking the project.\nIt further noted that the main objections of the appellants raised earlier during the public hearing as well as before the tribunal was about the urban flooding risk due to construction of the project on the Malir river since a part of the expressway was being built on the river bed instead of its right bank. \nIt said while the EIA stated that overhead bridges, box and pipe culverts will be constructed to allow water to flow, the structural integrity of these structures had not been taken into account during heavy rains and urban flooding.\nThe Malir Expressway Ltd contended that the expressway was being built on the right bank of the Malir river and not inside it while for protection of the right bank a deep-sea drain was being incorporated into the project to withstand the heaviest of rains and divert water out to the sea, it added.\nThe verdict further said that the apprehensions of the appellants about urban flooding and usage of groundwater for the project needed to be addressed by the firm; thus all the undertakings made by the respondents and conditions imposed in the EIA approval must be complied with and possible mitigation and remedial measures must be adopted.\nAbout rehabilitation of displaced people, demolition of their properties as well as agricultural land, the tribunal observed that since the approval was subject to compliance of all such conditions, the Malir Expressway Ltd was bound to comply without any further delay.\n\u201cThe firm is also liable to address the grievance of project affectees and in this connection the grievance redressal mechanism is already provided which must start its functioning to take appropriate action to reduce the grievances of people,\u201d it added.\nThe judgement also noted that as per record, the purpose of the project in question was to provide support to bulk and heavy vehicles transporting goods from ports in Karachi to other parts of the country. It said a need for this corridor was also highlighted in the traffic master plan papered by the Japan International Cooperation Agency in 2012.\nIt stated that after about 10 years, the project was being executed by now to avoid heavy traffic from entering and clogging the main arteries of the city such as Sharea Faisal, Shahrah-i-Pakistan, etc.\n\u201cThe fact that on account of tremendous increase in the population, a rapid increase of ancillary vehicles in the city, has resulted in a lot of pressure on city\u2019s infrastructure and surrounding to it, therefore, the situation demands the construction of this expressway to cater extreme need of the public at large. This project is not a private or commercial but is a public road and an initiative of government of Sindh,\u201d it added.\nThe tribunal directed the provincial government to form a complaint redressal and implementation committee, to be headed by a senior officer in at least of BPS-20 and its members not below the rank of BPS-19 to be taken from environment, climate change & coastal development, revenue agriculture, provincial disaster management authority, Sepa and other relevant departments including representatives of appellant party and respective villages.\nIt further stated that the committee would hold monthly meeting to consider complaints of affected people, examine progress reports of the grievance redressal committee and inspection of the project site and verification of matters listed in the conditions of EIA approval.\n\u201cThe committee will also ensure to implement the undertakings furnished by the firm as provided in the environmental laws and to advice Sepa for taking necessary action against the company, executing the project and cancellation of EIA approval in case it violate or not comply with the terms and conditions set out in the judgement,\u201d it added.\nThe proposed project is described in the EIA approval as a 38.75-kilometer-long six-lane dual carriageway that will allow a direct route for heavy vehicles from the industrial areas in Korangi and Landhi to outside the city. The EIA approval further said that the location of the project was starting from right before the Jam Sadiq bridge on Korangi Road and run along the right bank of the Malir river through the Korangi and Malir districts terminating on M-9 near DHA City outside Karachi.\n"

In Hub Canal, seven-year-old Islam Bibi drowned on Monday. Later, Edhi divers fished out the body.\nA 14-year-old boy, identified as Moosa Wali, drowned in the sea at Gadani.

            "Text": "\n\nNaseem Bano stirs the milk being boiled to prepare rabri.\u2014Dawn\n\n \nIT was around 10pm and customers were increasing in number. But the shop owner had run out of the available stocks of delicious rabri, or sweet condensed cream, on the second day of Eidul Fitr. \n\u201cCan we have a small quantity of it [rabri],\u201d Hazrat Ali, a second year student from Peshawar, inquires from shop owner Naveed Shaikh. He, however, apologises. \n\u201cI can\u2019t meet demand on occasions like Eid for a variety of reasons,\u201d says Naveed while telling workers to shutter the shop to avoid hassle. \u201cIt is difficult to meet commitments. Constraints ranging from issues of milk supplies to load management of natural gas leave me vulnerable. I have to sell fresh product because it is the key to success.\u201d \nLocated in the narrow passages of old city\u2019s famous 18th century Pucca Qilla area, the Haji Rabri Wala has become the identity of Hyderabad the world over since the independence.\nNaveed\u2019s great grandfather, Haji Basheeruddin, started the shop here in 1948 after migrating from Rewari in India to the newly-born state of Pakistan. Bearded Haji\u2019s turban-wearing photo hangs in a corner of the shop. As the Haji\u2019s fourth generation, Naveed is in the saddle to run the product which has completed its platinum jubilee. Basheeruddin had brought the recipe from India and started it here from scratch on a small-scale. \n\nHaji Rabri Wala has been Hyderabad\u2019s identity since long\n\nWhen Naveed\u2019s father died in late \u201880s and Basheerudin became too old, his mother Naseem Bano began looking after the business. Now in advance age she still looks energetic and keen to look after the rabri-making process in the backyard of the shop. \nAbba jee [her grandfather-in-law Basheeruddin] had bought a small space from a Hindu for Rs350,\u201d she says as she started sharing the story to me. \n\u201cTaste, cleanliness and quality is our hallmark that can\u2019t be compromised or undermined. We produce limited quantity with quality,\u201d she insists and expresses satisfaction that things remain normal as was case in Basheeruddin\u2019s time. \nShe sheds light how her family had gone through ups and downs following the death of Nooruddin and then Noor\u2019s father, Hakeemuddin. Nonagenarian Basheer died in 1990. \nShe recalled how Basheeruddin\u2019s relatives wrote to that Hindu property owner to take back his property which had then become a known business point. \u201cThe man did return from India but had to return empty-handed as Basheeruddin refused to return the property,\u201d she says and ascribes business success to the blessings of a spiritual figure, Baba Salahuddin, for Basheeruddin. \nRuled Card \u2014 a principal property document in revenue record \u2014 featured name of one Gagumal as the owner of the space/property number 841 and this number is there on the trademark registration. Basheeruddin\u2019s name appeared on the card \u2014 shared by Naveed \u2014 on Feb 1, 1975, with a sum of Rs15,000. Haji and his sons purchased more properties to be amalgamated to raise the present shop-cum-residential building. But Naveed didn\u2019t shift the business from there to a more developed and urbanised part of the city even after seven decades. \nThe rabri \u2014 plain, pistachio flavoured and sugar free \u2014 is something distinctive among sweetmeats. It was initially sold in earthen tumblers, which makes its more unique. The tumblers kept its quality and aroma intact, but now plastic pots and tin packs are used to enable customers carry it easily. \nNaveed\u2019s widowed mother grappled with issues but didn\u2019t give up. \n\u201cMy sons were minors. So, family members of my in-laws started looking after work although not without purpose. Time came and my sons eventually took up the reins of the business,\u201d says Bano smilingly. \u201cI didn\u2019t leave house till Naveed and his brothers attained adulthood.\u201d \nNaveed was poised to make his forefather\u2019s business a success story. \u201cHad amma [mother] left house after father\u2019s death and other conditions she would have perhaps lost her claim to the business and we would have been nowhere. My father must have given new dimensions to the work he had inherited from his grandfather had he not died that early,\u201d he says. \nBano reminisces about how 40kg of milk \u2014 five kg in each frying pan \u2014 was used to produce 13kg of rabri initially sans proper cooling facility then. \u201cWe used to have plenty of water underneath rabri carrying trays for manual chilling while using piece of muslin to cover the product.\u201d \nBut today her son uses 1,600kg of milk to make 400kg of rabri in a day. \u201cOn occasions like I need 3,000kg of milk to have around 700kg or 800kg of rabri,\u201d adds Naveed.\nRabri becomes ready for sale after multiple stages of boiling and chilling. Workers boil milk at unusually high temperature until, for example, 10kg milk transforms into 1.5kg rabri. After having mixed with sugar, which turned it yellow, lacchhay [cream\u2019s layers] are collected in huge frying pans and frozen before sale. Naveed has increased the number of pans and established a cold storage for cooling. \nAs business management graduate from Dadu, he intends to add new dimension to the business he inherited from his ancestors. Since started overseeing the business, he went for transformation, from a conventional approach to e-trade, to market his brand nationally and internationally to keep pace with new trends. \nWhatsapp messages for orders from abroad are regular traffic on his smartphone. \u201cOne Athar Shaikh from Texas placed orders for 60-70kg, which have been met in the last one week ahead of Eid,\u201d he tells me.\nLikewise, Iftikhar from London had placed an order for 33kg rabri in piecemeal. \n\u201cA US client puts my product on Facebook page for 1kg tin pack for approximately $20-$25 in Houston after buying it for Rs1,200,\u201d he says. \nHowever, there is a challenge.\n\u201cMany sell rabri with ours name at the railway station though I have no second branch other than Karachi. Complaints to the authorities fall on a deaf ear even though I got a trade mark registered a decade back,\u201d he remarks. \nNaveed aims to make his brand known globally. He is planning business abroad and grooming his son, Aurangzeb, for this venture once he completes business education and gets the degree.\n"

It said in usual course a body did not decompose to such a state within 17 days while the DNA report was also not 100 per cent certain about the identity of the remains in question.\nThe cause of the death was not established, no evidence was available about rape and there was also no evidence that the murder and abduction were made with a design to create terror as such the provisions of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 were not applicable in the case, it added.\nThe judgement further noted that the appellant had no motive to abduct and murder the victim while he claimed enmity with the complainant due to an old family dispute.\nKeeping in view the law in respect of circumstantial evidence, the prosecution had failed to create an unbroken chain in order to establish its case, it concluded.\n"

            "Text": "IT has often been claimed that in the past, one of the hallmarks of Karachi was its cultural diversity, artistic vibrancy and pluralism \u2014 integral elements of its urban composition. Is it the same these days? Perhaps it is. Perhaps it is not. Here\u2019s how things were half a century back. On April 24, 1973 the first all Pakistan contest for classical, semi-classical and folk dances was held in the city under the auspices of a film magazine. Film and stage dancer Shahnaz, who performed a semi-classical piece, a folk item and luddi, was adjudged the best dancer of the night. She was also crowned \u2018Dancers Queen\u2019 by Naheed Kamal Azfar, wife of the Provincial Finance Minister. Nazia and Shama were given second and third positions by a panel of judges. A dozen participants performed 15 styles of dances during the competition, including luddi, dhammal, jhumar and kathak.\nTwo days later, on April 26, an impressive exhibition of artworks by distinguished artist Mansur Rahi opened at a local hotel. The show included a huge mural, powerful wartime drawings and a new set of 17 oil paintings, which narrated the epic freedom struggle of the Muslims of the subcontinent. The 17 exhibits traced the inherent urge for freedom among the people which eventually took the form of the Pakistan Movement and then, despite the two wars and the Dhaka tragedy, moved on to project a new Pakistan, ushering an era of peace and progress for the common man. A critic commented that Rahi had been painting the story of man\u2019s struggle in his early days, and now he had taken a historian\u2019s role in depicting the contemporary history of the country with remarkable success.\nThe next day, on April 27, Governor of Sindh Begum Ra\u2019ana Liaquat Ali Khan inaugurated an exhibition of photographs and handicrafts depicting the emancipation of women of China presented to her by Madame Miso Chiu-jui, wife of the Consul-General of China in Karachi. Speaking on the occasion, the governor emphasised the role of women in the development and prosperity of the nation, adding that the gift [of photos] candidly projected the contribution of Chinese women to various fields of their national life. \nAnd on April 28, the Christian community of Pakistan organised a public reception to felicitate Cardinal Joseph Cordeiro, Archbishop of Karachi, on his elevation to the College of Cardinals. Dr Cordeiro, who had recently returned to the city after being decorated with the cardinal\u2019s red hat by Pope Paul VI at Vatican City, was the first Pakistani to be raised to the office of the \u2018Prince of the Church\u2019. The event arranged by the Vicar-General drew members of the community from all over the country. Apart from them, those who attended the reception included Governor Ra\u2019ana Liaquat Ali Khan, Central Minorities Minister Raja Tridiv Roy and officials of the diplomatic corps. Addressing the audience in English and Urdu languages, Cardinal Cordeiro said, \u201cTrue service will require that we frequently ask ourselves not \u2018what do I want\u2019 but \u2018what you want\u2019. This is pure goodness.\u201d Talking about the new constitution of the country, he remarked, \u201cIt is left to us as citizens to regard the constitution as just another official document or to treat it as a sacred trust which must be honoured both in letter and spirit.\u201d\n"

He warned that If the discontent persisted for long, it would  ultimately multiply people\u2019s economic problems.\nBilawal  Bhutto-Zardari said PPP was striving hard to persuade the coalition  partners at the Centre to go for talks even with the opposition, if  needed, and restrict the differences to elections. He said they should  agree on holding the general elections on one day. \nRegarding the  unprecedented rains and floods last year, he said \u201cstill we are braving  the trauma\u201d because the entire world was facing economic crisis which,  in turn, was casting an adverse impact on our country too. \nAmong  those who attended the \nEid Millan gathering were Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari,  MPA Faryal Talpur, Senator Nisar Ahmed Khuhro, Syed Khursheed Shah,  Khursheed Ahmed Junejo, MPA Suhail Anwer Siyal and senior PPP leaders.\n"

They were identified as Ms Maria, 28, and Ms Nazia, 35. The man and two other patients, whose names were not disclosed, were struggling for life, their relatives in the village said. They said a family dispute among them forced them to take the extreme step.\nBaghan RHC medical superintendent Dr Dawood Otho told Dawn that as many as 35 cases of attempted suicide were reported at this facility \u2014 which caters to the healthcare requirement of people from around 60 coastal villages \u2014 over the last couple of months. Almost all of them tried to commit suicide by consuming some poisonous substance, he added.\nThe most common motives for their extreme step appeared to be depression and hopelessness caused by abject poverty, unbearable inflation, personal enmity and a lack of awareness to settle petty issues, said the doctor.\n"

He is of the view that both the power utilities operate in Sindh and we have to put in our efforts to help them stand on their feet,\u201d the minister said. \nMr Shaikh said that the Sindh government was actively considering the idea of running Hesco and Sepco under the public-private partnership mode. He assured the CBA that no workers would be fired after the proposed takeover.\nCBA leader Nisar Ahmed Shaikh told the minister that power theft was being committed on a large scale. \u201cYou cannot just imagine the volume,\u201d he said, adding that this problem demanded strict action to establish writ of law. The CBA leader admitted that union leaders and members also could not curb power theft without having pro\u00adper legal cover and protection. \nHe also talked about an acute shortage of workers in both companies where a single worker had to pull on multiple assignments. The minister said no business could survive with 48pc annual loss, and stressed on jointly evolving a mechanism to address this issue and ensuring an uninterrupted power supply to consumers.\nThe minister also talked to CBA chief Abdul Latif Nizamani over phone and discussed the pressing issues. The minister hinted at holding a meeting with the central and regional leadership of the CBA union in Karachi shortly to address its reservations. \nPledging all out support, the minister asked the CBA to help turn Hesco and Sepco into profit-earning utilities. Zaffar Shaikh, a member of Sepco board of governors also participated in the talks and discussed workers\u2019 welfare and ways to improve performance of the company. Wali Mohammed Leghari, Syed Zahid Shah, Shuja\u2019at Ali Ghumro, Abdullah Soomro, Mehmood Pathan and other union leaders were also present.\n"

            "Text": "GUJRAT: Former chief minister and PTI president Chaudhry Parvez Elahi says the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) has opened up a front against every institution while Nawaz Sharif is the mastermind behind the campaign against the Supreme Court by the ruling coalition. \nHe said Maulana Fazlur Rehman\u2019s press conference against the chief justice, all superior judges and Imran Khan was extremely irresponsible and unacceptable. \n\u201cI am surprised that Maulana Fazlur Rehman was the most earnest about the election but today he is leading the campaign against the election. Maulana Fazlur Rehman, tell me, isn\u2019t this an open contradiction?\u201d he taunted the JUI-F leader. \nMr Elahi made these remarks while addressing the media as well as a gathering of his supporters at Kunjah House here during the Eid holidays. Chaudhry Wajahat Hussain, Mian Imran Masood and others were also present. \nPervaiz Elahi said the PML-N did not get candidates for the ticket in Punjab that\u2019s why it boycotted the election. The boycott of the PML-N had not made any difference as its election defeat in Punjab was writing on the wall, he added. \nThe former CM said no one could stop the election without an amendment to the Constitution with a two-thirds majority.  \n\u201cThe matter of election is constitutional and it will be resolved constitutionally. There is no way out without negotiations, which can also be held within the constitutional limits.\u201d \nMr Elahi said Imran Khan had never refused to negotiate on the election and the government was misleading the public. He explained that the Supreme Court had clarified the constitutional limits of negotiations in its order and it had given the last chance to the government while further disobedience of the court would result in disqualification. \n\u201cAyaz Sadiq has contacted Fawad Chaudhry and we wish there will be a way out for a fair and transparent election.\u201d  \nHe said the rulers were not concerned about the economic crisis nor did they have the ability to improve the affairs of the country, the unconstitutional rulers only wanted to cling to power unconstitutionally. \nMeanwhile, PML-Q chief Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain and Chaudhry Parvez Elahi celebrated Eidul Fitr at different places in their hometown. It was the first time that both the senior members of the family offered Eid prayers at different places despite being in Gujrat. \nShujaat Hussain and his scions, Salik Hussain and Shafay Hussain, offered Eid prayers at family\u2019s ancestral Zahoor Elahi House in the city whereas Parvez and Wajahat Hussain offered the prayers at Kunjah House. However, another family member Chaudhry Shafaat Hussain, a former Gujrat district Nazim, visited both the houses and met with the family elders along with his sons.\n"

            "Text": "BAHAWALPUR: Four newborn cubs of a Bengal tigress, Rani, made their first public appearance on Monday in the Bahawalpur Zoo, attracting a large number of visitors, including children.\nAs the news of their birth broke, the locals as well as the people from the adjacent cities thronged the zoo to have a glimpse of the cubs.\nZoo curator Dr Tariq said the Bengal tigress, aged 32, gave birth to the cubs following hormone therapy. They were kept in the safe custody away from the general public for few days due to security reasons and they were shown to the public on Eidul Fitr.\nTalking to Dawn, Dr Tariq claimed the aged Bengal tigress conceived after hormone therapy, extraordinary care and proper feeding in captivity. He claimed that by giving birth to four cubs, Rani had created history and projected the name of the Bahawalpur Zoo and the Punjab Wildlife Department in the whole world as it was the oldest tigress that conceived and gave birth to cubs. He claimed that the pregnancy of an aged Bengali tigress with hormone therapy was also a rare phenomenon in wildlife history, which the Bahawalpur Zoo had successfully achieved.\n\nZoo claims Rani made record by giving birth to cubs at 32 through hormone therapy\n\nAccording to the zoo curator, the tigress usually gives birth to two cubs or triplets but seldom four cubs. He said newborns were all females and with the new arrivals, the number of tigers in the zoo had risen to 11. He went on to say the zoo would be a focal centre in the coming years in respect of a fertile centre for tigers and it would also be able to sell the young tigers to other zoos not only in the country but abroad, bringing handsome income and foreign exchange.\nDOG BITE: A girl, Unishra Fatimah (7), was seriously injured in a dog-bite incident in Yazman.\nShe was provided first aid by Rescue 1122 and was shifted to the Tehsil Headquarters Hospital Yazman for further treatment. A dog attacked her and wounded her leg when she was playing outside her home.\nMOVEMENT: The leaders of the movement for the Bahawalpur province, including its chief executive Nawaz Naji, Akram Ansari, ex-parliamentarian Syed Tabish Alwari, Hazoor Bakhsh and Asia Kamal, have pledged on the martyrs day of the movement to continue their struggle to achieve the restoration of the Bahawalpur province.\nAt a gathering under the auspices of the movement, they paid homage to the two martyrs, Hafiz Muhammad Shafique and Muhammad Azim Dadpotra, who laid down their lives 53 years ago during the brutal firing of police force on a big public rally outside Farid Gate for the restoration of Bahawalpur province on April 20, 1970.\nThe rally, led by the late prince Mamoonul Rashid Abbasi, a son of the late Bahawalpur Nawab Sadiq Khan Abbasi, was demanding the creation of the Bahawalpur province during the martial law of Gen Yahya Khan.\nTeargas was used against the participants in the rally while fire was also opened by police, killing two protesters on the spot while scores of them had suffered injuries. The army was called after a curfew was imposed.\nThe leaders of the current movement reiterated their demand for a separate province and called upon the PML-N leaders to fulfill their commitment with the people of Bahawalpur as Mian Nawaz Sharif and Mian Shehbaz Sharif had pledged to meet the people of the people for creation of a province in the area where the Bahawalpur state existed.\n"

She said if the CJP gave a verdict in favour of Imran Khan not because of the Constitution but due to the fear of his mother-in-law and upon the advice of children and wives, this will not be allowed to happen.\n\nMarriyum says country is suffering at hands of liars \u2018like Imran\u2019; PTI renews call for probe into leaks\n\n\u201cNeither the nation will forgive those who play with the Constitution, nor will we spare them,\u201d she maintained.\nShe said it was strange that a woman had become spokesperson for those who threw shoes at the poster of her son-in-law.\nNow, elections will be held on time and not on the advice of Gen Bajwa and the mother-in-law of anyone, she added.\nCall for suo motu\nSeparately, PML-N leader Talal Chaudhry told a presser in Lahore the leaked audio strengthened PML-N\u2019s stance that an atmosphere was being created to benefit Imran Khan and demanded investigation into the purported audiotape.\nHe also demanded formation of the Supreme Court benches in line with the new law approved by the parliament.\nIn Faisalabad, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah Khan while terming the alleged audiotape very alarming demanded the Supreme Court immediately take suo motu notice of it to ascertain its reality, facts and background.\nAt a presser on Sunday, he said the matter should be taken on a priority basis as everyone was concerned about the conversation that had been mentioned in the audio leak by naming some personalities of the judiciary.\nHe said that if in the forensic audit and in FIA\u2019s inquiry, the tape is proved as fabricated, strict action should be taken against those who were involved in preparation of the tape.\nHe said the women were talking in the audiotape about the very serious issue of election, a matter which is being heard by the Supreme Court and are expressing their views about the case.\nHe recalled that a similar audio of Chaudhry Parvez Elahi was also leaked earlier but no action was taken.\nMr Sanaullah said those sitting in courts were bound by the Constitution, beyond relations.\nPTI seeks investigation\nOn its part, the PTI renewed calls for investigation into such clips and urged the Supreme Court to take notice of the leaks, Dawn.com reported.\nOf late, a slew of audio leaks featuring key government and opposition figures \u2014 including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, PTI Chairman Imran Khan, PML-N leader Maryam Nawaz, and others \u2014 have surfaced on social media.\nThe PTI chief said audio leaks were a matter of fundamental rights. \u201cI want to tell the SC today that my petition [on the matter] has been lying in the court for the last eight months.  The court should now take a step on it,\u201d he added.\nPTI leader Fawad Chaudhry said his party had repeatedly urged the SC to probe the series of leaks, calling them \u201cdisastrous\u201d.\nWhen audios from the PM Office and PM House were released, the PTI requested the SC to look into this matter, he said. \u201cIf the office of the prime minister is not secure and audios are being recorded there, then how will anyone else in the country be safe?\u201d\n\u201cNow, judges, politicians, civil servants, and even housewives are becoming victims of this third-class thinking and no one can do anything about it,\u201d he regretted, adding that \u201csuch illegal phone tapping is punishable by up to three years in prison under the fair trial law\u201d.\nFormer minister Shireen Mazari said audio leaks involving private conversations of people showed the level of \u201cdepravity, desperation, and insanity the deep state and its puppet PDM regime is delving into with impunity\u201d.\n\u201cTime for SC to move against such audio tapping which is clearly illegal.

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan experienced the highest number of civilian casualties due to use of explosive weapons in 2022, says a report by Action on Armed Violence (AOAV), a London-based charity, recording 721 civilian casualties due to use of explosive weapons in 126 incidents in the country.\nThis marked a 62 per cent increase from 445 civilian casualties recorded across 100 incidents in 2021, says the Explosive Violence Monitor 2022. Moreover, it means the rate of civilian harm per incident increased from 4.5 to 5.7, according to the report which was released on Monday.\nMost notably, incidents of explosive weapon use by non-state actors rose by 31pc last year, from 71 to 93 incidents, and civilian casualties of such attacks rose by 47pc from 376 to 554.\nAccording to the report, Pakistan appears ninth in the list of top ten countries that were most affected in 2022. Ukraine, Afghanistan and Syria topped the list, while India appears in 11th place and Gaza in 13th.\n\nExplosive Violence Monitor reveals Pakistan among top 10 countries most affected by explosive arms\n\nWhile the number of recorded incidents of state-perpetrated explosive violence remained the same as 2021, with three incidents recorded, the rate of harm from state attacks increased from 1 to 18.3, with three civilians harmed in such attacks in 2021 compared to 55 last year, the report says.\nImprovised explosive devices (IEDs) caused 71pc (515) of civilian casualties in Pakistan over the past year, while ground-launched weapons caused 194 civilian casualties, and mines caused 12 (a small drop from 15 in 2021).\nThe Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) are the predominant known perpetrators of explosive violence in the country, and in November 2022 the TTP called off a ceasefire with the Pakistani government, suggesting that non-state actors will continue to increase their activity in Pakistan, the London-based organization says.\nThe report reveals that explosive weapons were responsible for over 31,000 deaths and injuries across 4,322 incidents globally in 2022. Out of the total number of casualties, over 20,000 were civilians, accounting for 66pc.\nThe report highlights that explosive weapons used in populated areas were responsible for 90pc of civilian casualties, while other areas accounted for only 12pc. It recorded 19,632 civilians killed and injured in populated areas globally, which represented 94pc of globally reported civilian deaths and injuries.\nThe report shows that civilian casualties from the use of explosive weapons soared by 83pc last year, predominantly because of the war in Ukraine, according to AOAV.\nA significant proportion of explosive violence incidents recorded by AOAV in 2022 went unclaimed, and could not be attributed to a specific actor. In 8pc (341) of all incidents it was unclear from reporting whether a state or non-state actor was responsible.\nThe AOAV recorded 2,645 incidents attributed to state actors, which resulted in a total of 19,859 casualties. Of these 71pc (14,166) of were civilians.\nRussia was the predominant state perpetrator of civilian harm last year, causing 9,372 civilian casualties across 1,686 incidents. Civilians accounted for 93pc of all 10,083 recorded casualties from Russian explosive violence. Seventeen of those incidents took place in Syria, where Russian explosive weapons caused 82 civilian casualties, and the rest occurred in Ukraine.\nThe second highest state perpetrator of explosive violence was Myanmar, with 206 recorded incidents and 766 resulting civilian casualties. Other states identified as key perpetrators of civilian harm from explosive violence included Ukraine (600), Saudi Arabia (507 civilian casualties), Turkey (459), Ethiopia (436), and Syria (324).\n"

            "Text": "PESHAWAR: The public sector hospitals in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have reported an improvement in earnings from the Sehat Card Plus micro-health insuranceprogramme withdoctors and other staff members receivingthe stipulated share from that revenue.\nThe programme was launched in early 2016 covering 51 per cent of the province\u2019s population.\nOfficials of the health department told Dawn that before November 2020 when the SCP provided services to only poor people selected on the basis of the data of the Benazir Income Support Programme, 70 per cent of the income from the SCP programme went to private hospitals (Rs4.4 billion) and 30 per cent to the government ones (Rs1.9 billion).\nThey, however, said as the SCP\u2019s coverage was extended to the entire population of the province in 2020, earnings of government hospitals from the programme went up.\nAccording to official documents shared by them, except for the period from November 2021 to June 2022 when 74 per cent of that income went to the private sector (Rs4.05 billion) and the rest (Rs1.43 billion) to the public sector, private hospitals earned more that government health centres.\n\nOfficials say special panels ensuring provision of due share in that income to staff members\n\nAlso, the public sector hospitals\u2019 share in the SCP income was Rs6.2 billion(31 per cent)and that of private hospitals Rs13.7 billion (69 per cent) between July 2021 and June 2022 but it went up to Rs9.67 billion (38 per cent) compared to the latter\u2019s Rs16 billion (62 per cent).\nThe documents show that overall, private hospitals got Rs38.2 billion (66 per cent) from the government\u2019s health insurance programme and public sector ones Rs19.2 billion (34 per cent).\nHealth officials told Dawn that as the SCP\u2019s coverage was extended to the entire population comprising 9.78 million families, government hospitals had begun receiving more patients than before.\nThey said two million people had received free services under the programme with 52 per cent of them being women.\nOfficials said under the programme, the government had empanelled 1,100 hospitals across the country and 189 of them were located in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\nThey said initially, public sector hospitals received fewer patients compared with the private ones due to a lack of incentives for the former\u2019s employees.\nThe officials, however, said two years ago, the health department had introduced the \u2018Fund Retention and Utilisation and Distribution Formula\u2019 and asked government health centres to follow it to claim better share from the income of the health insurance programme.\nThey, however, said the formula wasn\u2019t fully implemented by most hospitals.\nThe officials said private hospitals had already treated patients on payment and thus, generating more revenue from the SCP compared with their public sector contemporaries.\nThey said under the formula, the hospitals had to spend 25pc funds from the SCP programme to improve patient care and do repairs and maintenance, give 30pc to doctors and 15pc to nursing and paramedical staff, and spend 20pc on consumables and 10pc on administrative matters.\nThe officials said in the last one year, the health department had been trying to ensure enforcement of the formula aiming to give incentives to staff of government hospitals from the income generated by the SCP.\nThey said it was a matter of concern for the government that the lion\u2019s share of revenue went to private hospitals, so it forced its hospitals to enforce the Fund Retention and Utilisation and Distribution Formula.\nOfficials added that after the initiative, many government hospitals began treating patients against the SCP \ncards causing their income from the health insurance programme to increase.\nThey said the Peshawar Institute of Cardiology, Lady Reading Hospital and Hayatabad Medical Complex had drawn most of income from the SCP programme in the public sector since the the enforcement of that formula two years ago.\nOfficials said the hospitals had formed committees headed by medical superintendents to ensure the provision of the stipulated share in that income to staff members.\nThey said seminars were also being held under the SCP programme in public sector hospitals to rope in more and more patients.\n"

The convict\u2019s brother, Shareefullah, was at large.\n\nAsks AAC to produce records of fines, sentences on May 3 hearing\n\nA judicial magistrate brought the matter to the notice of sessions judge Jehanzeb Shinwari, who declared, \u201cThe ACC, being a price magistrate, apparently has no mandate of the law to proceed, convict or acquit anyone involved in a crime contained in the Pakistan Penal Code, so the court is compelled to proceed [on the matter] under Section 439-A of CrPC read with Section 435 of CrPC.\u201d\nHe also directed the AAC to appear in the court on April 20, explain under what law or rules, he took the cognisance of a PPC crime, and produce records of the case.\nThe court also directed the district jail\u2019s superintendent to produce the convict with the relevant records, while the SHO (City) was asked to explain under which authority and law he submitted the challan to a court with no jurisdiction to examine the PPC cases and why the challan was not filed through the prosecution.\nIt asked the district public prosecutor about the offences the AAC committed by misusing his government office.\nSHO (City) Siddique Shah and AAC Mohammad Ali appeared before the court on April 20. The judge asked Mr Ali to attend the May 3 hearing to file a written explanation for overstepping his powers and produce records of the fines and sentences imposed by him since assuming the ACC-I office.\nKILLED: Two people were killed and 13 injured in road accidents here during Eid holidays, the police said on Monday.\nPolice said Mufti Hamid Khan, a 25-year-old resident of Churwai village in Amazai area, was killed after being struck by a heavy log on Monday.\nThey also said gunmen killed a resident and injured another over an old family feud in the Makhniyal area on Saturday.\nThe police identified the deceased as Haseeb Abbasi and the injured as Azhar Abbasi, who was admitted to the Khanpur Civil Hospital.\nSix road accidents were also reported here on Eid holidays with at least 12 people suffering injuries.\n"

He said the production would be sufficient for meeting grain needs of farmers and its sale in the market.\n\u201cA good yield would help improve the financial position of the growers, enabling them to meet the requirements of fertiliser and pesticides for other crops,\u201d he said.\nKisan Board district president Khalid Khan said unexpected rains had worried the farmers, but they wouldn\u2019t have any adverse effect on the yield.\nHe advised the farmers against succumbing to tactics of flour millers, who usually purchased wheat from them at low prices, exploiting growers\u2019 weak financial position.\nObaid-ur-Rehman, a farmer from Maneri village, complained that there was no mechanism at the official level to purchase wheat from them at reasonable rates. \nKILLED: Four people were killed and 15 injured in different incidents during the Eid days, Rescue 1122 officials and police said on Monday.\nRaj Wali, 40, a teacher in Islamia College Peshawar, was shot dead by rivals near the Swabi interchange on the Islamabad-Peshawar Motorway when he was taking tea along with his 10-year-old son at a restaurant. \nThe victim belonged to Chota Lahor. \nThe body was taken to Bacha Khan Hospital Complex, Shahmansoor, for autopsy.\nThe cause of the incident was a property dispute.\nSeparately, Luqman Khan, 20, drowned in the River Indus while bathing along with his friends at downstream of Tarbela Dam near Himlet village in Topi tehsil.\nHe was shifted to the Tehsil Headquarters Hospital, Topi, where doctors confirmed his death.\nA man, identified as Abdullah of Shagai village, was found dead in the fields.\nAlso, one person was killed and five others were injured when a car fell into a canal in Panjpir area.

            "Text": "\n\n\n \nPESHAWAR: Young calligrapher Kiran Shah Bukhari has advocated the use of social media by artists to market their works on a large scale and said interactive technologies offered multiple development opportunities.\nMs Bukhari, aka Kiran Shah Bee, is a graduate of IMSciences Peshawar.\nBorn in Bannu and bred in Peshawar, she has the penchant for strokes of brush, scratching sound of pen and shades of myriad colours since early childhood.\nAs a sixth grader, pencil sketches, colours and text images drifted her into the magical world of art.\nMs Bukhari said an \u2018art block\u2019 happened to her while in first year where she felt she was incapable to create anything but after a year it dawned upon her that calligraphy was her real forte and while doing the course of Business Administration, she learnt how to market her art pieces on social media.\n\u201cEvery day, I open my Instagram account and find it flooded with orders, appreciation and comments that boost my courage. I feel proud to be a Pakistani, Pakhtun girl. Social media has empowered me to promote my own brand of art,\u201d she said.\nThe young calligrapher said she was basically self-taught.\nShe said she learnt a lot about Islamic calligraphy from online tutorials, while her parents granted her the permission to do the art thinking that her passion for art would die after a while, but that didn\u2019t happen as she wanted to do something different.\nShe said there were six distinct calligraphic scripts in Arabic, including Thulut/Sulus, Diwani, Kufic, Naskh, Reeqa, and Taaleeq.\n\u201cKufic script is geometric in nature, while Naskh is cursive in its texture. I can masterly express my talents in every style,\u201d she said.\nMs Bukhari said her art pieces were in great demand across the country, while most art lovers placed orders for her works from around 50 countries.\n\u201cI market calligraphic artworks of three young girl-artists as they want to stay \u2018hidden\u2019. I believe calligraphic art has a promising future, \u201cshe said.\nThe calligrapher said the pure Quran Arabic and Thuluth scripts were her majors in calligraphy.\nShe regretted that no exhibition exclusively for promoting calligraphic art was held in the province though there were artists with really good works.\n\u201cPersonally, I don\u2019t set up my stalls in school level exhibitions as I think it is just a waste of time. Calligraphic art-works have a big market beyond Gulf-States,\u201d she said.\nRegarding future plans, she said she had been working on a project to learn Wassay (Iranian script) and Sufi styles after getting orders from Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad and a department of the armed forces.\n"

The cattle are fed on natural grass and kept in warm mud rooms to protect them from severe cold. The tribesmen also use timber as firewood for cooking and heating purposes.\nThe tribesmen preserve maize crop leaves for use in winter as fodder and hung them onto trees after plucking corncobs to be used as food.\n"

According to the PCB \u201csignificant work has already taken place\u201d in this regard. \n\u201cWhile a number of departments have confirmed their return to the domestic structure, election process at the district/zonal/regional level has recently picked up pace following last month\u2019s appointment of the independent Election Commissioner by the PCB Patron Prime Ministe,\u201d read the board\u2019s press release..\n\u201cOnce the elections process at the district/zonal/regional level has been completed, a Board of Governors will be constituted. \n\u201cThis will include four elected regional presidents, four departmental appointees and two PCB Patron nominees, who, in turn, will elect the Chairman of the PCB.\n\u201cIt is anticipated the entire process for the revival of the 2014 PCB Constitution will be completed within the next 60 days.\u201d\nThe notification was issued in response to a summary dispatched to the Prime Minister on April 20 by the IPC ministry, which recommended an extension of two to four weeks to the tenure of the interim Management Committee. \nThe ministry, through another letter \u2014 dated April 13 \u2014 requested the premier to name his two nominees to contest the elections for the post of the PCB chairman.  \nDawn had reported on Saturday that the Board of Governors will be constituted within the next two weeks with a good number of departments committed to form their teams according to the 2014 constitution.\nOnce the Board of Governors is complete, four elected presidents of the regions and as many departments affiliated with the PCB cast their votes to elect PCB chairman\nDuring Imran Khan\u2019s reign as the prime minister from 2018 to 2022, the PCB adopted the 2019 constitution, which saw departments and regions replaced by six provincial association sides. Imran had also instructed \ndepartments to close down their sport wings, which led to many athletes lose their jobs.\nSince Shehbaz took office after Imran\u2019s ouster through a no-confidence vote in April last year, the incumbent PM revoked his predecessor\u2019s move to restore departments in sports and eventually instructed the restoration of PCB\u2019s 2014 constitution.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The federal government is considering withdrawing funding to the Rs88 billion nationwide health programme initiated three years ago to combat Covid-19 and other natural calamities owing to poor implementation progress by the provinces and other regional administrations.\nInformed sources told Dawn that the \u2018Covid-19 Responsive and other natural calamities control programme\u2019 was approved in 2020 for implementation across the four provinces on a 50:50 cost-sharing basis and as federally financed projects in Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan.\nHowever, out of the federal share of about Rs46bn, the centre released about Rs38bn (almost 83pc) but the provinces could utilise no more than Rs10.5bn, accounting for only 27.6pc of funds released or about 23pc of the total federal share. Therefore, the relevant authorities in the Ministry of Planning and Development have suggested taking the matter with the prime minister for the withdrawal of unutilised funds from the provinces.\nThe flagship umbrella project was originally approved by the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council in 2020 to provide support to the provinces to respond, reduce and mitigate the impact of the pandemic at an estimated total cost of Rs70bn. The project was then expanded to also include the upgradation of public sector health facilities across the country to Rs88bn to cope with other emergencies, epidemics and natural calamities and support health sector interventions.\n\nResource utilisation has been precariously low in Punjab, Sindh\n\nAs part of this, the components related to the strengthening of public health surveillance system both animal and humans was also included in the modified project along with coverage of improved water supply and sanitation facilities not only in provinces but with particular emphasis on supporting the less developed areas of the country.\nAs such, 14 sub-projects of Punjab, two each for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan and one each for Sindh, AJK and Gilgit Baltistan were made part of the umbrella programme.\nInformed sources said a recent meeting of the Central Development Working Party was told that as of February, the utilisation of funds released by the centre stood precariously low in Sindh and Punjab at 10pc and 25pc respectively.\nThe utilisation rate was the best in Balochistan at 80pc, followed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa at 40pc. Strangely though, the federal government did not release funds for similar schemes in AJK and Gilgit Baltistan.\nThe report noted that the cost of 14 projects in Punjab stood at Rs43.97bn. Of the federal share of Rs19.73bn, the federal government released Rs19.59bn but only Rs5bn could be utilised in the country\u2019s largest province by population. The situation in Sindh was even worse where only Rs1bn could be utilised against Rs20.8bn worth of a single project even though the centre released its entire share of Rs10.4bn.\nOn the other hand, KP utilised about Rs2.1bn against Rs10bn worth of two projects that included the federal share of Rs5bn which stood transferred to the provincial kitty.\nBalochistan was able to utilise Rs2.356bn against its two projects of Rs10.9bn. The federal share in the case of Balochistan stood at Rs7.8bn and the centre had released Rs2.94bn to the provincial government.\n"

However, sales volumes declined for many bellwethers in Europe and the United States, raising investor concerns that consumers are starting to balk at increased costs as the economic outlook dims.\n\u201cThere is uncertainty on how the consumer environment may ultimately play out in 2023, Coca-Cola Chief Executive James Quincey said on a call with investors.\nConsumers have more wiggle room in their budgets, said Ben Ayers, senior economist at Nationwide Economics, pointing to increased use of revolving credit, along with the still-resilient job market. However, that pricing power may not last, as US consumer confidence fell to a nine-month low in April, led by a worsening outlook that could temper spending.\nGlobal shipping leader United Parcel Service forecast full-year revenue at the lower end of estimates for 2023.\n\u201cDeceleration in US retail sales resulted in lower volume than we anticipated, and we faced ongoing demand weakness in Asia,\u201d UPS CEO Carol Tom said. UPS shares were down 9pc on Tuesday, on target for their biggest one-day drop in more than eight years.\nUS automaker General Motors Co lifted its full-year profit expectations on Tuesday, saying demand has been stronger than forecast. Even though electric vehicle leader Tesla has been slashing prices to spur demand, GM was able to increase average wholesale prices for North American deliveries by $1,800 per vehicle.\n\u201cWe feel really good about where we are priced right now and consumers seem to be demanding our products,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said during GM\u2019s conference call.\nBut the pricing gains the automaker enjoyed in the first quarter probably won\u2019t last, according to Jacobson.\nSo far, US companies are exceeding estimates by more than 8pc in the first quarter, and consumer discretionary names have beaten forecasts by 20pc, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. \nBeverage giant Coca-Cola Co said average selling prices rose by 11pc, while rival PepsiCo Inc said its prices gained 16pc in the first quarter. Pepsi\u2019s CEO said the company is confident about improved growth in China, where first-quarter GDP rebounded after that country loosened longtime coronavirus restrictions.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing in China, an optimism in the customers and that\u2019s driving volume for us across both our food and our beverage business,\u201d Ramon Laguarta, PepsiCo chairman and CEO, said on an analyst call.\nExecutives said inflation is hitting customers, particularly in Europe. McDonald\u2019s Corp sales rose 12.6pc worldwide for the quarter, beating expectations, but company CFO Ian Borden said  \u201celevated cost inflation continued to put significant pressure on restaurant cash flows, particularly for our European franchisees.\u201d\n"

The suicide bomber, he said, was an Afghan national brought to Pakistan from Kunduz by the TTP\u2019s Jamaatul Ahrar faction.\nHe said the terrorists operating in Pakistan were being trained in various areas of Afghanistan and efforts were being made to restrict their entry into Pakistan.\n \n\n\nThe DG said that due to the current economic situation, the army had reviewed the operational and non-operational expenditures and decided to cut expenses related to fuel, rations, construction, non-operational procurement, training and non-operational movement. The military has been encouraging online meetings and simulator training and the use of technology to cut down on these expenses.\nElections\nIn response to at least three questions related to the deployment of army personnel for election duties, the spokesperson avoided giving a categorical response.\n \n \n\nHe, however, stressed that the army had given a comprehensive account in the report submitted to the Supreme Court and the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).\nIt may be noted that in its report, the defence ministry had requested the Supreme Court to recall its April 4 order, that had fixed May 14 as the election date for Punjab.\nThe DG ISPR said the federal government is empowered to deploy the armed forces in aid of civil power under Article 245, adding that the report submitted to the Supreme Court was \u201cbased on ground realities\u201d.\n \n \n\nResponding to a question about GHQ\u2019s agreement with the Punjab government to allot 45,257 acres of land to the army for corporate farming, which has been stayed by the Lahore High Court (LHC), Gen Chaudhry claimed that food security was a challenge and governments in many developing countries were utilising the armed forces\u2019 strength to improve the agriculture sector.\nSocial media campaigns\nThe ISPR DG said that the Constitution imposed some \u201creasonable restrictions\u201d on freedom of expression, adding that the kind of comments being seen on social media against state institutions were \u201cirresponsible, illogical and unconstitutional\u201d.\nHe added that the army as an institution cannot promptly respond to social media posts and claimed that some people with \u201cvested interests\u201d, and at the behest of hostile intelligence agencies, were involved in a propaganda campaign against the army.\n\u201cArmy cannot be pressurised because of unwarranted propaganda, there are laws for judges to initiate contempt proceeding against contemnors and the army also resorts to law in such cases,\u201d he said.\nIn response to another question, he said that veterans were an asset for the armed forces, but cautioned them not to indulge in politics.\nHe maintained that the army is \u201capolitical\u201d and that dragging the institution into politics to suppress an ideology, religion or a political party had resulted in chaos in different countries.\nIndian aggression\nReplying to a question pertaining to India, the ISPR DG said Indian aggression and false statements could not change history. The disputed status of Indian-held Kashmir was globally recognised and could not be changed, he said, adding that it was never an integral part of India nor it will remain its part.\nHe said that COAS Gen Munir\u2019s first visit was to the Line of Control (LoC) where the army chief had said that the armed forces could defend every inch of the country and could take the war to the enemies\u2019 territories.\nHe said that the situation at the eastern border remained peaceful due to the implementation of the Pakistan-India Director General Military Operations (DGMOs) Ceasefire 2003 and the 2021 dialogue on the issue.\nHe went on to say that Pakistan always cooperated with United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) and gave full access to the LoC but India did not give such access to any such groups.\nRegarding ceasefire violations, the ISPR chief said that India committed 56 small-scale ceasefire violations, including 22 incidents of ceasefire speculative fire, 3 air space violations, 25 tactical air violations, and 3 ceasefire violations.\nHe added six Indian spy quadcopters were shot down by the Pakistan Army along the LoC.\n"

            "Text": "KARACHI: Yet another taped phone conversation, featuring a former chief justice and a key member of the PTI legal team, emerged on Tuesday, where two men can be heard discussing the suo motu case currently before a three-member bench of the Supreme Court.\nThe latest in a spate of leaks targeting members of the judiciary, the conversation has not been denied by either former top judge Saqib Nisar or PTI\u2019s Kha\u00adwaja Tariq Rahim, but talking to Dawn.com, the ex-CJP questioned the authenticity of the audio, calling it \u201ca theft of my fundamental rights\u201d.\nThe audio clip, which has been widely shared on social and mainstream media platforms, features the voices of two men apparently discussing a previous SC judgement, as well as the elections suo motu currently pending before the apex court.\n\u201cPlease look into that\u2026 it is a seven-member judgment\u2026 this is suo motu number 4 of 2010, sir\u2026 seven-member judgement, 2012, has been reported on page number 553 of the Supreme Court,\u201d the voice of the ex-CJP says.\n\nSaqib Nisar says he is free to give advice to anyone, terms audio \u2018theft\u2019 of his fundamental rights\n\nHere, the man on the other end of the call, beli\u00adeved to be PTI\u2019s Mr Rahim, replies in the affirmative. \u201cWhoever is your lawyer, tell him to check it out. It states that if\u2026 never mind, you\u2019ll know when you will read it,\u201d the ex-CJP says.\nIn response, Mr Rahim purportedly says: \u201cI will read. I have seen the seven-member bench judgment. They have stated in it that until the act is not formulated\u2026 if you read it carefully, clause three has it\u2026\u201d\nAt this point, the voice believed to be Saqib Nisar replies \u201cyes I have seen that, it is the way out for you\u201d.\nHe goes on: \u201cAnd secondly Tariq sahab, if any person of yours is ready, you can use the Munir Ahmed Khan [judgment] which is a clear case of contempt of court.\u201d\n\u201cThat too\u2026 that too,\u201d Mr Rahim replies, after which the ex-CJP purportedly says \u201cafter what happened in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, I don\u2019t think there is any\u2026\u201d\nInterjecting, the person on the other end says that \u201cwe are only waiting for the three-member bench\u2019s verdict\u2026 it can take another half an hour\u2026 after that, we are filing a contempt application\u201d.\nThe audio clip of this alleged conversation comes on the heels of another similar leak, that purportedly featured a conversation between two women \u2014 one of whom was said to be related to a top-ranking serving SC judge, while the other was Mr Rahim\u2019s spouse.\nThe two women could also be heard discussing the case linked to KP and Punjab polls.\nEx-CJP \u2018free to give advice\u2019\nSpeaking to Dawn.com, ex-CJP Nisar termed the audio leak a violation of his right to privacy, adding: \u201cI am a citizen of Pakistan, an ex-CJP and I give free advice to those in office. Khawaja Tariq Rahim is a friend and I gave him advice.\u201d\nLater, in a separate conversation with Dawn, he said: \u201cIt is a discussion between two decades-old friends and professionals, who are discussing a legal point in the context of a particular case. Did I malign any institution or speak against Pakistan? It was a simple discussion on a legal merit.\n\u201cI have my views on legal matters and can discuss them with anyone and everyone seeking advice or just trying to take my input. What is wrong in it? If not, why call it a controversy?\u201d\nPTI\u2019s Khawaja Tariq Rahim, the other person said to be featured in the leaked clip, expressed similar views.\nSpeaking on a YouTube channel, he explained that the conversation was in the context of the disqualification of Sardar Tanveer Ilyas, the former prime minister of Azad Jammu and Kashmir who was shown the door by the Kashmir High Court in a recent contempt of court case.\n\u201cI am neither a lawyer nor a party to that particular case. But, I was certainly interested in seeing what grounds the high court has used to hold Ilyas guilty. It was as simple as that.\u201d\nPML-N reaction\nReacting to the leak, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said in a tweet that he was disappointed to hear the audio, saying that Mr Nisar had gone too far in his quest for revenge against Nawaz Sharif.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou took revenge on Nawaz Sharif and sentenced him. How long will you continue to feed on this poison?\u201d he added.\nThe PML-N \u2014 especially Maryam Nawaz Sharif \u2014 has time and again blamed the former CJP for disqualifying Mr Sharif as prime minister in the Panama Papers case in 2017.\nSharing the audio clip on Tuesday, Minister for Planning Ahsan Iqbal said that the \u201cmastermind of the 2017 regime change and judicial martial law conspiracy still conducting the orchestra\u201d.\nReacting to the leaked audio, Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb also expressed disapproval over what she termed \u201cjudicial bias\u201d in certain high-profile cases.\n\u201cWives, mothers-in-law, children and Dam Baba vs Constitution of Pakistan\u2026 competition is tough and time is running out,\u201d she said in a tweet.\nMuzhira Amin in Karachi and Ahmad Fraz Khan in Lahore also contributed to this report\n"

            "Text": "SWAT: The twin blasts that struck a counter-terrorism facility and killed several people in the Kabal town of Swat were caused by electrical short circuit at a munitions warehouse within the premises, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police have found in a preliminary investigation, ruling out a militant attack, as initially suggested.\nThe number of deaths from the Monday incident has risen to 17 \u2014 nine officers, three civilians and five recently detained militants who were being held there for investigation. Besides, 70 people were injured, mostly police officers.\nOn Tuesday, the KP caretaker government formed a two-member fact-finding committee to investigate the incident.\nIn Kabal, KP police chief Akhtar Hayat Khan told reporters that the blasts happened after rocket-propelled grenades, mines and other arms seized in different cases and stored in the warehouse had gone off due to short circuit.\nMr Khan said that fragments from these explosives struck buildings as far as 400 metres away. A projectile also hit the police lines mosque, leaving a hole in its roof.\nHe said that there was neither any evidence of forced entry at the facility\u2019s gate nor were pellets found in the victims\u2019 post-mortem reports. Besides, no shots were fired at the entrance.\nThe two explosions rocked the police station with an interval of 12 minutes, with the first blast taking place at 8:20pm and the second at 8:32pm, he said.\nHowever, he said the police would investigate the matter with an open mind and consider all angles during the investigation. Besides, the police would work to secure such material stored in other areas as well, he said.\nCommittee\nThe provincial government\u2019s fact-finding committee comprises the secretary of the Home and Tribal Affairs department, Muhammad Abid Majeed, and the additional inspector general of the police\u2019s special branch, Saqib Ismail Memon.\nThe committee has been directed to submit a comprehensive report covering all aspects of the incident.\nKP\u2019s caretaker chief minister, Muhammad Azam Khan, said in a statement that an inquiry into the incident was underway.\nEarlier on Tuesday, the KP police chief, Peshawar\u2019s corps commander, the inspector general of the KP\u2019s Frontier Corps, and the chief secretary visited the facility.\nMr Khan, the police chief, also offered funeral prayers for the deceased police officers and laid wreaths on their coffins.\nA rescue operation was underway on the second day with the help of 100 workers and heavy machinery, Rescue 1122 spokeswoman Shafiqa Gul said, adding that 13 bodies had been shifted to their hometowns.\nProtests in Swat\nMeanwhile, hundreds of people took to the streets in Kabal and Swat capital Mingora to protest the explosions and demand peace in the area.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe protest at Kabal Bazaar was organised by the organisation Swat Olasi Pasoon (Swat Public Uprising), whereas Swat Quami Jirga organised the protest at Nishat Chowk in Mingora.\n"

Similarly, the flawed numbers of the count aren\u2019t being fixed.\u201d\nThe meeting decided to make a final consultation within the party before announcing \u201cthe next step\u201d.\nMQM-P sources said Dr Siddiqi is scheduled to visit Islamabad today [Wednesday] where he is likely to meet the PM and key members of his cabinet, including Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal, to convey the concerns and details of the discussion within the party.\nThey confirmed to Dawn that the committee also decided in its meeting to collect resignations from all its seven MNAs and 21 MPAs before the party convener\u2019s meeting with the PM to lend strength to the party\u2019s stance.\nThe move coincides with the federal government\u2019s decision to extend digital census, scheduled to conclude on April 25, for five more days, after the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) field teams observed a negative growth in 12 major urban areas and needed data verification in 11 major cities.\n\u201cThe areas where the census timeline has been extended include Quetta, Lahore, Rawalpindi, Karachi Central, Karachi South, Karachi West, Karachi East, Malir, Keamari, Korangi, Hyderabad and Islamabad,\u201d the PBS said.\nHowever, the bureau statement\u2019s failed to convince the party to review its stance on the digital headcount.\n\u201cSince the beginning of this ruling partnership in April last year, MQM-P relationship with the alliance has never been very ideal or cordial,\u201d a source said.\n\u201cWhether it is local government elections in Sindh, implementation of Charter of Rights it had signed with the PPP or the digital census \u2013 the MQM-P has always been found on the other side of the fence and complaining. But it has compromised most of the time and the partnership goes on.\n\u201cHowever, this time it looks a little serious because the party would compromise over its political stature if it shows any flexibility in its stance on the Karachi census,\u201d the source believed.\nLater, in a statement, Mr Kamal said the meeting discussed loopholes in the exercise being conducted by PBS, the digital count conducted so far and all aspects of the exercise.\nThe senior deputy convener said the MNAs, who submitted their resignations to the party convener, were of the opinion that they would not go to the assembly until their grievances were addressed.\nThe meeting appreciated the role of the PM and federal minister for planning and development, who not only heard all their reservations but also issued directives to address them, Mr Kamal said. He said the MQM-P was part of the ruling coalition in the centre and would remain with the government at tough times.\n"

But the Supreme Court should take notice of this audio.\u201d\n \n \n\nThe minister further said conversation in the audio leak could drive a wedge between institutions.\n\u201cSaqib Nisar needs to be more careful in his conversation as there is a perception that he had the main role in the conspiracy against Nawaz Sharif in 2016-17,\u201d he said.\nMr Tarar said the parliament had a mandate to make legislation, wondering how could the Supreme Court stop implementation of the Practice and Procedure Bill before its enactment. He asserted that since both houses of parliament had passed the bill, it should be implemented.\nMalik Ahmad Khan, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister, also expressed fears that a conspiracy was afoot to embroil the government in contempt of court proceedings.\n\u201cAfter Saqib Nisar\u2019s audio leak, the government cannot be implicated in contempt of court,\u201d he insisted, urging the apex court to take suo motu notice to reach at the bottom of the matter.\nHe said while a ruling was given for conducting elections in Punjab in 90 days, but it was not applied to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The two assemblies were dissolved in mid-January.\nMalik Ahmad Khan said under Article 34, \u201cwe have the right to move a reference against (retired justice) Saqib Nisar, Chief Justice Bandial and his mother-in-law in the Supreme Judicial Council for (alleged) violation of the code of conduct\u201d.\n"

Today, another convoy carrying 211 Pakistanis dispatched from Khartoum has arrived in Port Sudan,\u201d the minister said in a statement.\n\u201cWith the latest convoy, the total number of Pakistanis who have been evacuated to safety has reached 700,\u201d he said.\nPakistanis were being hou\u00adsed near the port before their onward journey, Mr Bhutto-Zardari tweeted earlier this week.\nOther nations have also stepped up efforts to evacuate their nationals from Sudan, where fighting between the army and paramilitaries has killed and wounded hundreds.\nBut security fears were compounded when the World Hea\u00adlth Organization (WHO) war\u00adned of a \u201chuge biological risk\u201d after fighters occupied a Kha\u00adrtoum laboratory holding samples of cholera, measles, polio and other infectious diseases.\nOn Tuesday, sporadic gunfire rang out in parts of the Sudanese capital Khartoum despite a US-brokered agreement between the warring sides to a ceasefire for 72 hours to pave the way for talks on a more lasting truce.\nMr Bhutto-Zardari said in the statement that the government remained engaged with friendly countries in the region, especially Saudi Ara\u00adbia, to facilitate this process.\nHis statement came a day after the Foreign Office anno\u00adunced that the first batch of 500 Pakistanis had reached the city of Port Sudan, some 850 kilometres from Khartoum, for their onward to Saudi Arabia by sea.\nThe evacuated Pakistanis would be brought back home from Jeddah through special flights with the cooperation of Pakistan Air Force and Pakis\u00adtan International Airlines.\nThe ministry has said that the evacuees are being provided temporary accommodation and food by the government.\nA Foreign Office official said that a comprehensive plan to evacuate Pakistanis from Sudan had been finalised after consulting foreign missions in Sudan and its neighbours.\nHe said an emergency helpline had been set up at Pakistan\u2019s embassy in Khartoum and the diplomatic staff was in constant contact with the stranded Pakistanis.\nOn Sunday, Mr Bhutto-Zardari talked to the Saudi foreign minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, by phone and expressed his gratitude for the kingdom\u2019s help in evacuating Pakistani nationals from Sudan.\nForeign evacuations\nApart from Pakistan, multiple nations have scrambled to evacuate embassy staff and citizens by road, air and sea from Sudan.\nAccording to AFP, more than 5,300 people have left Khartoum in the foreign-led evacuations.\nBritain, which has thousands of citizens in Sudan, announced \u201ca large-scale evacuation\u201d from Tuesday, with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak saying that \u201cpriority will be given to the most vulnerable\u201d.\nGermany announced its last evacuation flight will take off Tuesday evening to Jordan.\nLittle was known about the security situation in remote areas of the poverty-stricken nation, after Darfur in particular has seen heavy fighting in recent days and the looting of aid depots.\nMeanwhile, thousands of Sudanese have tried to flee to Egypt, and the United Nations warned it was bracing for an exodus of up to 270,000 refugees to Sudan\u2019s even poorer neighbours Chad and South Sudan.\nThe UN warned on Tuesday that an estimated 219,000 women in Khartoum are pregnant, with \u201c24,000 expected to give birth in the coming weeks\u201d, amid a near-absence of medical care.\nThe capital city has endured \u201cmore than a week of unspeakable destruction\u201d, Norway\u2019s ambassador Endre Stiansen wrote on Twitter after his evacuation.\nIn an additional threat, the WHO\u2019s representative in Sudan, Nima Saeed Abid, told reporters in Geneva via video link that there was \u201ca huge biological risk associated with the occupation of the central public health lab... by one of the fighting parties\u201d.\nThe United States and European, Middle Eastern, African and Asian nations have launched emergency operations to bring to safety embassy staff and Sudan-based citizens.\n"

Saudi Arabia regularly announces seizures of amphetamine pills without specifying whether they are captagon. The oil-rich Gulf state is believed to be the largest market for the drug.\nIt is used by wealthy Saudis as a party pill and by poorer people who need to stay awake to work several jobs.\n \n \n\nThe vast majority of the region\u2019s captagon, which derives its name from a once legal drug used to combat narcolepsy, is produced in Syria and Lebanon and smuggled to its main consumer market in the Gulf.\nAn investigation in November found that Syria has become a narco-state with the $10 billion industry in captagon dwarfing all other exports and funding both President Bashar al-Assad and many of his enemies.\n"

            "Text": "TEHRAN: Iran has charged two prominent actresses for publishing pictures of themselves flouting the country\u2019s dress code for women, just weeks after announcing a crackdown on breaches, local media reported.\nPolice in Tehran have referred the case against Katayoun Riahi and Pantea Bahram to Iran\u2019s judiciary, accusing them of \u201cthe crime of removing the hijab in public and posting photos on the internet\u201d, the Tasnim news agency said late on Monday. If prosecuted, the pair could face fines or prison terms.\nEarlier this month police said they would begin using \u201csmart\u201d technology in public places to crack down on women defying Iran\u2019s compulsory dress code.\nLast week, photos of Bahram, 53, went viral after she posed without a headscarf at a film screening, while Riahi, 61, posted several photos taken in public places around Tehran in which she did not wear a headscarf.\nThe requirement for women to wear the headscarf in public was imposed shortly after the Islamic revolution of 1979.\nThe number of women in Iran defying the dress code has increased since a wave of protests following the Sept 16 death in custody of Kurdish-Iranian Mahsa Amini, 22, for allegedly breaching it.\nOn April 16, authorities said they had closed 150 commercial establishments whose employees were not complying with the dress code. Bahram and Riahi have won several awards at Iran\u2019s leading cinema event, the Fajr International Film Festival.\nIn November, Riahi was released on bail after more than a week\u2019s detention for posting photos to Instagram in solidarity with the Amini protests, showing herself without a headscarf.\nShe was the first Iranian actress to post such images on social media in support of the protest movement.\nJournalist re-arrested\nOn Tuesday, a dissident Iranian journalist has been arrested again, barely three months after his release from prison following two years of incarceration, his family said. Keyvan Samimi, known for his activism, was arrested on Thursday, a family member said.\n\u201cWe still have no further information on the (security) service responsible for his arrest or his whereabouts,\u201d they added.\nThe 74-year-old was released from Semnan prison in January after being sentenced to three years in jail for \u201cplotting against national security\u201d in December 2020.\nSince his release, he is known to have met activists and other political figures, including reformist former president Mohammad Khatami.\nIn January, Samimi\u2019s family said he also faced a separate case in which he was accused of \u201cassociation against the security of the country\u201d. They did not elaborate.\nIn February 2022, Samimi was provisionally released from prison and returned home due to health issues but was re-incarcerated in May after being suspected of engaging in political activities.\nA former editor of the now-banned intellectual magazine Iran-e Farda (Iran Tomorrow), Samimi has been imprisoned several times, before and after the revolution.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: Taking stern notice of the mushroom growth of kiosks, encroachment of verandas and footpaths in busy commercial centres in the federal capital, National Assembly (NA) Speaker Raja Pervez Asharf has directed the NA\u2019s standing committee on interior to retake a pending calling attention notice on the matter to decide how to tackle the problem.\nThe speaker took action in light of the recent incident of thrashing of a family by workers of some food kiosks in the busy F-7 Markaz commercial centre on the eve of Eid. \n\u201cThe speaker has also asked head of the committee to discuss the matter and find out the best possible ways to control misuse of state land,\u201d a senior official of the National Assembly Secretariat (NAS) told Dawn on Tuesday.   \nThe calling attention notice moved by Member of National Assembly (MNA) Asiya Azeem in October last year said: \u201cTo invite attention of the minister for interior to matter of urgent public importance regarding illegal shops and carts in the commercial centres of Islamabad, causing grave concern amongst the public.\u201d\n\nSays state land must not be misused\n\nAccording to a media report, Minister of State for Interior Abdul Rehman Khan Kanju had replied to the notice and asked the speaker to refer the notice to the committee so that detailed discussions could be made on it. \nFollowing the request of the minister and consent of the mover, Asiya Azeem, (PTI), the notice had been forwarded to the committee.\nIt is worth mentioning here that the Capital Development Authority (CDA) has decided to auction 300 kiosks in different parts of Islamabad and recently city managers gave an advertisement in national dailies inviting bids for purpose. \nHowever, experts on civic issues believe that the city does not need more kiosks because it had become crowded. \n\u201cThe CDA\u2019s plan will be misused as when the auction will take place no poor or deserving man will be \nable to compete in the auction and all 300 kiosks will be grabbed by rich and well off people,\u201d a retired CDA official said. \nDespite conducting a number of operations against encroachments and grabbing of state land, the CDA has so far failed to control growing encroachments in Islamabad which are challenging the writ of CDA.\nSome of the main commercial centres where abundance of illegal kiosks and encroachment can be seen include Jinnah Super Market, Super Market, F-8 Markaz in the vicinity of district courts, F-10 Markaz, Karachi Company Market, Aabpara Market, F-11 Markaz, G-8 Markaz, I-9 and I-10 I&T centres. \nPeople have complained that due to encroachments of footpaths and verandas in major markets, they could not move easily. \nThese areas have been encroached by small vendors and food outlets. \u201cThe owners of food stalls have also encroached green areas and green belts in markets and behave as if they own these places and not the state,\u201d said a customer Rehan Ahmed in F-7.      \nUnchecked encroachment in under-developed sectors is said to be the main reason behind their non development.  \nFast growing encroachments in Mehrabad Village where two sectors G-12 and F-12 are to be developed is evidence of poor vigilance of the CDA staff that has failed to stop such activities there. \nNow, these two sectors are considered the most difficult to acquire, where hundreds of houses and huge industrial units have been constructed illegally.\n"

Residents have complained about the indifferent attitude of the Rawalpindi and Chaklala Cantonment Board (RCB) towards their misery. Among the areas facing water shortage are Kalma Chowk, Azizabad, Mughalabad, Ali Road and Adra in the jurisdiction of cantonment. \nThe cantonment area residents also criticised the RCB for supplying water for just 20 minutes a day. They lashed out at the civic body for not providing water to residents even when dams are full. \nSuhail Shah, resident of Peshawar Road, said that water supply to the area had been disturbed for the past few years. He also complained of RCB\u2019s indifference toward their complaints. He said that repeated complaints to RCB in this respect had so far \u201cfallen on deaf ears\u201d. He alleged that RCB officials remained away during office hours. \nNisar Ahmed from Chungi number 22, said that water shortage had crippled people\u2019s life during Ramazan, adding that getting water from a private bowser cost Rs2500, which was unaffordable for him. \nMohammad Aslam, a resident of Lal Kurti, said that the CCB released water on alternative days and they are still conducting water rationing in the areas despite improvement in water reservoirs due to recent rains. \nAbdur Rehman, another local, said the CCB had installed a new tube well in the area but no new water was provided yet. Farooq Ahmed, of Allahabad, accused RCB officials of being discourteous when people approached them for redressal of complaints. \nThe officials, however, said that the RCB was striving to improve the water situation in the area. They said the daily supply of 9 million gallons daily (MGDs) water from Khanpur Dam was too little to meet their needs. They said the RCB would initiate new projects during the current fiscal year (2023-24) to improve supply network in different localities.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: All major facilities at Pakistan Sports Complex (PSC) are lying dormant since 2020 when these were closed down to counter the Covid-19 spread.\nSome of the major sports facilities were also vital sources of revenue generation for Pakistan Sports Board (PSB). These included badminton courts, swimming pool, squash courts, gym and lawn tennis.\nMoreover, the federal government has also drastically slashed funding for the PSB and as a result the reopening of the sports facilities is likely to be delayed further.\nUnlike the elite clubs which provide such facilities to their members only, the sports facilities at the PSC were accessible to general public, including professional and amateur players and senior citizens, through regulated membership.\nAfter the government ended the lockdown and the elite clubs also opened their sports facilities, the management of the PSB reopened lawn tennis courts and gym but kept the other facilities shut as it started repair and maintenance work on the premises.\nSafi Ahsan, 78, is an amateur swimmer and member of the swimming pool since 1992.\nSince he limps and could not walk or does fitness exercise, doctors have advised him to swim to maintain fitness.\nHowever, he said since March 2020 when the pool became inaccessible, he has developed certain health issues.\nInterestingly, the repair and maintenance work, which is yet to complete, had been initiated with millions of rupees funds at a time when the financial and administrative matters of the PSB were sub judice in Islamabad High Court (IHC).\nThe PSB employees union in 2020 filed a petition in the IHC against execution of multi-million rupees development works through the Public Works Department (PWD).\nAs per the petition, a major chunk of the funds were spent on the repair of roads instead of maintenance of sports facilities.\nIHC Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani deciding the petition termed the transfer of funds to PWD illegal and ordered the recovery of any loss from the officials concerned.\nThe PSB filed an intra-court appeal against IHC\u2019s order which is still pending in the court.\nFollowing the court orders, insiders said, the PSB administration did not initiate any inquiry against any official. Moreover, the administration hired an official from the PWD as the executive engineer on deputation.\nThey said the executive engineer rehired the same firms through which PWD had executed the development work against which the IHC had ruled.\nWhile the development work on the badminton courts and swimming pool was near completion, the PSB was told that the federal government due to ongoing financial crunch had cut about 50pc expenditures of the Sports Complex.\nResultantly, the PSB is not in a position to timely clear the outstanding dues of the contractors, hence, the pace of work has slowed down.\nPSB\u2019s Director General Ibrar Ahmed, when contacted, admitted that the repair and maintenance could be commenced during the lockdown. He said that since he had assumed charge of the office last year, he was struggling to reopen the facilities as soon as possible.\nHe said the PSB had increased the fee for its members to overcome the funding issues.\n"

But after the 2018 general elections, the project was shelved by the former PTI government in the province.\nHowever, the process to restart work on the project has started again in the current fiscal year and the RDA has forwarded the project to the government for inclusion in the annual development programme. \nHe said this time RDA has decided to construct an underpass on the road from Saddar to Fiazabad and a link road for Liaquat Road towards Fawara Chowk.\nThe flyover at Liaquat Bagh was found not to be feasible as it required more funds to acquire land on both sides of Liaquat Baghsquare.\nWhen contacted, the RDA director general said the underpass will be constructed on Murree Road in front of Liaquat Bagh on Saddar to Fiazbad side and the road will be connected with Liaquat Road.\nHe said it was the demand of local residents to end traffic congestion on Liaquat Bagh Chowk, especially for travellers towards Raja Bazaar.\nHe said the RDA had made an initial plan and sent it to the Punjab government for final approval. It will reflect in the new annual development programme of Punjab government, he added.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The city managers have decided to start development work in Sector C-16, which is located in the foothills of the Margallas along the newly-constructed Margalla Avenue, and also launched an anti-encroachment drive in the sector.\n\u201cThe revised layout plan of this sector was approved last week by the CDA board. After completing some formalities, we will invite tenders for development work in this sector,\u201d said Capital Development Authority (CDA) Chairman Noorul Amin Mengal.\nSpeaking to Dawn on Tuesday, the CDA chief said that there were some issues pertaining to planning and survey in the said sector, which have been settled by the civic body.\n\u201cWe have already published pre-qualification notice for the construction firms, so now there is no hurdle to start the development work,\u201d he said and added that the engineering wing had prepared a complete timeline for the development of C-16.\n\nCivic body removes \u2018illegal settlement\u2019 in anti-encroachment drive\n\nAccording to CDA officials, the sector has around 2500 residential plots, a \u2018markaz\u2019, and class-III shopping centres. Asked about CDA\u2019s lethargic attitude towards sector development, Mr Mengal said that he would ensure the timely completion of ongoing development work in various residential sectors, including C-16.\nAnti-encroachment operation\nMeanwhile, the enforcement wing of the CDA conducted an anti-encroachment operation in C-16 and removed an \u201cillegal Afghan settlement\u201d. \u201cEnforcement Wing and the Land Directorate conducted a full-scale operation to eliminate Afghan settlements and illegal constructions in Sector C-16 to keep Islamabad free from encroachments and illegal constructions,\u201d said a press release issued by CDA.\nIt is relevant to note here that Sector E-12 was launched in 1989, but the CDA failed to develop it despite the passage of decades. A few years ago, the civic agency started the development work, but subsequently, it was slowed down. Meanwhile, development work is in progress in sectors I-12, C-14 and C-15.\nOn the other hand, Sector I-15 is near completion: once completed this sector will be the first developed sector after D-12, which was developed over a decade ago. This sector has 10,289 plots of various sizes, mainly for low-income groups.\nThe CDA officials said that sectors C-13, C-14, C-15, and C-16, which are located along Margalla Avenue will have significant commercial potential for the civic agency. They said Sector C-13, which is the smallest sector of a few hundred kanal, should also be started at the earliest.\nIn addition to said sectors, there are several other sectors acquired by the CDA. However, the civic body has failed to get possession of the land in these areas. The sector, F-13, D-13, E-13, C-14, H-16, and I-17, were acquired by the civic agency in 2007-8, but the CDA did not announce the award of built-up property (compensation related to constructed houses). This negligence resulted in an increase in houses on the land even though it had been acquired by the CDA.\n"

Excessive use of sugar, salt and ultra processed foods has an important role in kidney diseases. \n\u201cWe need to avoid sugary drinks if we want to reduce diabetes and blood pressure which is among the major causes of kidney diseases. According to a meta analysis of different studies in years 2020 and 2021, daily use of one small glass of sugary drinks increases the risk of diabetes by 19pc and blood pressure by 10pc,\u201d he said. \n\u201cThis ultimately increases the risk of kidney diseases. The government shall take policy actions to reduce the consumption of these unhealthy drinks. An evidence based policy action is to increase the tax on these unhealthy drinks. In many countries when they increased tax on sugary drinks, the consumption of these drinks decreased significantly,\u201d he said. \nSecretary general of Pakistan National Heart Association (Panah) Sanaullah Ghuman demanded from the government of Pakistan to increase taxes on beverages by at least 50pc. \n\u201cThe reduction of consumption of these drinks will help decrease kidney diseases,\u201d he said, adding that overall diabetes prevalence in Pakistan was almost 19 percent and over 522 million people were currently living with diabetes globally. \nMr Ghumman said that 90 percent of diabetic patients have type 2 diabetes, which means that they are not born with diabetes and develop it because of different reasons later on. \nHe said risk factors may include genetics, being overweight, gestational diabetes and polycystic ovary in women. \nHowever sugary drinks and an inactive life increases chances of diabetes.\n"

            "Text": "KARACHI: \u201cIt\u2019s been 18 long months since our father was arrested at sea by the Indian coastguard,\u201d sighs 21-year-old Haroon Rashid, the eldest of fisherman Akhtar Ali\u2019s four children leading a difficult existence in a small two-room rented place in UC-6 of Machhar Colony.\nSpeaking to Dawn at the Imkaan Welfare Organisation\u2019s field office, Haroon, who works at a seafood factory and finds it challenging to make ends meet, said a lot had changed for his family in the absence of his father.\n\u201cSuddenly I\u2019m the family elder. I work hard all night from Maghrib till Sehri. I don\u2019t miss a single day\u2019s work even when I\u2019m sick because if I do I won\u2019t get paid for that day. I carry heavy loads of 70 to 80kg to and from containers. I do it for my mother and younger brothers and sister. My little sister is only 12 years old. I make sure she goes to school. My brothers are 17 and 15. The older of the two, Noor Bashar, left home and is living with my paternal uncle now and the other, Rizwan, here [he glanced at his brother who had accompanied him to the field office], tries to help if he can find part-time work anywhere. Work doesn\u2019t come easily these days.\n\u201cI am unable to send my brothers to school. They are also getting older and are at a phase in life that they give me attitude. I\u2019m also not their father so cannot control them. We are all sad and frustrated. So once when I was a little extra harsh on Noor, he just left home. I feel bad but things are out of my control. My mother feels for me, she has offered to find work cleaning fish and shrimps but I won\u2019t allow her. She observes purdah. When my father was here, he made sure she was comfortable and at home. I won\u2019t let that change at least,\u201d said Haroon as his eyes pooled up though he was quick to hide his tears.\n\nFamily\u2019s ordeal began after boat of Akhtar Ali crossed over to Indian side by accident\n\nThere were 11 other fishermen with Haroon\u2019s father onboard the fishing boat \u2018Allah Tawakal\u2019 when it unknowingly crossed over to the Indian side. \u201cAll have families here in Machhar Colony. Some have four children, some have three or two. All are miserable. All have set aside their own dreams to work and earn,\u201d said Haroon.\n\u201cWhen they were caught we found a video of them on social media. They were made to sit in a line by the Indian Coastguard who were pushing them and beating them. We have taken screenshots from the video,\u201d said the boy bringing out coloured plastic-covered pictures of the screenshots. He pointed out his father kneeling down among the men.\n\u201cWhen this all happened, all the families of these fishermen were paid a visit by people from the Fishermen Cooperative Society. We were given a sack of food rations and Rs12,000 each. Then it was all over. They never returned and we were forgotten and on our own.\n\u201cTwo days before my father was arrested I got Rs72,000 from a committee I used to contribute to on a monthly basis. I was planning to start my own little fish selling business from that money but it all got used up in my running from pillar to post trying to find out what happened to my father and in taking care of my family. I used to have a mobile phone at the time. But I sold it to buy water for our place.\n\u201cOur monthly rent is Rs5,000, the electricity bills amount to Rs1,500 to 2,000, water we buy from a tanker for Rs3,000. Rs4,500 is spent on a 25kg sack of rice and Rs10,000 to 15,000 goes in other groceries including vegetables and oil. We usually eat rice and chickpeas. I can\u2019t afford much else in these times of extreme inflation,\u201d he shared.\n\u201cI used to dream about going to school and studying hard but being the eldest son it was never on the cards for me. I could only attend a madressah when I was little. I have been working with my father from the age of 10. Sometimes I would put on one of my brothers\u2019 school uniforms just to fantasise being a school kid, too, but \u2026 Now I\u2019m making sure that at least my little sister gets to go to school. She attends the TCF School nearby,\u201d he smiles.\nImkaan Welfare Organisation works for children\u2019s rights, women\u2019s rights, education, health, legal aid, citizenship and identification. Haroon and his brother Rizwan\u2019s case was recently tweeted by the organisation as a part of its research findings.\nAlthough Haroon\u2019s parents have CNICs, many people and even children of Machhar Colony, born in Pakistan, remain stateless. Haroon himself was turned away by National Database and Registration Authority because they found irregularities in his birth documents.\n"

He has been kept at an undisclosed place in view of heightened religious sentiments amid a protest in the neighbourhood against the incident.\nThe 35-year-old victim lodged an FIR (No. 26/23) against the suspect under Sections 376 (punishment of rape) of the Pakistan Penal Code.\nShe stated in the FIR that she had come to visit Rani Bagh along with her mother and brother\u2019s wife on the first day of Eid (April 22) and then decided to visit the Shiv Temple located within the vicinity of the local Circuit House. \nShe stated that she met the suspect who told her that he could resolve her problems in life and asked her to visit him alone on Monday (April 24). She further stated that she went to the temple, where the suspect raped her in a room after throwing \u201csome powder\u201d on her face that made her drowsy.\nAccording to Cantonment ASP Aleena Rajpar, who is supervising the investigation, the police were primarily concerned with the commissioning of the offence, and not with the nature of her problem for which she had approached the priest.\nThe ASP said that the preliminary report of her medico-legal examination was not yet issued but doctors conveyed to the SHO that the offence of rape was indeed committed.\nShe said that the police could make a definite statement after examining the victim\u2019s medical report.\nSources said that the woman, mother of a son, had some issues with her husband for which she had approached the suspect to \u2018control\u2019 him through some magic\u2019 spell. \nKARACHI: The All Pakistan Hindu Punchayat (APHP) on Tuesday condemned the rape of a woman in the Shiv Temple of Hyderabad allegedly committed by a priest. \nThe incident sparked protests in the area with enraged people demanding action against the suspect and justice to the victim.\nAPHP chairman Shankar Lal Wadhwani condemned the incident and said: \u201cHindu religion believes in dignity and honour of women. It does not allow its followers to disgrace any woman. If anyone from the Hindu community commits such a deplorable act, he detracts from religious lines. He is for sure a criminal and our community does not support him ...\u201d.\nMr Wadhwani further stated: \u201cHindu community here comprises patriotic Pakistanis who believe in co-existence with equality and mutual respect for all castes and creeds. Temples are holy places and open to all. If any person, be it a Hindu, is found responsible for a crime, he will be answerable. We see all human beings as one family and our support will always remain with victims. We are and will always be on the side of the law and court\u2019s decision would be supreme for us\u201d.\n"

He warned that the prevailing conditions were leading the country towards disastrous consequences.\nMr Baloch said Pakistan was faced with economic, political and constitutional crises and politicians had to find a way out. The situation could not be improved by using the judiciary and establishment, he said, adding that martial law regimes never resolved problems in the past. If politicians again allowed themselves to be used by the establishment, they would face a deeper crisis, he cautioned.\nHe said JI advised democratic forces to give up their ego and stubbornness to adopt democratic path in line with the Constitution which was possible only through dialogue. \nHe observed that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and PTI chief Imran Khan appreciated JI\u2019s overtures. \nMr Baloch said international forces could create such conditions that they had created in Syria, Libya, Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen. \u201cWe [politicians] should assert and take our own decisions instead of seeking support from the international establishment,\u201d he added. \nThe JI leader pointed out that his party had won a clear majority in the Jan 15 LG polls in Karachi but, he deplored, attempts were afoot to convert this victory into defeat. He hoped that Karachi mayor would be from JI. \nOther JI leaders who spoke at the gathering included Mohammad Hussain Mahanti, Mumtaz Sahito, Abdul Waheed Qureshi, Tahir Majeed and Aqeel Ahmed Khan.\n"

The apex court should put the system to an end, it added. \nUnless tough decisions were taken to rid people of corrupt mafias and recover looted national wealth from them, the country could not be extricated from present morass, it said.\nThe meeting discussed overall political situation in the country, including Sindh. It also reviewed party\u2019s ongoing \u2018Sindh Bahali (rehabilitation) Tehreek\u2019.

Syed\u2019s death anniversary, observed today (April 25). \nIt said that workers were insulted and humiliated when they reached Sann.

It said PPP had always tried to create a violent situation in Sann.\nZain Shah told journalists that there was instability in the country. He said SUP believed that state institutions had failed to maintain equilibrium due to ongoing political, economic and judicial crises. \u201cSUP stands for a neutral set-up to hold free and fair elections as it is the only solution to present crises,\u201d he said.\nHe said that SUP held PPP\u2019s Sindh government responsible for present lawlessness which had gripped the entire province. On the one hand, he observed, economic degradation and destruction in the country had left people psychologically tormented and, on the other, cases of kidnapping for ransom and murder had become the order of the day.\nZain Shah said that 80pc villages in Sindh had become no-go areas due to cruel feudal system and tribal clashes in Shikarpur, Ghotki, Kandhkot-Kashmore and Jacobabad. The government had lost its writ, he said, and noted that whenever police tried to arrest criminals, they themselves suffered heavy casualties.\n"

They added that efforts were under way for a judicial coup in the country.\n\nAsks SC to take suo motu notice of Imran\u2019s recent interview \n\nThe information minister said that a very serious situation was developing in the country as the questions were being raised on the ways cases were being handled in the judiciary on the basis of \u201cpersonal likes and dislikes\u201d.\nHe said Imran Khan revealed that the meeting with former army chief retired Gen Qamar Bajwa was held in August in President House. \u201cBefore this meeting, Imran Khan had launched a social media campaign against Gen Bajwa,\u201d he said and alleged that the President House had become the centre of conspiracies.\nThe minister also came down heavily on the former chief justice of Pakistan, Saqib Nisar, and said he was fully involved in conspiracies. \u201cRight from the beginning Saqib Nisar had played the role of a facilitator for PTI chief Imran Khan,\u201d he alleged.\nHe said that political parties were being directed to hold dialogue, which was not the function of judiciary. \u201cUnder which provision of the Constitution these orders are being passed,\u201d he asked.\nMr Memon said the institutions were the hope of the entire nation, but unfortunately a few people were tilted in favour of a particular party on the basis of personal likes and dislikes, that put a question mark on the whole judicial system of the country.\nHe said the PTI chief was a puppet. \u201cEarlier, he was acting on someone\u2019s instructions, now he is ready to act on someone else\u2019s signals,\u201d he added.\nThe minister maintained that the PTI chief had earlier tried to defame Pakistan Army and targeted judiciary at some points. \u201cNow this person (IK) is plotting to defame the country,\u201d he said, claiming that a social media cell of the PTI abroad was engaged in that task.\nBarrister Wahab, who is also CM\u2019s adviser on law, demanded that an investigation be initiated into the dissolution of Punjab and KP assemblies.\nHe said legislation was the function of parliaments and assemblies all over the world. \u201cBut unfortunately, the constitution is changed through some court decisions in our country,\u201d he added.\nThe provincial government\u2019s spokesman said the PPP wanted an end to uncertainty prevailing in the country.\nHe said that such decisions were made which affected the elected governments and prime ministers. \u201cIt should be decided that all the decisions will be made by the chief justice instead of the parliament,\u201d he said. \u201cPoliticians were the representatives of people, even then they could not change the Constitution,\u201d he added.\n"

The outlawed Balochistan Liberation Army claimed responsibility for the attack.\nTo date, law enforcement agencies are groping in the dark to find out the whereabouts of Dr Haibatan, the spouse of Shari Baloch, who, along with his two children, went into hiding before his wife carried out the suicide bombing.\nThe case is pending trial before an antiterrorism court as only one suspect, said to be a facilitator, is in custody and remaining suspects \u2014 Haibatan Baloch, BLA commanders Bashir Zeb, Rehman Gul, Khalil Waja, spokesman Mir Safeer \u2014 have been declared proclaimed offenders.\nAccording to the charge sheet filed by the police in the ATC, Dad Bux was arrested on July 4, 2022 near Machli Chowk on Hawkesbay Road. He allegedly conducted reconnaissance and provide information to other suspects.\nFollowing the attack, the Confucius Institute was closed for some time but later on, it resumed its academic activities.\nA KU official, who wished not to be named, said that it was decided by Pakistani and Chinese authorities that the Chinese would not physically teach at the institute till a satisfactory security situation. Therefore, now Pakistani students who had studied in China were teaching at the KU while Chinese academics gave lectures online from China.\nFallout of the attack\nThe suicide attack carried out by a woman highlighted a shift in Baloch militancy and that resulted in a crackdown on not only on separatist elements, but also on students and enhanced security for Chinese working in Pakistan.\nSecurity analysts said that the KU blast targeting Chinese academics produced two outcomes. First a crackdown is launched on separatist elements and radicals, mostly students, not only in Karachi and Balochistan, but also in other parts of the country, particularly in academic institutes of Punjab and Islamabad.\nMohammad Amir Rana, director of Pak Institute of Peace Studies (PIPS), told Dawn that the scale of Baloch militancy was limited, but its intensity had been increased.\nBesides, he added that perception was gaining strength that radicalism, particularly among educated Baloch youth belonging to the Baloch Students Organisation (BSO), was also increasing. The use of a female suicide bomber, who was an educated woman, indicated this situation.\nMr Rana said that mainstream parties and Baloch tribal chieftains might be against suicide bombing, but militant groups had adopted it as their strategy.\nCiting data maintained by the PIPS, Mr Rana said that after the KU blast, a significant crackdown was launched on Baloch and Sindhi separatist elements and scores of them were detained. The Baloch students were also detained from the Punjab University and the Quaid-i-Azam University.\nThe second trend which has been noticed after the KU suicide bombing is related to provision of enhanced security to Chinese working on CPEC and non-CPEC related projects.\nTalking to Dawn, South-SSP Syed Asad Raza said that the security for Chinese, who mostly lived or have offices in South district, had remained a concern for law enforcers.\nHe revealed that there were over 120 locations in South district where some hundred Chinese associated with CPEC and non-CPEC were living or working in offices. \u201cProviding security to these Chinese is a serious concern for law enforcers amid growing threats,\u201d he observed.\n"

            "Text": "LAHORE: The bureaucratic bottlenecks and the alleged negligence on the part of the university\u2019s administration have delayed the establishment of a new independent and self-contained campus of the historic King Edward Medical University, Lahore, at Muridke-Narowal Road.  \nIt was one of the mega health schemes which had been facing delay for many years due to the alleged negligence on the part of, primarily, the institute\u2019s administration.\nUnder the project, the major facilities which were to be provided included college of allied health sciences, college of postgraduate medical sciences, an international undergraduate medical college, an institute of dentistry, college of nursing, 1,000-bed new hospital, an emergency block for 300 patients, hostels for over 900 students, nursing hostel for over 300 students, residential blocks/areas for various tiers, residents\u2019 hostels for 175 each boys and girls and 20 other facilities.\nOriginally, the scheme had been launched in 2015 at a cost of Rs175 million when its PC-II was approved the same year.\n\nSuccessive VCs seem reluctant to execute project as VC office is to be shifted to Muridke\n\nLater, the academic council of the KEMU approved the master plan for the new campus of the varsity in June 2017 including the construction of 1,000-bed teaching hospital and a 100-seat international level undergraduate medical college at Rs11 billion cost at that time.  \nThe chief minister had promised Rs2bn for the project while rest of the funds were to be managed by the KEMU through its own resources.\nThe bureaucratic hurdles continued to delay the scheme which is still awaiting attention of the authorities as nothing has been done so far to materialise the project despite getting approvals from all relevant forums except hiring of few guards, transplantation of trees and recruitment of managerial staff including consultants, engineers against hefty salary packages.\nInterestingly, the official document pertaining to the new campus of the KEMU itself shows non-seriousness when it claims \u201csome major achievements of the project\u201d so far.  \nAbout the achievements, the document says, \u201cThe university has acquired the land from the government on Muridke-Narowal Road, security guard rooms have been built, the master plan of the new campus got approved, boundary walls partially completed, and consultants have been hired.\u201d\nAn official privy to the mega scheme said the successive KEMU vice chancellors had been using delaying tactics because as per plan the VC office was to be shifted from Lahore\u2019s office to new campus at Muridke.\nHe said the office/building and all other assets of the institute belonged to the King Edward Medical College.  \nAfter the restoration of the historic institute\u2019s college status, the KEMU VC was bound to transfer the office and other belongings to the KEMU principal to use it as per rules and regulations.\nThe official said this demand was raised when the Medical Teaching Institute (Reforms) Act 2020 was enforced in 2021 and the Board of Governors was formed.\nHowever, the Act, later, lapsed and BoG dissolved, abolishing the status of the medical college just for the sake of empowering the VC to hold his entire command over the varsity.\nSince the launch of the scheme, the VCs have been holding briefing sessions, the official said adding that practically, they did nothing so far except to seek attention of the higher authorities.  \nSharing background perspective of the new campus at Muridke on 229 acres land, the official said when its execution was delayed for more than two years or so in 2017, the Provincial Development Working Party approved the PC-II of the KEMU in November 2019.  \nThe then Planning and Development (P&D) Board Chairman Habeebur Rehman Gilani chaired the meeting when approval to the PC-II was granted at that time.\nAs per the plan, many multi-storey buildings were to be constructed to accommodate the maximum facilities including all the essential components of a medical university under one roof.\nAbout the reasons, the document says, the project of new campus was proposed in Muridke as the existing premises of the KEMU in Lahore was located in a densely populated area (Anarkali) and visited by thousands of people every day for shopping.  \nAs Anarkali was always choked with traffic and resonating with the noise of horns, students were finding it difficult to focus on their educational activities.\nConsequently, travelling to and from the university was no less than an uphill task, according to the document.\nSimilarly, it was highlighted that when KEMC was upgraded to the university in 2006, its campus was not spacious enough to meet the fresh demands.  \nAt that time the medical science was developing at a tremendous pace, requiring establishment of new departments and facilities.\nHowever, due to acute shortage of space, neither the hostels could be built nor any other department could be created.  \nEven no open space was available in the near vicinity which could be acquired to undertake these development activities.\nIn view of these issues, it was decided by the Punjab government to establish new self-contained campus of the KEMU.\nThe document further states that the PC-II of the scheme was approved from P&DW at a total cost of Rs175m in 2015.\nAfter fulfilling the codal formalities, the PMU staff was recruited in April and May 2016 for two years. Funds for the project for financial year 2015-16 amounting to Rs23.6m were received in June 2016.\nMeanwhile, the services of the Engineering Services Consultant (ESC) hired for the designing of the project in July 2016 were terminated in July 2017 because of poor performance and very slow work.\nThe hiring of new consultant was started in October 2017 and the second consultant G3 Engineering Consultants (Pvt) Ltd. was hired in January 2018 with a bilateral agreement.\nThe revised PC-II (for extension in gestation period) was sent for approval in March 2018.\nThe Punjab Specialised Healthcare & Medical Education Department put observations on submitted revised PC-II in October 2018.\nLater, amendments were proposed and a revised PC-II amounting to Rs223.9m for the period of January 2017-June 2020 was submitted in February 2019.\nAfter incorporating the proposed amendments and observations by the P&D department, the revised PC-II with a total cost of Rs145.2m was approved in January 2020.\nLater on, the gestation period was extended till December 2021. The document further says the PC-I of the construction of the international hospital and undergraduate medical college was to be submitted by the third week of December 2022.  \nThis assignment couldn\u2019t be completed on given time period due to some reasons even after approval of the PC-I from the Punjab government.  \nSome of the reasons included a dispute between the KEMU and the Civil Aviation Authority on the construction of the boundary walls of the campus and retirement of the then project director.  \nIn view of the above-mentioned circumstances, the gestation period of one year [w.e.f Jan 1, 2023 to Dec 31, 2023 is required so that the designing and documentation as per approved scope of the consultant agreement can be completed.\n"

            "Text": "LAHORE: Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) emir Sirajul Haq has rejected the official explanation of the Swat valley terror incident, demanding a judicial inquiry into it.\nIn a statement issued on Tuesday, he questioned the presence of mortar shells and ammunition in a populated area inside the CTD station, saying the government officials were issuing contradictory statements regarding the incident. He said the Swat terror incident, the second biggest a few months after the Peshawar mosque massacre and days after the National Security Council meeting, had itself raised questions on the government\u2019s ability to handle security. If the rulers could not provide the people with protection, they should go home, he added.\nMr Haq declared it as unfortunate that the governments either had not shown any interest in conducting investigation into the terrorism incidents or the findings were kept secret if there was an inquiry. The people were still unaware of the official findings of the APS (Army Public School) tragedy, he said, adding the only inquiry which was made public so far was conducted by Justice Qazi Faez Isa.\nMeanwhile, the JI chief made a telephonic call to Afghan Foreign Minister Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi, giving him Eid greetings. He also conveyed good wishes to the people of Afghanistan and prayed for the peace and prosperity in both the countries.\nHaq highlighted the need of strengthening cooperation between Pakistan and Afghanistan for establishment of peace, linking it to the prosperity of the entire region. He said both the nations had been connected with each other for centuries through the common bond of religion and geography. The development in Pakistan and Afghanistan and prosperity of the people of two countries could only be possible if the governments succeeded in establishing peace and eradicating the menace of terrorism, he added.\n"

The chief justice should form a full-court bench instead of imposing a judicial martial law (by forming a selective bench to hear certain political cases),\u201d PPP Central Punjab acting president Rana Farooq Saeed told a press conference here on Tuesday.\nUrging the CJP not to make full-court bench an \u2018ego issue\u2019, he said various bar councils as well as almost all political parties were demanding constitution of a full-court bench.\nHe said the Supreme Court comprised the chief justice and 16 other judges and that a full court would help resolve all the complications being seen in the present political and constitutional crises as it would also be acceptable to all.  \nHe said female members of some judges\u2019 families were making a mockery of the law and national politics as all was being done [by the three-judge bench] to appease just one person [Imran Khan].  \nFlanked by Samina Gharki, Aslam Gul, Faisal Mir, Ahmad Jawad and others, Mr Saeed said the deteriorating political, economic and law & order situation was open to all and in such circumstances the apex court was functioning as a panchayat (instead of resolving the issue through a fair legal process).\nHe said the judiciary must not repeat the 1970s history and should hold fair and transparent elections to all assemblies simultaneously on the single day.\nHe regretted that ex-CJP Saqib Nisar-led Supreme Court had declared Imran as sadiq and ameen while the whole Europe was aware of the cricketer-turned-politician\u2019s (bad) character.\nHe alleged that three people, including Mr Nisar, conspired against the country for creating chaos in the domestic politics.\nThe PPP leader demanded that the minutes of a meeting held between former army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa and constitutionally-voted out prime minister Imran Khan through President Arif Alvi should be made public.  \nHe wondered why the apex court was bent upon holding general elections in Punjab alone ignoring Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where the provincial assembly had also been dissolved along with Punjab\u2019s.\nHe claimed that there\u2019s a grouping in the Supreme Court as female members of judges\u2019 families were creating chaos in the country by influencing court proceedings and demanded that like politicians and bureaucrats, judges should also undergo accountability processes.  \nReplying to a question, he said Imran would not accept election results if he lost the Punjab polls. He regretted that Zulfikar Ali Bhutto\u2019s (judicial murder) was not being heard for the last 10 years.\nHe recalled that Saqib Nisar had backed out of student union elections to join the judiciary.\nHe told a questioner that the review committee formed by the PPP had changed candidates for six Punjab seats.\nDeputy information secretary Faisal Mir alleged that \u2018Project Imran\u2019 is an international conspiracy in which neighbouring India is also playing its role.\n"

            "Text": "DERA GHAZI KHAN: The annual gathering of the Seraiki Lok Saanjh has demanded a Seraiki province, an end to illegal allotment of Rakhookh (grazing lands) to non-locals, and fair counting of the Seraiki population in the ongoing digital census.\nThe Saanjh called for immediate constitutional steps to establish the Seraiki province, which they believe will be a significant step towards a strong federation.  \nThe participants and speakers emphasised that a separate province is the soul and most viable solution to the problems and deprivations of the Seraiki region.\nThey highlighted the consistent plundering of the region\u2019s economic, mineral and land resources by the elite. The unjust distribution of resources, squeezed parliamentary representation of Seraikis, and non-transparent census in the region were identified as major issues facing Seraikis.  \nFormer census official Khalil Bukhari contended that any population census that ignores the annual average increase and shows the Seraiki population as less than the 2017 figures of above 40 million would be fake and must be rejected.\nQuestioning the reduction of the census duration from 10 to six years on the demand of just two political parties, the Jamaat-i-Islami and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, Awami Jamhuri Party (Sindh) President Dr Laal Syed called the whole process dubious and marked by technical flaws. He criticised the induction of untrained primary school teachers as digital enumerators and erratic entries due to Internet service in many regions, among others.\nIn addition to these issues, high-handed administrative measures like illegal land allotment to non-natives, especially the recent handing over of 45,000 acres of Rakhook, were criticised.  \nSeraiki activist Fazal Lund termed corporate farming belligerent and colonising constructs. The gathering, organised at Jaisal Klasra, was attended by public, politicians, Seraiki student bodies, representatives of political parties and professionals from various classes. \nMNA Afzal Dhandla lamented the historical plight of Seraiki people and the practice of land grab that affects thousands of native residents. \nFederal Minister of State Mahar Irshad Sial contended that they categorically rejected any kind of secretariat and demands fully autonomous administrative unit for Siraikis. The PPP always supported the cause of province and it\u2019ll be done with the efforts of the PPP.\n"

            "Text": "LAHORE: As Eidul Fitr has come and gone, it is a time for reflection and gratitude. There were several workers who spent this special occasion away from their loved ones due to work obligations. The city of Lahore wore a deserted look after the exodus of people who rushed to their native towns. \nIt is a difficult situation to be in, being away from family and friends during a time where togetherness and celebration are at the forefront of everyone\u2019s minds. The sacrifices made by these workers should not go unnoticed, and we should all take a moment to appreciate the hard work and dedication they put in day in and day out.\nMuhammad Zahid, a 35-year-old factory worker in the Gulberg area, was one such individual who spent Eid away from his family. Zahid, who hails from a village in Muzaffargarh, has been living in Lahore for the past 10 years, working at a factory that produces soft drinks for local consumption. Zahid is a guard at the unit. \n\u201cI missed my family a lot during Eid,\u201d Zahid says. \n\u201cBut I had no choice but to work, as I need the money to support my wife and children back home.\u201d\nFor Zahid and many others like him, working during Eid is not just a matter of financial necessity \u2013 it is also a question of job security. During a necessity, a time when unemployment rates are high and job opportunities are scarce, workers are often forced to accept whatever employment they can find, even if it means working through the holidays.\nThis is a sentiment echoed by 28-year-old Safia Iqbal, who works at a private hospital in Shadman as a paramedic. Safia, who moved to Lahore from a small town in south Punjab, says that while she missed her family during Eid, she is grateful to have a job that provides her with a steady income.\n\u201cI know it\u2019s hard to be away from my family during Eid, but I have to work to support myself,\u201d Ms Iqbal says. \u201cI am lucky to have a job, and I don\u2019t want to risk losing it by taking time off during the holidays.\u201d\nFor those who do have the option of taking time off during Eid, the decision to do so is often fraught with difficulty. Many workers fear that taking time off during the holidays will be seen as a sign of disloyalty to their employers and could result in them losing their jobs.\nThis fear is not unfounded. In recent years, there have been reports of workers being fired for demanding rights, including paid time off during Eid, despite being legally entitled to do so under labour laws. In these circumstances, there\u2019s little to offer hope for workers who are forced to spend Eid away from their families.\nDr Muhammad Ramzan, Punjab University Social and Cultural Studies professor, says as we move forward, it is important to remember the importance of family, community, and compassion towards those around us. \n\u201cLet\u2019s continue to work towards a world where everyone can enjoy the holidays with their loved ones, and where the sacrifices made by workers are recognized and appreciated,\u201d he concluded.\n"

He added that the suspect was arrested within hours.  \nAccording to Akram\u2019s complaint, Munir, his son Rizwan and wife Shamim, wanted to occupy his house. He alleged that Munir along with his son and wife came to his house, hit him on the head with an iron rod, tied him to a tree with a chain and tortured him.\nHe alleged his brother unleashed a dog on him, which bit him badly.\n"

            "Text": "LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has ruled that the polygraph test is a useful investigative technique to unearth the truth, but subject to the knowledge and expertise of the examiner.\nIn a verdict that acquitted a murder convict, Justice Muhammad Amjad Rafiq has observed that in the past there was criticism over the polygraph test as being inconclusive and an intrusion into personal liberty and fundamental right suggesting that it should not be conducted without consent.\nHowever, he notes, there are some studies which show improvements in the accuracy of the results after advancement in technology.\nThe judge says objections can be raised about the qualifications and skills of the examiner, the physical conditions under which the test is conducted, the manner in which questions are framed and the possible use of \u2018countermeasures\u2019 by the test subject.\nHe admits that a significant criticism of polygraph test is that sometimes the physiological responses triggered by feelings such as anxiety and fear could be misread. But it can be a best investigative tool to take a lead for collection of direct evidence, the judge adds.\n\nJudge says studies show improvements in accuracy of results due to advancement in technology\n\nExpressing dissatisfaction with the skills of the examiner who conducted the test of the convict/appellant, Justice Rafiq observes: \u201cIt is apparent that the expert has not taken much pain to ascertain the facts in issue while formulating question.\u201d\nThe judge regrets that the questions posed by the examiner in no case helped to detect lies or provide any additional information so as to add valuable contribution for building an opinion for and against the truthfulness of the accused.\nThe judge observes: \u201cThe test must be explanatory not only to question relating to facts in issue or relevant facts but also for requiring some more information relating to crime.\u201d\nHighlighting the techniques for a perfect attempt to extract truth through a polygraph test, Justice Rafiq refers to a judgement passed by the Supreme Court of India titled, \u201cSelvi & Ors versus State of Karnataka & Anr on 5 May, 2010.\u201d\nThe techniques suggested in the Indian judgement are: the relevant-irrelevant (R-I) technique, the control question (CQ) technique and the Directed Lie-Control (DLC) technique.\nThe judge maintains that the prosecution can make good use of the polygraph test provided it is conducted by a knowledgeable expert with formulation of sound and relevant questions following the three techniques in order to cover all areas of information relating to crime.\nHe says an objection can be raised that through polygraph test, a truth is extracted technically and sometimes by asking misleading questions, or through promise or without warning etc.\nHowever, he adds, article 42 of the Qanun-i-Shahadat Order, 1984 (confession otherwise relevant not to become irrelevant because of promise of secrecy, etc), gives due legal cover to such arrangement.\nThe judge says, based on the available studies, the experts assess the accuracy of polygraph examinations administered by a competent examiner to be about 90 per cent as the level of skill and experience of the examiner plays an important part in the accuracy of the test results.\nAllowing the appeal of convict Muhammad Aslam, the judge holds that the prosecution miserably failed to establish the charge against the accused beyond any shadow of doubt.\nA trial court of Depalpur had awarded life imprisonment to the appellant on a murder charge.\nThe appellant was administered the polygraph test, but the examiner had not given any conclusive opinion as to his truthfulness due to, what he claimed, poor psychophysiological data.\n"

The National Institute of Health has established two teams to trace the patient\u2019s contacts among passengers, at the airport, hospital and other places where the patient had possibly transmitted the virus.\nSo far, 22 contacts have been traced and kept in isolation after collection of their samples for tests, according to officials.\n\nSindh asks hospitals to set up isolation wards\n\nJoint Health Secretary Mustafa Jamal Kazi told Dawn that a control room has also been established at the National Command and Operation Centre.\nHe said a virtual meeting was held on Tuesday attended by representatives of all the provinces and 31 departments and divisions including civil aviation and interior ministry.\nIt was decided that personal protective equipment would be provided at all airports and isolation wards would be established in hospitals of major cities, Mr Kazi told Dawn. Masks and gloves have been declared mandatory for all porters who come in direct contact with passengers at airports, he added.\nFederal health ministry\u2019s spokesperson, Sajid Shah, said the authorities are keeping an eye on inbound passengers.\nMeanwhile, the Sindh government has also put hospitals on high alert.\nThe Directorate General Health Services has asked health facilities to designate separate units with up to five to 10 rooms for patients with monkeypox after the case was reported from Karachi.\nThe hospital administrations have been asked to nominate a focal person and ensure the availability of proper infection control measures.\nVaccination of children\nSeveral global organisations and NGOs have joined hands to launch a new initiative to boost vaccination for preventable diseases among children.\nThe initiative was aimed at catching up on the lost progress as the rate of immunisation slowed down significantly during the coronavirus pandemic.\nAccording to a statement, WHO, Unicef, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Immunisation Agenda 2030 and many other global and national health partners have come together for a targeted global effort to boost vaccination among children following declines driven by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) says in a study that meat, eggs and milk offer crucial sources of much-needed nutrients which cannot easily be obtained from plant-based foods.\nThis is particularly vital during key life stages such as pregnancy and lactation, childhood, adolescence and older age, said the study, entitled \u201cContribution of terrestrial animal source food to healthy diets for improved nutrients and health outcomes\u201d, released by the FAO on Tuesday.\nMeat, eggs and milk provide a range of important macro-nutrients such as protein, fats and carbohydrates and micro-nutrients that are difficult to obtain from plant-based foods in the required quality and quantity, the report says. \nHigh-quality protein, a number of essential fatty-acids, iron, calcium, zinc, selenium, Vitamin B12, choline and bioactive compounds like carnitine, creatine, taurine are provided by foods from terrestrial animals and have important health and developmental functions.\nIron and Vitamin A are among the most common micronutrient deficiencies around the world, particularly in children and pregnant women. Globally, more than one in two preschool aged children (372 million) and 1.2 billion women of child-bearing age suffer from the lack of at least one of three micronutrients: iron, Vitamin A or zinc. Three quarters of these children live in South and East Asia, the Pacific and sub-Saharan Africa.\nNot surprisingly, according to the report, consumption of food from animals (including milk, eggs, meat) varies widely around the world. A person in Congo consumes on average only 160 grams of milk a year, while someone in Montenegro consumes 338 kilograms. \nMeanwhile, the evidence of any links between milk, eggs and poultry consumption in healthy adults and diseases such as coronary heart disease, strokes and hypertension is inconclusive (for milk) or non-significant (for eggs and poultry).\n"

The protest continued for around 40 hours before family members agreed to bury the bodies due to negotiations with authorities. \nAlso, street protests were also staged in several parts of the province to express solidarity with the people of Swat against militant attacks.\nIn January this year, people in several cities of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa took to the streets against a suicide attack in the Peshawar Police Lines, which left scores of police personnel dead and over 200 injured.\n"

She claimed that initially, the matrimonial relation was cordial but soon it became strained due to the harsh and insulting attitude of her husband towards her.\nShe added that after four months of her marriage, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and even then, she was tortured physically, mentally and psychologically.\nThe woman claimed that she was ousted from his house and had to return to her parents and that her father ensured her cancer treatment by spending more than Rs1.39 million.\nHowever, her ex-husband denied the claims.\nThe trial court accepted the woman\u2019s plea for the recovery of the dower amount, payment of past maintenance from June 2018 to the completion of her iddat period, and recovery of Rs500,000 on account of medical expenses.\nThe man filed an appeal against those orders before the district judge of North Waziristan, which partially accepted it and dissolved the marriage on the basis of khula and not cruelty.\nHowever, both the woman and her ex-husband appealed the verdict in the high court.\n"

For the purpose, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police had published an advertisement in national newspapers inviting applications from women to apply for the post of lady police constable through Educational Testing and Evaluation Agency (Etea). But no woman applied.\nAfter a gap of about six months, the sources said the provincial police department again advertised the post with the hope women would apply, but again no woman applied for the post.\nThe sources said after receiving cold response, the department re-advertised the post, relaxing the age limit, qualification, height, etc. to \u2018encourage women to apply for the post\u2019. But again no one applied for the post, which advertised lastly in December 2022.\nAccording to the sources, regressive local customs were the major bar on women\u2019s recruitment in police as these traditions didn\u2019t allow women to work in a male-dominant atmosphere.\nHowever, some sources in the police and local residents blamed \u2018the lack of proper accommodation facilities\u2019 for women\u2019s disinterest in the police department.\nGhulam Hazrat, a resident of Khar town, said one of his daughters applied for the constable post after passing her matriculation examination last year, but she was disappointed when she learnt that the local police had very \u2018poor\u2019 accommodation facilities for women officials.\nWhen contacted, a senior police officer confirmed that local women didn\u2019t take interest in jobs in police owing to unknown reasons.\nHowever, he said currently, there were 10 lady police constables serving in Bajaur police, who were from outside.\nDistrict police officer Nazeer Khan told Dawn on contact that he hoped women would show interest in jobs in the police department in future.\n"

            "Text": "PESHAWAR: Research scholars of veterinary sciences and animal husbandry have warned of threats posed by cryptosporidium, which is scientifically recognised as an opportunistic zoonotic parasite that infects both humans and animals and is considered a major cause of diarrhoea often resulting in death due to severe dehydration.\nIn a study conducted in three districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, including Bannu, Lakki Marwat and Kohat, the researchers found higher prevalence of cryptosporidium among children (30/180) 16.66 per cent as compared to adults (10/180) 5.55 per cent.\nThe study has been conducted by several scholars, including Naimatullah Khan, Mohammad Hassan Saleem, Aneela Zameer Durrani, Nisar Ahmad, Ayesha Hassan, Sultan Ayaz, Sajid Umar, Mohammad Luqman Sohail, Mohammad Shafee, Ikramullah Khan, Mumtaz Ali Khan, Azmatullah Khan, Naimatullah Malik and Abdul Razzaq.\nCryptosporidium infects a wide range of animals and humans, causing substantial economic losses and serious public health concerns, observed the researchers.\n \n \n\nExposure to animals, poor sanitation and hygienic conditions are the factors responsible for transmission of the parasitic diseases and these factors are highly prevalent in the study area, where poor sanitation, open toilets, shared water sources of animals and humans cause its spread among the human population, they added.\nThis is the first study addressing one of the main causes of neonatal mortality in southern KP.\nA total of 360 stool samples were collected from the District Headquarters Hospitals of the three districts and were screened through microscopy.\nResults yielded an overall prevalence of 11.11 per cent in all three districts. Prevalence was the highest in Bannu (11.66pc), followed by Lakki Marwat and Kohat with 10pc each.\nStatistical analysis revealed significant differences among children of different age groups with highest disease prevalence in children of less than five years of age (21.40pc) and lowest in children of 11-15 years of age (15.99pc).\nIndividuals visiting DHQ hospitals of the study area with abdominal anomalies i.e., acute diarrhoea (three loose stools within the last 24 hours prior to hospital visit) or persistent diarrhoea, vomiting (once in last 24 hours before hospital visit) and abdominal cramps were included in the study. All the participants had exposure to livestock and other animals.\nHigher prevalence was recorded in children having close contact with domestic animals (20pc) as compared to those having no contact with domestic animals (12.94pc), shows the study.\nThe age of children was found to be a significant risk factor for the occurrence of cryptosporidium, researchers warned.\nThis high incidence of the disease in children may be related to the lack of pre-existing immunity. Moreover, children were more exposed to water during playing, increasing the chance of getting infected and there was a more frequent attendance of diarrhoeic children than adults at DHQ hospitals. Cryptosporidium in early age in the study area can also be related to malnutrition, which has been described as a potential risk factor for diarrhoea due to cryptosporidium.\nThe researchers suggest prevention as the only way to protect people from getting infected by cryptosporidium as there is no vaccine currently available against cryptosporidium infection because of limited understanding of its specific biology and challenges encountered in vaccine development.\nHence, to design effective disease control and prevention strategies a comprehensive understanding of various risk factors contributing to the spread of disease is unavoidable, they suggested.\nThe study reiterated its warning about the zoonotic transmission of cryptosporidium, one of the four main causes of morbidity in preschool children.\nThe study warned that due to limited treatment options available and poor healthcare facilities in the study areas, situation could aggravate if remained unnoticed.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The city managers have decided to start development work in Sector C-16, which is located in the foothills of the Margallas along the newly-constructed Margalla Avenue, and also launched an anti-encroachment drive in the sector.\n\u201cThe revised layout plan of this sector was approved last week by the CDA board. After completing some formalities, we will invite tenders for development work in this sector,\u201d said Capital Development Authority (CDA) Chairman Noorul Amin Mengal.\nSpeaking to Dawn on Tuesday, the CDA chief said that there were some issues pertaining to planning and survey in the said sector, which have been settled by the civic body.\n\u201cWe have already published pre-qualification notice for the construction firms, so now there is no hurdle to start the development work,\u201d he said and added that the engineering wing had prepared a complete timeline for the development of C-16.\n\nCivic body removes \u2018illegal settlement\u2019 in anti-encroachment drive\n\nAccording to CDA officials, the sector has around 2500 residential plots, a \u2018markaz\u2019, and class-III shopping centres. Asked about CDA\u2019s lethargic attitude towards sector development, Mr Mengal said that he would ensure the timely completion of ongoing development work in various residential sectors, including C-16.\nAnti-encroachment operation\nMeanwhile, the enforcement wing of the CDA conducted an anti-encroachment operation in C-16 and removed an \u201cillegal Afghan settlement\u201d. \u201cEnforcement Wing and the Land Directorate conducted a full-scale operation to eliminate Afghan settlements and illegal constructions in Sector C-16 to keep Islamabad free from encroachments and illegal constructions,\u201d said a press release issued by CDA.\nIt is relevant to note here that Sector E-12 was launched in 1989, but the CDA failed to develop it despite the passage of decades. \nA few years ago, the civic agency started the development work, but subsequently, it was slowed down. Meanwhile, development work is in progress in sectors I-12, C-14 and C-15.\nOn the other hand, Sector I-15 is near completion: once completed this sector will be the first developed sector after D-12, which was developed over a decade ago. This sector has 10,289 plots of various sizes, mainly for low-income groups.\nThe CDA officials said that sectors C-13, C-14, C-15, and C-16, which are located along Margalla Avenue will have significant commercial potential for the civic agency. They said Sector C-13, which is the smallest sector of a few hundred kanal, should also be started at the earliest.\nIn addition to said sectors, there are several other sectors acquired by the CDA. However, the civic body has failed to get possession of the land in these areas. \nThe sector, F-13, D-13, E-13, C-14, H-16, and I-17, were acquired by the civic agency in 2007-8, but the CDA did not announce the award of built-up property (compensation related to constructed houses). This negligence resulted in an increase in houses on the land even though it had been acquired by the CDA.\n"

But after the 2018 general elections, the project was shelved by the former PTI government in the province.\nHowever, the process to restart work on the project has started again in the current fiscal year and the RDA has forwarded the project to the government for inclusion in the annual development programme. \nHe said this time RDA has decided to construct an underpass on the road from Saddar to Fiazabad and a link road for Liaquat Road towards Fawara Chowk.\nThe flyover at Liaquat Bagh was found not to be feasible as it required more funds to acquire land on both sides of Liaquat Baghsquare.\nWhen contacted, the RDA director general said the underpass will be constructed on Murree Road in front of Liaquat Bagh on Saddar to Fiazbad side and the road will be connected with Liaquat Road.\nHe said it was the demand of local residents to end traffic congestion on Liaquat Bagh Chowk, especially for travellers towards Raja Bazaar.\nHe said the RDA had made an initial plan and sent it to the Punjab government for final approval. It will reflect in the new annual development programme of Punjab government, he added.\n"

He said that Saiful Malook\u2019s gripping natural beauty with its crystal clean-water emanating from the lofty glaciers of Malaka Parbat on its northeast was amazing and beyond one\u2019s imagination.\n\nA large number of people visit hilly areas to enjoy Eid holidays\n\nHe said that he had visited many lakes in Pakistan and abroad but the fairytales of prince Saiful Malook and princes Badri Jamala associated with the Saiful Malook Lake were unique and impressive.\nThe Malook-Jamala fairytale leaves mesmerising effects on the minds of tourists and forces them to visit it again and again. Terming it his ideal tourist destination, he said that it was his third trip to Saiful Malook Lake and first with his family that doubled their joy of Eidul Fitr.\nProf Ehtisham said that families could easily visit it to spend some time in its relaxed environment before exploring the nearby Anso and Dudipatsar lakes in Upper Kaghan through jeeps and horse riding.\nMian Mohammad Bakhash, a noted historian and poet, in his book \u2018Fairytale of Saiful Malook\u2019 related the tale of prince Saiful Malook and fairy princes Badriul Jamala during his visit to the lake.\nProf Ehtisham\u2019s mother said that Saiful Malook was the identity of Pakistan. She urged visitors to ensure its cleanliness and put all waste in dustbins placed by the government in its vicinity.\n\u201cI am disappointed to see garbage and polythene bags thrown by visitors near Saiful Malook and Anso lakes despite presence of dustbins,\u201d she said. She said that it was the collective responsibility of Kaghan Development Authority (KDA), wildlife department and district administration to maintain its cleanliness and make it pollution-free.\nThe tear-shaped Anso Lake is considered the highest lake of Himalaya region with 4,126 meter height of the sea level, Payala Lake with 2,895 meters elevation, Pyala Lake with 3,410 meters height, Siri Lake with 2,590 meters altitude, Dudipatsar Lake with 3,800 meters elevation and Dudibach Star Lake in Kaghan valley, which captivate adventurers and sports enthusiasts.\nShe said that that in other countries vehicles were parked away from lakes to maintain their ecology and protect them from pollution. She stressed the need for construction of parking areas away from Saiful Malook, Mahodand and other national lakes to protect them from environmental and water pollution.\nMohammad Ali Syed, the general manager of KP Culture and Tourism Authority, said that Pakistan was home to many natural and manmade lakes and reservoirs including South Asia\u2019s largest Manchar Lake that spread over 260 square kilometres in Sindh besides the country\u2019s biggest Paristan Lake in Skardu and Shimshal Lake in Hunza, Gilgit-Baltistan with 4,272 meters height.\nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa is blessed with around 100 small and big natural and manmade lakes including the worlds 33rd highest natural lake of Karambar with 4,272 meters height of above sea level and 3.9 kilometres length that could be accessed through Broghil valley in Chitral.\nSwat is going to become the tourism capital of the country due to its seven unique features including the snow-clad mountain peaks, trout fish, river, snowfall, motorway, waterfalls and lakes.\nSwat\u2019s Mahodand Lake with 2,900 meters height has unique features including brown and rainbow trout and camping besides Spin Khwar and Kundal lakes that draw many tourists during Eid days.\nAli Syed said that small and medium lakes in Mahodand would be interconnected after construction of small arch bridges that would enhance their natural outlook. He said that Mahudhand Lake would be converted into a model eco-tourism resort with provision of enhanced facilities to visitors. \n"

So, it feels like home.\u201d\nChapman was dismissed only once in five innings and racked up 290 runs \u2014 a record tally for a five-match T20 series \u2014 and was named Player of the Series.\nThe middle-order batter smashed 104 off 57 balls on Monday to secure New Zealand\u2019s six-wicket win in the final match, a knock which head coach Gary Stead called \u201cspecial\u201d.\nNew Zealand are touring without regular skipper Kane Williamson, who is sidelined with a knee injury sustained in the Indian Premier League, while several others are busy honouring franchise commitments in that tournament.\nChapman played the last of his seven ODIs against Scotland in July last year.\nSustaining the prolific run against Pakistan\u2019s formidable attack would boost his selection chances for the one-day World Cup in India later this year but Chapman is not thinking that far ahead.\n\u201cTo be honest, I haven\u2019t really thought too much about that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a five-match one-day series ahead of us. That\u2019s our primary focus at the moment.\u201d\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite squaring the series 2-2 against a depleted New Zealand side, Pakistan captain Babar Azam was of the view that the hosts gained a lot from the four games.\nThe elegant right-handed batter said his team would take the learning into the upcoming one-dayers, the first two of which will be played on Thursday and Sunday in Rawalpindi before the series shifts to Karachi for the last three matches.\n\u201cThere were a lot of positives in this series and we will try to further build on them and improve where we are lacking,\u201d said Babar.\nThere will be a few changes in the Pakistan squad for the 50-over games and Babar said he was sure the incoming players had prepared themselves well.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have much time and in such a case it\u2019s important to stay switched on as a professional,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be back-to-back matches, three or four new boys are coming in.\n\u201cWe will try to work harder in practice sessions.\u201d\n"

Our troops effectively engaged the terrorists\u2019 location,\u201d the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.\nThe military has identified the martyred soldiers as Sepoy Waqas Ali Shah, 26, a resident of Charsadda district, and Sepoy Basit Ali, 24, a resident of Peshawar district.\nIt said weapons and ammunition were also recovered from the killed militants, adding that the security forces were combing the area for other militants.\n\u201cSecurity forces of Pakistan are determined to eliminate the menace of terrorism and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers further strengthen our resolve,\u201d it read.\nAccording to local sources, militants carried out the armed attack from across the border on an army camp set up in the Tor Darra locality of Kukikhel area, close to the Afghan border.\nThey said that the military camp was a large facility covering a vast area to keep a close check on the border since Tor Darra and the surrounding areas \u2014 with forests and mountains \u2014 were once inhabited by militants before border fencing and military offensives against the militants.\nCTD building clearance\nMeanwhile, armed forces\u2019 technical experts and urban search and rescue teams have cleared 70 per cent of the collapsed building of a counterterrorism facility in Swat\u2019s Kabal town. The facility was struck on Monday by twin blasts, which were linked to an electrical short circuit at a munitions warehouse, according to a preliminary police investigation.\nOfficials said the teams were working round the clock and were defusing the ammunition under the debris of the collapsed building, adding that the building\u2019s ground and first floors were cleared.\n\u201cThe clearance phase of the basement of the collapsed building is underway and this will continue till clearance of the entire area [the collapsed structure],\u201d a senior official privy to the developments told Dawn, adding that five vehicles were recovered from the debris.\nAt least 17 people \u2014 nine officers, three civilians and five recently detained militants who were being held there for investigation \u2014 were killed in the explosions and 70 people injured, mostly police officers.\nOn Tuesday, the KP police linked the incident to a short circuit, ruling out a militant attack, as initially suggested. The provincial caretaker government also formed a two-member fact-finding committee to investigate the incident.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: A day after Pakistan reported its first case of infectious viral disease mpox, the health ministry said on Wednesday that there was no evidence of localised transmission.\nThe patient who tested positive for the virus has been isolated at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims), along with other individuals who are being tested, a health ministry press release said.\nThe patient arrived in Pakistan from Saudi Arabia on April 17 with symptoms of the disease, prompting authorities to beef up measures at airports and set up isolation wards in hospitals.\n\u201cThe 41-year-old patient has been recovering,\u201d Pims spokesperson Dr Haider Abbasi told Dawn. He said that some more samples had been sent to the National Institute of Health (NIH) after contact tracing and the results were likely to be shared on Thursday (today).\n\nTraveller infected with viral disease said to be recovering\n\nMpox \u2014 which spreads via close contact and tends to cause flu-like symptoms and pus-filled skin lesions \u2014 was declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organisation in July 2022. The organisation maintained its alert in November.\nIn November, the WHO named the disease mpox to replace the older term monkeypox, citing concerns of stigma and racism associated with the name.\nDr Naseem Akhtar, an infectious diseases specialist, told Dawn that the patient came to her clinic at Pims. \u201cI suspected that he had monkeypox, so I shifted him to an isolation ward and sent nasal and damaged skin samples to NIH for the PCR test,\u201d she said.\n\u201cLater, with NIH support, as many as 22 contacts have been identified and have been advised to stay in isolation. They will be kept there till confirmation of disease,\u201d she said.\nMeanwhile, Joint Secretary Health Mustafa Jamal Kazi told Dawn on Wednesday that personal protective equipment (PPE) had been dispatched to all the airports across the country.\n\u201cPPEs include face masks, gowns, surgical gloves, bottles of disinfection material, hand sanitisers and shoe covers. Moreover, a control room has been established at the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) to deal with monkeypox across the country. Reports and data will be shared by the NCOC to ensure clarity in the information and avoid chances of doubling as it can create panic among the masses,\u201d he said.\nMr Kazi said that wearing masks and using gloves have been declared mandatory for all the porters, those who push wheelchairs and those who deal with the luggage or directly contact the passengers.\nMeanwhile, health ministry spokesman Sajid Shah said: \u201cOur health facilities have been upgraded and the number of beds for the isolated patients has been increased. So, masses don\u2019t need to get panic.\u201d\n\u201cAs there is no evidence of localised transmission of mpox as of now in Pakistan, the risk of international spread of disease from Pakistan remains low. The WHO does not recommend any restrictions on trade on the currently available information regarding mpox outbreaks,\u201d Mr Shah added.\nHe said that advisories had been issued to enhance the screening of inbound passengers at all international airports.\n"

We have never tried to keep Russian energy off the market,\u201d he added.\nLast week, Pakistan placed its first order for discounted Russian crude oil under a deal struck between Islamabad and Moscow, with one cargo to dock at the port of Karachi in May.\nUnder the deal, Pakistan will buy only crude, not refined fuels. Imports are expected to reach 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) if the first transaction goes through smoothly.\nPakistan\u2019s purchase gives Russia a new outlet, adding to Moscow\u2019s growing sales to India and China, as it redirects oil from western markets because of the restrictions.\nResponding to another question about Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) acquiring the weapons the United States left behind while withdrawing its troops from Afghanistan, Mr Patel assured Islamabad that \u201cany assets or weaponry that were left in Afghanistan were no longer usable\u201d.\n"

The figure for April was yet to be released by the Federal Board of Revenue.\nAs a result of this reckless export in large quantities, the average retail price of sugar surged to Rs130 per kg in April and it is expected it would rise further in coming months.\nThe highest retail price of Rs135 per kg was recorded in Karachi, according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics.\nIts average price in Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Faisalabad, Peshawar and Quetta stood at Rs130, while in Gujranwala, Multan, Bahawalpur, Sialkot, Larkana, Hyderabad it was Rs120. In Lahore sugar was selling at Rs125 and Rs116 in Sargodha and Sukkur.\nSugar is one of the food items which dragged the overall inflation to an unprecedented 35.4pc in March. This figure will go up further when the data for April would be released next week.\nThe cost of allowing export is much more for consumers as against the argument that it will generate foreign exchange for the country. The value of sugar exports stood at $83.052 million against no exports last year.\nIn rupee terms, the export value of sugar stood at Rs22.987 billion in two months for the mill owners, especially from political families in the PDM government.\nAccording to a commerce ministry report, the net sugar consumption stood at over 5 million tonnes. A Re1 increase per kg means over Rs5bn net transfer of resources from consumers.\nAt the same time, sugar imports plunged by 98.39pc to 5,010 tonnes during the first nine months of this fiscal year against 311,345 tonnes in the same period last year.\n"

terming them an \u201cencroachment\u201d on parliament\u2019s domain.\nThrough the five-page letter, released to the media by Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, the speaker asked the apex court to \u201cas far as possible, avoid getting involved in the political thicket\u201d, saying that \u201cit is best to leave the resolution of political matters by the parliament and the political parties\u201d.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Ashraf urged the CJP and Supreme Court judges \u201cto exercise restraint and respect the legislative domain of the parliament\u201d.\nThe speaker wrote that the National Assembly \u201cstrongly feels that these recent decisions amount to encroachment upon two core constitutional functions of the Assembly \u2014 lawmaking and power of the purse\u201d.\nHe drew the CJP\u2019s attention to various articles of the Constitution that vest powers related to a money bill exclusively in the National Assembly and confer power and authority to approve expenditure from the Federal Consolidated Fund (FCF) on the elected members.\n\u201cI write to convey the profound concern and deep unease of the NA with the orders passed by a 3-member SC bench on April 14 and 19 directing the State Bank of Pakistan and Finance Division to allocate/release Rs21 billion to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP)\u201d as \u201cthese orders have been passed notwithstanding that such release has expressly been forbidden by the NA\u201d, he said.\n\u201cIt is sadly noted that the 3-member bench\u2019s orders have completely disregarded the constitutional process and the prerogative of the Assembly with respect to financial matters,\u201d Mr Ashraf said, adding that the Supreme Court has ignored the National Assembly resolution and the rejection of the bill seeking allocations for the election funds and the recommendation of the National Assembly finance committee in this regard.\nThe courts had the power to interpret the Constitution, but it did not include rewriting the Constitution or undermining the parliament\u2019s sovereignty, the speaker said, apparently referring to the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of Article 63-A at the time of the election of Punjab chief minister last year.\nReferring to some of the reported remarks of the judges, the speaker said the rejection of the funds did not constitute a loss of confidence of the National Assembly in the federal government or the prime minister.\n\u201cI am also to convey to you the sense of the House that an unnecessary confrontation, deeply damaging to the national interest, is being created by the repeated orders to release funds to the ECP,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThe NA will approve the expenditure for the general elections to all the assemblies in the annual budget for the next financial year.\nNA session\nEarlier in the session, lawmakers from the ruling coalition termed the recent orders of the Supreme Court \u201can insult to parliament\u201d.\nAs the lower house met after a week-long Eid recess, treasury members continued their tirade against judges and PPP Chairman and Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari went to the extent of suggesting initiation of \u201ccontempt of parliament proceedings\u201d against them.\n \n         View this post on Instagram            \n\nThe coalition partners, who had come to the house after attending a meeting presided over by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, took the floor one by one and, after hitting out at the judiciary, extended their complete support to PM Shehbaz and asked him to stay \u201cfirm\u201d on the issue of \u201csupremacy of the parliament.\u201d\nThe lawmakers, including federal ministers, alleged that the SC\u2019s decision of \u201cre-writing\u201d the Constitution while interpreting Article 63-A was the root cause of the present crisis.\nThe members also questioned the logic behind the insistence on the polls within 90 days only in Punjab and not in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, stating that this showed that it was a \u201cpolitical battle\u201d to gain control on the country\u2019s largest province.\nApparently, under a planned strategy, the speaker first allowed Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar to move a motion seeking to suspend Question Hour and then opened the floor to members to deliver speeches without taking up other agenda items, which included two calling-attention notices regarding \u201cincrease in the rent of gas meter from Rs40 to Rs517\u201d and \u201crising inflation\u201d.\nOpening the debate, the law minister gave an overview of the present situation and told the house that the federal cabinet had, in its meeting earlier in the day, reviewed the April 19 SC order and decided to refer the issue of the polls in Punjab once again to the parliament ahead of the taking up of the case by the SC on Thursday (today).\nTaking the floor in the prime minister\u2019s presence, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar ridiculed the SC move to directly order the SBP to release Rs21bn, stating that the SBP had no authority to disburse any amount. He said they would have to spend an additional Rs14.4bn if the elections were not held simultaneously in the country.\n \n         View this post on Instagram            \n\nMr Bhutto Zardari said the PPP was ready to send a team under Raza Rabbani to the judges to remove their confusion, if any, about the Constitution.\nThe foreign minister said he was \u201cshocked and horrified\u201d to learn that an institution was asking the government to ignore the parliament and accept a minority decision.\n\u201cMr Speaker, only a letter will not be sufficient. If the judiciary is ridiculing and undermining this House [National Assembly], if it is insinuating that we take an unconstitutional step \u2026\u2026 and if you go through the latest SC order, then in the eyes of the PPP, it is a contempt of the parliament. It is a breach of privilege,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cHow can an institution take it upon itself to order us to abrogate the Constitution and not listen to the Parliament?\u201d\nPTI MNAs restrained\nBefore the NA sitting began, PTI MNAs from Karachi reached Parliament House to participate in the assembly proceedings, but they were stopped by police at the entrance.\nThe MNAs, who had resigned from the assembly last year, had been trying to attend the NA sittings for the past many days after the Sindh High Court suspended the ECP notification to de-seat them. In a statement on Wednesday, the NA Secretariat said since the SHC order did not touch the speaker\u2019s decision, the MNAs could not attend the session as he had already accepted their resignations.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn their attempts to enter Parliament House, some of the MNAs also scuffled with policemen, but left the premises after staging a brief sit-in.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: After political parties failed to initiate a dialogue to decide on a date for polls, as directed by the Supreme Court, a three-member bench headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial will resume hearing the election delay suo motu at 11:30am today (Thursday).\nAt the last hearing, the court had asked political parties to hold talks on April 26 and come up with a response by April 27 after giving stakeholders a chance to reach an agreement. Political parties had been asked to decide the matter quickly, since the May 14 date for elections was still in the field and the order was binding on all authorities.\n \n \n\nSince no talks were held and the government also refused to comply with the April 4 directive, political players as well as the nation are on tenterhooks, waiting for the court to make its next move.\nOn Wednesday morning, speculation was rife after the top court revised the roster for Bench-I for the day due to the unavailability of the CJP, who was slated to head a three-member bench comprising Justice Athar Minallah and Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhel to take up ordinary cases. However, due to the indisposition of the CJP, the bench was delisted.\n\nPTI\u2019s plea seeks treason proceedings against PM and cabinet; urges court to supervise affairs of Punjab, KP in place of caretakers\n\nConsequently, a number of lawyers kept guessing whether the elections delay case scheduled for Thursday would be taken up or not, as the CJP was indisposed. The rumours gained mome\u00adn\u00adtum after it emerged that Bench-II, consisting of senior judges Justice Qazi Faez Isa and Justice Sardar Tariq Masood, was also not available.\nIt may be noted that alongside CJP Bandial, Justice Isa and Justice Masood are the senior-most judges of the apex court and also the members of the committee which, under the Supreme Court (Practice & Procedure) Bill 2023, would take stock of matters regarding the constitution of benches and suo motu cases.\nThough the government notified the act recently, the Supreme Court suspended the enforcement of the law through an order of April 13 even before it was enacted.\nThe rumours were finally put to rest, however, after an announcement in the afternoon clarified that the CJP-led bench would only take up the case pertaining to the delay in polls and work in chambers for the rest of the day.\nMeanwhile, other benches will take up routine matters. Bench-II will be consisting of Justice Ijazul Ahsan, Justice Aminuddin Khan, and Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhel; Bench-III will comprise Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Ayesha A Malik, and Justice Shahid Waheed; and Bench-IV will consist of Justice Munib Akhtar, Justice Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi, and Justice Athar Minallah.\nSimilarly, two special benches will also sit in the principal seat of Islamabad consisting of Justice Ijazul Ahsan, Justice Aminuddin Khan, and Justice Mandokhel, while the other bench will be consisting of Justice Akhtar, Justice Naqvi, and Justice Minallah. Meanwhile, a two-judge bench consisting of Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar and Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi will sit in the Karachi Registry.\nPlea to restrain caretakers\nSeparately, two pleas were submitted to the apex court on Wednesday; one by the PTI seeking restraining orders against caretaker governments in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, while another sought appointment of a caretaker prime minister and the chief election commissioner for transparent polls.\nThe PTI\u2019s petition, filed by Tariq A Rahim and Imtiaz Rashid Siddiqui, asked the court to stop Punjab Caretaker Chief Minister Mohsin Naqvi and KP Caretaker CM Azam Khan from exercising their power. It said that appropriate orders be issued to regulate day to day operations of the two provinces under the supervision of the apex court.\nThe petition argued that since the Constitution did not entitle any extension in the tenure of the caretaker government, the Supreme Court under Article 184(3) was bound to act in a manner which would ensure compliance with the Constitution.\nThe plea also sought proceedings against Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the federal cabinet under Article 5 (loyalty to the State) and Article 6 (high treason) for refusing to allocate funds to the ECP.\nAnother petition filed by Zahoor Mehdi Faisal sought the removal of Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja, PM Shehbaz Sharif, PDM leader Maulana Fazlur Rehman, and President Dr Arif Alvi, calling them \u201cpartisans\u201d.\nTherefore, the apex court, the petition pleaded, by exercising its authority should appoint a caretaker prime minister as well as CEC to hold free and fair by-elections within ten days on the proposed date without the assistance of the Rangers and the armed forces.\nIt pleaded that the present case was fit to be heard by a full court, adding the demand of the ECP for Rs21 billion and the assistance of the military for the election duty was \u201cintended to damage the state\u201d.\n"

SSP Jacobabad Dr Sumair Noor Channa along with a large contingent of police also reached there to support the Balochistan police.\n\nBalochistan police team was trying to recover son of mill owner from Sindh-based gang\n\nBalochistan police then launched the operation to rescue the hostage. They were near Chand Shakh in the Jageer area when members of the Mitho Shah Gang holed up on the embankment of the water channel opened fire.\nIn the ensuing exchange, Sub-Insp\u00adector Tayyab Hussain Umr\u00adani, SHO of Usta Mohammad police station, and policemen Abdul Wahab, Mohammad Usman, Riaz Hussain, Syed Khadim Hussain Shah and Nisar Ahmed were martyred, while Husain Ali and Altaf Hussain were injured.\n\u201cHeavy exchange of fire continued for hours,\u201d DIG Nasirabad Munir Ahmed Sheikh told Dawn.\nThe bodies and the injured were rushed to the Jacobabad civil hospital from where Cons\u00adtable Hassan Ali was referred to another hospital owing to his precarious condition.\nThe bodies were handed over to their heirs after post-mortem examinations, police said.\nOfficials said Constable Kha\u00add\u00adim Hussain Shah was indu\u00adcted into the force after his father Insp\u00adector Syed Jalaluddin was martyred in an anti-terrorist operation in Sibi.\nDIG Munir said, \u201cWe have sent more police and ATF personnel to the area while Sindh Police has also joined the Balochistan police and is taking part in the operation against the armed dacoits.\u201d\nHe said the Mitho Shah and Jakhrani gangs are involved in the kidnapping of Furqan Soomro.\n\u201cThe operation is underway and will continue till the recovery of the hostage and arrest of the gang involved,\u201d DIG Munir said, adding the Sindh police had already announced a bounty of Rs3 million on their head.\nSSP Channa vowed to bring the gang to justice soon.\nResidents of Mouladad said the Mitho Shah Gang has become a symbol of terror in the area. The bike-riding gangsters often attack police officials, rob and terrorise citizens and passengers of their valuables and break into houses, they added.\nSometime back, they recalled, the gang deprived the staff of water supply department of their money and valuables and shot fires at the transformer of the pump station suspending water supply to Jacobabad for days.\nFuneral prayers for SHO Umrani and Constable Abdul Wahab were held while bodies of other personnel were sent to their native villages.\nBalochistan Chief Minister Mir Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo expressed grief and commended the martyred for \u201cfacing the enemy with bravery\u201d, and prayed for their families to have patience.\nMr Bizenjo expressed the hope that the Sindh government would soon bring to justice those responsible for the incident.\nSaleem Shahid in Quetta also contributed to this report\n"

Today we have taken a firm stance that it was the decision of four-three judges but the apex court wanted to take forw\u00adard the decision of [the] three-member ben\u00adch,\u201d the premier said.\nHe said the challenges faced by the government in the last few months were taken to parliament for their resolution. \u201cThe National Assembly and the joint house dealt with these challenges \u2014 regarding the matters of the SC \u2014 through constitutional and legal measures,\u201d he added.\nThe PM recalled that parliament had \u201crejected the decision of the three-member bench and asserted that the federal government\u2019s stance had not changed even today\u201d.\nOn April 4, a three-member bench of the apex court quashed the Elec\u00adtion Commission of Pakis\u00adtan\u2019s (ECP) decision to delay the elections in the province from April 30 to October 8, ruling that the move was \u201cunconstitutional, without lawful auth\u00ado\u00adrity or jurisdiction, void ab-initio, [and] of no legal effect\u201d.\nTalks with PTI\nMr Sharif said it was important to inform the public that the PTI, instead of helping the government solve the current challenges, had exploited the situation and allegedly attempted to sabotage the deal with the IMF. He claimed the PTI had made all-out efforts to spread anarchy in the country and polarize the society. \u201cEven the Pakistan Army and its leadership were not spared. Some PTI agents outside Pakistan, who are enemies of the country, played a role that even an enemy won\u2019t play\u2026 they issued such statements and tweets that are unimaginable,\u201d the premier claimed.\nBut the government wanted to talk to the PTI, he said, adding that there was an overwhelming opinion that the doors of dialogue should not be closed, but its format was yet to be decided. \u201cThe decision [regarding talks] has to be taken by parliament, not you or me,\u201d he added.\n\u201cThere is also an opinion that we can convey our stance to them [the opposition] via the National Assembly speaker and then a parliamentary committee can take up the matter so that the nation can know that this allied government has made all-out efforts to ensure that everyone agrees on one-day polls,\u201d he said.\nDuring the meeting, the huddle reiterated that elections in all provincial and the National Assembly will be held on the same date which would be decided by parliament.\nThe ruling parties also authorised the speaker of the National Assembly, Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, to form a parliamentary committee and consult all stakeholders to decide when elections to the provincial assemblies of Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa should take place. The ruling coalition, while rejecting the apex court\u2019s decision, said that the Supreme Court should not act as a panchayat (arbitrator).\n"

She advised the provinces to ensure that storm drains were not clogged, besides the stability of electricity poles and road access in the event of flooding.\nA statement issued by the ministry for climate change quoted her as expressing the fears that the country may fall into a recovery trap if it does not have sufficient resources to deal with the devastation caused by the 2022 floods. \u201cMy fear is that Pakistan will be in the resilience and rebuilding trap if there are not enough resources to plough into the devastation wrought by the 2022 flooding.\n\u201cWhile there is no clarity on what level of monsoon to expect next, the rebuilding projects will certainly be impacted as well as the economic recovery, if even a fraction of the devastation repeats itself.\u201d\nChoppy seas and showers\nThe minister specifically advised the fishing community to be cautious, particularly off the coast of Ormara, Pasni, and Gwadar, due to the possibility of choppy seas and extreme weather conditions. It was important for them to take necessary precautions and stay informed about weather updates during this period, she added.\nAccording to Met Office, the regions that are likely to be affected by rain, wind, and thunderstorms for next three days include Islamabad, parts of Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jam\u00admu and Kashmir; Peshawar, Mar\u00addan, Charsadda, Nowshera, Swabi, Bajaur, Kurram, Waziristan and Kohat in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa; Mur\u00adr\u00adee, Galliyat, Rawalpindi, Attock, Chakwal, Jhelum, Gujran\u00adwala, Sialkot and Lahore in Punjab.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, parts of Balochistan, Sindh and south Punjab are likely to experience rain, dust, and thunderstorms, with isolated heavy falls and hailstorms, from April 27 evening till May 3.\nUnder the influence of this weather system, scattered dust-thunderstorm along with moderate to heavy rain is expected in parts of Sindh, including Dadu, Jamshoro, Kam\u00adbar, Shahdadkot, Larkana, Jaco\u00adb\u00ad\u00adabad, Shikarpur, Kashmore, Sukk\u00adur, Ghotki, Khairpur, Naus\u00adhahro Feroze, Shaheed Benazirabad, Sanghar, Matiari, Tando Mohammad Khan, Tando Allahyar, Hyderabad, Mirpurkhas, Umerkot, Tharparkar, Badin, Thatta, Sujawal and Karachi, from April 28 to May 1.\nAlso from April 30 to May 5, rain with wind and thunderstorms is expected to lash Islamabad as well as several areas of Punjab, KP, GB and AJK, namely Lahore, Faisalabad, Toba Tek Singh, Jhang, Kasur, Sheikhupura, Nankana Sahib, Sialkot, Narowal, Gujranwala, Gujrat, Hafizabad, Mandi Bahauddin, Sargodha, Mianwali, Khushab, Jhelum, Chakwal, Attock, Rawalpindi, Galliyat, Murree, Abbottabad, Kohistan, Shangla, Haripur, Mansehra, Mardan, Swabi, Nowshera, Charsadda, Peshawar, Bajaur, Kurram, Waziristan, Kohat, Karak, Bannu, Dera Ismail Khan, Chitral, Dir, Swat and Buner.\nPDMA preparation\nIn Sindh, the provincial disaster management authority (PDMA) claimed to have set up a centre for coordination among the district administrations and to monitor operations in case of emergency in any area. An official cited a letter sent to all deputy commissioners in Sindh and representatives of organisations at the district level, asking them to stay in touch with the Met Office and ensure the availability of stocks of emergency relief, medicines and related supplies at all government hospitals.\nAccording to him, a helpline number is being set up, which will become operational by Thursday evening, so that the general public reach the district administration and our staff in case of any emergency or any assistance they need. All ambulance services have already been taken on board with the district administration and PDMA, while power utilities had been directed to ensure uninterrupted supply to hospitals and healthcare units across the Sindh province, assigning a liaison officer to coordinate with all organisations. \u201cWe are coordinating with the local government organisations such as KWSB and different development authorities if they need any assistance. We have also identified a few areas in Karachi where they need to focus more and deploy more manpower and machinery for drainage [in case of flooding],\u201d the official said.\nIn Lahore, PDMA DG Imran Qureshi said that commissioners and deputy commissioners had been instructed to stay alert and keep machinery and personnel ready to tackle any emergency, amid the warning of flash floods in local streams and nullahs of the mountainous areas of D.G.

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court (SC) has remanded a case back to the Peshawar High Court (PHC) with a direction to reconsider its earlier condition to a petition of surrendering crypto currency code \u2013 a password to access digital currency account \u2013for securing its integrity. \nIn a judgement authored by Justice Athar Minallah, the SC also directed the high court to seek assistance of an expert while deciding the matter to set out reasonable conditions to prevent petitioner Mohammad Taimur from having access to the currency. \nJustice Minallah was a member of a three-judge Supreme Court bench consisting of Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial and Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhel that had taken up an appeal by Mohammad Taimur against the Jan 11, 2023 PHC order. \nThe case at hand concerns an inquiry initiated by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) regarding alleged involvement of an unregistered entity, Messers Pslashuk \u2013 a company operating and managing an online business in the nature of a Ponzi scheme that attracts the offence of cheating the public at large. \nConsequently, the petitioner was arrested on June 2, 2021 during the inquiry proceedings who initially sought bail on merits, which was declined by PHC on Oct 5, 2021. But after some time, the petitioner filed a petition before the judge of an accountability court, seeking bail on the grounds of delay in the conclusion of the trial, which was refused, and consequently the petition was dismissed. \nThe high court later allowed bail, subject to furnishing bail bonds with two sureties but PHC made the release of the petitioner conditional requiring him to surrender his passport and crypto-currency code to NAB\u2019s Investigating Officer (IO). His name was also ordered to be placed on the exit control list. \nIn its order, Justice Minallah observed that while granting bail the high court made certain conditions like surrendering the crypto-currency code. It was the case of the petitioner that he had no nexus with the alleged crypto-currency and, therefore, the condition was harsh and excessive and thus amounts to denying him the concession of bail granted by PHC. \nHowever, the prosecution wants to ensure that the evidence in the form of crypto currency was not tampered with. The factum whether the petitioner has the ability to access the crypto-currency could not have been decided at the bail stage because it would require deeper appreciation of evidence, which is yet to be recorded during the trial, the judgment said adding the condition, therefore, appears to be excessive and unreasonable because it denies the petitioner the right to liberty. \nMoreover, there are more than 1,500 witnesses on the list of the prosecution who would be entering the witness box. Therefore, the early conclusion of the trial seems not foreseeable, the judgement added. \nOn the other hand, the concern of the prosecution is regarding the likelihood of the petitioner\u2019s access to crypto currency, the judgement said. The mobile phone and the SIM card were seized and they were in NAB\u2019s custody, the judgement stated, adding the IO had already admitted that if the SIM could be blocked, it would serve the purpose since in such an event, access of the petitioner to the crypto currency would be denied. \n"

After he went missing, his father Mohammad Waliullah filed a petition seeking the recovery of his son. The petition cited the defence secretary, PNS Zafar commanding officer, and the Margalla police SHO as respondents.\nAs per the petition, Lieutenant Habibullah was inducted into the Pakistan Navy and after the successful completion of his training, he was transferred to PNS Zafar on Sept 11, 2019.\nOn Sept 14, 2022, the naval intelligence arrested him and he was released after one day. He was again picked up on October 26, 2022, a nd released after two days of detention, the petition said, adding that on April 12, 2023, the officer went to his office in PNS Zafar as per routine.\n\nLt Habibullah who remained missing for several days submits affidavit to IHC\n\nAt about 2pm, he sent a message to his father that he was being called by his commanding officer, the petition said, adding that after a few hours when the officer did not return his father tried to contact him but to no avail. IHC Justice Arbab Mohammad Tahir heard the petition on April 15 and issued notices to the above-mentioned respondents for the recovery of the officer.\n\u2018Forced to resign\u2019\nHowever, the naval officer was released a few days before Eid. Lt Habibullah submitted an affidavit, a copy of which is available with Dawn, to the IHC saying that he was forced to resign from the service.\nHe claimed that during the detention he was \u201cmanhandled and subjected to mental torture\u201d. \u201cI was illegally abducted and taken to a cell where I was forced to sign the voluntary retirement papers which I [initially] declined to sign. On my refusal to sign, they tortured, insulted, and abused me,\u201d the officer claimed. \u201cI was kept awake and standing whole nights. I was not allowed to sleep and my hands were tied up [the] whole nights, due to which my muscles were pulled up.\u201d\nThe officials of the intelligence compelled me to sign and categorically said that there was no solution other than to sign voluntary retirement papers, he added. The affidavit went on to state: \u201cOn my further refusal, I was taken to another torture room where chains, hammer, screw, ropes were hanging front of me. They used to put a cloth over my mouth in order to suffocate me. They even tried to undress me and they beat me on my back and legs with a stick and threatened to unleash mice and dogs in my cell.\u201d\n\u201cEventually, on April 14, 2023, at 1730 they got forcefully my sign on [the] application. They just told me we have orders from higher authorities to get your signature on resignation from service\u2026after that, my commanding officer came to receive me. He stated that on April 17 he has been released and on April 18, he was further given a letter that his resignation has been approved.\nThe officer claimed that \u201cit is important to mention that all this happened to me without any inquiry, charge sheet or other legal proceedings under the service laws.\u201d\nThe court will take up this matter again next month.\n"

However, after QAU land, from Shahdhra Road to Jugi Stop, the CDA had its own land on both sides of the road, where proper planning is required.\nThe CDA, besides other facilities, could also develop parks and sports centres on both sides of the road.\nWhen contacted, CDA Chairman Noorul Amin Mengal said he had already decided to plan two service areas on the pattern of motorways, on both sides of the bypass road.\n\u201cThe service areas will have petrol pumps, tuck shops, etc.,\u201d he said and added that soon, the CDA will call tender in this regard.\nThe CDA officials said that in coming days, the work on flyover portions will be expedited. \nThey said that all 27 transoms have been poured while all 144 girders had already been prepared and in coming days, their launching work will be started, adding that 12 girders had already been launched.\nThe 5.6 km-long road (including a 1km flyover) was started on October 1 and as per its PC-I was supposed to be completed within four months. \nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had directed the CDA to make all-out efforts to get the project completed within three months instead of the four months mentioned in PC-I. \nSubsequently, the NLC made efforts and work on the project continued round the clock, but it could not be completed within the stipulated time period.\n"

He was of the view that the party leadership did not give tickets on merit and voices of corruption have also been echoed. \n\u201cImran Khan himself has heard the voices raised from the districts against wrong distribution of tickets,\u201d he added. He said the party will suffer if the right decision is not taken regarding the tickets.\nOn the protest of aspirant candidates and workers, the party has started a series of reviews and he pinned hope that the tickets would be awarded on merit to genuine candidates after the review. \nThe PTI has finalised a list of 297 candidates earlier this week for the elections.\nHe said that the top court has provided an opportunity to all the political parties to move towards a solution to the current crisis but the PDM government is using delaying tactics.\nMr Aslam lambasted Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), saying that they wanted a verdict from the Supreme Court on gunpoint but PTI was serious in their approach to talks within the jurisdiction of the constitution.\n\u201cIf the government refuses to accept the decision of the Supreme Court, then why will the common people accept it,\u201d he questioned.

GB Chief Secretary has also been invited.\nThe agenda of the meeting is to explore ways to promote tourism to GB through more travel opportunities by air. Chief secretary said this will bear fruit and result in enhancement of tourism and in effect improvement of economy of the region, he said.\nEarlier, GB Chief Secretary Mohyuddin Ahmed Wani through a letter, sent to Chief Executive Officer of PIA requested to increase number of flights to Gilgit and Skardu. \nThe letter said there is a massive influx of tourists during this time, and the current flight schedule to both cities in Gilgit-Baltistan is very limited.\n\u201cTherefore, we urge you to increase the number of PIA flights to Gilgit and Skardu during the summer season.\u201d\nIt noted that as you may know, there are very few revenue generation activities in Gilgit-Baltistan, and tourism is the backbone of the local economy.\n\u201cAn increase in the number of flights to Gilgit would not only benefit foreign and domestic tourists but also facilitate the local population.\n\u201cIn addition to this, we would like to highlight the potential economic benefits that an increase in flights could bring to the region. The rise in tourism would create more jobs, boost the local economy, and generate more revenue for the government.\n\u201cWe hope that you will consider the matter and take necessary steps to increase the number of PIA flights to Gilgit and Skardu, the letter said. On April 18, Gilgit-Baltistan Assembly through a unanimous resolution has demanded decrease in PIA fares on the Gilgit-Baltistan and Islamabad route to promote tourism.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: A housing project launched by the Capital Development Authority (CDA) for overseas Pakistanis has received an overwhelming response, as at least 6,000 applications have been submitted by the expatriates against 2,000 apartments built as part of the Nilore Heights housing project.\nThe housing initiative was launched by the civic body on the instructions of the federal government to cater to expatriates in a bid to boost the foreign exchange reserves. A two-bed apartment is being sold by the CDA at a price of $30,000.\nFinance Minister Ishaq Dar chaired a meeting regarding the civic body\u2019s projects for overseas Pakistanis at the Finance Division on Wednesday and got a detailed briefing on the said housing projects in addition to some other upcoming projects as well. The meeting was apprised that the CDA initiated a number of short-term and medium-term housing projects for overseas Pakistanis.\n\u201cIt was informed that one of these housing projects, namely Nilore Heights-I, is in the completion phase and over 6000 applications have been received from 81 countries for 2000 flats,\u201d said a press release issued by the Ministry of Finance.\n\nDar directs CDA to hold balloting for Nilore Heights-I by May 8\n\nThe statement said that the finance minister emphasised the importance of overseas Pakistanis in the economic and financial development of the country and directed the CDA authorities to fast-track the development projects for overseas Pakistanis. He also directed the CDA to hold the balloting for the Nilore Heights-I project before May 8 instead of May 16.\nThe meeting was briefed on the provision of commercial and residential plots for overseas Pakistanis on an open auction basis.\nIt was informed that in the next phase registration for plots in C-14 and C-16 sectors for overseas Pakistanis will commence and in this regard special facilitation desks have been established in the CDA to facilitate the overseas Pakistanis.\nCDA officials said that the civic agency would likely offer 100 plots of one kanal in C-14 and about 700 plots in C-16 exclusively for overseas Pakistanis. A final decision in this regard would be made in the next few days.\nThey said that both sectors are located in the foothills of the Margallas. According to the officials, the development work in Sector C-14 is already in progress while the CDA\u2019s engineering wing is expected to call tenders for development work in C-16 by the next month.\nRecently, the CDA published notice of pre-qualification of construction firms for the development of this sector. The finance minister directed for the auction of commercial plots and said that incentives should be extended to those investors who make the payment in US dollars as this would boost the exchange reserves.\nThe statement further said that CDA authorities were asked to maintain a transparent system for investors during the sale and purchase of property by ensuring maximum interaction using the digital platform developed for this purpose.\nHe called for the expedition of work on Kuri and Overseas Enclave projects and to finalise the scheme for the auction of C-14 and C-16 plots to expatriates by mid-May.\n"

They are also focusing those buildings where not \u2018all\u2019 the people living in the building were enumerated by the district teams,\u201d they said.\n\u201cThe teams comprising PBS officials from Karachi and Islamabad were deputed in the city in last week of Ramazan due to reports that people living in several high-rise buildings which housed hundreds of thousands of individuals were not enumerated,\u201d said an official, adding: \u201cThe complaints were made by different political parties as well. So it has been decided to constitute PBS teams and attach them with the field enumerators.\u201d\nHowever, the officials denied the \u2018impression\u2019 that the enumerators had missed all 32,000 high-rise buildings, claiming that there had been \u2018several\u2019 facilities identified as \u2018completely uncounted\u2019 or \u2018counted incompletely\u2019.\n\u201cWhen re-evaluated by PBS teams, it has emerged that in several cases the enumerators didn\u2019t bother to visit these buildings at all to count the people living there and just marked them as \u2018enumerated\u2019,\u201d said the official.\n\u201cIn some cases, they faced different challenges and to avoid them they relied on \u2018conjectures\u2019 and \u2018heresy\u2019, which also affected the accuracy of the data and total count of the population,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cDuring last few days of Ramazan, the PBS teams conducted a combing operation in several such buildings. The teams are likely to stay until the job is completed.\u201d\nGrowing criticism \nThe PBS move came amid growing criticism on the process of digital census mainly in Karachi and widespread reservations about the process by almost all political parties in Sindh.\nHowever, the parties campaigning for presenting a \u2018true\u2019 population count of Karachi in the census still sound cautious about the effectiveness of the process and are not sure about the final outcome of the city population numbers.\n\u201cThe population of Karachi is not less than 35 million,\u201d said Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan convener Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqi. \u201cIt\u2019s a documented fact supported by different standards and reports. It was the MQM-P which pushed the authorities to go for another census after serious flaws in the 2017 count. So if the numbers of urban areas are manipulated again in the final count, it will be unacceptable for Karachiites.\u201d\nHafiz Naeem ur Rehman, Karachi chief of the Jamaat-i-Islami, demanding for count of each and every person living in Karachi, has already announced a \u201cpower show\u201d against the \u201cflawed census\u201d on April 30 on Sharea Faisal. He reiterated his party\u2019s demand for formation of a committee comprising stakeholders of the city to oversee the census.\n\u201cNow the authorities themselves admit that number of buildings remain uncounted which pushed the PBS to intervene and depute its teams, our concerns have proved to be true,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just one flaw which was addressed to some extent, but deputing Islamabad teams won\u2019t help.\u201d\n"

However, the SHO admitted that even after imposing a ban on swimming, it was not possible to control crowds, particularly on Eid holidays and weekends.\nEdhi divers continued their efforts to find the remaining two bodies till sunset. \nQuoting their family members, the police said that they did not inform the seminary or their families about their picnic.

            "Text": "\u2022 Says survey could determine actual position of multi-billion rupee project\n\u2022 Board of Revenue can change status of protected forest lands, SHC told\nHYDERABAD: A senior government official on Wednesday informed the Sindh High Court that the actual site position of the Bahria Town Karachi 2 (BTK-2) could only be determined after a survey and establishing latest ownership of the land in each Deh.\nThe Sindh forest secretary had earlier informed the SHC that the \u201cBTK-2 has been approved wrongly by the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) and Sehwan Development Authority (SDA) on forest lands as evident from attested maps\u201d.\nA division bench comprising Justice Mohammad Junaid Ghaffar and Justice Adnanul Karim Memon resumed the hearing of the case at the Circuit bench, Hyderabad. It adjourned the hearing till May 23.\nPetitioner Salahuddin moved the SHC stating that BTK-2 was located close  to PAF Base Bholari on Karachi-Hyderabad side of M-9 close to highly  sensitive defence installations. He said the project undermined and  compromised defence of the country. He said land on which BTK-2 (with  extension) situated in Than Bula Khan was being developed on  state/public land and entries shown in BTK-2 of scattered pieces of land  were bogus entries.\nHe asked the court to form a joint investigation  team to physically survey and investigate title and ownership of the  land on which BTK-2 layout plan was drawn.\nOn Wednesday, Additional Advocate General Allah Bachayo Soomro filed comments on behalf of the respondent forest secretary as well as a statement of Senior Member Board of Revenue (SMBR) regarding \u2018mother entries\u2019 of the subject land.\nTaking a different position from what he had stated in the earlier hearing, the forest secretary stated in the comments: \u201cActual site position with latest entries could only be determined after survey of total lands of Dehs by earmarking lands on ground and maps as per latest ownership of land in each Deh. Prima facie land in dispute with regard to petition doesn\u2019t fall within protected forests.\u201d\nIn his earlier comments, he had stated: \u201cLayout of BTK-2 is very likely on forest lands which is evident from attested maps annexed within\u201d. Notified forest lands have been wrongly mutated by revenue officers.\u201d\nHowever, in the fresh comments he submitted that the Board of Revenue (BoR) was the custodian of the record of state lands including protected forest. \n\u201cAny changes in the status of land due to allotment is done by BoR. Change in ownership and its subsequent entries are registered by relevant officers of BoR and land record. Thus forest department is not in a position to determine latest entry position in record of rights of abovementioned Dehs,\u201d he stated.\nHe stated that due to some error/misconception earlier comments pertaining to the SBCA were filed; however actual position was that the status of protected forest land could be changed by the custodian department i.e. BoR and such entries could be made in record of rights as done in the past in cases of Deh Chuhar and other Dehs of district Malir and Bin Qasim Town. \n\u201cActual site position of BTK-2 can be determined accurately by detailed survey and mapping of land of each owner of Deh maps which could be done by Survey of Pakistan, BoR and Forest department,\u201d he stated.\nAfter receiving a copy of the comments from a government law officer on Wednesday, petitioner\u2019s counsel Fayyaz Metlo told Dawn that the secretary in his previous comments had stated that \u201cforestland in above deh are notified as protected forestland under Section 4 of Forest Act 1927 vide notification dated May 7,1966\u201d. \nHe said according to the comments the forest department and Survey of Pakistan were preparing maps and doing demarcation of forest lands. \nOn the last date of hearing, the petitioner\u2019s counsel had informed the court that the forest secretary stated in his comments that the SDA and SBCA had wrongly approved project.\nThe counsel stated that the forest secretary also said that \u201cnotified forestlands have been wrongly mutated by revenue officers. BTK-2 has been approved wrongly by SBCA and SDA on forest lands as evident from attested maps. Lands have been kept in register of forests by revenue department therefore lands cannot be owned by respondents 13 and 14 (BTK-2 and M/s Paradise Real Estate).\n\u201cRecord of land annexed with petition shows that other entries were recorded on the basis of verbal statements without any allotment or transfer by government to people. Forest land could not be transferred without de-notifying in any circumstances to any person and it can only be used for forest purposes. In the instant case no de-notification has ever been issued by Sindh government,\u201d he stated in his earlier comments.\n"

He said the PTI had made huge mistakes in awarding tickets in Punjab and it would surely lose half of its seats in the elections due to its poor policies.\nIn the meanwhile, PML-Q has awarded party tickets to more than 50 candidates for the upcoming elections in Punjab.\n"

            "Text": "RAHIM YAR KHAN: The Punjab Food Department is intimidating small farmers to achieve its wheat procurement target in the district.\nThe department has procured 87,000 metric tons of wheat in pursuit of the target for this year -- 130,000 metric tons.\nOn increasing complaints from small farmers, the department on Tuesday night started a crackdown on flour mills and recovered more than 19,000 wheat bags.\nThe department will also raid different private seed companies to recover the wheat stored illegally or in excess of the permitted quantity. The food department is to procure wheat in Sadiqabad, Rahim Yar Khan and Liaqatpur tehsils, and Passco will buy the produce from Khanpur tehsil.\nThe food department started the wheat procurement by the end of March at its 21 centres with more than 45 food inspectors and other supporting staff and patwaris. \nSmall farmers, however, complain that the food department has hired more than 130 private \u201cchowkidars\u201d who are involved in the practice of confiscating wheat from them. These agents, along with a policeman, stop tractor-trolleys and rickshaws loaded with wheat bags which small farmers transport to their homes for their personal use. They initially force these farmers to shift the wheat bags to the official procurement centers, and on the farmers\u2019 refusal, they demand Rs1,000 to Rs5,000 for a vehicle and then allow them to take the wheat to their homes.\nA farmer of Chowk Suraile, Arshaad Ahmed, said that when he was transporting his 40 bags of wheat from his farms to home, two chowkidars with a policeman stopped their vehicle and told the driver to shift these bags to the Iqbalabad Food Centre.\nWhen Arshaad arrived at the spot and inquired about their identity, they refused to introduce themselves and said the assistant commissioner had deployed them to check the wheat movement. Later, they demanded Rs10,000 to allow the trolley to proceed.\nNew Model Grain Market President Anwar Najmi told Dawn that the small farmers had been restricted from bringing their wheat to the grain market as the food department wanted to achieve the target first.\nHe said that there were 270 traders in the grain market, and all were asking him about how they would earn their bread and butter under such restrictions. He said that when farmers want to sell their product in the grain market due to attractive rates, the government creates hurdles. He suggested that if the trade of agricultural products is not allowed, the grain market should be permanently closed.\nHe alleged that before Eid, the food department took huge amounts from flour mills and permitted them to store wheat at night. The department will again mint money from flour mill owners through this practice, Najmi said.\nOn Wednesday, the district association of flour mill owners held an emergency meeting at the Rahim Yar Khan Chamber of Commerce and Industry to discuss the situation but did not release the details of its decisions.\nDistrict Food Controller Fazal Abbas said that his office superintendent, Muhammad Asif, will respond to allegations, targets, and raids on flour mills, including complaints from small farmers. Mr Asif, however, chose not to share the details despite repeated attempts to reach him.\n"

She was initially taken to the Gujranwala Civil Hospital but later referred to Lahore due to her critical condition.\nThe station house officer stated the hospital informed them about the incident, but the police were not informed by the family, which makes the matter suspicious.\nAdiba\u2019s husband claimed that she set herself on fire, but the police are looking into the matter.\nATTACK: Up to 25 armed men broke into the house of a female health department employee in Rahwali on Wednesday over a land dispute. They broke the nose bone of her younger brother, Javed, and fractured an arm of her nephew, Ahsan.\nGhazala Yasmin, Javed and Ahsan were at home when Zulfiqar, Shamshad, Ayaz Sajjad, Sufyan, Nauman Adeel and 20 unidentified gunmen arrived and warned against buying the land adjacent to their house.  \nThe attackers used their weapons to break the doors of two rooms and beat Javed and Ahsan.\nThey also destroyed the walls of Ghazala\u2019s property using a tractor.\nWhen Ghazala called the police, the attackers fled the scene.  \nJaved and Ahsan were taken to the hospital for medical assistance.  \nThe cantonment police have registered a case against the suspects.\nCASE: The Civil Line Police have registered a case against six people for selling fake e-stamp papers.\nRetired Maj Muhammad Mustafa reported that he bought an e-paper to pay Rs15,000 fees.

            "Text": "LAHORE: The police authorities are considering a proposal to introduce changes in the Police Order 2002 to bring the investigation wing back under the command of the operations wing of the Lahore police, which according to its critics, will be like undoing the progress made by the organisation over the past two decades.\nThe proposal came as a surprise for most of the senior police officers when it was shared with them at a meeting and was later discussed at two more huddles recently, seeking suggestions from them, before its implementation in the provincial capital.\nInterestingly, a group of police officers wanted to implement the proposal despite strong reservations shown by a majority of the participants of the meetings.\nThe Police Order 2002 had introduced the provision for separate investigation staff at every police station in order to bring specialisation in the police, following the pattern in developed countries across the world.\nSharing details in this regard, an official privy to the development told Dawn that the move to abolish independent status of the investigation wing by giving  ultimate powers to the divisional SPs and the station house officers  (SHOs) has created unrest among the higher ranks of the police as it was also against the spirit of the Police Order 2002.\nHe said the clause 1 of the section 18 of Police Order categorically declares, \u201cThere shall be separation of investigation from other functions of the Police\u201d.\nThe prime purpose of segregation of the wings was to introduce specialisation in the police and to hold the officers accountable, he added.\nThe fundamental restructuring and reform of police stations included complete separation of prosecution from the police by creating an independent (prosecution) service, he said, adding this functional separation was also intended to develop requisite expertise and promote greater efficiency, leading to better results.\nThe official said the proposal also included increasing the number of police divisions of Lahore from six to twelve where the divisional SPs should deal with both investigation and operations.\nSimilarly, the changes have also been proposed at the police station level where the police high-ups wanted to bring investigation police under the command of the SHO.\nHe said a group of police officer backing this idea wanted to reintroduce \u2018unity of command\u2019 through this proposal.\nDuring these meetings, he said, Lahore Operations DIG Afzaal Kausar and the acting DIG (investigation) Kamran Adil opposed the scheme.\nSimilarly, investigation SSP Dr Anoosh Masood Chaudhry also shared her difference of opinion in the meeting, proposing that the high-ups should strengthen the investigation by reallocating human resource.\nHowever, Chief Traffic Officer Mustansar Feroze, Lahore police operations SSP Sohaib Ashraf, reportedly, backed the proposal to empower the SPs and SHOs to discharge both functions.\nThe official said the officers who opposed the proposal were of the opinion that the investigation police wing of Lahore has long been neglected as compare to the operations wing in terms of distribution of resources. They said that out of approximately 30,000 strong Lahore police, 24,000 officials were designated for operations wing, while the investigation wing has been kept understaffed.\n\u201cCurrently, there are only 510 investigation officers (IOs) at the disposal of the investigation wing of Lahore police, while the number of total registered cases in a year has reached 275,000\u201d, the official said. It was not humanly possible for the IOs to complete the investigations of such a large number of cases, as required by the high-ups.\nOn the other hand, the officers who were supporting the proposal claimed that the poor performance of the investigation wing has prompted the Lahore police chief to introduce reforms to bring \u201cunity of command\u201d in the police.\nThe official source said that independent police circles have termed the proposal an attempt to take the police back to the old era, saying as the developed world was following the concept of specialisation, a retrogressive mindset in the Punjab police was trying hard to grab powers to take decisions without any accountability.\nAccording to them, he said, the separation of the investigation and operations wings was a strong check on the police officers.\n\u201cIt would be unwise to give unbridled powers to the SHO to first lodge a case under specific sections and then himself decide whether the allegations leveled in the FIR are true or false,\u201d the official said.\nThe proposal, if materialised in its present form, would destroy the efforts to dispense justice to the people, he said while quoting the independent police circles.\nWhen this reporter contacted the retired senior police officer Dr Shoaib Suddle, he strongly opposed the proposal, declaring it against the spirit of the Police Order 2002.\nDr Shoaib, who has been instrumental in the implementation of the Police Order across the country, is also regarded as a leading police and justice system reforms specialist in South Asia.\n\u201cI have been advocating worldwide the specialisation in the police organisations as the best way to dispense justice to the public\u201d, he said, adding that the proposal would deal a major blow to the independence and autonomy granted to the police under the Police Order.\nHe said the Police Order had provisions for the organisation of police on functional basis, through introduction of new branches, divisions, bureaus and sections, to improve efficiency and bring professionalism in the service. \u201cThe separation of investigation from watch and ward was a major initiative to achieve this objective\u201d, Dr Suddle said.\nHe lamented that the attempt to wrap up the existing system in the name of the \u2018unity of command\u2019 would be tantamount to disowning the efforts of the senior police officers who drafted the Police Order 2002 in the best interest of the public and the police.\n"

They were identified as Muhammad Afzal, Ghulam  Sabir, Suleman Mustafa, Babra Yasmin, Basharat Ali, Iftikhar Ahmad and  Shahzad Ali.  \nSources said obsolete and worn-out cylinders are  being used without getting fitness certificates from the officials  concerned by the owners of passenger vans.  \nA district police  spokesperson, however, claimed that a crackdown was already under way  against vans using substandard cylinders. He said on the same road, Nawan  Lahore police had impounded a van on Tuesday for having a  substandard cylinder and its driver was sent behind bars after  registering a case against him.  \nPunjab caretaker Chief Minister  Mohsin Naqvi has expressed grief over the accident and directed  Faisalabad Regional Police Officer Dr Muhammad Abid to submit a report  on the incident.\n"

He said the illegal exercise was going on, despite the fact that in several cases, the high court suspended such unwarranted transfer orders.\nHe argued that the petitioner was taken aback, when through media reports, it was revealed that the ECP granted an unprecedented blanket permission to the caretaker government for transfer and posting of the officers, in total oblivion to the provisions of the Election Act.\nThe counsel pleaded that seeking a prior approval of the ECP by the caretaker government for each transfer and posting was mandatory under section 230(1)(f) of the Elections Act 2017, which provision cannot be dispensed with under the law.\nHe asked the court to set aside the impugned notification of the ECP issued on March 10 whereby it granted blanket permission to the caretaker government to transfer, post and appoint officers in the province without seeking a prior approval of the commission.\n"

Prime Minister\u2019s Principal Secretary Tauqeer Shah and Chief Census Commissioner Nadeem Zafar were also present at the meeting.\nThe MQM-P team was represented by party convener Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui and other leaders, including Syed Aminul Haq, Mustafa Kamal, Farooq Sattar and Hanif Javed.\n\nSenior party leaders ask govt team to form committee to \u2018correct statistics\u2019\n\nLater, Mr Kamal, the party\u2019s senior deputy convener, told a news channel that it was the 11th meeting between the government and his party on the census issue. He claimed that Karachi\u2019s population had exceeded 30 million, but it was counted at 16m in the current census.\n\u201cDuring the meeting, serious reservations were expressed about the figures of the census released so far,\u201d the MQM-P press release said.\nIn the meeting, the party leaders also discussed the alleged irregularities of the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) in the digital census and demanded that the federal government fulfil its promises and direct authorities to count the population correctly. The party also demanded the formation of a committee to correct the statistics released so far.\nOn Tuesday, party sources said MQM-P had \u201ccollected resignations from its lawmakers\u201d before its convener took up the census issue with Prime Minister Sheh\u00adbaz Sharif\u2019s team on Wednesday.\nIn a Tuesday meeting, the party expressed reservations about the census and regretted that the federal government was not serious in addressing its grievances.\nThe MQM-P had confirmed to Dawn that it had decided in its meeting to collect resignations from all its seven MNAs and 21 MPAs before the party convener\u2019s meeting with the premier to lend strength to the party\u2019s stance.\nThe move coincided with the fe\u00ad\u00adderal government\u2019s decision to ex\u00ad\u00adtend the digital census, scheduled to conclude on April 25, for five more days, after PBS\u2019s field teams observed a negative growth in 12 major urban areas and nee\u00added data verification in 11 major cities.\n\u201cThe areas where the census timeline has been extended inc\u00adlude Quetta, Lahore, Rawalpindi, Karachi Central, Karachi South, Karachi West, Karachi East, Ma\u00ad\u00adlir, Keamari, Korangi, Hyderabad and Islamabad,\u201d the bureau said.\nHowever, the agency\u2019s statement failed to convince the party to review its stance on the digital headcount.\nMr Kamal said Tuesday\u2019s meeting discussed loopholes in the census being conducted by PBS, the digital count conducted so far and all aspects of the exercise.\nHe said the MNAs who had submitted their resignations to the party convener resolved that they would not go to the assembly until their grievances were addressed.\nThe meeting appreciated the role of the prime minister and federal planning minister, who not only heard all their reservations but also issued directives to address them, Mr Kamal said. He said the MQM-P was part of the ruling coalition in the Centre and would remain with the government at challenging times.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: Human Rights Com\u00admission of Pakistan (HRCP) Chai\u00ad\u00adr\u00adperson Hina Jilani on Wedne\u00adsday said that no institution had the right to force politicians to negotiate.\nMs Jilani made these comments in response to questions from journalists during the launching ceremony of the HRCP report, \u2018State of Human Rights in 2022\u2019, here on Wednesday.\nThe report notes an uptick in enforced disappearances in Balochistan, with 2,210 reported cases having remained unresolved even as a bill criminalising the act was passed by the National Assembly.\nAccording to HRCP Co-chairperson Asad Iqbal Butt, the issue was becoming a reason for differences among provinces and putting the country into a blind alley. \u201cPeople are being arrested without warrants and they remain missing for months and years. There are cases in which people have been missing for 15 years. When an institution won\u2019t respect the Constitution can it expect from the masses to respect and follow the Constitution,\u201d he asked.\n\nState of Human Rights 2022 notes upward trend in disappearances, violence against women, trans community\n\nFreedom of religion\nThe report says escalating threats to freedom of religion or belief have remained a grave concern. While the number of police reports on blasphemy charges fell, the incidence of mob lynching appeared to have risen.\nThe Ahmadi community came under particular threat, with several places of worship and over 90 graves desecrated, primarily in Punjab.\nViolence against women continued unabated, with at least 4,226 instances of rape and gang-rape compounded by an abysmally low conviction rate for perpetrators. Additionally, the scale of violence and discrimination against transpersons has increased, it notes.\nRights of workers neglected\nAbout the rights of workers, the report notes that the rights of workers and peasants were sorely neglected. Although the minimum wage was increased, the state has yet to acknowledge that this falls below the threshold of a living wage.\nAdditionally, it says, while around 1,200 bonded labourers were freed in Sindh, the district vigilance committees constituted in 2022 remained largely dysfunctional. The death toll in the country\u2019s mines also remained very high with 90 workers killed in coal-mine accidents.\nThe report says that immediate action by the state is needed on all these issues if it is to move towards a pro-people approach to politics, law and governance in the country.\nHRCP treasurer Husain Naqi said that 4,000 girls were raped last year and the youngest of them was a newborn and there were also six months old girls. There were a number of cases of acid throwing and karo-kari,\u201c he said.\nIn her speech, Ms Jilani also criticised the settlement of militants in KP, alleging that they were responsible for a recent upsurge in terrorist attacks. She said it was a positive step that traders and hotel associations had opposed such a decision as it had affected their livelihood and business.\nUptick in terror attacks\nMs Jilani expressed concern over forced conversions and forced marriages of girls belonging to minorities. She also raised the issue of discrimination against minorities, especially the people belonging to the Ahmadi community.\n\u201cNational institutions of human rights are not exercising the authority they have. Violence against transgenders is a problem of every province. There is discrimination in employment, education and other rights. People living with disabilities are not getting their rights. Freedom of expression and assembly is not being allowed to people. The human rights community is extremely vulnerable and it has been continuously losing the space which it gained after a long struggle. Even today there are no-go areas for civil society,\u201d she said.\nShe also said there was no indication of involvement of military establishment in the no-confidence motion against the PTI government. However, she said, Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa assemblies were dissolved to create political turmoil, adding that the political situation should be tackled by political parties.\nSenior HRCP Council Member Nasreen Azhar suggested the media should highlight issues of the masses instead of just focusing on politics.\n"

The seat has been shown as \u201copen\u201d in the list of \u201cupdated candidates after review\u201d.\n\nPTI chief claims his life still under threat from people he has already named\n\nFour constituencies \u2014 PP-124 (Jhang-I), PP-204 (Khanewal-II), PP-221 (Multan-XI) and PP-244 (Bahawalnagar-VIII) \u2014 have been kept \u201cpending\u201d.\nFour candidates each have been accommodated on the pending decision seats in central Punjab and south Punjab region, while five ticket-holders have been replaced in north Punjab by awarding tickets to fresh entrants.\nThe aspirants, who got party tickets after the review, submitted their tickets with the Election Commission of Pakistan on Wednesday, replacing the already submitted tickets for respective constituencies.\nApril 26 was the last date for change of party tickets at the ECP.\nThe PTI chief\u2019s review and change of candidates on 22 seats constitute only seven per cent of the total award of tickets to 292 candidates. Five seats are still \u201copen\u201d or the decision on them is \u201cpending\u201d.\nIt may be mentioned that Mr Khan had interviewed some 1,000 aspirants out of 1,500, who had submitted their nomination papers with the ECP.\nMr Khan has stated he would himself interview women candidates looking for nomination on the reserved seats. He said the criteria for selection would be loyalty towards the party and their capacity to contribute in the assembly.\nThreat to life\nLate on Wednesday night, the PTI chief in a series of tweets again claimed that his life was in danger.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe former prime minister pointed out that the interior minister said his [Imran Khan\u2019s] life is under threat from foreign agencies. \u201cLet me make it clear to entire country that the only threat to my life is from the 3 ppl I named after Wazirabad assassination attempt.

He added that the petitioner No. 1 secured 66 and 71 marks for the post of the assistant secretary and staff officer, respectively, whereas the second petitioner also received good marks.\nMr Wazir, however, said the testing agency had not displayed a cumulative merit list and showed test results individually.\nHe said the petitioners were also called for interviews.\nThe counsel said after conducting the interviews, the secretary was bound to proceed under the relevant rules and had to display \u201cmerit list\u201d of the successful candidates and convey it to the candidates, but despite the lapse of a considerable time, no such information was provided to the petitioners and other candidates.\nHe said after a few days, the media reported a \u201clarge-scale favouritism\u201d in the recruitment, while a candidate formally complained to the FIA about it and provided it with a list of appointees along with their relationship with lawmakers and PA officials.\nMr Wazir said his clients also approached the Provincial Inspection Team on the matter, but no action was taken.\nHe argued that while the provincial cabinet had decided that all recruitment in government departments and organisations in the province would be carried out through the National Testing Service and Educational Testing and Evaluation Agency and that no other testing agency was allowed to conduct tests for the purpose.\nThe counsel, however, said the respondents, including the assembly\u2019s secretary, had violated that cabinet decision by giving away that contract to a private testing agency.\nHe claimed that a nephew of the then MPA from Swat, Fazal Hakeem Khan, was inducted as the assistant protocol officer and the son of MPA Mohammad Abdul Salam as the assistant director (reporting), while two residents of Matta area in Swat, the native town of the then chief minister, were appointed on his recommendation.\nMr Wazir claimed that some appointees were recommended by the assembly\u2019s speaker.\nHe said that an employee of the Hazara University also made it to the assembly as a stenographer on deputation before he became a permanent staff member as the speaker\u2019s protocol officer.\nThe lawyer added that the officer in question had appointed his wife as the assistant research officer in BPS-16 and his brother-in-law as the law officer in BPS-17.\nHe also claimed that the secretary appointed three of his family members to the assembly.\n"

Few days ago, the court had granted bail to three of the co-accused in the case, including Adil Khan Advocate, Fawad and Zakir.\nThe prime accused, Adnan Samiullah Afridi, was arrested from the high court\u2019s premises soon after he allegedly fired at Mr Latif Afridi in a bar room on Jan 16.\nInitially, the FIR registered by the East Cantonment police station had included section 302 (intentional murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code. However, Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act was added to it afterwards.\nDuring initial interrogation, the accused, Adnan had admitted to killing Mr Afridi, a former MNA, over a family feud. He, however, changed his statement during his subsequent appearance before the magistrate.\nThe present suspect, Majid Afridi is stated to be son of an ATC judge Aftab Afridi, who was killed when he came under a gun attack near Ambar Interchange on April 4, 2021, when he was travelling in his vehicle with his family on the Peshawar-Islamabad Motorway.\nThe ambush had also killed the judge\u2019s wife and his pregnant daughter-in-law along with her three-year-old son and injured his guard and driver.\nIn that case, Mr Latif Afridi was also charged for abetment along with six other accused persons. However, a court in Swabi had acquitted all the accused in that case.\n"

The authorities diverted traffic to alternative routes. \nThe protesters also burnt tyres on the road and chanted slogans against the government for its failure to protect the lives people and police officials.\nThe protest rally was addressed by PTI activists Ali Shah Mishwani and Kashif Kamal, JI activist Shuiab Ahmad, PPP\u2019s Advocate Alamzeb Khan, former district councillor Hujaj Khan, Malik Rahatullah and others.\n\nProtesters seek inquiry into Kabal incident\n\nThey questioned the stand of government and police about the incident and demanded judicial inquiry into the blast. They condemned the incident and said that durable peace was essential for prosperity and development.\n\u201cWe cannot tolerate terrorism on our land,\u201d said Ali Shah. \nHe added that Pakhtuns could no longer be deceived in the name of terrorism that was always carried out for US dollars.\nThe speakers said that Pakhtuns were peaceful people but their region witnessed the worst kind of bloodshed. They said that people lost trust in government agencies.\nThey said the government should initiate an independent inquiry into the Kabal incident. They said that more such massive protests would be held in the district if the current wave of militancy was not curbed.\nIn Swat, former federal minister and Pakistan Tahreek-i-Insaf leader Murad Saeed said here on Wednesday that it was strange to link the CTD police station blast to a short circuit as Taliban had already claimed responsibility for the incident.\nHe was addressing a protest gathering at Nishat Chowk through a video link. \nThe protest was organised by Swat chapter of PTI against the recent blast at CTD building inside Kabal Police Lines on April 24.\nApart from a large number of PTI workers, local leaders and former PTI MPAs and MNAs including PMA Fazal Hakim Khan, Mingora city mayor Shahid Khan, former provincial minister Dr Amjad and former MNA Saleemur Rehman attended the protest.\nAddressing the gathering, Murad Saeed said that raising questions in the country had become a sin. \nHe added that cases were registered against those, who tried to raise questions on wrongdoings.\n\u201cI have to appreciate the people of Swat for their resistance and bravery against terrorists and all forms of terrorism. Today all Pakhtuns stand for peace. It has become a valid fact that Pakhtuns\u2019 blood is considered cheaper,\u201d he said.\nThe former minister said that he had warned everyone in the month of January that terrorism activities would be carried out after melting of snow. \u201cDeclaring the CTD police station explosion a short circuit is strange,\u201d he said.\nOther speakers said that people of Swat would no more tolerate terrorism activities and would stand against them in unity.\nThe members of civil society also staged a protest against the CTD police station explosion in Khwazakhela tehsil.\nMeanwhile, a condolence reference was held in the district barroom foir the martyrs police personnel. \nA large number of lawyers along with the judges participated in the event.\n"

They said in some cases, children set the crop on fire. They said enmities might also have been behind such incidents.\nUnknown persons set on fire the harvested wheat crop of a farmer in Babu village of Ismaila after it had been collected for threshing. \nImmediately after the fire broke out, Raees Khan informed Rescue 1122, which dispatched a firefighting crew to the spot to put out the blaze. However, the team only managed to save the harvested crop lying in nearby fields.\nRaees said he had lost all of his grain, leaving nothing to feed his family till the next crop. He said unidentified persons put his crop on fire.\nSimilarly, such incidents were also reported from three areas of Topi and from Bamkhel village of Swabi tehsil, incurring heavy losses on poor farmers.\nBODY RECOVERED: The body of an Afghan national, Shabbir Ahmed, 20, who drowned in the River Indus on Tuesday, was recovered from Kund Park area and handed over to the family.\nAlso, Abidur Rehman of Sheraghund village was seriously injured when his rivals opened fire on him.\nMeanwhile, three persons, including an Afghan, were injured in separate road accidents on Wednesday, the police reported.\nCONFERENCE: The All-Party Conference convened by Awami National Party in Islamabad on May 2 will focus on how to defuse the current volatile political situation and stamp out the menace of terrorism.\nTalking to Dawn on Wednesday, ANP\u2019s former Swabi general secretary Tamazan Khan said party\u2019s central vice-president Ameer Haider Khan Hoti had held a meeting with local leaders in Shahmansoor on Tuesday, declaring that PTI won\u2019t be invited to the conference because it had pushed the county deep into political and economic turmoil during its government.\nHe said Mr Hoti was hopeful that the moot would achieve its objectives as it was responsibility of political leaders to formulate a joint strategy to counter terrorism and end political polarisation. He said Mr Hoti also stressed the need for bringing back into the party fold the annoyed workers and leaders.\n"

Jayawardene Trophy with the only thing missing for him on the opening day of the National Amateur Golf Championships was a place on top of the leaderboard. \nUnder sunny skies at the Lahore Gymkhana on Wednesday, Salman\u2019s 354-yard shot from the tee saw him win the prize for the longest drive by a considerable distance, with Omer Intesar (340) finishing second, before his 72, to go alongside Qasim Ali Khan\u2019s 76, helped Pakistan win the one-day team event for the J.R. Jayawardene Trophy by seven strokes over Sri Lanka. \nPakistan\u2019s aggregate was 148 with Sri Lankans finishing on 155 after rounds of 76 and 79 by M.H Chalitha Pushpika and R.A.U. Akash Priyamantha respectively. \nSalman, though, finds himself a shot off the lead in the race for individual honours with 20-year-old Mohammad Shoaib and Nouman Ilyas firing rounds of one-under 71 to steer clear of the 60-strong field after the first round. \nThe duo were in serene control with birdies offsetting the bogies; both firing powerful drives and backing them with sublime control over approach shots as well as putting on the greens.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a fantastic return for me,\u201d Shoaib said, \u201cand I hope it will get better.\u201d \nNouman, meanwhile, was eyeing improvement over the next three rounds. \u201cIt was a good day for me but I will need to improve further to stay in the running for the title.\u201d \nRalfe Aslam Raja is tied with Salman at one stroke behind the leaders with Usama Nadeem alone on 73. Omar Khalid and Umer Farooq are a further stroke adrift as the title race looks too close to call. \nA group of three is placed at 75, comprising Rao M.Hassan, Umair Saleem and Saad Habib while as many as nine golfers are bunched at 76 alongside Qasim and Pushpika. They include two youngsters Shahmeer Majid and Sher Ali Khan as well as Hussain Hamid, Muslim Abbas, Noman Asghar, Ahmed Zafar Hayat, Wing Cmdr Umer Farooq. \nPushpika\u2019s compatriot Chanaka Perera is alongside Ahmed Jibran at 77. \nThe contest for ladies begins from Thursday with two-handicapper Nida Mir from Qatar among the participants. Sisters Parkha and Rimsha Ijaz fired an early warning for the title by finishing one-two in the longest drive competition. \nParkha achieved a distance of 304 yards to win the contest ahead of Rimsha (288) and Amina Tiwana (280). \nThe gap was significantly narrower in the senior amateurs\u2019 category with Umair Butt edging Col Ikram-ul-Haq \nby just two yards. Umair\u2019s drive hit the 305-yard mark while third-placed Mohammad Ali (300) was also close.\n"

The fourth match was abandoned due to rain.\nA second-string New Zealand stunned the hosts by squaring a preceding five-match T20 series 2-2 despite missing eight first-choice players \u2014 including regular skipper Kane Williamson \u2014 due to the ongoing Indian Premier League or injury.\nPakistan have added young wicket-keeper/batter Mohammad Haris to the ODI squad while New Zealand have included in-form batter Mark Chapman, who ended the T20 series as top-scorer (290), in their ODI party.\n\n\nPAKISTAN opener Imam-ul-Haq addresses a pre-match press conference.\u2014White Star\n\n \nWicket-keeper/batter Tom Blundell, recently named among the five best cricketers of the year by Wisden, and middle-order batter Henry Nicholls further boost the touring squad.\nPakistan captain Babar Azam acknowledged the importance of the series starting today.\n\u201cEach and every match that we play from now on holds a great significance for us. This series is a brilliant opportunity for us to fine-tune our combinations and gather the momentum ahead of the mega events in the shape of Asia Cup and the much-anticipated World Cup,\u201d Babar was quoted as saying in a Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) media release.\n\u201cThis team has done well in the past one year in ODI format and I have firm faith in my boys that they will perform according to expectations in the exciting next seven months.\u201d\nPakistan, currently fifth on the ICC ODI rankings, get a chance to move to the top of the table. To achieve this, however, Babar and his men will have to sweep the five-game series against third-ranked New Zealand. While a 4-1 series triumph will lift the green-shirts to third spot.\nIn addition to this series, Pakistan are also scheduled to play three ODIs against Afghanistan (August) and the Asia Cup (September) before the all-important World Cup. \nPakistan\u2019s ODI show of late has remained short of expectations as they lost a three-match home series 2-1 to New Zealand at Karachi in January this year.\n\n\nPAKISTAN captain Babar Azam and his New Zealand counterpart Tom Latham pose with the \nODI series trophy.\u2014White Star\n\n \nThough Babar and company during the past year have done well, winning the ODI series against Australia (2-1) and West Indies (3-0) at home and downing the Netherlands (3-0) in Rotterdam during this period, losing the home series to 2019 World Cup finalists New Zealand came as a big blow.\nMeanwhile speaking to media, Latham said victory in the T20 series had boosted the team\u2019s confidence. \n\u201cThe T20s proved an outstanding series; winning the series after trailing 2-0 was an excellent comeback for us, and we\u2019re looking forward to switching to ODI mode now. The preparation wasn\u2019t ideal but for us that wasn\u2019t an excuse. It was about just keep getting better game from game and keep learning. We did that and to come out with a series draw after trailing 2-0 was awesome,\u201d the New Zealand skipper said during his pre-match media conference.\n\u201cThe T20 series has lifted our confidence level; it will help us in achieving good results in the ODI series [too] against Pakistan who are a quality side.\u201d\nOn the forthcoming ODIs, Latham said, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a tough ODI series on the back of what this T20 series has produced. We have seen some great games of cricket and the one-day series is going to be no different. It\u2019s a new format, and we have to adapt quickly. Hopefully we can do that straight away.\u201d\nEarlier addressing a press conference, Pakistan opener Imam-ul-Haq said the series against New Zealand prior to the Asia Cup and the World Cup, carried great importance for the hosts.  \n\u201cPakistan are one of the best ODI teams as we have won nine out of the last 12 ODIs during the past year,\u201d left-handed Imam said.\n\u201cThe entire team have been giving their full support to Babar Azam,\u201d the opener said, adding the players will make all-out efforts to win the series.\n\u201cWe will not repeat the mistakes committed during the T20 series.\u201d  \nTo a query, Imam said New Zealand were a good team. \u201cIn international and professional cricket, even \u2018B\u2019 teams, are also good.\u201d \nIn a potential setback for Pakistan, batter Haris Sohail suffered an accident during practice.\nAccording to a PCB in a media release issued late on Wednesday, left-handed Haris landed awkwardly on his left shoulder during fielding practice. The batter\u2019s initial scans [conducted] at a local hospital were satisfactory, added the PCB.\n\u201cThe medical team will assess Haris before the first ODI to determine his participation in the match.\u201d\nThe second match of the ODI series will be played on Saturday. The games at the National Stadium, Karachi will be held on May 3, 5 and 7. \nSquads:\nPAKISTAN: Babar Azam (captain), Shadab Khan (vice-captain), Abdullah Shafique, Fakhar Zaman, Haris Rauf, Haris Sohail, Ihsanullah, Imam-ul-Haq, Mohammad Haris (wicket-keeper), Mohammad Nawaz, Mohammad Rizwan (wicket-keeper), Mohammad Wasim Jr, Naseem Shah, Salman Ali Agha, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Shan Masood, Usama Mir\nNEW ZEALAND: Tom Latham (captain), Adam Milne, Ben Lister, Blair Tickner, Chad Bowes, Cole McConchie, Daryl Mitchell, Henry Nicholls, Henry Shipley, Ish Sodhi, Jimmy Neesham, Mark Chapman, Matt Henry, Rachin Ravindra, Tom Blundell, Will Young.\n"

Intensified US competition with China has further strained Pakistan\u2019s relations with the United States, as did the country\u2019s deteriorating economy.\n \n \n\nBut recently, there has been an increase in high-level diplomatic engagements and dialogues focused on trade, energy, education, health, and defence.\nThe half-day conference at Wilson Centre, Washington, focused on how the US-Pakistan relationship can be crafted against the backdrop of multiple challenging developments.\nAmbassador Khan not only emphasised the need to rejuvenate once close relations between the United States and Pakistan but also underlined the role Washington can play in easing tensions between India and Pakistan.\n\u201cWe do value the US encouragement to India and Pakistan to engage. But beyond that, the US could act as a catalyst to help resolve the Jammu and Kashmir dispute which has kept the region on the brink of war,\u201d he said.\nResponding to a question, Ambassador Khan said that Pakistan placed its first order for Russian oil and did so in consultation with the US government.\nHe also spoke about the role Pakistan can play in bringing stability to Afghanistan.\n\u201cAfghanistan\u2019s stability is imperative, first and foremost, for its own people who have suffered grievously over the past four decades,\u201d he said.\nNoting that the United States and China were both concerned about the growth of terrorism in Afghanistan, he said: \u201cLet\u2019s work together to eliminate this threat. Today it is a threat for Pakistan and Afghanistan; if unchecked, it will spread to other parts of the region and beyond.\u201d\nMs Horst also covered this issue, noting that both the US and Pakistan \u201cwant a region where terrorists pose no threats and borders are respected.\u201d\nUnderlining the need to look beyond the challenges, Ms Horst urged both nations to work together on economy, trade, investment, regional stability, and especially on global challenges like the climate and health.\nShe, however, acknowledged that \u201cthe question on everybody\u2019s mind right now is Pakistan\u2019s immediate economic situation.\u201d The United States, she said, \u201cshares concerns about the sustainability of Pakistan\u2019s current economic path\u201d and \u201cwe also know that this economic situation has very personal consequences for tens of millions of Pakistanis who are tightening their belts\u201d.\nThe United States, she said, would continue to support Pakistan through technical engagements and assistance, \u201cparticularly when it comes to encouraging Pakistan to enact policies that promote an open and fair, transparent business climate\u201d.\n"

And that\u2019s obviously created somewhat better conditions for people in Sudan,\u201d he told reporters.\nBurhan on Wednesday said he would consider a proposal by the East African IGAD bloc for another three-day ceasefire when the current truce formally expires at midnight (2200 GMT), but no further details have been released and the RSF\u2019s response to the proposal is unclear.\n\nUN says fighting disrupts food supply to 50,000 acutely malnourished children\n\nOn Thursday, warplanes patro\u00adlled over the capital\u2019s northern suburbs as fighters on the ground exchanged artillery and heavy machinegun fire, witnesses said.\nAt least 512 people have been killed and 4,193 wounded in the fighting, according to health ministry figures, although the real death toll is likely much higher.\nHospitals have been shelled and more than two-thirds are out of service, the doctors\u2019 union said Thursday, reporting at least eight civilians killed in Khartoum alone on Wednesday.\nViolence beyond Khartoum\nFighting has also flared in the provinces, particularly in the war-torn western region of Darfur. Witnesses said clashes raged for a second day in the West Darfur capital El Geneina, with pro-democracy medics reporting a doctor shot dead.\nThe UN humanitarian agency said the fighting in West Darfur had disrupted food to \u201can estimated 50,000 acutely malnourished children\u201d.\nThe violence has trapped many civilians in their homes, where they have endured severe food, water and electricity shortages.\nThose who can afford to have taken the long and risky journey to flee the country.\nEgypt said on Thursday that at least 14,000 Sudanese refugees had crossed the border since fighting erupted, as well as 2,000 people from 50 other countries.\nAt least 20,000 people have escaped into Chad, 4,000 into South Sudan, 3,500 into Ethiopia and 3,000 into the Central African Republic, according to the UN, which has warned if fighting continues as many as 270,000 people could flee.\nForeign governments have scrambled to get thousands of their citizens out, and UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly urged Britons to leave while they can. \u201cWe cannot guarantee how many further flights will depart once the ceasefire ends,\u201d he said.\nA Saudi evacuation ship docked in the Red Sea port of Jeddah on Thursday carrying 187 people from 25 countries, taking the total evacuated by Riyadh to 2,544, only 119 of them Saudis, the foreign ministry said.\nCanada said Thursday it had completed its first military flight carrying evacuees, with Defence Minister Anita Anand calling the situation \u201cvery volatile\u201d.\nAs lawlessness has gripped Sudan, there have been several jailbreaks, including from the high security Kober prison where top aides of ousted dictator Omar al-Bashir were held.\nAmong the escapees is Ahmed Harun, wanted by the International Criminal Court to face charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur. Harun\u2019s escape sparked fears of the involvement of Bashir loyalists in the ongoing fighting.\nThe army said 79-year-old Bashir was in a military hospital, where he had been moved to before fighting erupted.\n"

Already in 2022, the number of people facing acute food insecurity was projected to reach up to 222 million in 53 countries/territories, according to the latest Hunger Hotspots report.\nThe report said the world experienced a third consecutive La Nina event in 2022 and early 2023, a rare occurrence that has happened only twice since 1950. La Nina events are commonly associated with wetter conditions in Australia and drier conditions in the US, South America and East Africa.\n"

Acc\u00adepting the recommendations made in the report, the government can provide innovative employment prospects to 23pc of Pakistan\u2019s young population while adding $60 billion to the economy within the next eight years. The OICCI report has recommended a rapid increase in the fibre optic broadband penetration, focus on 4G penetration and a need for the Artificial Intelligence policy to supplement decision-making.\nThe report said government departments like the FBR should be encouraged to maximise the use of data analytics technologies. Moreover, it highlighted the need for an up-to-date cybersecurity law and strict enforcement of intellectual property rights to encourage global IT companies to set up operations in Pakistan.\nThe participants of the roundtable, including senior officials from the Planning Commission, HEC, Pakistan Institute of Development Economics, IT ministry, SBP and FBR, pointed out the inconsistency in policies, technical skill gap and deficiencies in the implementation and execution of policies as key challenges that needed the attention at the highest level.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The World Bank on Thursday forecast a substantial decline in global commodity prices during the current year but Pakistanis would have to brace for 21pc average annual inflation in the next fiscal year.\nIn its latest Commodity Markets Outlook, the World Bank expected global commodity prices to decline this year at the fastest clip since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, clouding the growth prospects of almost two-thirds of developing economies that depend on commodity exports.\n\u201cThe drop in prices, however, is expected to bring little relief to the nearly 350 million people across the world who face food insecurity\u201d, said the bank, adding that although food prices were expected to fall by 8pc in 2023, they would be at the second-highest level since 1975.\nThe report came a day after the Ministry of Finance forecast 21pc annual inflation for the next fiscal year \u2014 down from a record 28.5pc during the current fiscal year. The MOF also forecast the economic growth rate for the next fiscal year at 3.5pc against 0.8pc anticipated for the current fiscal year.\n\nSays despite fall, food prices will remain at five-decade high\n\nThe World Bank noted that as of February this year, annual food price inflation was at 20pc globally, the highest level over the past two decades.\n\u201cThe surge in food and energy prices after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has largely passed due to slowing economic growth, a moderate winter, and reallocations in the commodity trade,\u201d said Indermit Gill, the World Bank\u2019s Chief Economist and Senior Vice President for Development Economics.\n\u201cBut this is of little comfort to consumers in many countries. In real terms, food prices will remain at one of the highest levels of the past five decades. Governments should avoid trade restrictions and protect their poorest citizens using targeted income-support programmes rat\u00adher than price controls\u201d, he said.\nOverall, commodity prices are expected to fall by 21pc in 2023 relative to last year. Energy prices are projected to decline by 26pc this year. The price of Brent crude oil in U.S. dollars is expected to average $84 a barrel this year\u2014down 16pc from the 2022 average. European and US natural-gas prices are forecast to halve between 2022 and 2023, while coal prices are expected to decrease by 42pc in 2023.\nFertiliser prices are also projected to fall by 37pc in 2023, which would mark the largest annual drop since 1974. However, fertiliser prices are still near their recent high last seen during the 2008-09 food crisis. Pakistan\u2019s major imports include oil and gas besides coal, wheat and fertilizers that together form almost half of total imports.\nAyhan Kose, the World Bank\u2019s Deputy Chief Economist and Director of Prospects Group said: \u201cThe decline in commodity prices over the past year has helped reduce global headline inflation. However, central bankers need to remain vigilant as a wide range of factors, including weaker-than-expected oil supply, a more commodity-intensive recovery in China, an intensification of geopolitical tensions, or unfavourable weather conditions, could push prices higher and reignite inflationary pressures.\u201d\nDespite the large declines expected this year, prices of all major commodity groups will remain well above their 2015-2019 average levels. European natural gas prices will hover at almost three times the average in 2015-19. Energy and coal prices will also remain above the pre-pandemic average.\n\u201cMetal prices, which increased slightly early in the year, are expected to fall by 8pc relative to last year, primarily because of weak global demand and improved supplies,\u201d said Valerie Mercer-Blackman, Lead Economist in the World Bank\u2019s Prospects Group. \u201cIn the longer term, however, the energy transition could significantly lift the demand for some metals, notably lithium, copper, and nickel.\u201d\nA Special Focus section of the report evaluates the performance of a wide range of approaches used to forecast prices of seven industrial commodities (oil and six industrial metals). A key finding of the study is that futures prices, which are widely used for price forecasts, often lead to large forecast errors.\n"

A day earlier, Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani had made efforts to bring the opposition party to the table for a dialogue with the government at the request of the federal government.\nThe PTI delegation included Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Fawad Chaudhry, and Senator Ali Zafar whereas the government was represented by PML-N\u2019s Ishaq Dar, Khawaja Saad Rafique, Azam Nazeer Tarar, Sardar Ayaz Sadiq and PPP leaders Yousuf Raza Gilani and Naveed Qamar.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsiders told Dawn that the PTI had put forth three key demands during the meeting \u2014 the dissolution of the National Assembly and Sindh and Balochistan legislatures in May to pave way for general elections in July; the passage of a constitutional amendment for a one-time concession to delay polls beyond 90 days if the government wanted to go beyond the May 14 election date in Punjab; and, the withdrawl of the speaker\u2019s order accepting the resignations of PTI MNAs to bring them back to the National Assembly.\nThe government team has sought some time to discuss the demands, the sources added, and the two sides will meet again today (on Friday) to continue talks.\n \n \n\nThough MQM-P lawmaker Kishwar Zehra was a part of the government-nominated team, the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) was conspicuous by its absence from the meeting.\n\u2018No delay tactics\u2019\nPTI Senator Syed Ali Zafar, while talking to reporters after the meeting, said both sides have agreed that talks would not be used as a delaying tactic. He said that the negotiations committee had a one-point agenda i.e. \u2018elections\u2019.\nDuring the meeting, the government and the opposition tried to understand each other\u2019s stance in the parleys. The committee also would try to inform the Supreme Court about any outcome of talks by Monday, he added.\nAfter the end of the first round of talks, Shah Mehmood Qureshi said that political parties used to resolve the political issues through talks but any extra-constitutional resolution of the matter would not be possible.\nHe confirmed that the government side has sought some time for a discussion with its leadership to respond to their terms.\nPPP\u2019s Yousuf Raza Gillani told the media that a final decision on the elections would be taken after consultations with all the parties. \u201cAll matters would be resolved while remaining within the limits of law and the Constitution.\u201d\nEarlier in the day, Chairman Senate Sadiq Sanjrani wrote separate letters to Leader of the House Ishaq Dar and Leader of Opposition Dr Shahzad Waseem asking them to nominate members from both the treasury and opposition benches for a special committee to initiate talks.\nIn separate letters, the Senate chairman requested both leaders to provide the names of four members from each side for inclusion in the special committee within two days.\nANP invites PTI for multi-party moot\nPrior to the huddle with the government, the PTI convened a meeting to devise a strategy for talks with the government.\nAccording to a PTI leader, the strategy was to ensure that PDM would not be able to say that the negotiations were derailed because of the PTI. Meanwhile, the leadership of the Awami National Party (ANP) expressed their desire to have a formal meeting with Chairman Imran Khan.\nThe development took place in a meeting of the ANP leaders \u2014 Zahid Khan and Mian Iftikhar Hussain \u2014 called on Shah Mehmood Qureshi and Fawad Chaudhry in Islamabad. During the meeting, they extended an invitation to the PTI to attend the ANP\u2019s multi-party conference on July 3.\n"

Tabling the resolution, Mr Bhutto-Zardari said the government had decided to show the whole world that parliament stood with the Constitution.\nAmid desk-thumping and loud sloganeering, Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf made the announcement that 180 members had risen from their seats in favour of the resolution.\n\u201cConsequently, Mian Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif has obtained the vote of confidence from the National Assembly and commands the confidence of the majority of the members of the National Assembly as prime minister of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan,\u201d the speaker declared as soon as the prime minister returned to his seat after individually shaking hands with the parliamentary leaders of each and every coalition party.\nOn his way back, PM Shehbaz also greeted PTI dissident and Opposition Leader Raja Riaz Ahmed, who seemed happier than anyone else in the house over the development. However, he was among the members who did not vote for the PM.\n\u201cHad the late Mufti Abdul Shakoor [federal religious affairs minister, who died in a road accident] been present today, the premier would have secured 181 votes,\u201d said the speaker, who had earlier allowed counting of the votes of veteran PPP members Nawab Yousuf Talpur and Aftab Shaaban Mirani while asking them to remain seated due to their ill health. Mr Talpur had come to the assembly on a wheelchair.\nPTI\u2019s Saleh Muhammad was the only one from the opposition who spoke on the occasion and accused the government of running away from the elections.\n \n         View this post on Instagram            \n\nThe development came two days after Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb vehemently refuted reports in media that PM Shehbaz had decided to seek a vote of confidence. Legal and political experts believe that after this successful trust vote, the government team negotiating with the PTI would be able to do so from a position of strength.\nInterestingly, when Shehbaz Sharif was elected prime minister in April last year, he secured 174 votes \u2013 two more than the required number of 172. This time around, the increased numbers were down to members of coalition parties who had joined the legislature after winning the recently held by-elections.\nShehbaz\u2019s speech\nIn his speech after securing the trust of the house, PM Shehbaz said he always stood by parliament, whose decisions were being \u201cchallenged\u201d these days.\nLashing out at the judiciary, the prime minister said the judiciary had no right to re-write the Constitution.\n\u201cIt is not possible that parliament frames a law and the judiciary issues a stay order on it, even before it is enforced,\u201d he said, referring to the top court decision to stop implementation of a law passed by the parliament seeking to clip the CJP\u2019s powers in suo motu cases.\n\u201cWe do not accept the decision of the three-judge bench. We only accept the 4-3 verdict,\u201d he said, referring to the division within the judiciary over the issue of suo motu petitions on the issue of polls. He expressed surprise that the court was only interested in the elections in Punjab whereas it had no concern for the elections in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\u201cZulfikar Ali Bhutto was unjustly martyred, Yusuf Raza Gilani was disqualified. Nawaz Sharif was disqualified. Today, parliament has given me the vote of confidence. By God, if they oust me in response to this vote of confidence, I am ready to go back thousands of times,\u201d the prime minister resolved.\n\u201cThis parliament has elected me as the prime minister. If this parliament reaches a decision after debate and obliges the government and cabinet, then it is mandatory for me to respect its decision. It is mandatory for me to stand by them,\u201d he said, in an apparent reference to the SC order to the federal government to release Rs21bn election funds.\nPM Shehbaz said that despite reservations of some coalition partners, the government had agreed to hold talks with the PTI, but the agenda should be holding the elections on one day in the country.\nHe said if elections would be held in Punjab six months before polls in other federating units, it would send a wrong message and the smaller provinces would accuse Punjab of \u201cexploiting\u201d the political situation.\n\u201cIf the PTI is ready to accept elections on a single day, then we have nominated our team,\u201d he said.\nIn his speech, the PM also lashed out at the previous government and its \u201cfacilitators\u201d, specifically targeting former chief justice of Pakistan Saqib Nisar. He recalled that former prime minister Imran Khan had promised that charges of rigging in the 2018 elections would be probed, but it never came to pass. He alleged that it was former CJP Nisar who stopped recounting in the constituencies, demanding that an investigation be launched as to how the mandate of the people was stolen by shutting down the Result Transmission System (RTS).\nHe also referred to a recent audio clip \u2014 purportedly of a conversation between ex-CJP Nisar and PTI legal adviser Khawaja Tariq Rahim regarding a high-profile case currently being heard by the Supreme Court \u2014 and reiterated the allegation that the former judge had been involved in \u201crigging\u201d the 2018 elections. He also hit out at the former CJP for \u201ctaking suo motu notices day and night\u201d.\nHe said the three-member bench in its order had stated that if they were not implementing the judges\u2019 directives, it meant that the prime minister had lost the majority in the house. \u201cBut the house has given its verdict today,\u201d he declared, stating that parliament had rejected the decision of the three-member SC bench.\nBlaming Imran Khan for undermining Pakistan\u2019s foreign relations, he said thanks to Allah Almighty, a Russian cargo ship carrying cheaper oil was about to depart from Russia, consequent to the incumbent government\u2019s efforts, particularly the foreign and petroleum ministers.\nDefence Minister Khawaja Asif clarified that though PM Sharif had stated that he was ready to face conviction on contempt charges, but they did not accept the present three-member SC bench hearing the polls case.\nAsad Mehmood of the JUI-F said parliament would complete its constitutional term, adding that no one had the authority to dictate terms and undermine the supremacy of parliament. He asked the government to stick to its stance of holding polls across the country simultaneously and not succumb to any pressure in this regard.\nFederal Minister Javed Latif made it clear that the PML-N would accept the general elections only if its leadership would be given a level playing field in the political process. He said PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif had faced disqualification and judicial trials despite being innocent, but it was time to ensure justice for him.\nThe NA will meet again today (Friday) at 11am.\n"

The bodies were shifted to the Civil Hospital, Khairpur.\nRailways officials in Sukkur told the media that they found three burnt bodies in Coach 4, where the blaze erupted, whereas two teenage victims were found in Coach 18, where they had run to save their lives. Two bodies were found lying outside the train.\nThey said the train was disconnected and half of its coaches were towed to Gambat Railway Station. Meanwhile, firefighters managed to douse the blaze after a two-and-a-half-hour effort.\nDr Rahim Bakhsh Bhatti, head of the Gambat Institute of Medical Science, reached the incident site with his team to give first aid to the injured and shift them to the institute for further treatment.\nRailways staff and Pakistan Army soldiers carried out the rescue work for about eight hours and cleared the up and down tracks for other trains, which had been stopped at different stations after the incident.\nSabotage can\u2019t be ruled out Railways Minister Khawaja Saad Rafique, meanwhile, ordered an inquiry into the incident and formed a team headed by the federal government inspector of railways.\nExpressing grief over the loss of lives, he informed the National Assembly that the possibility of sabotage could not be ruled out, the APP reported.\nThe minister said he was \u201cnot satisfied\u201d with the version that the fire broke out due to a short circuit.\nHowever, he told lawmakers that the factual situation would be cleared within one to two days after an inquiry into the incident.\nPR official begins probe\nMeanwhile, the Federal Government Inspector of Railways (FGIR) \u2014 a senior Railways officer \u2014 has started an investigation into the incident.\nAn initial report shared internally by the relevant officials with top Railways officers after inspecting the burnt coach has apparently identified short circuits as a main cause of the incident.\n\u201cThough the FGIR has been assigned to probe and submit a preliminary report within the next couple of days, a very initial on-spot observation made by the officers concerned has identified short circuit a major cause that rapidly spread to the eruption of the massive fire, killing seven people and injuring others,\u201d a senior Railways official, who declined to be named, told Dawn on Thursday.\nIn October 2019, 73 people were killed and 40 injured after three bogies of a Tezgam train bound for Rawalpindi caught fire near Liaquatpur in Punjab\u2019s Rahim Yar Khan.\nHowever, the official said the 2019 fire incident was different from the present one.\n\u201cThe main reason behind the massive fire in Tezgam Express was the LPG cylinder carried by a passenger,\u201d he said.\nBesides, the coaches burnt in Tezgam were of the economy class and not of the business class, where belongings of passengers were inspected closely, he said, adding that it was impossible that someone might carry a gas cylinder there.\nIncident report\nAccording to an incident report compiled by Pakistan Railways, the Karachi Express train having engine No. 9014 (GEU 40) and a total load of 940 tonnes was being driven by the driver Shamsuddin and assistant driver Asghar Raza of the PR\u2019s Karachi division.\nBefore reaching the Tando Masti Khan station, the driver reported at 12:40am to the authorities about the drop of pressure and eruption of fire.\nOn this, the control office contacted the guard in charge of the train and inquired about the matter. The guard reported that the fire erupted in AC business coach No. 12525-0 (fourth from the engine) at KM No. 436/5 near Tando Masti Khan.\nThe affected coach was immediately isolated and fire brigades were called from Khairpur and other cities. \u201cThe first fire brigade reached the site at 1:50am followed by another at 1:55am,\u201d the report said.\nIt stated that as many as 13 trains (up and down), including a special Eid train, were stopped at various stations, including Khairpur and Rohri.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: A three-member bench of the Supreme Court led by Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial on Thursday appeared to be in a defensive mode, as the CJP implored all parties to sit together to break the political impasse, while also clarifying that the court on April 20 had not directed political parties to negotiate rather it was a mere suggestion.\nAt the last hearing on April 20, the CJP through an order had asked political parties to sit together and chalk out a strategy for deciding the date for simultaneous polls and update the apex court on the progress in negotiations by April 27.\nDuring the hearing on Thursday, CJP Bandial implored political parties to sit together to break the political impasse in the wake of a delay in elections.\n\u201cConstitution violation has already taken place (due to delay in elections) but we want to abide by the Constitution so that nobody disregards it,\u201d observed the CJP while heading the bench inclulding Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Munib Akhtar. Justice Bandial conducted the entire proceedings while the other two judges remained quiet throughout the hearing.\n\u201cThe present political environment is of estrangement and bitterness but the Constitution is supreme, besides we are holding the present proceedings in accordance with the constitutional mandate,\u201d he emphasised. It was always a good idea for political parties to discuss issues amongst themselves; it was not a direction but a suggestion, he said in reference to the court order on April 20.\n\nJustice Bandial says courts cannot \u2018force political parties to hold parleys\u2019; detailed SC order still awaited\n\nThe court closed Thursday\u2019s proceedings with an observation that it will issue an appropriate order but will not give any timeline for the culmination of the parleys as it did on April 20 when it had given political parties one week to reach a consensus date. The courts cannot force political parties to hold parleys but they should approach each other with optimism, the CJP observed, adding the court was finding a constitutional way out.\nHowever, no order had been released by the apex court until the time of going to print.\nDuring the hearing, PTI leader Shah Mehmood Qureshi claimed the ruling coalition was using delaying tactics to run away from polls in Punjab directed by the Supreme Court on May 14.\nMr Qureshi assured the court that the PTI believed in negotiations and always respected the Constitution and the courts. As he made further comments of political nature, the CJP stopped him from indulging in politics. PTI spokesperson Fawad Chaudhry opposed the idea of giving political parties the right to advance the election date.\nPPP leader Farooq H Naek said that Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani was acting as a facilitator for talks between the government and the opposition. Senate was chosen to initiate the talks since it was the House of federation and currently members of all the political parties were its members, he added.\nAttorney General Mansoor Usman Awan said the Senate chairman wrote letters to the leaders of the house and the opposition asking them to nominate five leaders each from both sides.\nDuring the hearing, the CJP also tried to kill the speculations of differences amongst the judges by stating that on April 20 we had to meet at the chambers since Justice Munib Akhtar had to leave for Karachi early.\nThe CJP observed that the Supreme Court was not pushing anyone for dialogue but wanted to find out a way to enforce the Constitution for the resolution and solution of the present impasse.\n"

He never returned to Europe again.\nIt is a relatively unknown episode in the life of the American physicist of German Jewish origin, who was born in 1879 and died in 1955.\nWhen Adolf Hitler came to power in early 1933, Einstein, a native of the southern German city of Ulm, was already teaching his theory of relativity in the United States.\nHitler\u2019s Nazi Germany swiftly hunted Jews, targeting Einstein\u2019s home near Berlin and confiscating his belongings.\nOn his return to Europe from across the Atlantic, Einstein landed in Belgium in March 1933 with Elsa, his second wife, fearful that returning to Germany would be too dangerous.\nThe physicist spent six months at De Haan under the careful watch of Belgian police.\n\u201cMy mother knew Einstein well when she was young. Every morning, he walked on the promenade or on the beach,\u201d said Brigitte Hochs, a 78-year-old Belgian guiding a team in the scientist\u2019s footsteps.\nThe Hochs family ran the Bellevue Hotel for decades, with a building in the Belle Epoque style.

As well as the German language, he shared a love of the violin with queen Elisabeth. \u201cThey even played together,\u201d Hochs added.\nThe physicist\u2019s \u201cFlemish\u201d adventure inspired a comic last year by Belgian screenwriter Rudi Miel, who described the short exile as \u201ca thriller\u201d, noting that Einstein was under police watch because of \u201cdeath threats\u201d.\nIn the comic, \u201cLe Coq-sur-Mer, 1933\u201d, referring to De Haan\u2019s French name Le Coq, Einstein, with his famously awry grey hair and thick moustache, appears as a hunted man in the drawings by Baudouin Deville.\nThe author imagines a blonde spy in a trench coat, pistol in hand, sent by the Nazis to kidnap Einstein as part of the Third Reich\u2019s research on the atomic bomb.\nEinstein\u2019s discoveries on mass and energy from his famous equation E=mc2 laid the foundations for future nuclear fission, despite being him a pacifist all of his life.\n\u2018A real jackpot\u2019\nIn reality, there was never any kidnapping attempt while he was in Belgium. But the file devoted to him in the Belgian state archives shows the extent to which Einstein was threatened during his escapades on the shores of the North Sea.\n\u201cThe file is a real jackpot. Through the surveillance reports, we discover professor Einstein\u2019s personality,\u201d said archivist Filip Strubbe.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The arrangement to buy crude oil from Russia is a win win situation for Pakistan and Russia, said Russian Ambassador Danila Ganich.\n\u201cThis trade agreement on oil was not possible unless it was advantageous for both countries,\u201d said the ambassador at a reception hosted to celebrate 75 years of diplomatic relations between Russia and Pakistan.\nSince the 1990s, the volume of trade between Pakistan and Russia has increased from under $100 million to $500 million, the ambassador said.\nThe significance of cordial relations between the two countries could not be overstated.\n\u201cWe will move forward and I am betting on friendship between the two countries with regards to commonality of values, interest and similar approaches to international issues,\u201d he said.\nAs Minister for Economic Affairs Division Ayaz Saddiq echoed the comments of Ambassador Ganich, Senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed believed that Pakistan\u2019s relations with Russia were the most important in the current times. There is no conflict of interest. There had been hesitations in the past, bureaucratic perhaps, geopolitical compulsions.\n\u201cThat is no longer the case. This is the Asian century. Eurasia has to work together. We are particularly happy to get oil from Russia, and work on closer diplomatic and political relationship. We reject any new cold war and expansion of Nato.  We feel, in the 21st century, peace, cooperation and connectivity is the need of the hour. We want to be on the side of connectivity and moving progress and building the Asian Century. Russia, China, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Turkey would be partners in this goal for a better tomorrow,\u201d Mr Sayed said.\nHe said Pakistan would be willing to join any arrangement which strengthened regional connectivity, peace and cooperation.\n\u201cThe two countries have strong compatibility of interest on Afghanistan, for peace and stability, non-interference in Afghanistan and ensuring that Afghan soil is not used for terrorism against any country,\u201d he said.\nThe reception brought together a select audience both local dignitaries and ambassadors such High Commissioner of Mauritius Rashidally Soobadar and Ambassador of Nepal Tapas Adhikari.\nA special corner was dedicated to vintage photographs of former president Ayub Khan\u2019s visit to the Soviet Union on April 5, 1965, ambassador of Pakistan to Soviet Union Mian Arshad Hussain presenting his credentials to chairman of the presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR Leonid Brezhnev, October 5, 1961, and an image of a reception at the Soviet embassy in Islamabad on the occasion of the 72nd anniversary of the Great October Revolution with then prime minister Benazir Bhutto, Soviet ambassador Victor Yakunin and president Ghulam Ishaq Khan on November 7, 1988.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The government seems to have no interest in carrying out the much-needed revision of the master plan of Islamabad, as it has been sitting on a summary for approval of members of the commission that will do so, since over the last five months, Dawn has learnt.\nThe CDA in December last year had moved a summary to the interior ministry for onward submission to the federal cabinet for approval of names of commission members, who will perform revision of the master plan. However, the said names are yet to be approved, which shows that the incumbent government, like its predecessor PTI government, has no interest in the matter.\nIn the said summary, the CDA had requested the federal government for re-consideration of the commission formed by the PTI government, which later became inactive. Honorarium of Rs25,000 was also approved for members for participating in the meeting. \nSources said that CDA had proposed around 20 names for the commission and in a recent development last week, one more name, a member of Islamabad Wildlife Management Board, was also sent to the ministry to be added to the list.\n\nCabinet yet to approve summary for the commission members\n\n\u201cIt is true that we have moved summary in December, proposing names for formation of the commission. But still, there is no development. The good thing is that our summary was not returned which shows that it was not rejected but is facing delay. \u201cSo let\u2019s be positive. Hopefully, the government will approve it soon,\u201d said an official of CDA.\nOn the other hand, the federal capital, which was built in accordance with a well-documented master plan, developed in 1960, has been constantly facing changes to its master plan without any input from professional consultants.\nHitherto, the master plan has faced around 45 changes by successive federal governments, but in spite of these changes, a proper revision has not been made yet. Similarly, the CDA is also facing several challenges for launching people welfare schemes in Zone III, where under the existing master plan, construction is not allowed. An official said that the civic agency, which is going to launch some good schemes \u2013 like auctions of restaurants and construction of sports enclave in Zone III, could face some issue, if changes to the master plan were not made. However, other officials said that CDA could launch such schemes without making changes to regulation of Zone III, but they emphasised that overall revision of Islamabad\u2019s master plan is needed.\nIt is relevant to note here, Doxiadis Associates, a Greece-based firm that had prepared the master plan, recommended its revision after every 20 years. However, no such revision has been made till date.\nWhen the PTI government came to power in 2018, it announced that the master plan will be revised and then-prime minister Imran Khan also formed a commission in this regard. However, the commission, after a delay, prepared an interim report in 2020, which was mostly related to building by-laws and regularisation of certain areas including Banigala. \nThe said commission left proper revision to a professional firm, which, due to various reasons, could not be hired till Mr Khan\u2019s government ended in April last year. Later on, the said commission was inactive, therefore, it was decided that a new commission will be formed and a summary was sent to the interior ministry for re-constitution of commission, which is yet to be approved by the federal government.\nWhen contacted, CDA Chairman Noorul Amin Mengal said that he had been pursuing the summary and he is hopeful that soon it will be approved.\nHe said that CDA, ministry and government are on the same page on this issue and a summary had been moved by the ministry to the Cabinet Division for placing it before the federal cabinet. \u201cI do agree, the revision of master plan is imperative,\u201d he said.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: While the first three-year term of National Commission for Minorities (NCM) has expired, the government has failed to approve law for the establishment of the commission as an autonomous body.\n\u201cAs long as the legislation regarding NCM is not enacted, not only the whole commission but the religious minorities in Pakistan will remain like orphans,\u201d said Chela Ram Kewlani in his last address as chairman of the NCM.\nThe farewell meeting of the commission was held here on Thursday. Speaking on the occasion, Mr Kewlani expressed disappointment and said the first bill, \u201cNational Commission for Minorities Act 2015\u201d, was presented in the National Assembly in 2015 and it could not sail through the lower house.\nWhile the NCM was established 27 years ago, it has always been like a committee under the Ministry of Religious Affairs.\nHowever, in 2020, the then minister for religious affairs Pir Noorul Haq Qadri took the lead by establishing the NCM headed by a non-Muslim even without a law in this regard.\n\nBill was tabled in National Assembly in 2015 but could not sail through, says outgoing chairman\n\nIn February this year, Finance Minister Senator Ishaq Dar introduced the National Commission for Minorities Bill 2023 in the National Assembly. The bill has been referred to the relevant committee for further deliberation.\nMeanwhile, addressing the farewell meeting of the NCM, Mr Kewlani said the commission with its limited powers took up matters related to forced religious conversions, issues related to the properties belonging to minorities, security of places of worship of minorities, reserved seats and quota for minorities in government institutions and educational institutions.\nMr Kewlani added that the commission had suggested to the government to celebrate major festivals of all religious minorities at the official level, including Diwali, Holi, Easter and Nowruz.\n\u201cBut the most important work that the commission has done is to strive for legislation for minorities over various issues because I think that without legislating minorities are left helpless and powerless to fight for their cause,\u201d he added.\nThe speakers in the farewell speech said the commission did what the representatives of the minorities should do.\nThe members of the commission held meetings with high government officials and members of aggrieved communities in remote districts in all four provinces.\nThe members of the commission visited all temples, churches, other places or individuals that faced terror or mob attacks.\nThe 12-member commission included two Muslim members, three each from Hindu and Christian communities, two members from the Sikh community and one member each from the Parsi and Kalash communities.\nThe meeting was attended by Dr Jaypal Chhabria, Mufti Gulzar Naimi, Vishnu Raja, Dr Sara. Albert David MBE, Dr Mampal Singh, Saroop Singh, Roshan Khursheed Brocha,  Dawood Shah and Dr Liaquat Masih Qaiser. The meeting was told that members of the commission did not take their salaries during their three-year tenure nor did they availed of other facilities like travel and other allowances.\nThe meeting was also attended by Minister for Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony Senator Mohammad Talha Mehmood.\n"

We are well prepared to deal with any situation,\u201d he said.\nSpeaking about the first case of mpox, he said that an expat, who arrived from Saudi Arabia on April 17, had tested positive for mpox. \u201cThe patient was admitted in an isolation ward of Pims and as many as 22 contacts were traced and samples were taken from them with a direction to remain in isolation until results of tests would be announced,\u201d he added.\n\u201cThose who were identified as suspects during the contact tracing included passengers of the flight, the airport staff and those who had interacted with the patient,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n \n\n\nSeparately, Prof Dr Javaid Usman, who is a microbiologist, said, \u201cWe have been facing Mpox cases for decades, so there is nothing to worry about it.\u201d He, however, added that there was no approved antiviral therapy for mpox so symptomatic treatment is usually given.\n\u201cIn some countries, the vaccine for smallpox is administered on an experimental basis but even that was given to family members of the patient which is called ring vaccination,\u201d he added.\n\nExpert says Pakistan has been dealing with mpox cases for decades\n\nIslamabad District Health Officer Dr Zaeem Zia told Dawn that on Thursday his teams identified three suspects of mpox and took their samples besides ensuring that they would remain in isolation till the confirmation of tests.\n\u201cWe have established three teams which have been monitoring entry points of the city and other areas to identify patients,\u201d he claimed. \u201cIt is easy to identify the symptomatic patients but asymptomatic patients cannot be spotted. However the good thing is that asymptomatic patients do not spread the virus,\u201d he said.\nAt least 22 samples collected by the National Institute of Health from Islamabad and Rawalpindi to test mpox after contract tracing came back negative, the NIH said on Thursday.\nNo vaccine\nCurrently, Pakistan has no vaccine available for the virus, as confirmed by a senior officer of the Ministry of National Health Services (NHS) on the condition of anonymity.\n\u201cMpox is treated as per symptoms, such as paracetamol is given if a patient has a fever and rash cream is applied in case of a rash: this is called symptomatic treatment,\u201d he said, adding that smallpox vaccine is used to treat monkeypox in some cases but it is not considered proper treatment.\nA Pakistani national who was deported from Saudi Arabia on April 17 on a flight with over 20 people on board was first diagnosed with the virus. According to the official, at least five passengers were tested \u2014 three were cleared while two had chickenpox.\nMeanwhile, another passenger, whose first test for monkeypox has come back positive, might have contracted the virus after using the same toilet as the first patient, the official said, adding that a formal announcement will be made after the second test.\nTwo cases of mpox\nMeanwhile, National Health Services (NHS) Parliamentary Secretary Dr Shazia Sobia Aslam Soomro told the National Assembly there were two confirmed mpox cases in Pakistan.\nDr Soomro stated this while responding to a question from a member National Assembly on the floor of the house. She said treatment against mpox will be available in the market soon.\n"

The link road was assembled in PML-N\u2019s last tenure to connect areas like Potha, Sehar Bhagla Phagwari, Charyan road that lead to Murree Expressway .\nAccording to locals, they had lodged complaints on the citizens\u2019 complaint portal and a number of applications have also been submitted with the Punjab Highways department for repair of the route, but no action was taken.\nThe shabby condition of the road creates hardships for residents taking seriously ill or injured patients especially elderly persons to hospitals, said a resident of the area Zafar Javed.\n\u201cLarge cracks appeared in the damaged portion of the road due to torrential rains a few years back during the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government and public representatives were approached for funds to repair the road. Our school going children were suffering massively due to the bad condition of the road. In the rainy season, patients have no option but to keep their children from going to school,\u201d he said.\nAnother resident Rafiq Mahmood said that after continuous refusal of their applications, local people raised funds on self-help basis and started repair of the damaged road on their own. \nHowever, due to heavy land sliding, huge funds were required and the government needs to contribute, he added.\nAn official of the highway department said that the funds for the damaged link road had to be released a few months ago before dissolution of the provincial government. During interim tenure, the provincial chapter in Punjab cannot release any funds for development purposes as per the rule.\n"

In developed countries books are ranked as best-seller and are valued accordingly but it is disheartening to note that here such trend is not in currency. He further said that unavailability of libraries at schools was also a reason and proof of declining reading habits amongst our progeny. He appreciated contribution of Dr Zulfiqar Siyal in enrichment of Sindhi literature. \nSenator Khuhro recalled that when Dr Siyal was the medical superintendent of the Chandka Medical College Hospital, he established CT scan, MRI and Thalassaemia centres there which were among his good works. \nDr Zulifqar Siyal told the audience that writing is his passion. He said he had been writing for the last 50 years. \u201cMy 30 books have already been published and around 100 more are ready for publication. I have been awarded Tamgha-i-Imtiaz on my contribution to the Sindhi literature.\u201d  \nHe said he was even unaware about recommendation of his name for this award. \u201cI came to know about it only when I saw my name in the list of shortlisted writers published in newspapers,\u201d he said. \nProf Mukthiar Sammo, a writer and founder of Larkana\u2019s Knowledge Centre, said that good books enlightened the minds of readers and enriched their knowledge; they also helped bibliophiles distinguish between truth and falsehood. The ones who write books are doing a great service to society.  \nHe described Dr Siyal\u2019s prose and poetry as very inspirational. His brief autobiographic article in his book is based on his bitter experiences which expose the level of corruption, injustice and nepotism in our society; if written in detail, they could make a separate book on present societal realities. \nJam Mahabbat Sahito said that Dr Siyal, besides being a good writer and poet, proved himself a very effective government official as well. He had also leadership qualities with which he steered Sindh Adabi Sangat a prominent organisation of writers. He very skillfully led it to the benefit of Sindhi literature during his tenure as its secretary general.  \nAzad Anwar Kandhro said that more than 360 pieces of poetry composed by Dr Siyal had been sung by prominent singers of the country, who included maestro like Mehdi Hassan.  \nProf Jam Jamali, a former secretary of the Larkana Arts Council, said that Dr Siyal is an eccentric man in his entity having rich experience of writing, composing poetry and also public dealing.  \nThe others who spoke at the gathering included Ghulam Mohammad Ghazi, Abdul Haee Bhutto, Jeal Oad, Rizwan Gul, Yasmeen Brohi, Manzoor Mangi and Ahmed Ali Sabir Chandio.  \nSinger Sheeraz Abbasi recited verses from Shah Jo Risalo of great Sufi Saint Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai to the much applauds of the audience.\n"

            "Text": "KARACHI: Approving funds for the toll plaza surveillance project, the Sindh cabinet on Thursday directed the chief secretary to immediately hire a consultant and award the contract of installation of automatic number plate recognition cameras (ANPRC) at all the entry and exit points in the province.\nThe decision was taken in the meeting of the cabinet, presided over by Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah. The cabinet sanctioned Rs1.56 billion for the project, which is aimed at enhancing security at entry points to the province through the installation of high-definition CCTV cameras on 40 toll plazas with centralised monitoring and alert system for blacklisted vehicles and criminals.\nThe cabinet was told that high-definition CCTV cameras would capture images of the registration number plates of vehicles and front seat passengers. The images captured will be transmitted to the central monitoring control room at Central Police Office (CPO) in Karachi in real-time. The cameras will read characters on number plates to identify vehicles and face recognition features will identify the passengers.\nThe cabinet was told that the project would help in prevention and detection of crimes by identifying vehicles linked to criminal/illegal activities. It would also detect and prevent terrorist activities by providing early warning of suspicious vehicles entering Karachi.\n\nCS told to award contract for installation of number plate recognition cameras within a month\n\nThe project would also have the capacity to identify suspects associated with a particular vehicle by using facial recognition features and tracking their movement.\nReward money\nHome Secretary Saeed Mangnijo told the cabinet that a committee headed by a DIG consolidated proposals for bounty on criminals based on the nature of their crimes and the number of FIRs against them. \nHe added that the provincial police chief had reviewed the project and endorsed it and sent it to the home department.\nThe cabinet was told that once the criminal was arrested or killed, the police department moved a note for the claim of the announced reward, and the approved amount is released for disbursement.\nThe home secretary said that recently it was identified that while the reward was mentioned in the policy, there was, however, no cap placed on the maximum amount.\nGiving an example, the home secretary said that Rs20m cash reward was recommended on the arrest of a criminal of district Ghotki who was involved in one murder and one kidnapping case; whereas just Rs10m reward was recommended for the arrest of criminal of district Shikarpur involved in 29 murder cases.\nTaking cognizance of the severity of offenses/ heinous crimes and in due consideration of the principles of fairness and justice, the chief minister proposed to place a cap on cash reward for cases where head money for heinous criminals has to be paid. This proposal will cover the lacunae in the available policy.\nThe home department proposed that cash reward should be capped at Rs10m maximum and the cabinet approved it after discussion.\nThe cabinet was informed that due to floods in Sindh in July-August, 2022, many ongoing schemes were severely affected; therefore, Rs87 billion from the provincial annual development programme was diverted for relief and rehabilitation of flood-damaged infrastructure works.\nThe cabinet was told that the size of the ADP was revised from Rs332.16bn to Rs267.65bn as on March 31.\nMangrove projects\nForest Minister Taimur Talpur told the cabinet that the forest department was implementing two mangrove projects \u2014 Delta Blue Carbon-I (DBC-I) and Delta Blue Carbon-II (DBC-II) in the Indus Delta. \nHe added that under DBC-I about 3.1 MtCO2e had been sequestered and traded with the help of partners, whereas planting operations under DBC-II were approved in 2019 by the cabinet and had commenced from 2023.\nHe informed the cabinet that the climate change ministry had in 2021 announced the Revised Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) pledging that 15pc of the carbon credits generated in the country would be a voluntary contribution towards NDCs. In all about 240 MTCO2e annually constitute about 15pc.\nThe forest minister said that provincial government did not agree to this claim and objected through the letters, wherein, it was requested that the DBC-I and DBC-II project be implemented prior to the commitments made under NDCs as the corresponding adjustments which were less than one per cent of the pledged 240 MTCO2e from these projects thus, these may be exempted from contribution towards NDCs.\nOn the proposal of the forest minister, the cabinet decided to approach the federal ministry for climate change to exempt the carbon credits generated by both DBC-I and DBC-II projects from corresponding adjustments towards NDC till lifetime or at least till the year 2043 to fulfil the legal obligations.\n"

            "Text": "KARACHI: The students and teachers of the St. Joseph\u2019s Convent School were proud to be celebrating 160 years of this historic girls\u2019 school located in the always busy and congested area of Saddar. \nSindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah was the chief guest on the occasion, accompanied by Education Minister Syed Sardar Shah.\nSt. Joseph\u2019s Convent was founded in 1862 by the Daughters of the Cross of Liege, Belgium. Opening its doors for the Muslim girls, too, on the request of Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah soon after the partition of the subcontinent in 1947, the school has over the years seen countless young ladies getting admission here while still at the toddler stage to then also passed out with their heads held high.\nIt was and still is here that they made life-long friends, fast friends along with so many memories together. They learned how to behave as they brushed up on their social skills. They learned to give respect to their teachers and elders and also get respect in return along with attaining a fine education.\n\nMurad appreciates Christian community of Pakistan for providing quality services in the field of education\n\nOn the arrival of the guests, school Principal Sister Elizabeth Niamat, Provincial Superior Sister Angelina Francis, reverend sisters, reverend fathers, nuns from the Institute of the Daughters of the Cross of Liege, and school staff received them.\nSister Niamat shared a bit of history about the institution of learning. \u201cEducational pursuit has evolved here unabated,\u201d she said. \nSpeaking on the occasion, the chief minister said the Catholic education\u2019s philosophy revealed a concern for an education that combined sound knowledge and skills with overall personal development. Such an education involved a high level of interpersonal relationship between the teacher and student, he said.\n\u201cIt is something to be proud of that today we are commemorating 160 years of educational growth and services of the St. Joseph\u2019s Convent School,\u201d he said.\nMr Shah said his elder sister had received her education from St. Joseph\u2019s School while he was enrolled at the St. Patrick\u2019s Boys High School right the next door. He shared his memories of both, his sister\u2019s and his schooling, and how their father, late Syed Abdullah Shah, used to pick and drop them himself.\nHe also said that the school celebrating its 160 years brought up a golden milestone in the history of not only the St. Joseph\u2019s Convent School, but in the history of Pakistan. \u201cWe are duly indebted to the Christian community of Pakistan for providing quality service in the field of education,\u201d he said.\nA great thing about the St. Joseph\u2019s School was that it had evolved with the passage of time and had incorporated a syllabus that befitted the national curriculum, the CM said, adding that he had learned that the convent school was against bullying and corporal punishment. \u201cThe school believes in nurturing young minds through counselling and kindness. That\u2019s why excellent results are produced from here and we see students securing positions each year,\u201d he said.\nThe CM was also happy to know that St. Joseph\u2019s School welcomes back their alumni as teachers, too, and that most of their teachers had sustained themselves for more than three to four decades which made the students privileged to acquire the mentors of prestige.\nSpeaking on the occasion, Education Minister Sardar Shah said he was not as lucky as the CM to have received that kind of prestigious education. \u201cI received my early education at a school set up under a neem tree where my teacher Mohammad Malook Kumbhar took classes under the open skies,\u201d he recalled.\nHe said Catholic schools focused on holistic education of the child \u2014 socially, emotionally, spiritually, physically, and culturally. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is preparation for life, and a life of worth, not merely a life of work,\u201d he said. \nEarlier, the students of the school presented tableaus and a Sindhi cultural show in which they paid rich tributes to the Sufi saints of Sindh, former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, mystic singer Abida Parveen and women peasants working in the fields along with men.\nIn conclusion, the chief minister gave away shields to the present and retired principals of different branches of the school spread all over Pakistan.\n"

Khan, taken to Islamabad and then brought to Lahore and now he has been detained in Central Prison in Sukkur, he added.  \nThe counsel contended that it was a settled principle of law that multiple FIRs under the same offence against a person cannot be lodged and also against the principle of double jeopardy, but all the cases in question were registered against the former minister under the same charges while Section 123-A of the Pakistan Penal Code was the prerogative of the state and could not be invoked by the police or a private persons.\n"

            "Text": "HYDERABAD: Commencement of physical work for the rehabilitation of Akram Wah, the only off-taking lined channel of Kotri barrage, at a cost $75.92m may take more time to address its decades-long design problem that blocks full discharge into the channel. \nThese remedial measures would be undertaken under World Bank-funded Sindh Water and Agriculture Transformation (SWAT) project. The project has already started.\nAkram Wah is Kotri barrage\u2019s one of two perennial canals that feeds lower Sindh\u2019s Tando Mohammad Khan, Badin and considerably large part of Hyderabad division\u2019s rural districts with a command area of 0.487m acres. The 76.20-mile-long canal has 1,780 outlets to feed farmlands.\nWith the establishment of Sindh Irrigation and Drainage Authority (Sida), the lined channel was placed under its administrative authority besides a non-perennial new Phulelli canal. Rest of Kotri barrage\u2019s two canals are under irrigation department\u2019s domain. \nOriginally designed for 4,100 cusecs, the canal never lifted full discharge due to the design issue. Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) also lifts water for drinking wate supply to Hyderabad city that contributes to deficiency.\nSida feeds Akram Wah through New Phulelli canal\u2019s Alipur regulator to overcome this never-ending water deficiency. This creates a bad situation for new Phulelli as it has only six-month water as per its share from the barrage for paddy cultivation in Phulelli\u2019s command.\nRice cultivation allowed\nCultivation of rice crop in the left bank of Kotri barrage\u2019s command areas though it was otherwise banned in the left bank areas of Guddu and Sukkur barrages by Sindh government under a West Pakistan legislation.\nA damaging part of matter that pertains to Akram Wah\u2019s management is that despite deficient flows, this canal\u2019s water is used for irrigating lands of Sukkur barrage\u2019s left bank in Rohri canal\u2019s command. Water shortage aggravates during Kharif but influential growers cultivate rice in Akram Wah\u2019s command as well despite a ban on its cultivation. \n\u201cNew Phulelli canal\u2019s growers rightly raise a hue and cry arguing that their share of water is diverted to meet water needs of Akram Wah. But this is a situation that has to be managed technically to feed the areas in Akram Wah as well. But this issue will hopefully be finally settled through SWAT-related works once and for all,\u201d Sida managing director Pritam Das told Dawn.\nThe lined channel didn\u2019t carry its designed discharge since day one when it was built in 1955 and went into operation in 1958 after construction of Kotri barrage, the third one over Indus river. Situation always worsens when water shortage aggravates during peak Kharif season.\nAs the last barrage and at the tail-end of Indus river system, this barrage bears the brunt of most water shortage. Water shortage is expected once again this peak Kharif according to Indus River System Authority (Irsa) assessment of 37pc deficient flows in early Kharif in Sindh. This would matter for Akram Wah and new Phulelli canals while ensuring water availability with equity.\nAs part of Akram Wah\u2019s rehabilitation project Sida has lately disbursed Rs145m out of total cost of Rs555m allocation towards compensation against the demolition of houses built illegally along the banks of Akram Wah. \nCompensation to encroachers\nAccording to a senior Sindh irrigation officer, by paying compensation to encroachers a precedent has been set by Sida. \u201cNowhere in Sindh such compensation is given as anti-encroachment drive covers all irrigation canals and infrastructure under Sindh High Court\u2019s orders. It is wrong,\u201d said the official.\nThe Sida MD claimed that compensation payment was a condition put up by WB and that was met. Sindh government had separately approved it in the project cost-I (PC-I). \nRegarding the proposed work on Akram Wah, Mr Prittam Das said: \u201cWe will be going for vetting of the proposed design of Akram Wah through another consultant as well before the work gets underway.\u201d\nIt was learnt that a private consultant firm\u2019s team recently visited Akram Wah to verify resettlement plan. \u201cIt is for the first time that such a cost is paid for resettlement. Those who had occupied areas of canals\u2019 embankment have been disposed and they are told that they can\u2019t digress certain point near the canal while resettling,\u201d said an observer.\nUnder WB\u2019s loan for SWAT project, Akram Wah\u2019s works include removal of damaged lined panels of canal from RD-0 to RD-193.8 as the debris blocks the flow regime of the channel. Retaining walls would be built at vulnerable sections of the canal where it passes through Hyderabad city. Four cross regulators would be replaced, besides some bridges that are constraint to flow.\nAccording to irrigation officials, humps that have been built in the channel may be removed to improve flow regime. \u201cThese humps were built to control behaviour of steep gradients of the canal. But Sida intends to rehabilitate the entire canal through this loan,\u201d he observed.\n"

The blockade continued for three hours until Gambat ASP Noman Zafar, through negotiations, persuaded them to disperse peacefully at around sunset. He also got Dr Khokhar released.\n"

            "Text": "LAHORE: The Punjab food department has suspended the official wheat quota of all 1,100 flour mills in the province as prices of grain in the open market begin to rise though the new wheat crop has hit the market. \nAs per convention the food department has suspended release of official wheat to flour mills in the province with the beginning of harvesting of the new crop. \nHowever, flour millers claim that deputy commissioners are not issuing them permits for transporting the wheat to their factories they are purchasing from the farmers or open market. \nPunjab chapter chairman of the Pakistan Flour Millers Association (PFMA) Chaudhry Iftikhar Mattoo sees flour crisis round the corner as wheat stocks with most of the mills have exhausted and those still grinding wheat don\u2019t have enough supplies to keep their units functional beyond 72 hours. \nHe tells Dawn that the ban on flour millers to purchase wheat from the open market is giving the negative impression that the province has not produced enough grain this year. This impression, he says, will lead to panic buying and encourage unofficial private players to hoard the crop on one pretext or the other and the grain to be bought by the mills will go to private and undeclared storages creating a shortage in the market. \n\nMillers say ban on private purchase likely to trigger hoarding\n\nMr Mattoo warns that the hoarders will mint money at the cost of flour consumers as mills forced to buy wheat at higher rates from the black market will pass on this hike to the general consumers. \nPunjab mills usually procure around two million tonnes of wheat every year. \nHe says if the government wishes to document all the sale and purchase of wheat crop then it should issue permits to registered market players otherwise the grain purchased by unregistered private parties will remain unaccounted for and thus puzzling the authorities about the actual size of crop and making them to go for wheat imports to cover the \u201capparent\u201d demand and supply gap. \nThe food department has unofficially revised its wheat procurement target for the ongoing campaign from 3.8m tonnes to 4.2m tonnes for the year. So far it has procured 1.88m tonnes of grain. It has distributed gunny bags among over 58,082 farmers. \nThe department was to buy 3.5m tonnes wheat but as much of the stock from the previous stocks was exhausted due to the free flour scheme this Ramazan, it enhanced its target to 3.8m tonnes and then to 4.2m tonnes for maintaining its carryover stocks.\n"

The institute will also provide training to the staff of Civil Aviation Authority, Rescue 1122 and other related departments about the disease.  \nThe IPH dean said arrangements have been completed in all the hospitals for the treatment of expected patients and isolation wards are also functional as per the instructions of the government.  \nHowever, she said, people should not get panicked, take precautions, avoid going in crowded places and make sure to use face mask and wash hands with soap to avoid spreading the virus.\nProf Tahir asked the management of all hospitals that if any suspected case is reported, it should be brought to the notice of the higher authorities without delay so that timely case management could be ensured.  \nMeanwhile, the Punjab Healthcare Commission directed all the private healthcare establishments to refer suspected cases of mpox to the selected/identified public sector hospitals instead of admitting such patients to their respective institutes.  \nThey have also been instructed to make sure that on the identification of such cases, they will immediately refer less than 15-year-old patients to the Children\u2019s Hospital and above 15 years to the Lahore General Hospital.  \nIt merits mentioning that the PHC had already shared comprehensive definitions of suspected, probable and confirmed cases of mpox.\n"

He said on March 18, a field staff member of the department during his visit to Malh had found some children who missed the measles campaign.  \n\nHealth CEO says affected children were found malnourished \n\nLater, the CEO said he sent a health team to the locality which completed the measles vaccination among the [missed] children. Then the samples of all the children were dispatched to National Institute of Health (NIH), Islamabad, which confirmed measles positive in two kids.  \nDr Wazir said: \u201cAn initial investigation report is being prepared by the authorities and it would be released soon.\u201d  \nHe said Ayesha (1), Shahnaz (2), Salam (4), Anjum (4) and Kalsoom Bibi (8) were among those who died.  \nThe CEO said all the affected children were found malnourished and the health authority established a medical camp for proper food and medicines.  \nDr Wazir said the actual figure of the under-treatment children would be provided soon. He said the initial reasons for outbreak were poor health and hygiene, mud houses with dense population and maximum open defecation.  \nHe said the Liaquatpur assistant commissioner was requested for the provision of potable water to the affected families because sewage was mixing in the drinking water.  \nWhen Liaquatpur AC Sarmad Ali Bhagat was contacted, he did not reply to the call of this correspondent.\n"

            "Text": "LAHORE: The overall unemployment rate in Punjab has reached 6.9pc with the highest rate of unemployment by age-group found amongst the youth (aged 15-29) at 10.9pc and the female youth with Master\u2019s degree make up over 23pc of all unemployed female youth. \nAccording to a research conducted by Gallup Pakistan and PRIDE (Policy Research, Innovation, Development & Education), using data from the Labour Force Survey-2020-21, among all the divisions of Punjab, Rawalpindi has the highest youth unemployment rate is a little more than 17pc.  \n\u201cWith the unemployment rate of females being substantially higher than males (8.32pc vs. 6.06pc) and that of urban residents being relatively higher than the rate of their rural counterparts (7.94pc vs 6.11pc).  \nThe analysis of division-wise youth unemployment rate varies from as low as 4.45pc for Bahawalpur division to as high as 17.78pc for Rawalpindi division,\u201d reads the report.  \n\nUnemployment rate reached 7pc by 2021; Punjab\u2019s youth population equivalent to entire population of Canada\n\nThe distribution of unemployed youth by level of education indicates that the youth having education level of \u2018Matric but below Intermediate\u2019, make up the highest proportion of the unemployed youth at 20.01pc while the youth having \u2018less than one year of education\u2019 comprises the lowest share of unemployed youth at 0.39pc. What\u2019s surprising is that 23.52pc of unemployed female youth in Punjab have a Master\u2019s level degree. This share is over seven times higher than the corresponding share of the unemployed male youth (around 3pc of unemployed males have a Master\u2019s degree). \nThe research analysis shows that the Lahore division has the highest population (20.7m) in the whole province whereas the Sahiwal division has the lowest population (7.9m). Gujranwala division has the highest rural population of 10.9m and the Lahore division has the highest urban population of 14.4m in Punjab.  \nThe analysis shows that in Punjab alone, there are 31m youngsters aged 18-29 and the youth population of Punjab alone is equivalent to the entire population size of Canada. \nYouth unemployment refers to the number of youth (15-29 years old) population that is economically active but currently without work and searching for employment. This measure does not include the people such as full-time students or those who are not looking for work, i.e., those considered economically inactive individuals. This indicator serves as a measure of potential youth labour market entrants that remain under-utilized.  \n\u201cThe study\u2019s most alarming finding is that a higher share of educated youth are unemployed compared to their lesser educated counterparts. Education, if seen to be not delivering dividends, would lead to people dropping off from the education stream and the vast pool of educated urban youth could also cause social issues (if not already causing ones),\u201d Bilal Gilani, executive director at Gallup Pakistan, said. \nDr Lubna Shahnaz, the chief executive officer at PRIDE, said: \u2018Labour force statistics usually available at national or provincial level do not adequately capture the labour market dynamics across different regions even within a particular province. More disaggregated statistics at divisional level would enable a more in-depth examination of the labour market situation and facilitate in the development of relevant policies and programs at a grass roots level\u201d.  \nThe current series of reports would be looking at the Labour Force Survey 2020-21, which is a large-scale survey, covering close to 100,000 households, conducted by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS).\n"

He said tangible evidence was available to prove the offence against the former chief minister.\nJudge Ali Raza extended the bail of Elahi till Friday (today) and directed the ACE lawyer to complete his arguments.\nTalking to the media, Parvez Elahi said his decision to join the PTI was right. He accused the PML-N of doing politics of vendetta and victimisation.

            "Text": "LAHORE: The medical and public health experts say almost 90 to 99 per cent of people recover from mpox by themselves and the use of simple antipyretics or painkillers is enough.  \nAccording to them, the disease is self-limiting and people should not panic unnecessarily. The virus can settle on fomites including used clothes, towels or even can stay on electronic equipment or other physical items contaminated with the mpox virus, therefore isolation is mandatory if the disease is diagnosed. \nThese views were expressed by General Cadre Doctor Association President Dr Masood Akhtar Sheikh and other senior medics while addressing a seminar in City Hospital. \nDr Sheikh said mpox can spread from person to person or occasionally from animal to person.  \nTalking about its symptomatology, Dr Munir Ghauri said initially, the patient has a fever, headache, back pain and muscle pain, after which the lymph nodes of the body become swollen. He said a rash may appear on the face, palms, soles of the feet, or specific parts of the body that lasts for two to three weeks. The rash gradually turns into watery blisters that eventually dry out.  \nDr Muhammad Shahbaz said until the watery blisters fall off and dry, this disease can be transmitted from one person to another. Symptoms may worsen in newborns, young children and immunocompromised individuals. If precautions are not taken, pneumonia and eye problems are seen.\nDr Ghulam Farid said touching watery blisters or any such part where these blisters are present can cause the disease to be transmitted. As long as there is no water in the blisters or new skin comes or there is inflammation and blisters in the eyes or any part of the body, then the disease can be transmitted from one to another.\n"

It sought details of gifts from Mr Khan, including wristwatches and a mobile phone, presented to him by various foreign dignitaries. The bureau also sought details of jewellery sets presented to his wife, including a Rolex watch, a gold and diamond locket presented by the emir of Qatar and two necklace sets gifted by the Saudi crown prince on Sept 2020 and May 2021, respectively.\n"

A deputy public prosecutor was also present in the courtroom,\n\nRecord shows no offence committed by suspect, court rules\n\nThe lawyers contended that their client was innocent, terming the blasphemy charge against him false.\nThe Joint Investigation Team, which was set up to probe the matter, placed records of statements made by the accusers and the Chinese national before the court.\nNaseeruddin, the SHO of Kamila police station and main complainant in the case, appeared in court with records.\nThe judge ruled in his order that three labourers \u2014  Gulistan, Shafi, Qadir \u2014 and their interpreter Yasir, had lodged the FIR on April 17, two days after the alleged incident on April 15.\nHe observed that the three were neither able to produce evidence in support of their accusations in the court, nor could they prove charges in their statements before the JIT.\nThe judge, said in his order that Yasir, the interpreter, was 35-40 feet away from the Chinese national, simply assuming that the former had uttered sacrilegious remarks.\n\u201cSection 295-C of PPC says whoever by words, either spoken or written, or by visible representation or by any imputation or innuendo or insinuation, directly or indirectly defiles the sacred name of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) shall be punished with death or imprisonment for life and shall also be liable to be fined in light of the available record,\u201d the judge quoted from the section pertaining to blasphemy.\nHe further ruled that the case did not come within the ambit of \u201creasonable ground\u201d as the blasphemy charge was the \u201cresult of a misunderstanding\u201d and that the police station concerned in Kohistan had registered a \u201cfalse case\u201d against the Chinese national.\nThe court ruled that according to record, no such offence was committed by the accused and hence he was granted bail.\nMaulana Waliullah Tohidi, a member of Ulema Jirga constituted by clerics after the alleged incident, said the release of the Chinese national was a judicial matter and \u201cwe accept it wholeheartedly\u201d.\nHe said, however, that Yasir the interpreter should be put on trial for \u201cinstigating the people of Kohistan to take to the streets\u201d. \u201cWe (Kohistanis) are patriotic Pakistani and will never allow anybody within the country, or outside, to sabotage the Dasu project at any cost,\u201d the Maulana added.\n"

Reports of numerous cable operators providing pirated content were also prevalent, the report noted.\nPakistan\u2019s establishment of IP Tribunals in three cities in 2016 was a welcome development, but plans to create new tribunals in other cities have not moved forward.\nMoreover, litigants with experience in these tribunals have raised concerns over the lack of capacity, inconsistency of rulings, nominal fines, a general lack of expertise among tribunal judges, and confusion over standards by which courts review tribunal decisions, according to the report.\nThe US expressed concern over the proliferation of counterfeit pharmaceuticals manufactured, sold and distributed by numerous trading partners.\nThe report said Pakistan has not provided criminal enforcement authorities with the power to take action against counterfeit goods. While optical disc piracy continues in many countries, including China, India, Mexico, and Pakistan, online piracy is the most challenging copyright enforcement issue in many foreign markets.\nA 2019 report, titled \u2018Impacts of Digital Video Piracy on the US Economy\u2019, estimated that global online video piracy costs the US economy at least $29.2 billion and as much as $71 billion in lost revenue each year.\nDelays in obtaining registrations present a significant obstacle to protecting IP rights in foreign markets, with stakeholders identifying Iraq, Pakistan, and South Africa as countries with extreme delays in processing trademark applications.\n"

He said that weakening parliament was meant an insult to the entire nation. \nHe added that his party believed in the supremacy of parliament and the rule of law.\n\u201cInterference in the jurisdiction of parliament is unconstitutional and illegal. PPP leadership has rendered sacrifices for the supremacy of parliament,\u201d he said.\nHe alleged that PTI chief Imran Khan wanted to create political chaos in the country but the government would not let him do so. \nHe demanded probe into the billion tree tsunami project, Malam Jabba land allotment scam and demanded of National Accountability Bureau to take action against all those involved in the mega corruption cases.\n"

            "Text": "PESHAWAR: Journalists and social media activists staged a protest in Bannu on Thursday against the failure of police to register an FIR and arrest the suspects involved in alleged kidnapping and torturing of journalist Gohar Wazir over a week ago.\nHe filed a written complaint with Bannu City police station after he was set free by the captors and he received medical treatment at a local hospital on April 21. However, the complaint has not been converted into proper FIR so far.\nGohar Wazir, who is president of National Press Club Bannu and works with a Pashto private television channel, has claimed that he was given electric shocks by his captors during a round 30-hour illegal confinement at an unspecified location.\nThe protesters included local journalists and social media persons, who were holding placards and banners inscribed with different slogans and demands. They passed through different bazaars and said that the culprits should be arrested at the earliest.\n\nProtesters demand arrest of culprits at earliest\n\nMr Wazir suspects involvement of some militants, believed to be pro-government in the area, in his kidnapping.\n\u201cThey were asking me to record a video statement wherein I should be praising them for working for peace and development of the country,\u201d he told Dawn.\nHe said when he declined to accept their demand, he was given electric shocks by them and finally when the pain became unbearable he had to record a video of their choice.\nThe issue of his kidnapping was also raised by different human rights and media rights organisations including Human Rights Commission of Pakistan.\nMember of National Assembly Mohsin Dawar had also voiced concern over his abduction and torture and demanded arrest of the culprits.\nMr Wazir, who is known for raising local issues through media, especially militancy, provision of natural gas to the people, in his complaint claimed that he had gone to the market for Eid shopping on April 19 where two suspected persons approached him.\nHe stated that they told him that he had to accompany them to their Markaz (centre). He added when he told them that he would visit their place two days later, they insisted that he should accompany them to a car where their three other accomplices were present.\nHe claimed that he was forcibly taken away in the car by those unidentified persons to an unspecific place where he was handcuffed and locked in a bathroom. He said that after around 30 hours, he was taken out of the bathroom and severely tortured.\nMr Wazir claimed that later on, he was taken out blindfolded and left somewhere. He said that he was asked to open his eyes after 10 minutes. He then boarded a passenger coach and reached Bannu. He has charged five unidentified persons for his kidnapping.\nOfficials at the relevant police station said that they were probing the matter from different dimensions and also trying to get any CCTV footage, if available.\nMr Wazir told Dawn that certain quarters were averse to his reporting of different issues including the peace marches, the alleged resettlement of militants and the famous sit-in staged in Janikhel.\n"

He sought directives of court for the respondents including the federal and provincial government to stop the process of \u201csettling back of terrorists\u201d in his homeland.\nThe petition is filed through advocates Babar Khan Yousafzai and Khizar Hayat Khazana.\n\nAimal Wali says he is on hit list of terrorists for his political stance\n\nThe respondents in the petition are President of Pakistan, former prime minister and chairman of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Imran Khan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government through its chief secretary, former chief minister Mahmood Khan, former special assistant to chief minister Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif, former director general of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) retired Lt Gen Faiz Hameed and federal government through interior minister.\nThe petitioner claimed that due to his political stance for the betterment, harmony and peace for the people of the country, he was on the hit list of terrorist organisations. He claimed that in that regard, two would-be suicide attackers belonging to Mohmand and Bajaur districts were arrested.\nThe petitioner stated that as a consequence to strong stance by the ancestors of ANP regarding eradication of terrorism, the party sacrificed thousands of political workers. He added that army and police, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, played a vital role in restoring peace at the cost of their lives.\nHe claimed that constant statements kept coming from the office of the then prime minister Imran Khan and Barrister Saif regarding the resettlement of trained militants from Afghanistan into Pakistan.\nHe said that he along with his party leadership and workers had constantly opposed the policy related to relocation of terrorists into Pakistani territory. He claimed that the President of Pakistan had also confirmed his involvement in granting immunity to 102 terrorists and that fact was also reported in the media.\nSimilarly, the \u201cprocess of relocation of militants\u201d was not possible without the support of the former chief of ISI, he said.\nThe petitioner has also annexed several press reports along with the petition related to peace talks between the government and the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and the release of some hardcore militants from custody by the security agencies during those negotiations.\n"

The people typically at higher risk include pregnant women, children and immune-compromised persons.\nThe most common symptoms of Mpox include fever, headache, muscle aches, back pain, low energy and swollen lymph nodes, followed or accompanied by the development of a rash, which may last for two to three weeks. The rash can affect the face, palms of hands, soles of feet, groin, genital and or anal regions.\nAbout protection from the virus, Prof Zia said that risk of catching Mpox from other people could be reduced by limiting close contact with the people, who had suspected or confirmed Mpox and staying informed about the disease in the relevant area or social group.\n\u201cHave open conversations with those you come into close contact (especially sexual contact) with about any symptoms you or they may have. Clean your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub,\u201d he said.\nProf Zia advised people to frequently clean and disinfect the commonly touched surfaces in the environments that could have been contaminated with the virus from an infectious person. Common household disinfectants or bleach products are enough to kill the virus.\n\u201cVaccination can help to prevent infection for people at risk. Vaccine for Mpox is available but in short supply,\u201d said Prof Zia.\nIn May 2022, an international outbreak of Mpox was reported. In July last year, the World Health Organisation declared the global Mpox outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. In Pakistan two confirmed cases have been reported a few days ago.\nPublic Health Reference Laboratory (PHRL) in KMU has been working with the National Institute of Health Islamabad since 2017. It has conducted 1.7 million surveillance tests for Covid-19, typhoid, cholera, dengue fever, Congo fever, chikungunya, hepatitis and influenza.\n\u201cThe PHRL is struggling with finances. As per the initial memorandum of understanding signed with the health department, the responsibility of providing finances to the laboratory lies with the department. However, so far any structured financial provision has not been made. It is imperative that a sustainable funding model should be developed for current and future outbreaks,\u201d said Prof Zia.\nIn his message for people about the outbreak of Mpox , he said that there was no need to panic.\n"

            "Text": "PAKISTAN are known for their uniquely flamboyant brand of white-ball cricket. They have top-shelf products like Babar Azam, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Fakhar Zaman and Mohammad Rizwan. Yet their fluidity in top-level limited-overs international cricket is getting more and more obvious.\nThe way Mark Chapman changed gears and made Pakistan completely helpless during the second half of the New Zealand innings in the decisive fifth T20 International at Rawalpindi the other day must have come as an eye-opener for the team\u2019s think-tank.\nConceding a loss at home after posting a healthy 193-5 indeed came as a shock and that too to a second-string New Zealand. Without taking anything away from Chapman\u2019s masterclass, one strongly feels the green-shirts in all probability should have bagged the game after restricting the opponents to 73-4 in around 10 overs.\nDefeat in a key match evokes a lot of retrospection by the losing side. But will it actually manifest on the ground?\nInterestingly, Rawalpindi was not the first loss in a crucial white-ball match suffered by Pakistan in recent times.\nPakistan, after remaining unbeaten in the 2021 T20 World Cup group stage, lost the semi-final to Australia in Dubai. Babar and his men then suffered a 23-run loss at the hands of a rejuvenated Sri Lankan side in the 2022 T20 Asia Cup final, also staged in Dubai, in September. A month later, there was another heartbreak for the green-shirts who experienced a 67-run rout by England in the series-deciding seventh T20 in Lahore. The Moeen Ali-captained England, despite missing playmakers like Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler, proved too much for Pakistan to handle in their own backyard.\nThen came the all-important 2022 T20 World Cup decider, staged at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, in November. Pakistan, who had just sneaked into the semi-finals after a dismal show in the group stage, thrashed New Zealand by seven wickets in Sydney, but wilted under intense pressure against their well-oiled English rivals.\nAs regards ODIs, one can recall that a largely inexperienced yet solid Glenn Phillips, batting at number seven for New Zealand, tore apart Pakistan bowling with a 42-ball 63 not out in the series-deciding third match in Karachi last January. And though Babar-led Pakistan last year recorded home ODI series wins over Australia and West Indies and swept the Netherlands 3-0 in Rotterdam, losing the series 2-1 to a top-class side like New Zealand after winning the opener was indeed puzzling.\nA striking common factor in all the aforementioned white-ball matches is that except for the 2022 T20 World Cup final in Melbourne, all the other games were staged either in Pakistan or Dubai, a UAE venue where the conditions predominantly suit green-shirts.\nThis makes Pakistan\u2019s white-ball quandary even more complex.\nRizwan and Babar are second and third, respectively, on the ICC T20 batsmen\u2019s rankings while Shaheen is fifth in the bowlers list. Other players like Fakhar, Haris Rauf, Shadab Khan, Naseem Shah, Imad Wasim and Imam-ul-Haq (third in ODI batsmen\u2019s rankings) are highly talented and can upset the opponents on any given day.\nBut what is the net advantage if these players fail to produce match-winning shows in key white-ball international games?\nGiving impressive performance in routine competitions is fine, no doubt, but a team to become world-beaters are naturally expected to lift their game in big contests. Something Pakistan must ponder.\nPlayers\u2019 technical flaws, lack of mental toughness, wrong playing XI or weak leadership\u2026 whatever maybe the reasons for Pakistan\u2019s below-par shows in high-profile outings, their think-tank must sort things out sooner than later so that the problems are identified, analysed, worked upon and resolved for long-term benefit of the team.  \nThe country\u2019s dip in big games has mostly been witnessed in T20 Inter\u00adna\u00adtionals. If not addressed in time, one fears this brittleness may permeate into ODIs.\nConsidering this year\u2019s 50-over World Cup is going to be held in India where the conditions will be close to what prevail in Pakistan which will stage the Asia Cup in September, the player support staff led by recently-appointed team director Mickey Arthur in conjunction with his coaching team and the captain are duly expected to make a critical and comprehensive analysis so that the team is battle ready for cut-throat situations at the continental and global events and beyond.\nA timely and genuine fix in this connection will not only put Pakistan cricket back on track but will also enable our teams to earn victories on major occasions.\n"

Soon after Fakhar\u2019s hit, Imam launched Ish Sodhi down the ground for a towering six but fell on the next ball when the New Zealand spinner trapped him lbw for 60.\nIn came skipper Babar Azam and he soon had the fervent home crowd back on its feet with a four through mid-wicket off Rachin Ravindra and following it with a six down long-on off Sodhi.\nThe day, though, belonged to Fakhar and the left-hander slammed his ninth ODI hundred, hitting 13 fours and a six before being dismissed on 117 and ultimately setting up a comfortable five-wicket victory for Pakistan.\nPakistan had earlier prevented New Zealand from accelerating in the death overs despite Mitchell\u2019s career-best 113 and Will Young\u2019s blistering 86, restricting them to 288-7. The Black Caps couldn\u2019t do that for a sustained period and although they did hit back from time to time, Pakistan ultimately had too much in the tank.\nMost importantly, they had Fakhar who gave nothing away and pounced severely on anything loose. Fakhar raised his century off 99 deliveries before Adam Milne picked up two wickets in two overs. Babar, whose 49 off 46 deliveries featured three fours and a six, was caught behind and Shan Masood gave a simple catch at cover.\nFrom 214-1, Pakistan had slipped to 217-3 but Fakhar released the pressure by hitting Sodhi for consecutive fours in the next over before lashing Milne to the mid-wicket fence. Mohammad Rizwan took no time to settle and kept the runs coming.\n \n\nNEW ZEALAND batter Daryl Mitchell celebrates after scoring the century against Pakistan on Thursday.\u2014White Star\n\nFakhar\u2019s 114-ball knock ended when he skied Ravindra to mid-on but Rizwan took Pakistan home with nine balls to spare, hitting a six and six fours in an unbeaten 42 off 34.\nOpener Young had set up the New Zealand innings after they had been sent into bat, hitting spinners Mohammad Nawaz and Agha Salman for sixes as well as stroking eight boundaries during his 78-ball knock.\nAfter his opening partner Chad Bowes (18) was caught behind off Haris Rauf (2-65) in the 10th over, Young put up a 102-run partnership with Mitchell for the second wicket. Mitchell made a sedate start with Young being the aggressor until he holed off-spinner Shadab Khan to long-off.\nHaving been dropped on the return by Salman on 23, Mitchell reached his half-century off 60 deliveries and provided the majority of the runs in a 72-run stand with his skipper Tom Latham (20).\nLatham was trapped lbw by Shaheen Shah Afridi (2-63) with Mitchell reaching his second ODI century soon after with a four crunched past Pakistan\u2019s pace spearhead.\nMark Chapman, whose blistering century saw New Zealand square the five-game Twenty20 International series earlier this week, was cleaned up for 15 by pacer Haris as the Black Caps failed to build on the momentum in the last 10 overs.\nThey scored just 66 with Shaheen ending Mitchell\u2019s 115-ball knock when he had the right-hander caught by Fakhar at deep mid-wicket.\nMitchell bettered his previous best of 100 not out against Bangladesh in 2021 and hit 11 fours and a six during his impressive ton.\nHenry Nicolls was unbeaten on 20 in the end with Naseem Shah (2-29), the most impressive of the Pakistan pacers, getting his reward at long last on the last two balls of the innings when he got Ravindra caught at long-on and then dismantled the stumps of Adam Milne.\nNew Zealand had a score to bowl at but the solid opening stand of 124 between Fakhar and Imam soon had them on the backfoot. They did get Imam, who unsuccessfully reviewed his dismissal after hitting five fours and that six in his 65-ball knock, and then Babar, Shan, Fakhar and Salman but it wasn\u2019t enough.\nSCOREBOARD\nNEW ZEALAND:\nW.

I reiterate that this visit is taking place in the context of SCO and any other noise that accompanies the visit of the foreign minister must be ignored, because that\u2019s just noise and it has no bearing on the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and its proceedings,\u201d she added. \nMs Baloch said that such negative statements and negative developments cannot dissuade Pakistan from playing its part in an organisation of which it was an equal member and to which Pakistan was strongly committed. \n\u201cWe hope that all members of SCO would see the positive spirit with which Pakistan is participating in this meeting,\u201d she said.\nAnswering another question about chances of good relations between Pakistan and India, she said Pakistan has had a consistent position, adding that Pakistan wishes to have peace in the region and it would like to have peace and amity with all its neighbours, including India. \nShe said that Pakistan believed that following the events of 2019 and India\u2019s belligerent posture in the region the situation for peace and dialogue had been compromised.\n\u201cWe now expect India to take steps to create an environment which facilitates peace and dialogue, including on outstanding disputes, especially the core dispute of Jammu and Kashmir,\u201d she said. \nAbout the army chief\u2019s visit to China, she said that this was an important visit and it will contribute to further strengthening of decades-old, robust defence ties between Pakistan and China.\nIn reply to a question, she said that both Saudi Arabia and Iran were important partners and friends of Pakistan and Pakistan was very encouraged with the dialogue that was taking place between them. \n\u201cNow that the two countries have established a direct contact, we encourage them to continue to engage with each other for further normalisation of bilateral relations and for the regional peace and stability,\u201d she noted.\nAbout reports accusing Pakistan of supplying ammunition to Ukraine, she reiterated that Pakistan maintains a policy of strict neutrality in the dispute between Ukraine and Russia and in that context does not provide any ammunition to them. She, however, pointed out that in the past, Pakistan had strong defence ties with Ukraine.\nShe said that Pakistan\u2019s defence exports were always accompanied with strict end-user requirements and hoped that those requirements would be fully respected by recipients.\n"

To work out an operation plan during the extended days, he said, the bureau would hold a meeting with chief secretaries on Saturday (today).\n\u201cWe will present the request of the political parties in a meeting of census monitoring committee,\u201d he added.\nNeed for the extension was felt after it emerged during the exercise that Karachi and Lahore populations showed little increase since the 2017 census.\n\nPBS asks political parties to identify areas not covered by enumeration teams\n\nThe PBS at the briefing requested political parties to identify the areas that had not been covered by census teams.\nMr Sarwar said the bureau would need another 15 days to finalise data before submitting it to the Council of Common Interests (CCI) by June.\nAn official announcement issued after the meeting showed that 237.448 million individuals had been counted in all the four provinces, an increase of 29.768 million since 2017 when the tally was 207.68m.\nSo far, 54.138m people have been counted in Sindh, 116.442m in Punjab, 39.315m in KP and 19.713m in Balochistan.\nMeanwhile, a joint meeting of Balochistan lawmakers and representatives of political parties from Quetta discussed the process of census in Quetta and its preliminary results.\nThe participants demanded that the census be conducted again in the provincial capital and the exercise should be extended for two months.\nThey said that census results had shown that Balochistan\u2019s population had increased by more than seven million while that of Quetta had decreased by 500,000, which they claimed was part of a plan.\nSaleem Shahid in Quetta also contributed to this report\n"

On Friday, Mr Khan said he knew much more than what Mr Mir said.\n\u201cSince this matter is related to national security, I don\u2019t want to say anything that would become news for international media as it would be detrimental to Pakistan,\u201d he said while responding to a question after attending a hearing on his bail petition at the Islamabad High Court.\nPTI\u2019s senior vice president Dr Shireen Mazari also called the ISPR\u2019s clarification \u201creassuring\u201d but added that the ex-army chief\u2019s remarks were not taken out of context as he had repeatedly made similar claims on many occasions. She demanded that Gen Bajwa be held accountable for his remarks.\n"

Owing to delays, the industry had taken the matter to the courts. Through negotiations, the two sides reached an agreement that was approved by the ECC to ensure the continuous availability of drugs in the market.\nUnder the agreement, the ECC, as a one-time dispensation, allowed manufacturers and importers to increase their existing MRPs of essential drugs equal to 70pc increase in CPI (with a cap of 14pc) and MRPs of all other drugs and lower priced drugs an increase upto 70pc in CPI (with a cap of 20pc) based on average CPI for current year i.e July 1 to April 1 with condition that it should be considered as an annual increase for the financial year 2023-24 and no increase under this category will be granted in next financial year.\nThe ECC further advised the Policy Board of DRAP to review the situation after three months i.e. in July and make its recommendations to the federal government regarding price decrease if the rupee appreciates.\nRoosevelt Hotel\nThe ECC was informed that while the Aviation Division and Pakistan International Airline-Investment Ltd (PIA-IL) were working on a business plan under directives of the government for re-opening of Manhattan\u2019s prime property through renovation and severance cost with the hotel\u2019s worker union, the New York City offered to utilise the building\u2019s 1,025 rooms for three years to house immigrants at the rate of $200 per day for 36 months.\nThe offer envisaged a 14-month guaranteed period along with a four-month termination notice period (minimum of 18 months). The contract is to commence on May 15 and entails a per-night rent of $200 for the first year, $205 for the second year and $210 for the third year. New York City will cover the taxes etc and make a payment of $1.74m monthly rent on the first of each month in advance.\nThe meeting was informed that this would help the payment of dues to the staff union which was cooperating with the deal settlement and provide a three-year net cash flow of $18.8m to the PIA-IL at the rate of $7.4m in the first year, $5.3m in the second year and $6.1m in the third year. \nPIA-IL has to hand over about 500 rooms to New York City immediately i.e. on the commencement of the contract on May 15, followed by 400 more rooms within 30 days and the remaining 125 rooms later. This required $1.145m for re-opening works and was already available with PIA-IL as a government grant.\nThe meeting was also informed that two other options under the business plan envisaged a three-year carrying cost of about $160m on \u2018as is where is\u2019 basis or $132m of financial obligations in case of gradual renovation and revival of the hotel business.\nThe ECC after discussion approved the recommendations of the Ministry of Aviation and approved the formation of a four-member negotiating committee led by the Secretary Aviation Division to negotiate with the New York City Government and the hotel union. \nThe ECC also allowed PIA-IL/RHC (Roosevelt Hotel Co) to utilise the funds of $ 1.145m from the available balance as bridge financing to commence the re-opening work at the hotel.\nWheat procurement\nThe ECC also approved Rs1.164tr CCL for procurement of about five million tonnes of wheat by the provinces who would bear themselves incidental charges to retain wheat crop 2023-24 at the rate of Rs918 per 40kg.\nThis includes the procurement of 1.4m tonnes of wheat by the Sindh government at the rate of Rs4,000 per 40 kg involving CCL of Rs214bn -\u2013 Rs140bn for the purchase of wheat and Rs74bn to be utilised on the bank\u2019s borrowing charges.\nLikewise, the Punjab government would procure 3.5m tonnes of wheat at the rate of Rs3,900 per 40kg involving CCL of Rs950bn \u2013 Rs343.5bn for the purchase of local wheat and the remaining Rs607bn on account of borrowing charges and cushion amount. The Balochistan government would procure 100,000 tonnes of wheat at the rate of Rs3,900 per 40 kg but did not seek CCL.\nThe ECC also approved Rs35m additional funds to the Ministry of Interior for the establishment of Passport Processing Centres at the Tehsil level in 30 administrative units throughout the country. Another Rs450m for the operational requirements of ICT police for its liabilities and training of fresh recruits.\n"

The drag on earnings on the annual basis was primarily because of a decline in net interest income and higher operating expenditure, according to the brokerage.\nFaysal Bank Ltd reported its bottom line remained Rs3.3bn for the January-March quarter, up 50pc from a year ago but down 9pc from the preceding quarter.\nK-Electric Ltd posted a net loss of Rs12.3bn for January-March, up 6.7 times from the quarterly loss of Rs1.8bn recorded in the same three-month period a year ago.\nHonda, Toyota extend plant shutdowns\nHonda Atlas Cars Ltd (HACL) and Indus Motor Company (IMC) have further extended their plant shutdowns due to a shortage of imported parts and accessories.\nIn a stock filing on Friday, Honda Atlas said it would keep its plant shut from May 1-15 due to supply chain issues caused by restrictions on opening letters of credit for the import of completely knocked kits, raw materials and halting foreign exchange payments. \nProduction activities in HACL remained suspended from April 16-30.\nIMC in its stock filing also cited the same reasons for keeping production activities suspended from May 2-3. The company said it is unable to continue its production activities due to insufficient inventory levels of imported parts.\nThe production plant of IMC was completely shut from March 24-27. From August 2022 to date, Toyota vehicles\u2019 assembling plant remained inoperative for 60 days.\n"

Mr Qureshi confirmed that both sides had tabled their proposals and said that PTI\u2019s suggestions are \u201creasonable, implementable and within the constitutional bounds\u201d.\n\u201cWe have taken a break so that we may talk to our leadership and they discuss it with their coalition partners. We have agreed to meet again on Tuesday at 11am,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI, Fawad Chaudhry and Ali Zafar will go to Lahore tomorrow and take Imran Khan into confidence on today\u2019s progress,\u201d he said, adding that talks on Tuesday would be held in the light of this development.\n\u201cThreat to dialogue\u201d\nMr Chaudhry criticised the detention of PTI leader Ali Amin Gandapur and \u201carrest of 33 supporters of Imran Khan\u201d outside the Islamabad High Court earlier in the day, saying such actions would \u201cdestroy the process of dialogue\u201d.\nHe said ministers had maintained that they had no involvement in these arrests. \u201cThen whoever is doing this, it is akin to ruining the talks, and the responsibility falls on the government in any case,\u201d he added. \u201cIf you will engage in arrests without reason, the things will derail,\u201d the PTI leader warned.\nMr Qureshi also condemned the arrests, saying Friday\u2019s talks began with this issue. The arrests, he maintained, had no justification.\n\u201cThere are talks on one hand and this situation on the other. So they [government representatives] were asked what are they trying to do and were they creating an enabling environment. They understood [our stance] and consequently, 33 arrested people were released,\u201d he added.\nHard stance\nAhead of the second round of parleys, PTI chief Imran Khan \u2014 during a chat with journalists outside the Islamabad High Court \u2014 said he had requested the party negotiators to initiate talks with the government only if the ruling party was prepared to immediately dissolve the assemblies and hold elections.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to proceed if they insist on holding polls in September or October,\u201d Mr Khan said, with both Mr Qureshi and Mr Chaudhry present on the occasion.\nHe said it would be a breach of the Constitution if the Punjab Assembly elections were not held on May 14, adding the ball is now in the government\u2019s court, as they can hold simultaneous elections by dissolving the National Assembly prematurely.\nSeparately, Mr Chaudhry said the main objective of the negotiations was to recognise that public was the \u201ccentre of power\u201d and move towards elections.\nPrior to talks, the government and PTI teams called on Chairman Senate Sadiq Sanjrani, who took the initiative to bring the two sides on the negotiating table.\n"

It will also help boost the country\u2019s economy by increasing energy production and reduce the cost of production for industries, he said Mr Malik said the government was actively working on a new energy policy that would focus on creating energy from LPG, LNG, and solar resources. \nPeace with neighbours\nSeparately, addressing the passing-out parade of cadets at the PAF Academy Asghar Khan in Risalpur, PM Shehbaz said that Pakistan was a peace-loving nation and wished to maintain friendly ties with all countries, especially its neighbours. \n\u201cHowever, our desire for peace must not be misunderstood as weakness,\u201d he said, adding that there could be no peace in South Asia without a just and fair settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in line with the UN resolutions and the aspirations of Kashmir people.\nHe praised the role of the armed forces, including the air force, police and intelligence community, in neutralizing threats to national security\nMeanwhile, PM Shehbaz will head to the UK to attend the coronation of Britain\u2019s King Charles III and Queen Consort Camilla on May 6, the Foreign Office said on Friday. \nA day earlier, he is expected to participate in an event for Commonwealth leaders in London and will hold bilateral meetings with leaders participating in the celebrations.\n"

The attack was followed by a fierce exchange of fire in which soldiers killed four militants.\nThe two other incidents took place in the district\u2019s Amir Kalam and Tajbi Khel areas, during which another three militants, including key militant commander Musa Khan, were gunned down, the military\u2019s media wing said, adding that weapons and ammunition were seized from their possession.\nTehreek-i-Jihad Pakistan, a militant group that surfaced for the first time, has claimed responsibility for the attacks in a statement issued by the organisation\u2019s spokesman, Mulla Mohammad Qasim.\nReuters also cited a report by an intelligence agency that identified the new, little-known militant group as being involved in the attacks, though the report couldn\u2019t be immediately confirmed.\n \n \n\nThe attacks were reported on Thursday night, but there was no official word from military or security agencies regarding the incidents or the number of casualties then.\nISPR said soldiers repulsed all the attacks, which took place within a short span of time.\nThe three martyred soldiers were identified as Naib Subedar Taj Mir, 40, resident of Nowshera district; Havaldar Zakir Ahmed, 38, from Abbottabad; and Sepoy Abid Hussain, 29, from Dera Ismail Khan district.\n \n\nA combination photo of Sepoy Abid Hussain, Havaldar Zakir Ahmed and Naib Subedar Taj Mir. \u2014 ISPR\n\n\u201cSanitisation of the areas is being carried out to eliminate any other terrorists found in the area.

One of them originated from Port Sudan and the other from Jeddah to bring back Pakis\u00adtanis who had earlier been evacuated there,\u201d she said.\nMs Baloch said the evacuation of Pakistanis from a difficult security situation in Sudan had been made possible by a robust inter-agency process led by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. \n\nHeavy battles rage despite latest truce; Turkiye\u2019s military aircraft comes under fire\n\nShe said the evacuation plan has been implemented in phases: In the first phase of the operation, over 800 Pakistanis were transported from Khart\u00adoum to Port Sudan, which was relatively safe. The second phase of the evacuation operation consisted of transporting Pakistani nationals from Port Sudan to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, or directly to Pakistan.\n\u201cToday\u2019s flights, operating from Port Sudan via Jeddah, mark the first part of this second phase,\u201d she said. \nThe spokesperson said that evacuation from Port Sudan to Jeddah continues including through ferries operated by the Saudi government. Some passengers will also be evacuated through a Chinese ship from Port Sudan to Jeddah.\n\u201cWe remain engaged with friendly countries in the region and are especially grateful to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for facilitating this process by providing transport by ferry from Port Sudan to Jeddah and also hosting Pakistani nationals until their repatriation to Pakistan,\u201d she said.\nMs Baloch said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will continue to lead the inter-agency process. Ambassador Meer Bahrose Regi\u2019s team in Khartoum and Port Sudan have worked tirelessly to facilitate this process and will continue to provide relief to Pakistanis who remain in Sudan until their evacuation to Pakistan. Our Consulate General of Jeddah will continue to coordinate with the Saudi authorities and assist Pakistanis in transit through Jeddah.\nThe spokesperson, who had earlier put the number of Pakistanis stranded in Sudan at around 1,500, avoided giving the exact number of Pakistani nationals trapped in Sudan.\n\u201cWe have a large number of Pakistanis who are still in Sudan and some Pakistanis are in transit through Jeddah. They were evacuated earlier from Port Sudan to Jeddah. Since the outbreak of civil war in Sudan, we have evacuated about 847 Pakistanis from Khartoum to Port Sudan and of them some are already in Jeddah while the rest are in transit as we speak to Jeddah via ferries. So, the situation is fluid. We would be able to give you the exact numbers as we have more details about the movement of these ferries,\u201d she said while answering a question.\nHeavy battles \nFighting raged in Sudan on Friday, despite rival forces agreeing to extend a truce aimed to stem nearly two weeks of warfare that has killed hundreds and caused widespread destruction, AFP adds. \nIn the war-ravaged western Darfur region, scores have been killed in days of bitter urban battles in the city of El Geneina, the United Nations says. \nBlack clouds rose over the capital Khartoum as foreign governments scrambled to organise mass evacuations of their citizens, with Turkiye\u2019s defence ministry reporting on Friday that one of their military transport aircraft had come under fire. \nThere have been multiple truce efforts since fighting broke out on April 15 between Sudan\u2019s army led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) commanded by his former deputy and fellow coup leader Mohamed Hamdan Daglo. All have failed. \nOn Thursday, the two sides agreed to extend a repeatedly broken ceasefire for three more days, with the United States, Saudi Arabia, the African Union, the UN and others hoping it would help forge a \u201cmore durable cessation of hostilities\u201d. \nSince a power struggle between Burhan and Daglo erupted into violence, fighter jets have pounded RSF positions in densely packed districts of Khartoum, as fighters on the ground exchanged volleys of artillery and heavy machine gun fire.\nIn some parts of the city of some five million people trenches have been dug, as gunmen battle each other street by street. \nAt least 512 people have been killed and 4,193 wounded in the fighting, according to health ministry figures, although the real death toll is likely much higher. \nFighting has also spread across Sudan, especially in long-troubled Darfur, where witnesses reported intense conflict and looting.\n"

He said Pakistan had 23 million out-of-school children, which was unfortunately the highest figure in the world.\nThe minister said in the capital, there were 70,000 out-of-school children, claiming he would bring all these students to schools. He also said he had been focusing on bringing improvement in the quality of education as well, adding that his initiative of schools on wheels was meant for pre-school children and buses had been catering the need of education of students in rural areas of Islamabad.\nHe said there was no involvement of government funding in this project, adding that the Word Bank had assured him of providing 30 buses for the purpose.\n\nSays initiative aims to focus on giving access to education to pre-school children\n\nMr Hussain said the World Bank was also planning to launch such buses in African countries.\nThe minister was speaking, in response to a question asked by Member of National Assembly (MNA) Tahira Aurangzeb, about the steps being taken by the present government to increase literacy rate in the country.\nHe said during the last nine months, because of various initiatives, the literacy rate had increased by 0.8pc.\nPML-N MNA Shaista Pervaiz said she had heard about mobile hospitals but surprisingly, now there was talk about mobile education. She said provision of education required a proper system, adding that education standards in the country were known to everyone.\nShe demanded complete details of funding, details of teachers and students, who are getting benefit from the initiative. The lawmaker said that education ministry was facing shortage of infrastructure and mosques could be utilised for the purpose of education.\nThe MNA said that if mosques are used, then there will be no need of such \u201cfacade school on wheels projects\u201d.\nMeanwhile, MNA Sheikh Rohale Asghar asked the minister to provide complete details of fully funded and half funded scholarships provided by Higher Education Commission (HEC) during the last five years. He said that allegedly, children of bureaucrats and those who sit in \u201cdarbars\u201d were the main beneficiaries of these scholarships. \nHis question was also supported by MNA Noor Alam Khan, who said that being chairman of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), he had raised his voice about this issue and sought details of scholarships of HEC. \nEarlier, MNA Saira Bano had sought details of vehicles available in the ministry and its attached departments and details of expenditure on fuel. The education ministry, through a written reply, had provided her the required information.\nAfter detailed discussion on education, MNA Mahmood Bashir Virk, who was chairing the session in the absence of speaker and deputy speaker, referred the questions to the Standing Committee on Education for detailed discussion adding that chairman of PAC Noor Alam Khan should also be invited for standing committee meeting.\n"

            "Text": "RAWALPINDI: As many as 55 passengers coming from abroad to Rawalpindi division were cleared of Mpox during screening but were isolated in their houses. \nThese passengers arrived at Islamabad International Airport in a flight on April 24 in which two passengers from Islamabad tested positive for Mpox.\nRawalpindi Division Director Health Dr Anser Ishaq told Dawn that the health authorities of Rawalpindi, Chakwal, Attock and Jhelum screened all the 55 passenegrs who arrived on April 24 and found no symptoms of monkeypox.\nHowever, he said as a precaution, these passengers had been asked to isolate in their houses to avoid chances of spread of disease. \nHe said the World Health Organisation\u2019s guidelines to deal with suspected patients were being implemented. He said that the incubation period for Mpox is typically 5 to 21 days, with an average of 12 days. \n\u201cDuring this time, an infected person may not show any symptoms but can still spread the virus to others. The infectious period for Mpox begins with the onset of symptoms and can last for up to 4 weeks,\u201d he said.\nMonkeypox is primarily spread through close contact with infected animals, such as handling or consuming meat from infected animals, or through close contact with infected people, such as through respiratory droplets or contact with infected person\u2019s body fluids or skin lesions. The rate of transmission can vary depending upon several factors, such as the level of exposure, the severity of the disease, and the effectiveness of infection control measures.\nIn general, the risk of transmission is higher in settings where there is close and prolonged contact with infected individuals, such as households or healthcare settings. The use of personal protective equipment and good hygiene practices, such as handwashing and disinfection of contaminated surfaces, can help reduce the risk of transmission.\nIt is important to note that monkeypox is a rare disease, and the risk of transmission outside of endemic areas is low. However, if you have been in close contact with an infected individual or animal or have recently traveled to an endemic area and experience symptoms of monkeypox, it is recommended that you seek medical attention promptly to receive appropriate care and to prevent further spread of the disease.\n"

            "Text": "RAWALPINDI: Ahead of monsoon season, the district administration on Friday imposed section 144 around Leh Nullah to stop people from dumping solid waste and construction material waste for 30 days in the area. \nWater and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) requested the administration to impose a ban on dumping solid waste in and around Leh Nullah as the agency will start cleaning the nullah which will be completed by end of June.\nDeputy Commissioner Hassan Waqar Cheema recommended Punjab Home department to impose section 144. According to a notification, the DC said that the issue of solid waste and construction debris being dumped into the nullah and its tributaries was an alarming one.\nThis practice posing a serious threat to public health and the natural ecosystem. Moreover, a significant amount of solid waste and construction debris is being illegally dumped into these water bodies, causing blockages and hindering the natural flow of water. \n\nWasa requested admin to prevent waste from being dumped in it\n\nTherefore, the deputy commissioner said that there were sufficient grounds to proceed under section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), 1898, as an immediate remedy and the restrictions herein after appearing are necessary to prevent danger to human health and life in the district.\nMeanwhile, truck and loading vehicle owners came up with an idea to park their vehicles in the congested Raja Bazaar and dumped constructed material waste on the banks of Leh Nullah to create space for parking.\nOn the backside of Ganjmandi police station, along the bridge over Leh Nullah, loading vehicles park their vehicles while encroaching banks of the nullah which reduces its width and creates problems when there is heavy rainfall.\nHowever, no civic body is taking notice of the issue. Wasa has spent millions every year to clear hurdles in the smooth flow of water in the nullah to avoid flooding. \nThe more than 30 kilometre-long nullah, starts from the foot of Margalla Hills in Islamabad and discharges into Soan River in Rawalpindi near Lahore High Court (Rawalpindi bench). The major devastated flood that the nullah witnessed was on July 23, 2001. Just a few hours of 620 millimetres of rain resulted in the worst floods in the city\u2019s history. As many as 35 people lost their lives while many slums were swept away resulting in financial loss worth millions. \nThe provincial government spends millions of rupees on dredging of the nullah year after year. This year too, like all others, Rs10 million is being spent on dredging.\nFurthermore, Wasa will start cleanliness of the nullah which will cost Rs30 million from next month to avoid a flood-like situation in the garrison city.\nThe government released the amount to Wasa and directed it to start work as soon as possible and it is set to be completed by June 30.\nWasa spokesman Umer Farooq told Dawn on Friday that there were reports that the coming monsoon will be aggressive and there was a dire need to remove mud and any other obstacle in the smooth flow of rain water coming from the capital city and adjoining nullahs.\n"

            "Text": "TAXILA: Commissioner Liaquat Ali Chattha has said efforts are underway to establish a modern gymkhana in Attock to provide better recreational facilities to natives of the area.\nHe was talking to journalists after attending a briefing regarding the project on Friday. The commissioner was accompanied by Additional Commissioner Revenue Kanza Murtaza, Additional Commissioner Ch Abdul Majid, Deputy Commissioner Rao Atif Raza and other administrative officers.\nMr Chattha said the facility would be established on 47 kanals of land while indoor and outdoor sports facilities including badminton, squash, tennis as well and riding will be provided to people.\nHe said the facility would include a library and swimming pool besides a joy land for kids, adding that the gymkhana would not only provide better recreational facilities to government officials and their families but also help in the promotion of local culture and social norms. \nMr Chattha said earlier last year, serving as commissioner of Dera Ghazi Khan, he revived the over-a-century old local officers\u2019 club asGymkhana Club while the same projects were successfully initiated in other districts especially Faisalabad, Sargodha and Gujrat. \nEarlier, presiding over a meeting regarding development schemes, he was informed that work on 21 schemes is underway across the district at a cost of Rs27,527.9 million in the district. \nHe was informed that among them, a sum of Rs10,233.9 million was being spent on 26 schemes of highways, Rs2,487.3 million on 22 schemes of buildings, Rs1,426.3 million on seven public health schemes and Rs135 million on two local government schemes.\nHe said that effective steps should be taken to complete all development projects on time and quality of work should be ensured. He was of the view that senior officers should take ownership of work on development projects and supervise them, he added. \nHe instructed officers to take the local community of the place where there was a public project into confidence and work in cooperation with them, adding that the government would not let the cost go beyond the fixed limit by controlling expenditures. On this occasion, he said words of encouragement to the best performing officers especially Deputy Commissioner Rao Atif Raza and Deputy Director (Information) Shahzad Niaz Khokhar.\nLater, the commissioner attended the Nambardar (village elders) Convention at District Council Hall. He said that nambardars occupy an important position in the revenue department and are highly respected. \nThe doors of the commissioner\u2019s office are always open for them, he said, adding that nambardars submitted their demands to commissioner Rawalpindi on which they were assured that their demands would be met within the next one month.\n"

He succumbed to his injuries later on.\nMore than 90 incidents of street crime were reported to police on Thursday in which the victims lost 57 mobile phones, 22 motorcycles, two cars and a significant amount of cash and gold jewellery.\nAfter Eidul Fitr, there was a noticeably sharp increase in the number of street crime incidents reported, suggesting that the police may have been more focused on holding \u201coffice meetings\u201d than attempting to stem the crime wave and recover the loot.\nAccording to a police report, one of the suspects was overpowered by security guards, while his accomplice managed to escape by firing a gunshot in the air which sparked panic and fear among the people. Some hid to protect themselves inside the CSD while others went into other nearby shops.\nThe crime scene was located not far from the most sensitive buildings in the garrison city. Niaz Ali, a security guard who was seriously injured, was taken to Combined Military Hospital (CMH), where he passed away, police said.\nYasir Khan, a resident of Dhamial, lodged a first information report (FIR) with R.A. Bazaar police saying that his brother Niaz Ali had been performing duty as a security guard at the CSD store in Lal Kurti.\nHe said as he came to see his brother at the CSD at night, he found Liaquat Ali, one of the employees of the store chasing two unidentified persons and shouting \u201ccatch them, catch them\u201d as they were stealing a motorcycle.\nHe said responding to Liaquat Ali, his brother Niaz Ali, Tariq Mehmood and Hussain Ali, all of whom are security guards tried to intercept the escaping suspects and they opened fire on them. One of the suspects fired a gunshot at Niaz Ali that left him critically injured while the suspect was overpowered by two other security guards who also seized his pistol.\nHowever, the suspect\u2019s accomplice managed to run away by firing gunshots in the air which created panic and fear among people.\nAnother murder case was reported to Saddar Bairooni police by Yasir Mehmood who said in the FIR that Akhtar Mehmood who had been missing since Thursday morning was found dead with torture marks in the fields. He suspected that his brother Akhtar was tortured to death by unidentified persons for unknown reasons.\nFurthermore, in Kotli Sattian, Ahsan Satti, an active worker of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), was shot dead while his driver Javaid Satti was injured when four persons ambushed them in Sand Saroor area on Thursday night.\nAdil Mumtaz and Mohammad Zahid were deprived of their motorcycles, mobile phones and cash by two unidentified robbers in the Pirwadhai area, while Attaullah was robbed of his mobile phone by two unidentified robbers in Pirwadhai area.

It also relies on poaching the reclusive Hardwicke\u2019s spiny-tailed lizard, which is cruelly butchered on the pavement before its innards are cooked on a crude gas hob.\n\u201cYou just apply five drops over the affected area and massage,\u201d said Yasir Ali, one of four vendors in Rawalpindi\u2019s Raja Bazaar.\n\u201cIt does magic in terms of promoting sexual stamina,\u201d the 40-year-old told this agency.\nAs he speaks, a lounge of paralysed lizards is spread out on his tarpaulin sheet cluttered with glass vials.\nAli entices a gaggle of customers perusing his potions by telling them it is \u201ca solution to bring joy and happiness\u201d which will make them \u201cstrong like steel\u201d.\n\u201cIt will make your wife happy,\u201d he promises with a glint in his eye. \u201cBuy it and try it.\u201d Sultan Mehmood, 62, a user for three decades says. It \u201cworks like a miracle,\u201d he adds, as he launches into a vivid description of his sexual performance.\n\n\n\n \nThe meek lizards - measuring up to 60 centimetres (24 inches) as adults - are plucked from the plains of Punjab and Sindh provinces as they peep out of their burrows to sunbathe.\nAs night fades, Mohammad Nasir, 25, lays a web of fishing wire snares on the arid plateaus surrounding the village of Adiala, 20 kilometres (12 miles) south of Islamabad. Within hours he has caught more than a dozen.\n\u201cWe break the lizards\u2019 back after capturing them,\u201d the fourth-generation poacher said. \u201cThis is done to make sure they do not run away, because the animal moves with the speed of a bullet,\u201d he said, adding that \u201csometimes it\u2019s quite painful to hunt these lizards and deprive them of their right to live in a natural habitat, but this is how we make a living\u201d.\nIn a nation where social pressure dictates couples produce sprawling families, infertility is deeply stigmatised and Viagra is outlawed, the quack remedy for sexual impotence remains popular.\nBut Islamabad clinician Ahmad Shahab says the trade is capitalising on naivety stemming from the taboo of sexuality in deeply conservative Pakistan.\n\u201cIt is absolutely rubbish and there is no truth in claims that the oil helps,\u201d Shahab said.\n\u201cSex is a subject people are quite curious about and these quacks are making fools out of them,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cwe have to change the mindset of our people and to educate them\u201d.\nWWF senior research and conservation manager Jamshed Iqbal Chaudhry agreed that claims of healing properties were \u201ctotally false and devoid of any truth\u201d.\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature classes the spiny-tailed lizards as \u201cvulnerable\u201d.\n\u201cThe over-exploitation of lizards will lead them to the verge of extinction,\u201d Chaudhry warned.\nAli, the vendor, says he has been arrested \u201cmany times\u201d by wildlife protection officers, but after fines no larger than Rs10,000 ($35) he was freed to continue his trade.\nAli cuts the sand-coloured lizards\u2019 necks while they are immobilised but alive - ending their 15-year lifespan - and melts down the fat inside their plump bellies.\nHe says the unction is infused with saffron - an exorbitantly expensive spice - but given the oil sells for between Rs600 and Rs1,200 ($2 to $4) that seems unlikely.\nHe also claims that it has miracle properties include healing joint aches, back pain, sciatica and hair loss.\n\u201cI have regular customers from Saudi Arabia, Dubai, Sharjah, Malaysia and several African countries,\u201d he boasts.\nMohammad Azam, 65, remains unconvinced.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing but a fraudulent activity,\u201d he said. \u201cI used this medicine but found it useless. It\u2019s full of germs and bacteria,\u201d he added.\nStill, Ali\u2019s fellow vendor Mohammad Rafiq, 40, says others turn to the oil \u201cto satisfy their wives and to have children\u201d.\n\u201cThis is a great human desire which is undeniable,\u201d he said.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The director general of World Health Organisation (WHO) has submitted a report to the forthcoming World Health Assembly that cases of poliomyelitis in Pakistan are now primarily restricted to the southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa where challenges remain in reaching children.\nIn a report, the WHO director general said since January 2021 all reported cases had been from seven polio-endemic districts in the southern area of KP, out of a total of 171 districts nationwide.\nThere has been one WPV1 case this year reported from Bannu, the WHO data showed. The World Health Assembly is opening in Geneva on May 21, where much of the deliberations will focus on the ongoing and evolving Covid-19 situation whereas the global efforts to eradicate polio will also be discussed by member states.\nBy submitting the report to the assembly, WHO has sought guidance on measures to adopt to ensure that all remaining zero-dose children in the most consequential geographies are reached with oral polio vaccine.\nThe WHO stated that wild poliovirus type-1 continued to be detected in parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan, the last two remaining countries where the virus is endemic. \nBoth countries have continued to make progress since the year 2000, as demonstrated by the declining number of poliomyelitis cases and positive environmental samples, geographically localised transmission and reduction in the number of transmission chains to a single active chain in each country.\nThe WHO report added that the periodic detection of wild poliovirus type 1 from environmental samples outside of these remaining reservoir areas demonstrated the continued risk of transmission.\nAccording to the report, in Pakistan, 20 cases of poliomyelitis due to wild poliovirus type 1 3 and 41 positive environmental samples for wild poliovirus type 1 4 were reported in 2022. All cases were concentrated in three districts in the southern KP.\nAn operational plan specifically targeting the southern KP was being implemented. As in Afghanistan, the genetic diversity of wild poliovirus type 1 transmission in Pakistan continues to decline with a single active individual transmission chain at the start of 2023, compared to 11 chains in the year 2020 and four in the year 2021.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, the Technical Advisory Group on poliomyelitis eradication in Pakistan and WHO and Unicef regional directors met to review the progress made to date and underscored the current epidemiological opportunity to eradicate poliomyelitis in Pakistan. The global political will to eradicate poliomyelitis remains strong as demonstrated by the high-level commitments to poliomyelitis eradication made during sessions of the World Health\nAssembly, the Rotary International Convention, the G7 leaders meeting, the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting and the G20 Development and Health Ministers meeting as well as at the global pledging moment held at the World Health Summit in Berlin. At the summit, global leaders pledged $2.6 billion in funding towards the Polio Eradication Strategy 2022-26, an important first step in securing the full $4.8 billion needed to ensure the successful implementation of the strategy. \nAdditional commitments have been made since then by new and existing partners, including through the European Investment Bank, and, at its December 2022 meeting, the board of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, extended the Gavi eligibility and co-financing exemptions for inactivated polio vaccine in support of polio eradication efforts.\n"

The teenager accompanied by his father was travelling to Pakistan for repair of a congenital disease,\u201d shared an official.\nThe suspected patients had been quarantined at a government health facility in Bhittaiabad in Gulistan-i-Jauhar and their samples were analysed at the Dow University of Health Sciences (DUHS).\nMeanwhile, the National Institute of Child Health (NICH) has sent a sample of a seven-year-old child suspected of having mpox disease to DUHS.\nA resident of Lyari, the child is stated to be a liver disease patient. He had been under treatment at the Indus Hospital for over six months from where he was recently referred to the NICH.\n\u201cThough it seems to be a complicated case of chickenpox, we have sent his samples for analysis for monkeypox disease,\u201d NICH director Dr Nasir Saleem Saddal said, adding that the child had a weak immune system.\nThe child, according to NICH doctors, has no travel or contact history.\n\u201cThe case couldn\u2019t even be defined as a suspected case and the staff had to get him tested as a suspected mpox case following misleading news in the social media,\u201d Dr Liaquat Ali Halo, deputy director at NICH, explained.\nThe children\u2019s hospital had set up an isolation unit for mpox cases, he said.\n"

            "Text": "KARACHI: Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah on Friday inaugurated the first specialised 200-bed children\u2019s hospital in the metropolis in the public sector offering paediatric services especially to newborns, infants and premature babies.\nThe Sindh Institute of Child Health and Neonatology (SICHN) in Korangi is equipped with 21 ventilators along with modern facilities, including a 52-bed intensive care unit dedicated to premature babies, a 28-bed ICU, a 53-bed general unit, a state-of-the-art laboratory and health information management system.\nSpeaking at a briefing organised on the hospital\u2019s premises, SICHN executive director Dr Jamal Raza highlighted the need for setting up a dedicated children\u2019s hospital in the city and its key features.\n\u201cThe hospital has successfully treated over 40,000 patients in six months. The staff is working in the morning and evening shifts, and around 300 poor patients are provided free-of-cost treatment daily,\u201d Dr Raza told the audience, adding that there was no cash counter at the facility.\nPakistan, he said, had one of the highest mortality rates among premature babies and newborns in the world and the establishment of a specialised hospital catering to their needs was long overdue.\n\u201cPakistan has 45.6 neonatal deaths per 1,000 live births. However, 80 per cent of these deaths can be prevented through the provision of adequate facilities,\u201d he said.\nThe SICHN, Dr Raza said, would be offering paediatric neurology services with rehabilitation, physiotherapy, speech therapy and occupational therapy along with outpatient department services for endocrinology, cardiology and rheumatology.\nTalking to media, the chief minister appreciated the efforts of the hospital administration and said the facility would help save many precious lives.\n\u201cIn order to reduce the high neonatal death rate, the experts have suggested a three-tier system comprising an effective primary healthcare followed by a secondary healthcare system at the tehsil level offering kangaroo-mother-care units,\u201d he said, adding that public awareness about frequent and exclusive breastfeeding was equally important.\n\u201cUnder the SICHN umbrella, the aim is to develop hospitals and health facilities in the field of paediatrics and neonatology. The Sindh government plans to establish a paediatric surgical unit, services for sub-specialties, and to expand laboratories and upgrade the existing infrastructure. Besides, the institute would be a training and research facility,\u201d he said.\nThe SICH satellite centre project at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC), he pointed out, was still in its nascent stages. But, even then it had successfully treated 92pc of its patients.\n\u201cThe SICHN is developing its genetic testing services including genetic variation tests, screening of inborn error of metabolism, and the application of Artificial Intelligence in child health and nursing,\u201d he said.\nA community development training unit, the chief minister said, had also been established where 72 staff members, including doctors, nurses, and paramedics of DHO East and Korangi and 36 of Chiniot General Hospital had been trained to look after newborns.\nEarlier, the chief minister visited different wards of the hospital and the outpatient department and interacted with the mothers who had brought their children for a medical check-up and treatment.\nThe hospital\u2019s inauguration ceremony was also attended by Local Government Minister Syed Nasir Shah, parliamentary secretary for health Qasim Soomro and secretary health Zulfikar Shah.\n"

            "Text": "\u2022 Historians shed light on modernity and creation of Pakistan in a thought-provoking discussion\n\u2022 Scholar says Thatta had 6,000 institutions of education for boys and girls before colonial era\nKARACHI: Modernity in the context of India, the role of women of the calibre of Miss Fatima Jinnah, Jahanara Shahnawaz and Shaista Ikramullah in Muslim nationalism and politics were in focus at \u2018Negotiating Modernity: Women in the Making of Pakistan\u2019, a learned conversation between Associate Professor of South Asian History at Georgetown University, Dr Reza Pirbhai, who also happens to be member of faculty at the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service in Qatar, and scholar Nusrat Khawaja at the Mohatta Palace Museum here on Friday.  \nFrom examining conflict and reconciliation between movements in Islamic thought and institutions, and those introduced by the British in the colonial context, Dr Pirbhai talked about the idea of a clash between tradition and modernity, the fluidity of culture and the conjoined impact of various strands of thought on the cultural formation of identity for post-Partition society.  \n\u201cWhen we speak of modernity, we pin the concept to 18th and 19th century Europe and the present,\u201d said Dr Pirbhai.  \n\u201cWhen we pin modernity on the European concept, we take everything else and put it in the box of \u2018tradition\u2019. All this tradition is set apart from modernity and that is how we achieve something negative,\u201d he pointed out, while explaining that it was like making colonialism more important. Like the British telling you that they rule over you to bring you into the modern world. And that idea was being reinforced by the educational institutions and political institutions.  \n\u201cColonialism says, \u2018all you need to know is how we define the world\u2019,\u201d he added.  \nDeconstructing the idea of modernity, he said, \u201cWhen we think of tradition in Pakistan, we think of Islam. We are not looking at modernity going back here for over 1,400 years because it is in the box of tradition that has been put away.\u201d \nComing to the topic of women and modernity, he said that the ideal women in the Victorian world were domestic women. \u201cMothers, daughters and wives, who were householders, women who nurtured others and led a life of seclusion,\u201d he said.  \nHe said that in 1843, when the British took over Sindh the major centres of learning here were the matabs and madressahs. \u201cFor example, a place as small as Thatta had 6,000 such institutions of learning and not just for boys and men, but also for girls and women, who were taught literature and arithmetic, too. Then the British shut down these centres of learning,\u201d he said.  \n\u201cThanks to those education institutions before the colonial era, the literacy rate there was significantly high. But after the British shut the institutions, they replaced those 6,000 institutions in Thatta with five schools, and you had to pay fees to go to those five schools. The girls and women were the first ones there to find no place for themselves in those schools. They were instantly at a disadvantage,\u201d Dr Pirbhai added.  \nIt was also pointed out that the modern or educated women had the support of educated men, who were either their fathers, husbands or brothers, to widen their horizons. All of these men were touched by English education and believed in the western ideal of the educated woman. Educated women were seen as westernised, and not in the Islamic frame.  \nThe discussion turned to politician and activist Jahanara Shahnawaz, former member of the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan, Begum Mohammed Ali Jauhar, Miss Fatima Jinnah and Shaista Ikramullah, who all had an educated man by their side, encouraging them to pursue their interests. They did away with the ideas of seclusion.  \nAt the time there were two extremes of the burqa and veil and the Victorian woman who did not cover her head or face. The well-educated dentist that Miss Jinnah was, compromised between both these looks when she came into public by covering her head. Actually, even the much more modern Benazir Bhutto found that compromise suitable for herself also.  \nBack to Miss Jinnah, she was leading a kind of retired life after the passing of the Quaid-i-Azam in 1948 until 1962 when she was unhappy with Field Marshal Ayub Khan\u2019s reforms and was urged to join politics by Jahanara Shahnawaz and the other ladies.  \nIt was said that had she won the elections, she would not have just been the first female county head in the world, but she would have also reversed Ayub\u2019s decisions and gone back to having both Urdu and Bengali as the two national languages of this country and we would not have lost East Pakistan.\n"

            "Text": "HYDERABAD: Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah has said that his government is committed to eliminate dacoits\u2019 gangs operating in the riverine area of upper Sindh.\nSpeaking to the media at the residence of local PPP leader Dr Irfan Gul Magsi here on Friday, Mr Shah said talks with the federal government were under way on the issue of using military-grade weapons in the ongoing massive anti-dacoit operation in Sindh, Punjab and Balochistan. \nHe explained that federal government\u2019s consent was required to buy military-grade weapons as the riverine area involved Balochistan and Punjab provinces as well. \u201cBut the [federal] authorities told the Sindh government that use of such weapons may lead to collateral damage,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe told them that the Sindh government can pay them for use of such weapons and that they should also join in the operation\u201d. \nThe CM, who had earlier expressed his concern over the gangs having more sophisticated weapons than police have, again called for measures to stop such \u201csupplies\u201d. \u201cNo such weapon factory exists in Sindh,\u201d he argued. \nHe said police were setting up pickets at a distance of 200 to 300 metres and that\u2019s why dacoits were intensifying their activities. He admitted that the factor of human resource constraint was also there. \n"

He also stated that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif should also be disqualified for submitting a false affidavit. \nConsidering elections be held in the near future, the former prime minister suggested: \u201cMyself and Nawaz Sharif be put on the Exit Control List until holding of the elections and formation of a new government\u201d. He said the looters of the national wealth would run away from the country as their properties, businesses, medical treatment and shopping were abroad. \nMr Khan lamented that the incumbent rulers were blocking the people\u2019s fundamental right to vote and elect their representatives to protect their looted wealth and the NRO-II given by former army chief retired Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa.  \nImran Khan said the incumbent government had also intensified torture of the peaceful PTI workers and even tried to silence him by masterminding an assassination attempt in Wazirabad followed by another plan to be executed at the Judicial Complex, Islamabad. The rulers were afraid of holding elections just because they knew that Imran Khan would win with the votes of the people and then hold them accountable for their massive loot, he added. \nAsserting that only a group of seven-eight people were pushing the country towards disaster to protect their looted wealth, Mr Khan asked whether the powers that be could not see that Pakistan was heading towards disaster. \n\u201cIf the rulers violated the Supreme Court decision and the Constitution of Pakistan, the whole nation would stand by the Constitution and the apex court and he would lead the nation on the streets to get their fundamental right to vote and elect representatives in a peaceful manner,\u201d he warned.\n"

He said the PPP was mobilising its workers using social media. \nFormer MPA Ayesha Chaudhry has urged party\u2019s digital activists to present their point of view in a civilised, polite, and dignified manner on all social media platforms to discourage the anti-democracy forces from spreading chaos and hatred in the country.\nShe hopes the activists will also take into account the gender and age of the opponent(s), while expressing their views and will respond to even rude posts in a decent way, with reason, logic, and civility. \nQasim Gilani says the purpose of establishing this platform is to spread Bhutto\u2019s ideology.

Still, for the past five years, Pakistan has been trying to recover from environmental degradation.\u201d\nIn order to protect the environment of Punjab, we divided it into three parts -- first part includes rules and regulations, second is equipment and monitoring sector and the last part is strategies to control pollution.He said they were ready to cooperate with the academia for a better environment in Punjab.\nNorth Carolina State University\u2019s Department of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences head Prof Dr Lewis Owen, in his remarks, stated that understanding the nature and dynamics of Quaternary paleoenvironmental change and landscape evolution of environmental geology and natural hazards along active plate margins was crucial in the Himalayan-Tibetan Orogen and the Western Cordilleras of North and South America. \nHe mentioned some of the best laboratories working for understanding the dynamics of geomorphic, tectonic and climatic processes, and ultimately providing the analogues for understanding the evolution of many ancient plate boundaries.\nHe said applying remote sensing, field methods and geochronology in various geographical regions would provide the basis for advanced climate change research.\nProf Paul Liu of the North Calorina State University said the flux and fate of river-derived sediment in the margin sea were affected by the late quaternary sea-level changes and their paleoenvironmental implications, which should be deeply studied to understand the drivers of global climate change.\nHe emphasised the importance of digital mapping using a high-resolution sub-bottom profiler and Swath Bathymetric Sonar System to explore the effects on various rivers, glaciers and oceans, particularly in Pakistan.\nDepartment of Environmental Sciences Chairperson and workshop organiser Prof Dr Arifa Tahir, in her address, provided the project digest and overview including objectives, activities and outcomes of this international collaboration to find solutions and mitigation measures to reduce and compensate for global climate change.\n"

            "Text": "LAHORE: The management of Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) has warned its former managing director (currently an officer on special duty) of stopping his monthly salary in case he avoids attending the office.  \nThe managing director, however, says the action will be illegal.\nThe management recently issued a notice to Ali J Hamdani, whose services were placed under suspension with the seizure of his power to act as the managing director in February this year, under which he was asked to attend the office on a regular basis, failing which his salary\u2019s release will be stopped, says an official source.\n\u201cSince he (Mr Hamdani) has not bothered to receive this notice, his salary for the month of April is likely to be stopped by the company\u2019s finance department,\u201d the official requesting anonymity said.\nOn the other hand, the outgoing MD, who has challenged the act of his ouster in the Lahore High Court, rejected the notice and termed it unlawful.\n\u201cThe notice has been signed and sent by a junior officer who does not have the power to do so. He has not forwarded a copy of this letter to the sitting managing director, the board, or the petroleum division. How can I term it as issued under the rules and regulations?\u201d he questioned.\nHe said whenever he visited the office, the HR department officer disappeared after seeing him.  \n\u201cMy office on the 7th floor of the SNGPL\u2019s building on Kashmir Road (Lahore) has also been sealed. So, where will I sit?\u201d he deplored.\nMr Hamdani called the management\u2019s actions illegal, saying he would also challenge this in court.  \nAccording to him, his salary cannot be blocked in any way. \u201cIf someone did this, it will be illegal,\u201d he maintained.\nHe said the court has reserved judgment in his case, and soon it will be announced.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that the court will decide this case in my favour, as I was removed by the board unlawfully,\u201d he claimed.\nIt merits mentioning that the company\u2019s board of directors had on Feb 18 removed Mr Hamdani from the post with a direction to avoid exercising his authority to run the country\u2019s largest state-owned gas company. The board also appointed Amir Tufail as the new managing director on an officiating charge basis.  \nMr Hamdani\u2019s removal was based on allegations of irregularities/corruption. However, he rejected these allegations, describing the entire procedure adopted to remove him from office as illegal, baseless, and unethical under corporate governance rules, and announced that he would challenge it in a court of law.\nINAUGURATION: The SNGPL management on Friday inaugurated a daycare centre at the company office.\nAddressing the inaugural ceremony, company\u2019s board of directors chairperson Roohi Raees Khan said the board had always endeavored for the welfare of the company and its employees.\n\u201cThe measures taken by the board and implemented by the management resulted in UFG reduction, cost control and a successful digitisation programme,\u201d she said, adding any organisation or even society cannot prosper without collective efforts; hence, all employees, male and female, must work together and develop a tolerance for each other.  \nShe said the daycare centre was a longstanding demand of the company\u2019s female employees, which had been fulfilled.\nOn this occasion, MD Amer Tufail said the company would strive to bring in further improvement to the daycare centre in the future.\n"

They said the government should withdraw the increase in the bills; otherwise, the JI would stage a sit-in on the GT Road. The demonstrators ended the protest by giving an ultimatum of one week. \nBRIDGE: The 56-year-old overhead bridge in Wazirabad is in a dilapidated condition due to the negligence of the authorities and it\u2019s causing damage to the vehicles using it.  \nThe bridge has deep puddles at places and its condition has gotten worse during the last five years.  \nThe condition of the bridge is so bad that its causes accidents frequently as heavy traffic continues to run on it. The bridge passes through the city centre for the Rawalpindi-Lahore traffic while the traffic going to Sialkot, Narowal and Shakargarh was also using it.  \nIt was inaugurated in 1967 by the then federal minister of communications Muhammad Khan Junejo. There is the DSP office on one side of the bridge while the Wazirabad assistant commissioner has his office on the other side.  \nThe citizens demand the authorities to immediately repair the bridge to protect the lives of commuters and motorists.\n"

However, the possibility of short circuits or any sabotage activity or negligence allegedly on the part of officials or the passengers that led to such a sorrowful incident cannot be rul\u00aded out,\u201d the Railways official told Dawn.\nSharing inside investigations, the officer said the affected coach, bearing number 12525-0, was a new one and was added to the rolling stock after being overhauled by the Pakistan Railways\u2019 department concerned on April 8.\nHe said the air-conditioned Business Class coaches generally had four to six sockets for mobile charging and not for other purposes like ironing, heating, etc. \u201cBut this coach had only two such socket points,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe other items such as fans, AC, lights, etc., were operating fine as there was no fluctuation,\u201d he said, quoting interviews of some passengers of the same coach with Railways officials.\nHe said that to keep the electricity supply system intact and protected, the coaches also have certain devices (like circuit breakers) that trip the system in case of any fluctuation, low voltage, etc.\n\u201cWhen the train stopped, most passengers succeeded in coming out of the coach along with their luggage. It means the situation was not so bad at the time when the train stopped,\u201d he said.\nTV footage later showed several burned sections of the train.\nIn October 2019, more than 70 people were killed and 40 injured after three coaches of Tezgam Express bound for Rawalpindi caught fire near Liaquatpur in Punjab\u2019s Rahim Yar Khan.\nAn initial investigation conducted by a Railways team blamed the incident on gas leakage from an LPG cylinder carried by a passenger.\nLater, the FGIR also conducted a detailed inquiry into this incident  and six officials were suspended from service.\nThe report also identified serious administrative, operational and security lapses that led to the Tezgam train inferno, as the officials who were supposed to take measures to avert such accidents apparently showed sheer negligence in performing their duties, ignoring the relevant laws or the standard operating procedures.\nHowever, the ministry later raised several objections to the inquiry report, claiming that it was full of flaws and bias.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has submitted a report to the Supreme Court, saying it has not yet received any funds against the Rs21 billion required to conduct elections to the Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa assemblies.\nThough full contents of the fresh report are not known, the two-page reply has explained the latest situation about the unavailability of funds to the commission.\nEarlier on April 18, the commission took the plea before the court that staggering of polls by holding them for Punjab and KP assemblies was not feasible since it would incur significantly more expenses compared to holding the exercise on one day.\nThat report was filed in line with the court\u2019s April 14 directions, in which the commission had taken the view that an already depleted security apparatus would require weeks in advance for its movement.\n \n \n\nThe ECP also pointed out that staggering of elections could risk increase in violence since the losing party in one constituency would likely create violence in some other constituency in the next phase to offset chances of the perceived loss.\nThe incidents of influencing results through rigging in the next phase may also increase, the ECP had feared, adding that staggering of elections raises risk of violence as outlaws would have more chances to plan and commit attacks than the one-day limited window of opportunity.\nMoreover, it had said, the police and other law enforcement agencies were engaged in intelligence-based operations in Punjab. Their appointment in election duty would lead to compromising electoral activities by terrorists, which could re-engage in terrorism.\nBesides, the prevailing polarisation needs consensus among parties to bring the political temperature down, the ECP had emphasised. From the election point of view, political polarisation can have a triggering effect which can lead to violence and increase risk to safety of people during polls.\n \n \n\nThe commission had said it was essential that some guardrails and red lines be developed for tolerance and balance between contesting political parties and candidates.\nBut a three-judge Supreme Court bench, headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial, had described the ECP\u2019s earlier report an attempt to restore the date for general elections to Oct 8, which was already set aside by the court through its April 4 order in which May 14 was fixed as the fresh date for holding elections.\nThe April 19 order had held that ECP seeks restoration of the Oct 8 date on essentially security grounds, which in large measure overlap the concerns expressed in the defence ministry\u2019s report.\n\u201cIn our view the commission seeks, in the guise of a representation, to re-agitate matters that were before the Court when CP 5/2023 was heard and decided, and in which two fully instructed counsel were permitted to make submissions on its behalf,\u201d the court had recalled in its order.\nThe bench, including Justice Ijaz-ul-Ahsan and Justice Munib Akhtar, said it was impermissible to attempt to reopen issues and questions that already stand finally decided. The representation is not maintainable and ECP report is disposed of accordingly, the court had held.\n"

In March, the GB chief minister warned of  approaching the Supreme Court against the reduction of funds for  development projects.\nMore flights to GB\nIn a separate development, the federal aviation ministry has decided to increase the frequency of Pakistan International Airlines flights to Gilgit and Skardu.\nThe decision came after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif ordered the ministry to increase the flights and authorise private airlines to fly to GB to promote tourism.\nThis was decided in a meeting held at the Aviation Division on Friday to discuss the issue of flights to the region.\nThe meeting also decided to start Haj special flights from GB to facilitate the pilgrims intending to take the journey from the region. \nOnce the point of departure was notified, the PCAA will order PIA to start Haj flights from Skardu.\nIt was also agreed to start special flights from Lahore to Gilgit, Lahore and Karachi to Skardu. The PIA representative agreed to start flights from Faisalabad and Multan to Gilgit-Baltistan.\nThe reservations of GB people over high fares were also conveyed and it was decided that the matter will be reviewed.\n"

Besides Sindh and KP bar councils, Pakistan Bar Council, a Lahore-based social media influencer Advocate Mian Dawood, PML-N Lawyers\u2019 Forum and a private citizen Ghulam Murtaza Khan have moved misconduct and assets beyond means complaints against the Justice Naqvi who was elevated to the Supreme Court in March 2020.\nIn the fresh application, the SBC cited a 2014 judgment in which the SC bench comprising then Justice Asif Saeed Khosa, Justice Amir Hani Muslim and Justice Ijaz Ahmed Chaudhry had made certain observations about the conduct of the respondent judge when he was a Lahore High Court judge.\nThe SC bench had noted: \u201cWe may observe that discretion exercised by the learned judge (respondent) while passing the impugned order in the instant case has appeared to us to be somewhat colourable as after dismissal of second application for suspension of sentence bearing the same ground the only difference in the respondent\u2019s third application for the same relief was a different counsel for that respondent.\u201d\nThe Sindh bar recalled that after the SC observation, Justice Naqvi had filed a review petition seeking to expunge the strictures passed by the bench against him.\nSubsequently, the review was fixed before a bench comprising Justice Khosa, Justice Chaudhry and Justice Gulzar Ahmed.\nThe bench not only dismissed the review petition but also observed, \u201c\u2026. a judge of the High Court approaching this court in person and seeking review\u2026. is surely out of the ordinary and it may raise many an eyebrow in view of the provisions of Articles VI of the Code of Conduct prescribed by the Supreme Judicial Council.\u201d\nAudio recordings\nThe complaint noted that recently some audio recordings, purportedly based on the judge\u2019s talk with prominent politicians and certain lawyers have been widely circulated on social media and mainstream media. The SBC mentioned that the audio recordings had not been officially denied.\n"

Similarly, caretaker government\u2019s decision to dissolve the Medical Teaching Institutions\u2019 Policy Board and board of governors was also suspended by the Peshawar High Court.\nDr Jameel is the second member of KP caretaker cabinet to have resigned as another minister, Khusdil Khan Malik, was de-notified due to his being in government service at the time of his appointment in the caretaker cabinet. Hidayatullah Turi, another special assistant to chief minister, had last month resigned without mentioning any reason.

They warned if the demand wasn\u2019t met, their protests would continue. \nIn Alpuri area of Shangla district, scores of people took to the streets after Friday prayers to protest the \u201cresurgence\u201d of terrorism in Malakand division. \nThe rally was called by the Shangla Olasi Pasoon (Shangla Public Movement) and attended by political and social activists, traders and people from other walks of life. \nCarrying banners and placards, the protesters shouted slogans for elimination of terrorism and restoration of peace. \nThe speakers demanded a \u201ctransparent\u201d probe into the Kabal blasts, strict action against culprits and elimination of militancy from the region. \nMian Tufail Khan of the Jamaat-i-Islami said over 80,000 Pakhtuns had rendered their lives in the so-called fight against terrorism but authorities never took the issue seriously and therefore, terrorism had resurfaced. \nHe said that the Malakand division couldn\u2019t afford further damage to public life and property from terrorism. \nLawyer Salman Shah said that Pakhtuns had never seen the chief justice of the Supreme Court take a suo motu notice of blasts on their soil despite the killing of many Pakhtuns. \nHe insisted that the courts focused their attention on political issues.  The lawyer said that Pakhtuns were always targeted by vested interests to claim American dollars. \nAnother speaker, Noorullah Yousafzai, said Pakhtuns won\u2019t allow the killing of their community members by militants.  He said that the state should protect Pakhtuns and ensure elimination of the so-called terrorism. \n\u201cWe [Pakhtuns] always stood with our police brethren and will continue doing so,\u201d he said. \nHe condemned the Swat CTD depot blasts and demanded of authorities to investigate the explosions \u201ctransparently\u201d and bring culprits to justice.\n"

            "Text": "RAWALPINDI: After overseeing Pakistan\u2019s 500th victory in the One-day International format on Thursday, captain Babar Azam lavished praise on the way his side controlled the game to draw first blood in the five-match series against New Zealand.\nWith their five-wicket triumph over the Black Caps at the Pindi Cricket Stadium, Pakistan became only the third cricketing nation to reach the landmark. It came in their 949th one-dayer, making them the second quickest after Australia to achieve the feat.\nIn the second ODI, also at in Rawalpindi, on Saturday, the hosts will look to build on that victory to further embellish their lead in the series but they will be mindful of the fact that New Zealand came back from 2-0 down to level the preceding five-game Twenty20 series 2-2.\nPressing home their advantage, therefore, will be crucial for Pakistan. They can\u2019t afford to give the visitors any chance, any opening. In Thursday\u2019s game, they did exactly that with opener Fakhar Zaman\u2019s ninth ODI hundred trumping a similar effort by New Zealand\u2019s Daryl Mitchell.\nMitchell smashed 113 off 115 deliveries to help New Zealand post 288-7 with Pakistan\u2019s pacers, especially Naseem Shah, doing well in the end to restrict them under 300. Fakhar\u2019s 117 was the standout effort in the chase even though his fellow opener Imam-ul-Haq, Babar and Mohammad Rizwan chipped in with good runs.\n\u201cThis was a team effort, we wanted to start [the series] well,\u201d Babar said. \u201cCredit goes to the fast bowlers for the way we restricted them in the end. It feels good to see players execute their plans. The way Naseem bowled put the pressure on them and then Fakhar played a solid match-winning knock. The way Fakhar and Imam played, then the innings Fakhar and I built together, was great.\u201d\nFakhar and Imam (60) put on 124 for the first wicket and Pakistan were carried further towards the target by a 90-run stand between the opener and Babar (49). New Zealand hit back late when Adam Milne removed Babar and Shan Masood with Fakhar bringing Pakistan within 34 runs of victory before being dismissed but Mohammad Rizwan led the victory charge with a brisk unbeaten 42.\n\u201cThe plan was to attack and stay long,\u201d said Fakhar, who was named Player-of \u2013the-Match. \u201cIf you survive the new ball, you must stay [till the end]. The idea was to have at least one of the top three batters to bat deep. Today was my day and hopefully, Imam and Babar will also play big knocks.\u201d\nAt the post-match news conference, Fakhar said he enjoyed a good rapport with his opening partner Imam both on and off the pitch.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen a more confident player than Imam,\u201d said Fakhar. \u201cWe enjoy being with each other on the field and off the field as well. Now we have also got an understanding of each other\u2019s game and when he makes a mistake I let him know right away, and its vice versa.\u201d\nQuestions inevitably shifted to the T20 series where Pakistan lost the third and fifth games to let slip the chance of a series victory. Fakhar was forced to defend the fact that he plays one-drop in the shortest format of the game for Pakistan.\n\u201cIt\u2019s true that I\u2019ve played most of my cricket as an opener,\u201d he noted, before adding that \u201cone has to understand the team\u2019s situation\u201d.\n\u201cI think I can hit spinners better than [regular T20 openers] Babar and Rizwan. A team combination requires at least two left-handers in the middle-order and I think the way Babar and Rizwan are playing, there\u2019s no need to change it.\u201d\nNew Zealand failed to maintain the momentum from the T20 series and skipper Tom Latham rued his team\u2019s inability to get an early breakthrough.\n\u201cI think the score we got was about par,\u201d said Latham. \u201cDaryl played a superb innings. The wicket got harder for new guys, but the way Pakistan played was superb. We couldn\u2019t make any inroads. It [the wicket] got harder in the end but the two partnerships up top from Pakistan made the difference.\u201d\nMitchell to believed New Zealand managed a \u201cpar score\u201d batting first on a low wicket.\n\u201cPakistan have got some world-class bowlers and they showed that at the end there with their death bowling,\u201d he told reporters. \u201c..also the way Pakistan batted tonight was pretty special and put us under pressure at times and they always kept the rate in check. Fakhar was dangerous, he took the game on at times, took some risks and he obviously got the rewards for that.\u201d\nHe added that New Zealand would try their best to get back at Pakistan and spoke about the side trying to adapt to conditions here.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve played them a number of times now obviously coming over here is a totally different challenge for us Kiwis compared to what we\u2019re used to back home in terms of the reverse swing and the lower wickets so again it\u2019s just about us constantly improving and trying to get better each day,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI guess the surface here dictates how you want to play and for us as Kiwis we\u2019re just constantly trying to adapt to the kind of surface we see and the different format of one-day cricket. We know the blueprint that we want to play one-day cricket in the style that we want to play as Kiwis and we\u2019ll keep trying to show up and do that with a smile on our face.\u201d\n"

The director general added that he would take all stake holders, including sports federations and the Pakistan Olympic Association (POA) on board for bringing improvements in the sports sector.\nShoaib\u2019s predecessor Asif Zaman, who was appointed by former prime minister Imran Khan, was sacked by Shehbaz in October last year \u201cfor failing to perform his duties in accordance to the given mandate.\u201d\nSince Asif\u2019s ouster, the DG PSB\u2019s office remained vacant and the body\u2019s affairs were being taken care of by an interim official.\nDuring Asif\u2019s tenure, several sports facilities at the Pakistan Sports Complex here \u2014 including the swimming pool and the badminton and squash courts were simultaneously shut down in the name of renovation. The move had caused unrest among the members.\nShoaib said that he would ensure early reopening of the facilities that had been closed because of renovations and repair works. However, a PSB official said that several facilities have already opened and remaining one, the swimming pool, will be reopened in July. The Rodham Hall and the Hamidi Hall, meanwhile, will be inaugurated in the second week of May.\n"

            "Text": "LAHORE: The National Amateur Golf Championships are headed for a grandstand finish with a thrilling race to glory in store after Salman Jahangir moved level with overnight leader Shoaib Ahmed atop the leaderboard following a tense third round on Friday. \nSalman, who helped Pakistan \u2018A\u2019 bag titles on each of the two opening days and was part of another team victory on Friday, fired two-over 74 at the Lahore Gymkhana to ensure he and Shoaib will be bunched together at the start of the final round. \nHaving won the first-day event for the J.R. Jayawardene Trophy and followed it by winning the two-round International Team Match alongside Qasim Ali Khan, Salman was part of the Punjab Golf Association Team that won the Inter-Association Team Match. \nAlongside him were Qasim, Hussain Hamid and Damil Ataullah as they finished ahead of the Federal Golf Association team comprising Umair Saleem, Ahmad Zafar Hayat, Umer Khokhar and Abbas Naqvi. \nBut on Saturday, Salman will set his sights on the big prize after he took advantage of Shoaib slipping to a third-round 77 to grab a share of the lead at five-over 221. \nSalman fired three birdies and had two bogies with a triple bogey on the sixth hole preventing him from going clear at the top. By contrast, Shoaib \u2014 who had been a joint-leader with Nouman Ilyas after the opening round before moving three shots in front on Thursday \u2014 had just one birdie to show for his efforts on a day where he faltered to a double bogey and four bogeys. \nBut the contest for the title isn\u2019t going to be between just the two of them with Ahmed Zafar (25) a stroke adrift while Sameer Iftikhar, who returned an impressive two-under 70, is on 224. Sameer, who went bogey-free, is a stroke in front of Sri Lankan Chalitha Pushpika (73) and Egypt\u2019s Dean Naime (72). \nThe three-round ladies competition also looks to go down the wire on Saturday with Humna Amjad storming to the top with a two-round aggregate of 152, just one shot ahead of overnight leader Parkha Ijaz. Aania Farooq is nine strokes off the lead with Suneya Osama (166), Dania Syed (167) and Rimsha Ijaz (170) further off the pace. \nHumna and Dania, meanwhile, combined to help the Pakistan \u2018A\u2019 Team win the International Ladies Match. \nThe Senior Amateurs contest was wrapped up on Friday with Sardar Murad Khan (78) clinching the title with a three-round aggregate of 231, finishing eight strokes in front of Col Mohammad Shafi while Azfar Hassan took third place.\n"

            "Text": "WASHINGTON: Two leading economists \u2014 Atif Mian and Reza Baqir \u2014 have warned that the current political crisis will have tremendous economic ramifications, but they also hoped that it leads to key structural adjustments in the decision-making process.\nIn a recent discussion on Pakistan\u2019s economic future, which Mr Mian posted online earlier this week, both economists emphasised the need to end excessive political interventions in economic decisions.\nMr Baqir served as the 20th governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, from May 4, 2019 to May 4, 2022.\nMr Mian, a professor of economics at Princeton University, has authored a widely acclaimed book \u2014 \u2018House of Debt\u2019 \u2014 which explains why debt continues to threaten the global economy.\n\nAtif Mian, Reza Baqir want policies to be insulated from political cycles\n\nAsked how to manage the level of fiscal deficit in Pakistan, Mr Baqir suggested that such matters should be tackled by a decision-making body that thinks beyond the political cycle. Another possibility, he said, was to delegate the power of taking such decisions to the finance secretary who is then insulated and protected from political pressure and is guided by an autonomous fiscal council.\n\u201cIt would almost be a waste that as coming out of the (current political) crisis \u2026 we do not make some structural interventions on the economic front and review the governance of the policy-making institutions,\u201d Mr Baqir said in his conversation with Mr Mian.\n\u201cI would want that (technical decisions) are insulated from political cycles, and a policy does not automatically change whenever the identity of the finance minister changes.\u201d\nExplaining the impact of fiscal deficit on the national economy, he pointed out that the year-to-year deficit can vary by three percentage points of GDP. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to have macro-economic stability on a long-term basis if our fiscal deficit swings like this,\u201d he warned.\nAnother possibility, he said, was to involve the opposition, and other key stakeholders in the decision-making process.\nIn his opening remarks, Atif Mian spoke about how educated, young Pakistanis were leaving the country which, according to him, showed a lack of trust in the system.\nThe perception in the investors\u2019 community and those aware of the current situation was that \u201cPakistan is not the place to go to right now,\u201d he said.\nThose in power, he said, needed to understand that where the country was now was a cumulative effect of very bad and poor decisions made at a strategic level, both on the economic and political/security fronts. \u201cThe flip side of that is \u2026 a structural change can take us forward if things were done differently,\u201d he added.\nMr Baqir acknowledged that the majority in the investors community believes \u201cit\u2019s almost too late in an economic sense for Pakistan, which is moving toward an economic implosion \u2026 but I believe that there\u2019s a way forward.\u201d\nThe starting point for turning around the economy, he said, would be to ensure that those in government had the right balance of political representation and of those who are equipped to deal with technical issues.\nA decision like \u201cmaking the right tax policy that\u2019s good for curbing the budget deficit and also gives incentives for growth is a challenge\u201d that needs technical expertise, he said.\nMr Main urged the country\u2019s political leadership to base their decisions on merit, particularly when making high-level appointments.\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing to see that when a new government comes, it lets go of very competent people, because it does not value meritocracy,\u201d he said. \u201cThere has to be a different norm or culture that respects professionalism and is relatively apolitical.\u201d\nMr Baqir also said that professional people needed protection from other stakeholders to do the right thing.\nThe country, he said, needed a system wherein decisions like tackling the deficit were not driven by political cycles, and changes within a government did not impact policies.\n"

            "Text": "KARACHI: The outgoing Sweet Eid has left a bitter aftertaste for many garments, shoes and artificial-jewellery sellers, as inflation-bitten citizens tightened their purse strings because of significant price hikes across the board. \nThe traders have mostly blamed the rupee\u2019s depreciation and the central bank\u2019s curbs on imports for higher prices.\nKapra Market, commonly known as Kagzi Bazaar and located near Memon Masjid at M.A. Jinnah Road, lacked buyers due to high prices of unstitched fabric and shalwar kameez.\nYaqoob Bali, chairman of the Kagzi Bazar Old City Tajir Ittehad, said the price of gents\u2019 blended shalwar kameez fabric arriving from Faisalabad had soared by half on an average over the past year, meaning the fabric selling for Rs400 per metre is now priced at Rs600.\nThe prices of cotton suits have jumped at least 60pc over the past year, and they are available at Rs100 to Rs1,000 per metre depending on the quality.\nWomen\u2019s clothes now sell in the range of Rs1,200 to Rs5,000 per suit after a hike of 50pc in their prices.\nMr Bali estimated that around 30-40pc of men had not made shalwar kameez this Eid, whereas some of them had bought only one suit compared to two to three a year ago. He blamed many factors for the increase in prices, including the rupee\u2019s devaluation, high transport costs due to rising fuel rates, surging power and gas bills, and higher prices of yarn, laces, embroidery and linen.\nSheikh Mohammad Feroz, president of the Society Saddar Cooperative Market Ltd, said this year\u2019s Eid sales remained highly depressed due to a phenomenal jump in the prices of shalwar kameez made of both imported and locally made fabrics.\nSales of children\u2019s shalwar kameez shrank to 60 per cent while those of gents\u2019 suits remained 40pc as compared to last year\u2019s Eid, he said, adding that many traders could only sell half of their shalwar kameez stock, which had dented the profits. He said the landed price of Chinese fabric had doubled to Rs400 per metre over the past year due to the rupee\u2019s fall.\nThe price of the local fabric, mostly coming from Faisalabad, had also hit Rs280 per metre, much higher than last year, he said, adding that plain cotton shalwar kameez were sold at Rs2,500 apiece while embroidered ones were available at Rs3,500-4,000.\nThe secretary general of the All-City Tajir Ittehad (ACTI), Mohammad Ahmed Shamsi, said the presence of imported items relating to Eidul Fitr had remained dismal this year due to the central bank\u2019s decision to curb the inflow of finished imported items, unpredictable exchange rate and high import duties.\nAs a result, smuggling of confectionery, bakery, children-related items, shampoo, soaps, crockery, electronic, artificial jewellery, etc., continued to fill the demand-supply gap.\nHe said many importers had left their genuine import trade and had been waiting for the rupee\u2019s stability, the government\u2019s action to control the influx of smuggled goods, removal of high duties, taxes and restrictions on imports.\nA dealer in children\u2019s garments at North Nazimabad\u2019s Hyderi Market said imported garments and shoes had become costlier by 40pc in the past year, whereas only 20pc imports were made due to high costs on account of the rupee\u2019s depreciation against the dollar. \u201cThe sale of children\u2019s garments and shoes have remained pegged at 40pc this year,\u201d he said.\nSyed Mohammad Saeed, president of the All Hyderi Business Traders and Welfare Association, said sales of kids\u2019 imported garments, shoes, accessories, etc., remained low. At the same time, items produced by the local industries managed to bridge the demand and supply gap. However, a high cost of living had resulted in a drop of 30-40pc in sales of Eid-related items, he said.\nThe president of Tariq Road Traders Alliance, Ilyas Memon, said imports of children\u2019s garments and shoes coming through legal channels had dropped 60-70pc this year, while some quantities continued to arrive from informal channels.\nThough the local industry got its share of imported items, it could not fully utilise its potential due to people\u2019s shrinking purchasing power.\nGold rises\nMeanwhile, domestic gold prices hit another all-time high of Rs219,500 per tola and Rs188,186 per 10 grams on Saturday, showing an overnight jump of Rs686 and Rs800, respectively.\nAccording to the All Sindh Saraf Jewellers Association, global gold prices went up by $6 per ounce to $1,990.\nWhen the year began, the price of gold was Rs187,200 per tola and Rs160,494 per 10g on the domestic market and $1,824 per ounce on the global market.\n"

The source is of the view that in case of an agreement between the ruling coalition and the PTI on polls, even though \u201cchances are slim\u201d, party supremo Nawaz Sharif will try to win the Maulana over.\nMr Dar briefed the huddle on economic challenges and the staff-level agreement progress with the IMF. \u201cNawaz Sharif asked Ishaq Dar to step up efforts to secure an agreement with the IMF, saying the party would go into elections after giving relief to the masses,\u201d the source said.\nBudget prerogative of party with mandate\nIn an interactive session with party workers in Lahore via Zoom, Mr Khan expressed disconcertment with the PDM government\u2019s logic to dissolve the assembly only after passing the budget for the next financial year. The former prime minister said the government was being \u201ccompletely illogical\u201d as only a government with the people\u2019s mandate should pass the budget.\nOn \u201cbehalf of the whole nation\u201d, PTI chief Imran Khan made an impassioned appeal to all judges of the Supreme Court to \u201cget united and save the country\u201d from an imminent disaster as Constitution was \u201cbeing discredited and people being denied of their fundamental rights\u201d.\nHe said the Punjab and KP caretaker governments had become illegal and asked whether the Punjab caretaker government took any step towards holding of elections in the province.\n\u201cWhat is the constitutional status of the Punjab caretaker government, why it is working, and who is behind this government and compelling it to do all kinds of illegal things,\u201d the PTI chief asked the apex court judges.\nWarning to powers-that-be\nMr Khan said people of Pakistan were coming out for peaceful protests under the banner of the PTI as they were waiting for elections. \u201cIf elections will be denied, these people will not stay peaceful and Pakistan may face a situation worse than Sri Lanka,\u201d Mr Khan said in a warning to the powers-that-be.\nThe PTI chief also announced Labour Day rallies in Lahore, Islamabad and Peshawar on May Day (Monday) with a secondary objective: \u2018Save Constitution \u2013 Save Pakistan\u2019. Mr Khan said he would lead the Lahore rally from Liberty to Nasser Bagh, while Shah Mahmood Qureshi and Pervez Khattak will lead rallies in Islamabad and Peshawar, respectively.\nAccording to Fawad Chaudhry, the PTI has rejected the attempts to sabotage the talks and decided that the negotiations with the government would continue on the issue of elections in light of the top court order and the Constitution. The final agenda will be discussed on Tuesday, he tweeted.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nShah Mehmood Qureshi said the coalition government was divided over talks with the PTI, as the PML-N leadership was engaging the PTI for talks while PDM President Maulana Fazalur Rehman and PML-N leader Khawaja Asif were opposing the dialogue. \u201cIf the PDM coalition government wants to carry forward the ongoing dialogue, it should convince leaders within its ranks and create an enabling environment to go ahead,\u201d Mr Qureshi said and added that the raid at Chaudhry Parvez Elahi\u2019s residence had destroyed the environment for talks.\nThe PTI leader said Imran Khan has been briefed on the first and second rounds of talks and added that the party chairman was privy to all the details of the dialogue.\n"

The raiding party used an armoured vehicle to break open the main gate of the residence after facing resistance. However, the ACE team could not find Mr Elahi, even after thoroughly searching the house.\n \n         View this post on Instagram            \n\nSeparately on Saturday, Rasikh Elahi petitioned the Lahore High Court (LHC) to restrain authorities from arresting Mr Elahi until the expiry of his protective bail on May 6.\nIn his plea, the son of the former CM contended that his father was granted protective bail till May 6 by the high court on April 28 in a corruption case registered by the ACE.\nHowever, on the same night, a team of the anti-graft body accompanied by a heavy contingent of anti-riot police attacked his family residence on Zahoor Elahi Road to arrest his father, the petitioner added.\nAccording to the plea, police trespassed on Mr Elahi\u2019s house and violated the sanctity of their home, which amounted to contempt of court. The petitioner pleaded that the ACE be directed to furnish details of all cases registered against the former chief minister so that a legal remedy could be availed. He also urged the court to restrain the anti-corruption body and the police from arresting Mr Elahi till the expiry of his protective bail.\nHe further asked the court to restrain the police from arresting any family member of Parvez Elahi and order police to clear Zahoor Elahi Road. The petition has been fixed for May 2 before Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar.\n\u2018Enough is enough\u2019\nPTI chief Imran Khan st\u00adr\u00ado\u00adngly condemned the \u201cill\u00adegal raid\u201d on Parvez Ela\u00adhi\u2019s house and asserted that \u201cenough is enough\u201d. He said the Constitution, the Supreme Court\u2019s verdicts, and the fundamental rights of the people were being disrespected, and the law of the jungle was being imposed in the country.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are seeing the dismantling of democracy in Pakistan before our eyes,\u201d he said in a comment on the raid. He announced that he would present a roadmap to the nation on how to resist the destruction of the Constitution and democracy and added that the crackdown on the PTI was part of the alleged \u2018London Plan\u2019 to demoralise and crush the opposition party.\n\u201cThey attacked my house and now [the] same [is] being done to Parvez Elahi by [the] cabal of crooks and handlers. \u201cWe did not even see such barbarism in Musharraf\u2019s martial law,\u201d he added.\n\u201cHas the state dared to break into the homes of the looters and money laundering Sharif and Zardari families in this manner? Enough is enough,\u201d he warned.\nSpeaking to media persons after visiting the residence of Parvez Elahi, PTI Vice Chairman Shah Mehmood Qureshi said the prime minister and the caretaker chief minister should \u201copenly own or disown\u201d the raid. \u201cIt will be strange if the PM and caretaker CM will stay aloof from their responsibilities,\u201d he commented.\nMr Qureshi said PTI\u2019s every worker was standing alongside Mr Elahi and added that all \u201cthose involved in the late-night raid did not even consider the help\u201d the former chief minister extended to them during his tenures.\nThe PTI leader said the raid on the residence of Parvez Elahi was similar to the police action at Zaman Park, as police crashed the main gates and desecrated the sanctity of four walls and the women present inside. He urged the PTI workers to stay united and face this trying time and added this too shall pass.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDar disowns raid\nSeparately, in a phone call with PTI leader Shah Mehmood Qureshi, PML-N leader Ishaq Dar said the federal government had nothing to do with the raid on the house of the former Punjab CM. He expressed grave concerns and claimed that the police action was orchestrated by the caretaker government.\nMansoor Malik also contributed to this report\n"

It has been an honour that the lawyers of Balochistan have taken the initiative, be it constitutional crisis, martial law or the supremacy of parliament in the country,\u201d they added.\n\nBalochistan bar convention demands institutions work within their own constitutional limits\n\nThe lawyers\u2019 leaders were of the opinion that elevation of judges to the Supreme Court should be on the basis of seniority, adding that reappointment of retired judges, generals and bureaucrats in institutions should be banned to accommodate fresh and energetic persons on vacant posts.\nAdvocate Rahab Bilidi, a member of the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC), said that lawyers belonging to Balo\u00adch\u00adistan had always stood by the supremacy of the Constitution and parliament and opposed martial law in times of constitutional crisis in the country.\nFormer president of the Balochistan High Court Bar Association Abdul Majeed Kakar said lawyers had rendered many sacrifices and suffered hardships for upholding the sup\u00adremacy of the Constitution and law.\nFormer attorney general for Pakistan Irfan Qadir, while speaking through video link, said the country is going through political and constitutional crises and the \u201crole of the chief justice of Pakistan and like-minded judges is sad\u201d.\nAhmed Farooq Khattak, a former member of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Bar Council, said the lawyers\u2019 movement becomes successful when it starts from Balochistan.\n\u201cConstitutional and legal matters are left to three judges of the Supreme Court. They do not consider themselves as judges, Qazi or Munsif, but as \u2018police officers\u2019. Six junior judges are sitting in the Supreme Court and I condemn the current government as it voted for junior judges under pressure. The nation is facing a constitutional crisis due to the evaluation of junior judges to the apex court,\u201d he added.\nMr Khattak accused former CJP Saqib Nisar of giving the \u201cdictator [army chief] a three-year extension\u201d, adding that Justice Nisar and favourites always disrespected fellow jud\u00adges. Lawyers should raise their voice against such disrespect, he added.\nSenior vice president of the Supreme Court Bar Association Yousuf Mughal and Islamabad Bar Council\u2019s Adil Aziz said the Supreme Court should uphold the truth and make decisions based on justice.\nSindh Bar Council vice chairman Azhar Abbasi said that \u201cwe are not against anyone, but we are raising our voice to remove objections against the Supreme Court so that the prestige of the top court is restored\u201d. \u201cThere are serious questions raised over the suo motu powers and the addition of favourites to the bench.\u201d\nFormer chairman of the BBC Salim Lashari said the supremacy of the Constitution would be established when all the institutions remain within their limits.\n\u201cIf the constitutional limits are crossed, then the constitutional supremacy does not exist; the Supreme Court is the last court of the country which needs a lot of caution. \u2018Judges Club\u2019 is formed when junior judges are elevated to the Supreme Court,\u201d he said, adding that lawyers all over the country should stand by the Constitution and not by any particular class.\n"

Biden\u2019s criticism of the North is  \u201cnonsensical...from the person in his dotage,\u201d Kim Yo Jong said, employing language similar to that used to attack former president Donald Trump.\nIn a heated exchange on Twitter and in state media between Trump and Kim Jong Un in 2017, Kim called the former real estate mogul  \u201ca dotard\u201d. Trump called Kim  \u201clittle rocket man\u201d in return.\nIn a further swipe at the 80-year-old Biden\u2019s age, Kim\u2019s sister said that he was  \u201cnot at all capable of taking the responsibility... an old man with no future\u201d. She added it was  \u201ctoo much for him to serve out the two-year remainder of his office term\u201d, before then calling South Korean President Yoon a  \u201cfool\u201d. Seoul condemned Kim Yo Jong\u2019s  \u201cfar-fetched\u201d statement.\nIt  \u201creflects its nervousness and frustration at the drastically strengthened nuclear deterrence of the Korea-US alliance,\u201d South Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry said.\nThe ministry, which is in charge of inter-Korean relations, added that the statement\u2019s  \u201crude language\u201d demonstrated  \u201cthe North\u2019s lowly level\u201d.\nKim\u2019s statement indicates military tensions around the Korean peninsula could  \u201cdramatically escalate to a level similar from 2017\u201d, Cheong Seong-chang of the Center for North Korea Studies at the Sejong Institute said.\n"

The drugmaker filed its product, a two-step treatment of mifepristone and misoprostol, for approval in Japan in December 2021.\nSimilar medication is available in many countries including France, which first approved the abortion pill in 1988, and the United States, where it has been available since 2000.\nThe approval of the pill to end pregnancies up to nine weeks follows a ministry panel endorsement, which was postponed for a month as thousands of public opinions were submitted.\nNational broadcaster NHK said the total cost of the abortion pill and a medical consultation would be around 100,000 yen ($700). Abortions are not covered by public health insurance. Surgical abortions can cost around 100,000 to 200,000 yen.\nMifepristone has been at the centre of a high-profile US court battle in recent weeks.\nThe US Supreme Court has temporarily preserved access to the widely used abortion drug, freezing rulings by lower courts that would have banned or severely restricted its availability.\n"

            "Text": "NEW DELHI: An unnamed middleman in Mumbai provided a crucial raw material used in Indian-made cough syrups that have been linked to the deaths of more than 70 children in Gambia, a chemicals trader involved in the supply chain said.\nThe World Health Organisation said last year the syrups, made by Indian manufacturer Maiden Pharmaceuticals Ltd, contained lethal toxins ethylene glycol (EG) and diethylene glycol (DEG) used in car brake fluid. These ingredients can be used by unscrupulous actors as a substitute for propylene glycol (PG), which is a key base of syrupy medicines because they can cost less than half the price. The children who died were mostly under age 5 and died of acute kidney injury, some within days of taking the syrups.\nIndia\u2019s drugs regulator told the WHO in December that the propylene glycol used in the syrups came from Goel Pharma Chem, a Delhi-based pharma-supplies company, and was  \u201crecorded to have been imported\u201d from South Korean manufacturer SKC Co Ltd.\nSharad Goel, whose eponymously named company is based in north Delhi, said he had bought the ingredient in sealed barrels but not directly from SKC. \u201cWe bought the propylene glycol from an importer in Mumbai who bought it from SKC,\u201d Goel said in February, speaking out for the first time.\n\u201cI can\u2019t name the supplier \u2014 we have business links that we need to keep,\u201d said Goel, adding his company had  \u201cnot done anything wrong.\u201d He said his business was  \u201cjust a trader and we pass on sealed barrels that we get. We can do nothing with them.\u201d \nHe said that after the Gambia poisonings, his company had stopped selling PG but continued to supply other products such as starch, and that he generally buys most of his products from 8-10 importers.\nGoel subsequently stopped answering calls and when a reporter called at his business twice in April, it was locked. Workers at a neighbouring factory said they had not seen it opening in the past few months. SKC said it had never supplied any PG either to Goel or to Maiden.\nIf true, Goel\u2019s claim would point to a missing link in investigations by Gambia, India and the WHO into the contaminated products. The clue comes as the WHO and Gambia\u2019s government say the search for a culprit has been stymied by a lack of information from India.\nIndia\u2019s drugs regulator said in December its own tests found no toxins in the syrups, but its factory inspectors did earlier find that batches of medicine may have been incorrectly labeled, according to a notice it sent to Maiden.\nIt has not made clear how, in light of that, it can be sure it tested the correct batch.\nIndia\u2019s health ministry did not respond to questions about the alleged intermediary or about any of the other issues raised in this story.\nAsked to comment on the claim there was a middleman in the supply chain, the WHO\u2019s lead investigator said inquiries have reached a  \u201cdead end\u201d due to a lack of information from the Indian authorities and the drugmaker.\n\u201cIf you ask and you don\u2019t get informed, it\u2019s a dead end,\u201d Rutendo Kuwana, the WHO\u2019s team lead for incidents with substandard and falsified medicines, said in an interview on March 31.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: As many as 21 suspects of mpox have been discharged from the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) after their tests for the viral disease came back negative.\nThe sole mpox patient is also \u201cstable and will be discharged during the next week\u201d, Pims spokesperson Dr Haider Abbasi told Dawn. \u201cThe 41 years old confirmed patient is completely stable and will be discharged from the hospital during the upcoming week,\u201d he said.\nGiving details about the 21 individuals who were discharged, Dr Abbasi said, \u201cMajority of them had arrived from Saudi Arabia and were being suspected as positive for mpox, as the only confirmed patient of mpox had also come from Saudi Arabia. Out of 21 suspects, two had symptoms of mpox and others did not have any symptoms,\u201d he added. According to the spokesperson, all tests came back negative for mpox while two people were tested positive for smallpox.\nIt is worth mentioning that the mpox-positive person had arrived in Islamabad from Saudi Arabia on 17th April, and went to the Pims to get himself tested. \nPims Assistant Professor of Infectious Diseases Dr Naeem Akhtar had identified that the patient could be suffering from mpox and admitted him to the isolation ward.\nLater, it emerged that the patient had mpox and another traveller on board the same flight as him was also reportedly found positive for the disease.\nA senior doctor of Pims, requesting anonymity, said that the patient had cleared the immigration counter and came out of the airport without being identified as a potential mpox patient. \n\u201cNext day the patient came to Pims for a check-up... it shows that he might be deported because of mpox,\u201d the doctor said, adding that the patient had claimed to spend at least 20 years in Jeddah working as a driver.\nThe statement of the patient \u201cfurther strengthens our doubts that he was deported because of mpox... If that is indeed the case, we are astonished that how a patient was deported without informing the authorities of Pakistan that he had contracted mpox,\u201d he added.\nMeanwhile, the World Health Organisation (WHO) in a statement informed that it was working and investigating on the cases of mpox as the situation regarding mpox in Pakistan was still evolving.\n\u201cWHO will assist the Government of Pakistan as per their requirement especially in lab testing, points of entry and provision of testing kits,\u201d it stated.\nMpox \u2014 which spreads via close contact and tends to cause flu-like symptoms and pus-filled skin lesions \u2014 was declared a global health emergency by the WHO in July 2022. \nThe organisation maintained its alert in November.\nIn November, the WHO named the disease Mpox to replace the older term monkeypox, citing concerns of stigma and racism associated with the name.\nOn Friday, at least four air travellers suspected of having mpox tested negative for the disease in Karachi.\n"

A senior official of the District Health Authority told Dawn that the provincial government was worried about the spread of measles in the district which led to the death of eight children in just a month.\nHe said that the team checked the record of the anti-measles vaccination drive in the district and sent it to its Lahore office in order to compile a report. \n\nDeaths prompt inquiry into vaccination campaign as officials fear \u2018measles outbreak\u2019\n\nHe said that Dr Waseem met senior officials of the health authority and also interviewed the vaccinators.\nThe official claimed during the last campaign, more than 2.3 million children were vaccinated against measles. \nHowever, in light of these deaths, the health authorities were worried about the authenticity of this drive.\nWhen contacted, Dr Waseem Ahmed confirmed that he visited the offices of district health authorities to investigate the deaths caused by measles. \nHowever, he claimed that it was a routine visit to check the record of vaccination and that a final report in this regard would be complete by the next week. \nThe health official said that he has access to records pertaining to the vaccination drive.\nRegional Director of Health Dr Anser Ishaq told Dawn that he was not aware of any inquiry into the vaccination drive. \nHe agreed that the deaths of children due to measles were alarming. \nHe added that measles vaccines were necessary to protect children from pneumonia, malnutrition, and brain diseases.\nDr Ishaq said that combined vaccines against measles, mumps, and rubella immunise children against measles and added that the first dose of the vaccine should ideally be given to babies, 12-13 months old.\n\u201cChildren are given a second dose also called booster dose before they start school, usually between the ages of three and five. The second dose can also be given three months after the first,\u201d he said, adding that about 5 to 10 per cent of children do not develop complete immunity after the first dose, therefore the second dose is required for increased protection. After the booster dose less than 1pc of children still have the risk of getting measles, Dr Ishaq added.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: President Dr Arif Alvi has directed the Employees\u2019 Old Age Benefit Institution (EOBI) to register a retired female teacher for pensionary benefits within a month.\nThe teacher had been deprived of her pension by the EOBI since February 2019 on the flimsy grounds that she had only three years service to her credit.\nExpressing displeasure over the failure of EOBI to address the grievances of the complainant, the president regretted that EOBI had unnecessarily wasted its precious time by submitting representation against the decision of the Federal Ombudsman who had referred the case to EOBI for resolution within 45 days. \nHe also directed the secretary Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resources Development to take effective measures to enhance the service delivery of EOBI immediately.\nThe complainant Zohra Bibi had stated that she served with the Oxford Public School, Hayatabad, Peshawar, from July 1,1996 to February 2019, which becomes almost 23 years. \nThe complainant also stated that regular contribution from her salary had been deducted and this fact had been admitted by the EOBI. The latter has also admitted that the concerned school was registered with it.\nAccording to Ms Zohra, after retirement she applied for grant of EOBI pension but to no avail. Feeling aggrieved, she approached ombudsman who passed the order in her favour. \nEOBI, then, filed a representation with the president.\nThe president rejected EOBI\u2019s representation and observed that the Registration Card dated Nov 29, 2006 of the pension scheme issued by EOBI was genuine and it was written on the card that the effective date was May 7, 1996; whereas the complainant was eligible for EOBI pension with effect from July 1, 1996. \nHe further pointed out that the contribution was regularly deducted from the monthly salary of the complainant and it was admitted by EOBI that the school concerned was also registered for pensionary benefits of its employees. \nHe said that EOBI had failed to computerise complete record of that school and also failed to recover its share, if any, from the school, and resultantly the low paid female complainant was kept deprived of her due pension since February 2019.\nWhile rejecting the EOBI petition, the president stated that the pension was not a bounty rather an employee earned it by dint of his long, continuous and faithful service and this constituted a fundamental right to livelihood under Article 9 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, adding that this hard-earned right could not be denied to a pensioner except in accordance with law.\n"

            "Text": "KARACHI: The National Commission for Justice and Peace (NCJP) organised an education conference on the implications of the Single National Curriculum (SNC) at a local hotel here on Saturday.  \nThe objective of the conference was to sensitise the public at the grassroots level and build momentum regarding the implications of a unified curriculum, while specifically addressing the ambiguities and lacunae in the SNC in the context of the political hegemony and exclusion of religious minorities.  \nThe NCJP has conducted an extensive research on the SNC and its implications for religious minorities. Their analytical study on religious bias in education policy and textbooks titled, \u2018Away from a Fairer Future\u2019, was also officially launched during the conference.  \nWhile speaking on the matter, senior educationist Dr A.H. Nayyar said that there were religious instructions even in the English language and Urdu Adab textbooks, a norm from the General Ziaul Haq era. \u201cForcing non-Muslims to study Islamiat violates their basic right, according to Article 22 (1) of the Constitution of Pakistan,\u201d he said.  \n\nImplications of Single National Curriculum discussed at conference\n\n\u201cThere was also a commission formed by the Supreme Court of Pakistan to look into this matter under the leading police and justice sector reform specialist Shoaib Suddle, whose findings noted that Islamiat should be taught as just Islamiat but here there is an overlap of Islamiat in our Urdu, English and Social Sciences textbooks, too. Because of this it is not possible to keep non-Muslim students away from Islamiat,\u201d he said.  \n\u201cAfter all, you can\u2019t ask the non-Muslim students to cover their ears or leave the classroom every time Islamic topics come up in other books. One example of this was the Hamd and Naat in Urdu Adab books. But the Council of Islamic Ideology said that the Hamd and Naat there in the Urdu books were to be taken in the literary context and how could they omit it and ignore the 97 per cent Muslim majority students for the three per cent non-Muslim students?\u201d He said.  \nSpeaking on the implications of SNC on minority girls, Prof Dr Ernest Fahim of Selinus University of Sciences and Literature in Lahore said that minority females have to fight for their education. \u201cThey won\u2019t get it otherwise,\u201d he said.  \n\u201cThere is a need to enhance the primary education of girls here because educating females brings change to society,\u201d he added.  \nDr Asghar Ali Dashti said that the SNC was the Islamisation of curriculum in a country where religious extremism was already prevalent.  \n\u201cThis curriculum divides people into \u2018us\u2019 and \u2018you\u2019. The \u2018us\u2019 group is superior and the \u2018you\u2019 group is inferior and is thus to be looked down on,\u201d he said.  \n\u201cThe Constitution of Pakistan itself is discriminatory as non-Muslims here cannot head the state. With the SNC now what kind of values are you passing on to impressionable minds? See, forced conversions are happening already here due to social pressure. In fact, all our policies push minorities to either leave the country or convert to Islam,\u201d he said. Educationist and social worker Dr Sabir Michael said that the curriculum should be like the milk fed to a baby by his mother to help him grow. \u201cBut if you get contaminated milk or when you sow a bad seed, you can\u2019t expect a sweet crop. Through the Single National Curriculum we are imposing Islam even though the basic guidelines of the curriculum should revolve around human rights,\u201d he said.  \n\u201cStudying in local schools, my children often ask me if they are \u2018kafir\u2019. I come from a poor background and also happen to be blind and despite that I studied hard and also did my PhD. But people tell me that even after achieving so much in life I\u2019m at a loss because I have not recited the Kalima,\u201d Dr Michael said.  \nDr Riaz Shaikh, Dean of Faculty of Social Sciences and Education at Szabist, said that Pakistan was a unique state where there had been continuous experimentation going on since 1947. \u201cIn 2018, we indulged in yet another experiment of turning the state into Riasat-i-Madina instead of making it a truly secular state,\u201d he said.  \n\u201cWe turn a blind eye to all wrongs here such as lynching of students at university campus or public beatings because \u2018might is right\u2019,\u201d he said.  \n\u201cSNC enforces a mercenary mindset. It will sharpen our identity crisis and reinforce apartheid while making the divide between the haves and have-nots bigger. This country needs scientific education, it needs inclusive education, which it is not getting because this system of education is taking you towards segregation,\u201d he said.  \nReverend Father Asher Liaqat and Naeem Yousaf Gill of NCJP also spoke.\n"

            "Text": "KARACHI: The Sindh Institute of Urology and Transplantation (SIUT) has achieved another milestone when experts performed the first paediatric open-heart surgery at the hospital earlier this week.\nThe patient, five-year-old Zainab, had a hole in the heart, a birth defect that allowed blood to have increased flow towards the lungs resulting in frequent chest infections.\nAccording to SIUT director Dr Adib Rizvi, a team of nine doctors, two perfusionists (those who operate a heart-lung machine), and eight nurses worked hard to ensure safe and successful surgery and post-operative care. The procedure, which took place on April 26, took two hours to complete.\n\u201cZainab tolerated the procedure well and made a remarkable recovery, being able to come off the ventilator within three hours. She has made an excellent recovery and was discharged home on Friday,\u201d he said.\nAccording to him, a lot of planning went into carrying out the first open-heart surgery at the hospital.\n\u201cInitially, a team of cardiologists and their support staff established a paediatric cardiology department at SIUT. The purpose wasn\u2019t only to provide a new service but also to develop protocols and processes to make the new division comparable to any international unit which deals with paediatric and congenital heart disease,\u201d Dr Rizvi explained.\nThe institute, he said, was a patient-centric facility aimed at providing free, high-quality care with dignity and compassion to all patients without any discrimination.\n\u201cThe facility is being expanded, offering newer facilities and specialties to cater to the complex healthcare demands of the people. It has transformed from an eight-bed ward into an institute of urology and transplantation, also having services for robotic surgery and now paediatric heart surgery,\u201d he said.\n"

            "Text": "KARACHI: Highlighting factors that impede efforts for people with disabilities, Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah said on Saturday that it\u2019s not the matter of monetary resources but rather of trained and dedicated manpower that could turn individuals with special needs into skilled workforce.\nHe was speaking at a seminar titled Autism: current challenges and the way forward organised by the Pakistan Centre for Autism (PCA) at a local hotel here.\n\u201cFunds are not an issue for the cause of persons with disabilities including those living with autism. The issue is the availability of dedicated, devoted and trained manpower,\u201d he told the audience.\nThe government, he said, was actively supporting the private sector working for people with special needs and was ready to provide funds to the private sector in this respect.\n\nKarachi alone has 40,000 children with autism, moot told\n\n\u201cWe are ready to provide funds if the private sector extends assistance and helps people with disabilities become productive citizens of the country,\u201d he said.\nThe government, the chief minister pointed out, had already enacted the Sindh Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities Act 2018 to protect the rights of persons with special needs and punish those who dare violate their rights.\n\u201cA massive exercise and hard work went into preparing and enacting this law in 2018, which covers all kinds of disabilities, including autism. The government has also set up centres for education and training of children with autism in Karachi and Hyderabad,\u201d he said.\n350,000 children with autism in country\nEarlier, Prof Abdul Gaffar Billoo presented a welcome note and spoke about the alarming increase in autism. He disclosed that there were around 350,000 children with autism in the country out of whom 40,000 were in Karachi.\nDr Billoo called for spreading awareness about autism, pointing out that the majority of doctors had no knowledge about this disorder.\n\u201cIf a child isn\u2019t speaking by the age of two and a half years, it means there is an issue with the child. Parents should consult with doctors when they feel that their child has problems with his movement and speech,\u201d he said.\nHe defined Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) as a developmental disability caused by differences in the brain. \u201cPeople with ASD often have problems with social communication and interaction and restricted or repetitive behaviours or interests. They may also have different ways of learning, moving, or paying attention. If the therapy of such children is carried out well in time, the issues get resolved,\u201d Dr Billoo said.\nDisclosing that there were only 15 centres with trained staff, he emphasised the need for opening more ASD centres in the country.\nAlliya Batool, representing PCA, spoke about the neglected domains in the rehabilitation of persons with ASD, highlighting that often parents did not take their children with ASD to social gatherings out of fears that they would be taunted.\n\u201cAs a result, the challenge such children are facing aggravates. Hence, it is important that parents help their children learn socialising skills and allow them to participate in gatherings as well as educational and recreational activities,\u201d Batool said.\nShe regretted that there were cases wherein parents wanted to take their children with ASD to parks but the park administration denied their entry.\nNoting this point, the chief minister directed the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation and district municipal corporations to look into this complaint and dedicate parks for children with disabilities.\n"

            "Text": "\n\n\n \nKARACHI: A book titled Pakistan: Origins, Identity and Future written by eminent physicist and writer Pervez Hoodbhoy was launched at the Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) House on Saturday evening. \nBusiness and economy journalist Khurram Husain moderated the event. The first question that he put to the author was about the first part of the publication\u2019s subtitle, origins. Mr Hoodbhoy replied the reason for writing the book was that the history that was taught at Pakistani schools and colleges was \u2018full of lies\u2019. When he was about 16 or 17 years of age he felt something was wrong, he said. \nHe thought of the 1965 war about which he had earlier felt happy. He himself tried to get into the armed forces but no one accepted him. It was something driven by the passion to defeat India. But later he came to know about Operation Gibraltar conceived by Ayub Khan. Something was not right, he said. \nHe said although he was not a historian, as a citizen he wanted to know how Pakistan came into existence and how it reached the situation that it\u2019s in now. \u201cThe country was made on the basis of the Two-Nation Theory according to which there are only two nations in the subcontinent \u2014 Hindus and Muslims. They couldn\u2019t coexist peacefully therefore they have to separate. Today when we inquire about the beginning of Pakistan, our textbooks suggest that it began in 712 when Mohammad bin Qasim arrived in Sindh and trounced Raja Dahir. He\u2019s the first Pakistani. \n\nAcademic\u2019s book on Pakistan\u2019s origins and future launched \n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not just us [Pakistanis] who have such ideas. In today\u2019s India if you ask about the origin of Hindus, they\u2019ll say they\u2019ve been here from the beginning \u2026 from thousands of years back,\u201d he said. \nReferring to the first part of the first chapter in the book about identity formations in India, Mr Hoodbhoy said, \u201cResearch tells us that in the past there was no such sense of identity [of nations]. If in the days before Muslims came to this region you asked a villager in any part of India who he was, he wouldn\u2019t have said he\u2019s a Hindu; instead, he\u2019d have told you about his village and profession. In other words, the Hindu identity did not exist. Those who follow Hindutva claim that they\u2019ve been here from the beginning, Muslims came later. They also say that Muslims ill-treated them and broke their idols, etc, so we should now take revenge on them.\u201d \nOn the other hand, he said, Muslims claim that prior to their arrival in India it was occupied by uncouth, illiterate people and we civilised them. \nAfter commenting that the Muslim identity too was non-existent in the past, the writer shifted his focus to the Mughal period. \u201cWhen the Mughals came to the region they kept Hindus in their courts as well. The Bhakti movement was a rebellion against the Brahmins. This was the period of syncretism. You couldn\u2019t identify who Muslim or Hindu was. But a new period started with the arrival of the British.\u201d \nMr Hoodbhoy said the British needed [local] people \u2014 doctors, accountants, policemen, etc, \u2014 with whose help they could control the country. They were small in number and wanted to rule over a large land. Hindus were educated, whereas Muslims were hardly educated. The British thought of setting up institutions where science and English would be taught. Hindus welcomed it, Muslims didn\u2019t. In 1835 when Lord Macaulay talked about educational reforms, Hindus asked him to make colleges for them. In 1846, the University of Calcutta was built to which mostly Hindus got admitted. \u201cIf you look at the data in the book you\u2019ll see that the Muslims\u2019 condition vis-\u00e0-vis education was extremely poor.\u201d \nHe said after 1857 a new chapter in history was opened and the two nations [Hindus and Muslims] started to drift apart. \u201cIf it comes to the question of employment, who shall get it and who shan\u2019t, then the difference between people turns into a gulf. At that time someone from the Muslim community named Sir Syed stood up and argued that the reason for Muslims\u2019 downfall was that we couldn\u2019t move along with modern times. That\u2019s how the Two-Nation Theory came about.\u201d \nAt that juncture, the moderator raised the question whether it was inevitable that the end of British rule resulted in partition. Mr Hoodbhoy responded that nothing could be said with absolute certainty.\nThis made Mr Husain touch upon the point that the British Indian army didn\u2019t interfere in civilian affairs. After partition, the army in Pakistan interfered in civilian matters. Mr Hoodbhoy answered that was inevitable. He explained that apart from the Quaid-i-Azam, the Muslims had no leader. There were feudal, businessmen and landlords. There were very few educated people. Two years after Mr Jinnah\u2019s death, the Muslim League got broken because it had a wadera outlook on life. The army was the only disciplined force. \nAfter the conversation, the floor was opened for the audience. Mr Hoodbhoy received a series of queries which he answered with a great deal of patience. \nReplying to a query he said that there\u2019s no difference between the PTI and the PDM. \nAbout the current crisis, he was of the view that the system is about to change and collapse because now no one wants to give us loans.\n"

            "Text": "\n\nSome of the artworks displayed at the exhibition.\u2014Fahim Siddiqi / White Star\n\n \nKARACHI: Moeen Faruqi is an artist with proven and enviable credentials. His paintings, among other things, delineate people and their idiosyncrasies. It is easy to categorise them by using the suffix \u2018ism\u2019, but that wouldn\u2019t do justice to his art. He sensitively expresses himself through another genre \u2014 poetry. This goes to show his creative range for approaching life the struggles associated with it \u2014 either through visuals, colours and shapes or through words arranged in a rhythmic order. \nAn exhibition of Faruqi\u2019s latest body of work titled Continuum is underway at the Canvas Art Gallery. It\u2019s a must-watch show.\n\n\n\n \nWhy does one say this? One says this because this is how the artist describes his latest effort: \u201cI feel there is so much left unsaid and undone in my re-creation of the modern, urban existence. It is an ongoing Karachi Kahani with colourful, contradictory, seemingly impossible characters and situations. These are forms and settings that give meaning both to my work and to my life. This body of work not only carries with it my earlier depiction of the alienation and angst of urban life but also showcases a gradual metamorphosis where the characters appear to have freed themselves of their erstwhile dread.\u201d \nA perceptive reader (read: viewer) will immediately understand that by throwing in words such as \u2018alienation\u2019 and \u2018angst\u2019 against the backdrop of \u2018urban existence\u2019, Faruqi is touching upon the basic existential dilemmas espoused by 20th century philosophers. But what\u2019s remarkable about the 27 exhibits on display is that when one looks at them philosophy takes a back seat and readily identifiable issues related to everyday goings-on in a city come to the fore in the form of a series of memory-driven moving images.\n\u2018Estranged Family\u2019 and the \u2018Karachi Kahani\u2019 series are packed with myriads of stories led by characters. Their faces with eyes being their prominent features are dour which, in a manner of speaking, is a give-away. When Faruqi uses colours, the dourness is hard to miss; and when he does that with ink on Canson paper, it merges with lines and shapes to give it a collective feel. This is visual poetry. Top-notch stuff! \nThe exhibition concludes on May 4.\n"

            "Text": "HYDERABAD: The Accoun-tability Court-II has directed National Accountability Bureau to file reference in the multibillion rupees land scam case of M6 Hyderabad-Sukkur Motorway\u2019s Matiari section.  \nThe judge Mehboob Ali Dayo on Friday issued the directive and adjourned the hearing till May 11 after he was informed by NAB prosecutor that inquiry in an identical land scam case of M6 Naushahro Feroze district\u2019s section had already been transferred to NAB.  \nThe case was simultaneously pending trial in provincial anticorruption court in Sukkur and banking court in Karachi. Now the case would be transferred to NAB Hyderabad for carrying out formal inquiry after DG NAB\u2019s permission. \nOn Friday, all the accused in the M6 Matiari case appeared in the court. Jurial Shah, junior clerk in Matiari DC office was on bail while former Matiari deputy commissioner Adnan Rasheed, former assistant commissioner Saeedabad Mansoor Ali Shah, former Sindh Bank manager Tabish Ali Shah and Ashiq Kaleri were brought to the court from Nara prison Hyderabad where they were interned. Aslam Pirzada and Illahi Bux, who were granted interim pre-arrest bail in the case by Sindh High Court, also attended the hearing. \n\nAccused given last chance to file objections on freezing of their bank  accounts, properties\n\nNAB\u2019s investigating officer Irfan Ali submitted compliance report about freezing of properties of accused Ashique Hussain Kaleri, a private person, his family members and benamidars.  \nBeneficiaries of properties Mehrunnissa, Farhana, Shaukat Ali, Nusrat and Shakil Ahmed filed undertaking along with affidavits which were made part of the record. \nThe court passed the order for freezing properties of the accused Ashiq Hussain Kaleri, his family members and benamidars under section 12 (c) of the National Accountability Ordinance (NAO), 1999, and issued a letter to authorities concerned for compliance of the order for freezing of properties. \nThe court issued non-bailable warrants for absconding accused, Raheel Ahmed Shaikh, Rehmatullah Solangi and Asghar Ali Jatoi. Ayaz Hussain Tunio filed a statement along with application for acceptance of plea bargain under section 25(b) NAO, 1999, along with affidavit of his client, Ashique Hussain Kaleri. \nThe court forwarded the original application for plea bargain to NAB director general Karachi for its disposal according to the law.  \nThe counsel submitted application for unfreezing of bank account of Ashique Kaleri, his sons Ali Raza and Babar Ali on which the court issued notices to NAB prosecutor and sought report from the investigating officer in this regard.  \nAccording to Kaleri\u2019s counsel, Ayaz Tunio, his family members informed the court that they were ready to surrender the property. Kaleri was arrested in Karachi on Jan 21 by NAB officials, who recovered Rs137,590,000 from his possession. \nMohammad Zubair, one of the defense counsels, submitted applications to seek extension in time to file objection on application of freezing of bank accounts and properties of Subhan Khatoon and others. The court allowed his application as a last chance to file objections, if any, till next date of hearing. \nThe IO also submitted application under section 344 CrPC for adjournment and grant of time to complete the investigation in order to file final reference of the case till next date of hearing. The court adjourned the matter till May 11 with directives to produce the accused before the court. \nThe M6 land scam case was unearthed in November in Matiari district where former DC, AC and Sindh Bank area manager were arrested in connection with Rs2.3 billion embezzlement and suspicious transaction of funds deposited by National Highway Authority (NHA) for the acquisition of land for M6 project. \nThe funds were withdrawn in cash from the bank on the directives of the former AC, who was acting as land acquisition officer (LAO). The funds were withdrawn in cash even without passage of land acquisition award under section 11 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, by the LAO. \nIn Naushahro Feroze, around Rs2.52bn were embezzled in the land scam for the disbursement of land acquisition award to landowners for the land to be used for M6 Sukkur-Hyderabad motorway.  \nNaushahro Feroze DC Tashfeen Alam Khan had fled abroad after the scam was unearthed and he was subsequently suspended by Sindh government. \nMatiari DC Adnan Rasheed was, however, arrested soon after detection of the fraud by the inquiry team appointed by Sindh Chief Secretary Dr Mohammad Sohail Rajput in November 2022.  \nThe funds in both the land scam cases of Matiari and Naushahro Feroze were transferred by NHA, which was land acquiring agency in the project.\n"

The SHRC remains committed to fostering an environment of tolerance and peaceful coexistence.\u201d\nMr Krishan Sharma from the National Lobbying Delegation and Mr Sukhdev (a political figure) gave a presentation on the evolution of Hindu personal laws in Sindh.\nMr Sharma said: \u201cWe are pleased to share our knowledge on the historical evolution of Hindu personal laws in Sindh. This workshop provides an opportunity to enhance understanding of these laws and their significance for the Hindu community.\u201d\nMs. Pushpa Kumari (also from the National Lobbying Delegation) discussed the \u2018Prospects of Sindh Hindus Marriages Laws\u2019, and said: \u201cThe Sindh Hindus Marriage (Amendment) Act 2018 is an important piece of legislation that provides legal protection to the Hindu community in Sindh. However, there is a need for greater awareness and understanding of these laws to ensure their effective implementation.\u201d\nBarrister Rida Tahir talked on \u2018Issues with the Marriage Registration Process\u2019 based on SHRC observations and perspectives. She said: \u201cThe SHRC has identified several issues with the marriage registration process including delays and lack of access to information. We hope that this workshop will provide an opportunity to identify possible solutions to these challenges\u201d.\nThe workshop concluded with an open discussion on possible interventions to enhance marriage registrations.\nSpeaking about the discussion, Mr Detho said: \u201cWe have had a productive discussion on ways to enhancing marriage registrations in Sindh and it\u2019s encouraging to see such engagement and commitment from stakeholders.\u201d\nLastly, Mr. Detho emphasized the need for effective implementation of the Act. He noted that rules were framed in December 2017 whereas a notification from the local government for its implementation came out in July 2019.\nHe stressed on continued collaboration among stakeholders to ensure effective implementation of the Act.\nHe hoped that this workshop would help stakeholders develop a roadmap for further action.\nThe workshop was attended by civil society members, legal experts and representatives of the Hindu community, besides the officials concerned.\n"

Funds were also being negotiated with the World Bank for the flood control project, they said.\nGiving brief details of the plan, the sources said that two small dams would be built in the Kohistan belt whereas the Ochto outfall drain would also be converted into a small dam. The rain and flood waters stored in the three dams would be used to irrigate lands in Thatta and some other remote coastal areas.\nWith enhanced capacity, the Haleji and Hudero lakes would cater to the drinking water requirement of coastal districts, including those of Karachi.\nMeanwhile, Pakistan Peoples Party MPA Ali Hassan Zardari, speaking to Dawn, said that he was in constant touch with the officials concerned of the irrigation and coastal highway departments for the timely commencement of the projects.\nHe pointed out that all those projects and schemes launched in the current tenure of the PPP government had either been completed or were nearing completion. He appeared confident that the chronic issue of water scarcity in Thatta district would stand resolved soon.\n"

            "Text": "GUJRAT: It seems the gluttony of the private housing schemes mafia and the power that be supporting it has no end in Pakistan as another scam has surfaced in which about 100 villagers in Mandi Bahauddin have been deprived of almost 1,000 kanals of land in their own village without their knowledge.\nThe housing society involved in the scam is connected with a property tycoon of the country, presented as an example of success by many who ignore the foul play in the business of land done with the connivance of corrupt state departments.\nA major scam of land has been unearthed in Malakwal tehsil of Mandi Bahauddin district where at least 100 villagers have been deprived of around 1,000 kanals of their ancestral land through illegal transactions of ownership in the official land record by the officials of the revenue department.\nThe said land located in Rukkan village, 17km away from Malakwal, was later on mutated in the name of a housing society owned by the grandson of a property tycoon.\n\n1,000 kanals in Mandi Bahauddin village transferred to housing scheme without owners\u2019 knowledge\n\nThe matter has been under investigation by the Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE). Mandi Bahauddin Deputy Commissioner Shahid Marth had referred it to the ACE.\nA case has already been lodged with the ACE against Malakwal tehsildar, a patwari, gardawar and some private persons under sections of the Pakistan Penal Code and the Anti-Corruption Act.\nHowever, so far only a tehsildar, namely Raja Aftab, and four private persons have been arrested and the other prime suspects particularly Patwari Raja Rizwan could not be arrested as he has reportedly fled abroad to avoid legal action against him. An alleged frontman of the housing scheme is on interim bail in the case.\nOfficial sources say the ACE has been probing at least two more such cases of land fraud in the same village with the villagers after which the DC ordered to stop any further transaction into the land record of ownership in Rukkan.\nMandi Bahauddin DC Shahid Marth told Dawn by telephone that as per the initial inquiry, the illegal transactions were made from December last year till the first week of February on the pretext of rectification of the record as the land had been mutated to the other people without knowledge of the actual owners and the same land was then transferred to the housing scheme through a registered sale deed.\nThe DC said he had come to know about the matter within two weeks of assuming the charge in Mandi Bahauddin in February. The initial probe was conducted and he referred the matter to the ACE for legal action, the DC said and added that in the inquiry so far, at least 99 owners of some 94 acres (752 kanals) had been found. Out of 94, around 58 people had already appeared before him and the rest of them were yet to appear whereas he had also issued notices to the management of the housing scheme, revenue officials and others concerned to appear before him for the inquiry.\nAs far as the arrest of the main culprits in the scam is concerned, Mr Marth said, the matter was in the purview of the Mandi Bahauddin circle ACE and the other inquiries might also be attached to the already registered case with the ACE.\nACE Mandi Bahauddin Deputy Director Ziaullah Sohi told Dawn he had been probing the remaining two references in the matter whereas a case had already been lodged in March. He confirmed the arrest of at least five people.\nOfficial sources said Patwari Rizwan had allegedly got posted in the circle through bribing a lawmaker of the then ruling party and further investigation could expose the role of the political figure into the land scam, depriving about 100 villagers of their land without their knowledge.\nIt is learnt that the bail petition of the arrested tehsildar had been dismissed by the Gujranwala anti-corruption court after which he approached the high court where the matter is pending.\nAll the land owners of Rukkan village have been asked by the administration to go to the Arazi Record Centre Malakwal to check their ownership details as the total land of several owners has also been reduced through the said fraud.\n"

Sadly, the Punjab Archives in Lahore\u2019s Secretariat have a similar amount of documents, yet because of the mental change instilled in the Punjab bureaucrats, they remain hidden.\nThe first decision made was that the ruling class would be purely British white EIC employees, while a new \u2018stratum\u2019 below would be created and they would be strictly, initially, non-Punjabis. So in what was a deliberate strategy all clerks, teachers, pleaders (as lawyers were called) and doctors would be Bengalis.\nThere was a reason for this strategy, for a hundred years hence Bengal was conquered, and there they had an array of bureaucrats local to the company. Within the first seven years, 2,891 Bengali speaking persons moved to the Punjab bureaucracy. This number grew to 4,852 by the year 1921. Imagine that all these bureaucrats had moved with their large families and children, and in the process created English-medium schools run by Bengali teachers.\nThe preference of the British rulers was that if these Bengalis converted to Christianity, they would get priority in jobs and salaries. It was through the educational sector that this new class of people above the local population of Punjabis, that they emerged. Here we see, as the archive documents tell us, that a critical decision was made that the medium of education would be English, with Urdu and Hindi being secondary languages. The Punjabi language was to be strictly avoided.\nIt was a view held by almost all EIC British bureaucrats. In a way this is the view that still prevails in a diluted form. Let me put forward two English bureaucrats with opposing views, whose views are documented. Firstly was Dr G.W. Leitner, the famed Orientalist and founder of Government College, Lahore, and the Oriental College, Lahore, who wished that Punjabi be the medium of instruction. He was threatened with deportation.  \nOne dialogue stands out: \u201cMy research shows that in Lahore the Punjabis are more literate than us. We should leave them alone.\u201d\nBut Lord Napier of Magdala, who was present when the Sikhs surrendered after the Second Anglo-Sikh War, strictly presented the opinion: \u201cThe Punjabis are a proud fighting race. They have surrendered because of reasons we all know, but personally they will never surrender. Crush their language and force English on them.\u201d It seems Napier\u2019s suggestion was followed, and in a way is still followed by our Punjab bureaucracy as they see their own language as a threat to \u201cthe unity of the country.\u201d Imagine.\nIn 1861 a Bengali Brahmin named Kali Charan Chatterji came to Punjab after converting to Christianity. He was made headmaster of the Jullander Mission School, moving on to Lahore where he set up a number of English-medium schools. He moved on to become a mathematics teacher in the Government College, Lahore, and then became a director of the Forman Christian College, Lahore.\nThe Bengali Christians moved up the ladder through the educational sector and then so as to appear sort-of secular they set up the Lahore Bhahmo Samaj in 1863. Thus a caste-based allegedly Christian organisation came about which effectively sidelined Sikhs and Muslims, both were seen as threats to British rule. In 1872 they set up Lahore\u2019s first printing press using English and Urdu only.\nThen came a well-known person named Lala Lajpat Rai. Within the Samaj they started off a movement for the use of Hindi and the Devanagari script. This was the beginning of the Urdu-Hindi controversy. In a way this also much later fuelled the Partition movement. Here the need to promote Punjabi faced yet another blockade.\nThe Sikhs wanted the Gurmukhi script in Punjabi for their separate schools, while the Muslims preferred the Shahmukhi script. So here were four language scripts in competition with one another, they being English, Devanagari, Shahmukhi and Gurumukhi. The complex language controversy had taken off, and the British encouraged it, but crushed Punjabi.\nWithin the bureaucracy we see the emergence of the Urdu-Hindi speaking English-medium people who had to show their loyalty to their new masters. Once they proved themselves they started moving towards Punjab. These new bureaucrats could relate more easily to the Punjabi population than the Bengalis.\nBut once Punjab, especially Lahore and Multan, had their own cadre of Punjabi English-medium persons, they were encouraged to join the bureaucracy. This was more encouraged by Punjabis, especially the Sikhs, serving in the armed forces. So the balance started shifting, but on the strict condition that Punjabi was not to be used in schools and in offices.\nCome 1947 and we see each religious group classified with its own version of their beliefs. But Punjabi was strictly avoided. In a way the manner in which the British viewed the medium of instruction prevails still. In the English-medium schools of Lahore if a student speaks in Punjabi he or she is condemned for belonging to the \u2018servant\u2019 class. The Brahmo Samaj lives within our English-speaking elite, of this there can be no denial.\nBut then with the rise of communal politics in both Pakistan and India, the rise of the priestly classes is very visible. The priestly class have become rich based on \u2018donations\u2019 and corruption is no longer condemned. Their entry in politics is for all to see. Punjab that the East India Company wanted to make a \u2018model\u2019 State is today headed towards poverty.\nThe strategy of the East India Company to kill off the very minds of the people lay in killing off their mother tongue. If our \u2018scholars\u2019 somehow manage to go through the archives of the company, of even those held in secret in the Punjab Archives, it will be clear that scholars like Dr Leitner were ignored, while those of Lord Napier were followed. In a way local scholarship is still looked down upon.\nIn a country that spends barely one per cent of its national income on education, what else could be expected? The solution lies in promoting provincial mother tongues as the medium of instruction, with Urdu and English both being also taught. Plus the educational budget should be increased tenfold. If there is any other route, one would like to learn of it.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: An eight-member larger bench of the Supreme Court (SC) will resume hearing a set of petitions challenging a bill seeking to curtail the Chief Justice of Pakistan\u2019s powers on Tuesday, Dawn.com reported.\nThe SC bench will comprise CJP Umar Ata Bandial, Justice Ijazul Ahsan, Justice Munib Akhtar, Justice Sayyad Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi, Justice Mohammad Ali Mazhar, Justice Ayesha Malik, Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi and Justice Shahid Waheed, according to the roster issued on Saturday.\nThe three petitions were filed under Article 184(3) of the Constitution by Advocate Shafay Munir, Raja Amer Khan, Chaudhry Ghulam Hussain and others.\nArticle 184(3) of the Constitution sets out the SC\u2019s original jurisdiction, and enables it to assume jurisdiction in matters involving a question of \u201cpublic importance\u201d with reference to the \u201cenforcement of any of the fundamental rights\u201d of Pakistan\u2019s citizens.\n\nEight-member bench to hear petitions assailing \u2018stayed law\u2019 on May 2\n\nThe bill, titled the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Bill 2023, is aimed at depriving the office of the CJP of powers to take suo motu notice in an individual capacity. It was initially passed by both houses of parliament and sent to the president for his assent. But President Arif Alvi had sent it back, saying that the proposed law travelled \u201cbeyond the competence of parliament\u201d. The bill was subsequently adopted by a joint session of parliament \u2014 albeit with some amendments.\nHowever, while hearing the set of three petitions challenging the bill, the eight-member apex court bench on April 13 ruled that after the bill received either the president\u2019s assent or it was deemed to have been given, the act that \u201ccomes into being shall not have, take or be given any effect nor be acted upon in any manner\u201d \u2014 halting the law\u2019s implementation when the bill came into effect.\nThe PDM coalition government was swift to reject the apex court\u2019s ruling. However, President Alvi again refused to give his assent to the bill on April 19 and returned it to parliament, following which it technically became an act of parliament on April 21.\nPetitions\nThe three petitions argued that the concept, preparation, endorsement and passing of the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Bill, 2023 is an act tainted with mala fide. Therefore, they urge the SC to strike it down after declaring it to be without lawful authority and of no legal effect.\nThe impugned bill is ultra vires and an unconstitutional measure, in sheer violation of the constitutional mandate, the petitions said, adding that the federal government has committed a blatant violation of the Constitution.\nThe federal government, law secretaries as well as principal secretaries to the premier and president have been named as respondents in the case.\nThe bill states that a three-member bench, comprising the CJP and the two senior-most judges of the apex court, will decide whether or not to take up a matter suo motu. Previously, this was solely the prerogative of the CJP.\nThe legislation also includes the right to file an appeal within 30 days of the judgement in a suo motu case and that any case involving constitutional interpretation will not have a bench of fewer than five judges. The bill seeks to allow former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and other parliamentarians disqualified by the Supreme Court under suo motu powers (such as Jahangir Tareen) to appeal their disqualification within 30 days of the law\u2019s enactment.\nThe petitioners further argued the parliament could not make a law that was inconsistent with the referred provisions of the Constitution. They contended that if any appeal could be allowed by a legislative enactment, the same could only be available through an amendment to the Constitution.\n"

            "Text": "LAHORE: The audio-leak saga on Saturday took an interesting turn as a fresh clip emerged, purportedly featuring the voice of the son of former chief justice Saqib Nisar, demanding a \u201creward\u201d for a \u201cjob done for a PTI ticket candidate\u201d.\nIn the audio, a voice purported to be that of Najam Saqib can be heard saying to the person on the other end that his father had worked very hard to get the job done and the caller on the other side, said to be PTI ticket hopeful Abuzar Chaddhar, can be heard saying he would come to meet Najam\u2019s father after submitting the ticket.\nIn the clip, the voice said to be Najam\u2019s can also be heard asking Mr Chaddhar to meet his father the same day and, in conversation with another caller \u2014 identified as Mian Uzair \u2014 asking for \u201cnot only delivery of the goods, don\u2019t take less than 120\u201d.\n\nFormer chief justice admits recommending current ticket holder, says he can intercede on anyone\u2019s behalf\n\nMr Chaddhar was granted a PTI ticket in the second phase when party chairman Imran Khan reviewed and changed his earlier decision for 22 seats.\nIn the audio, a voice purported to be of Mr Chaddhar\u2019s can be heard as saying that \u201cyour efforts have paid off\u201d and he would come straight to meet him [ex-CJP] after submitting the ticket [with the ECP] before 12 noon.\nAfter the first phase of interviews, Mr Khan had granted party ticket to Malik Iqbal for PP-137 (Sheikhup\u00adura-III). However, he changed the decision allegedly after the former CJP\u2019s intervention and recommendation.\nAccording to Geo News, the former CJP confirmed that the audio was of his son\u2019s but that the facts had been \u201cdoctored\u201d.\nAdmitting that he had recommended Mr Chaddhar for the PTI ticket, the ex-CJP said he was now a private person and could recommend anyone and no one should have any issue about it. He, however, denied taking any bribe for the recommendation and said, \u201cA curse on those who take money\u201d.\nThe former CJP also said that those who recorded his son\u2019s conversation were \u201chypocrites\u201d.\nReacting to the audio leak, PML-N chief organiser Maryam Nawaz castigated the former CJP in her tweet saying, \u201cThink, those who have retired now, how would they be misusing their powers when they were occupying offices\u201d.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said that PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif was silent but the cruel faces of conspirators and their nexus were getting exposed every day.\nIn another tweet, she stated, \u201cThink, sitting on the apex seat of justice, the decisions of the fate of the state are being made for the sake of entertaining mothers-in-law, sons-in-law and children or for their financial interests\u201d.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the history of the world, Ms Nawaz added, such a hideous judicial joke had never happened to any state.\nShe said that those who imposed Imran Khan and the former CJP were the criminals of Pakistan and deserve punishment. \u201cThe state is waiting for justice!\u201d she demanded.\nMeanwhile, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Interior Attaullah Tarar told a news conference that evidence in the form of audiotapes of getting bribe for grant of tickets to the candidates had exposed the real face of PTI and its belief in justice.\n\u201cFrom the PTI chief to other senior leaders, including Senator Ejaz Chaudhry, everyone has been found involved in bribery, as disclosed in the audiotapes, making rounds on the social media,\u201d he said.\nMr Tarar said PTI claimed itself to be a party based on justice, but its entire leadership was involved in minting money for award of party tickets. \u201cIt is a serious matter and needs to be investigated,\u201d he added.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: South Asia is one of the regions most at risk due to extreme heat but the majority of its urban areas are ill-equipped to deal with the phenomenon, which is increasing in frequency, severity and complexity due to climate change.\nThis was stated in a new World Bank report which said that the region, home to a quarter of the world\u2019s population, was accustomed to extreme heat, but rapid urbanisation and climate change were pushing the region\u2019s limits of adaptation with lethal consequences.\nThe impacts of heat in South Asia are already emerging with over 3,600 heat-related deaths in India and Pakistan during the 2015 heat waves. More recently in 2022, at least one billion people in India and Pakistan experienced further record-breaking heat waves with temperatures reaching 51 degrees Celsius in some parts of Pakistan.\nThe report, \u2018Urban Heat in South Asia: Integrating People and Places in Adapting to Rising Temperature\u2019 said high-density living, along with low permeation of green and blue spaces, has created heat management challenges for a large number of communities in South Asia.\n\nNew report calls high-density, less green spaces \u2018a challenge\u2019; says \u2018inclusive planning\u2019 needed to mitigate effects\n\nThese environmental factors were important considering that heat adaptive measures, such as mechanical cooling through air conditioning, were rarely afforded in South Asia.\nIn many South Asian communities, air conditioning use is impractical due to erratic electricity supply or affordability.\nThe report stated that across Pakistan, electricity demand often exceeded supply resulting in blackouts lasting three to four hours per day. These factors were not limited to low-income communities and extended across many urban communities in the region.\nData limitations\nUrban heat is a rising risk across South Asian cities that is often underestimated and underreported. Unlike many other climate hazards, urban heat is a relatively predictable hazard that can be largely measured and protected against.\nThe report pointed out that the knowledge of urban temperatures in South Asia has been largely limited to satellite data or studies that have not accounted for spatial variability. This has limited the awareness and understanding of intra-urban heat differences in South Asian cities.\nAccording to the report, South Asian cities face unique challenges, competing demands, and resource constraints, unlike anything in developed economies.\nStill, lessons could be learnt from outside the region to understand best practices and potential heat management improvements, the report suggested.\nUrban heat island\nWhile explaining the complications of urban heat, the report said the heat has uneven spatial and social distributions, with wide variations in temperatures and adaptive capacities across buildings and cities around the world.\nUrban areas often experience higher temperatures by absorbing more solar radiation than surrounding rural areas, a phenomenon called the urban heat island (UHI) effect, it stated.\nThe existing heat risks in cities were amplified by warming temperatures from climate change as the global surface temperatures have risen 1.1C above pre-industrial levels. These global effects of climate change are further amplified at a local level through the UHI effect.\nThe report said that between 1950-2017, 60 per cent of the world\u2019s urban population experienced warming twice as large as the global average, and by 2100, 25pc of the world\u2019s largest cities could warm by 7C\nThe report emphasised that future heat management efforts should be designed to address both social and spatial vulnerabilities.\nInclusive planning\nThe cities need to map out overall heat vulnerability, including both heat risk factors, such as building density, materials and access to green/blue spaces, and demographic and socioeconomic determinants, such as income, age, education, gender, health, and social isolation.\nThere should be inclusive heat planning and policymaking processes to address thermal inequities, particularly in the most vulnerable communities and population groups, the report stated.\nThe report urged policymakers in the region to ensure urban planning and development was adapted to higher temperatures in the face of climate change and the UHI effect.\nThe cities in the region should integrate people and place in managing the acute and chronic impacts of urban heat by better understanding the heat risks; garnering the necessary human, technical, and financial resources; and embedding urban heat resilience into planning and development processes, the report suggested.\n"

Additionally, open grazing during periods of high winds, thunderstorms, or hailstorms will increase the risk to livestock,\u201d she said.\nMs Rehman advised farmers to take mitigation measures as advised by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and local authorities to prevent damage and losses to crops like wheat, cotton, gram, sugar cane and mango.\nFor wheat crops, harvesting should be done according to weather conditions and bales packed in smaller sizes with stalks facing upwards if there\u2019s a risk of rain. In areas with no chance of rain, wheat harvesting and threshing should be completed as soon as possible in weed-free fields for the next crop.\nShe said that for cotton crops, sowing should be stopped in case of rain, following local advisories and guidelines from respective irrigation departments.\nThe minister advised farmers to take all necessary mitigative and precautionary measures like timely harvesting and safe storage to safeguard their crops and harvest. She said that livestock herders should also undertake necessary mitigating and precautionary measures like safe sheltering and provision of adequate water and fodder for sheltered livestock during adverse weather.\nCiting a Food and Agriculture Organisa\u00adtion\u2019s report, she said Pakistan was among the 20 countries that were under threat of excessive rain due to the return of the El Nino oceanographic phenomenon in June.\n\u201cThe re-emergence of the El Nino oceanic trend has the potential to unleash severe environmental calamities, including above-average rainfall, floods, droughts, and food scarcity,\u201d the minister said.\n\u201cAlarmingly, Pakistan is among the 20 countries facing the spectre of more than normal rainfall and as we are still recuperating from the aftermath of last year\u2019s floods, it is crucial that we prepare ourselves to deal with the looming threat of extreme environmental events to avoid falling into a recovery trap,\u201d she said.\n"

His writings influenced youth to develop open minded approach to philosophical discourses, according to panelists.\nOpening the debate, Dr Mohammad Shahzad presented a chapter- wise introduction to the author and the book in order to trigger young participants to share their views based on their critical judgment. The book, he said, was a collection of the author in which he explained concepts of evolution of different narratives in an easy-to-understand Urdu language.\nMr. Shahzad added that the main purpose of the study session was to foster intellectual spirit in our youth for building a positive world view alongside tolerance and self-confidence.\nProf Aslam Mir stated the book under debate offered a progressive perspective on the concepts including theocracy, Islamic state, Feudalism and their origin in a well-defined historical background.\n\u201cNaveed-i- Fikr is a compilation of Sibte Hassan\u2019s scholarly and intellectual pursuits in which he has answered deep questions occurred to young minds in simple diction with clear historical examples and references, with an attempt to remove misconceptions and doubts regarding the theocracy, liberalism, the evolution Islamic state concept , feudalism and religion,\u201d senior panelist Sultan Mohammad said.\nProf Hamza Wadan pointed out that Syed Site Hassan had profusely written on politics, and ideology explaining with solid examples from the ancient past to the present day, how imperialists exploited the masses with the support of the middle class.\nDirector at the Bacha Khan Research Centre Prof Fazalur Rahim Marwat said unless youth read different political narratives with a fair critical thinking, they would remain under the influence of obscurantists and would never understand the true rationale of a welfare state which was intrinsically secular.\nMr Marwat said Naveed-i- Fikr offered an alternative perspective to judge things objectively and that such quality work helped youth widen their scope of looking into ideas governing their social and political lives.\nProf Sadeeq Shah, Azizullah Karwan and Shahabuddin Khan also spoke at the event.\n"

The ban would remain enforced for 30 days.\nIn Kohat, superintendents of some examination halls allegedly shut CCTV cameras in connivance with the school staff to facilitate cheating during the matriculation examinations, sources told Dawn. \nThey claimed managements of schools were throwing lavish lunches and serving tea parties with gifts for the examination staff in a bid to have a lenient attitude towards students during the examinations.\nThe sources said cheating mafia was very much active since the start of examinations on Friday despite a ban imposed by Kohat deputy commissioner Azmatullah Wazir to ensure smooth and transparent conduct of the exams.\nThey said guidebooks and other cheating material made their way into the halls without any hindrance.\nMeanwhile, talking to Dawn on Saturday, the Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Kohat, chairman Ms Saleema Altaf, confirmed that she had received complaints about shutting of CCTV cameras in examination halls.\n\u201cI have reprimanded the superintendents of halls and relevant staff, and directed them to keep the CCTV cameras active throughout the course of examination period of three hours. She said the superintendents not abiding by her directives would be proceeded against under the law.\nMs Altaf said she had issued directives to the staff to use power generators and uninterrupted power supply in case of loadshedding to ensure full recording of CCTV cameras.\nAn official statement on Saturday said the Kohat deputy commissioner had termed the unfair means during examinations as a curse, which was a discrimination against the students who had prepared well for the exams.\nHe said transparent and fair examinations were necessary for the future and development of the country.\n"

            "Text": "RAWALPINDI: Once again, Fakhar Zaman followed Daryl Mitchell in scoring a century. Once again, the result was the same; the Pakistan opener setting up victory for his side. This time though, Fakhar saw it till the end.\nFor the second time in three days, Fakhar put the New Zealand batter\u2019s exploits in the shade; the left-hander smashing a masterful 180 not out as Pakistan cantered to a seven-wicket win with 10 balls to spare in a high-scoring second One-day International at the Pindi Cricket Stadium on Saturday.\nIt was Fakhar\u2019s third ODI century in a row, and came after his 117 in the series opener on Thursday. He also scored a century against New Zealand in the last game of the previous series between the two sides earlier this year.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFakhar led the chase from start to finish, smashing six sixes and 17 fours during his 144-ball stay as Pakistan chased down an imposing 337-run target with consummate ease.\nCaptain Babar Azam provided valuable support to the left-hander, making 65 in a 135-run partnership for the second wicket with Mohammad Rizwan making a brisk 54 off 41 balls to help Fakhar close out the win as Pakistan took a 2-0 lead in the five-match series.\nMitchell, who scored 113 in the opening game, bettered it with 129 and shared a 183-run partnership for the third wicket with his skipper Tom Latham who made an enterprising 98 but it wasn\u2019t enough for New Zealand.\nPakistan rested pace spearhead Shaheen Shah Afridi and off-spinner Shadab Khan and saw their bowlers plundered for plenty after they put New Zealand into bat; Naseem Shah the only bowler to go under five an over.\nNew Zealand opener Will Young had made a blazing 86 in the opener but fell early this time when he edged Haris Rauf (4-78) to wicket-keeper Rizwan after making 19. His opening partner Chad Bowes made himself count this time, sharing an 86-run stand with Mitchell.\nMichell surivived some vicious short bowling by Ihsanullah early in his innings before coming into his own with a six off Haris over mid-off. Bowes also found his shots, hitting seven fours in his 51 off 51 \u2014 the last off them a cracking drive off Haris before he was trapped lbw off the very next ball.\nMitchell and Latham, who started cautiously, then frustrated the Pakistan bowlers. Mitchell reached his half-century off 53 balls, reverse-sweeping Agha Salman for four, and surviving on 96 when Naseem spilled a straightforward catch off leg-spinner Usama Mir.\n \n\nNEW ZEALAND centurion Daryl Mitchell makes the crease as Pakistan wicket-keeper Mohammad Rizwan looks to receive the ball during the second ODI at the Pindi Cricket Stadium on Saturday.\u2014Tanveer Shahzad/White Star\n\nLatham then pulled Usama for four to reach his half-century off 61 balls. It was just Latham\u2019s third boundary and after Mitchell raised his 100 in the next over, the duo cut loose.\nMitchell flicked Ihsan for four past fine leg and then slog-swept Usama four four in the next over. Usama was then plundered for 18 runs in his final over; Mitchell getting the third and final six of his innings and Latham hitting two fours.Latham was forcing the issue; Haris was lifted for a four and six off consecutive deliveries early in the 45th over before the left-hander successfully reviewed to overturn a lbw decision.\nIn the first five of the last 10 overs, New Zealand had plundered 61 runs but Pakistan finally got some joy when Naseem had Mitchell caught in the deep halfway through the 46th. Mitchell hit eight fours and three sixes in his 119-ball knock.\nLatham followed soon after, having guided Haris for four through the off-side before getting caught behind off the next ball and falling two short off what would\u2019ve been his eighth ODI century. He hit a six and eight fours during his 85-ball stay.\nThe quick dismissals saw a dip in New Zealand\u2019s scoring rate and Haris dismissed Mark Chapman to get his fourth wicket but James Neesham\u2019s 17 not out ensured the tourists crossed the 330-run mark.\nKnowing a fast start was needed, Fakhar hit five boundaries in the opening three overs. He then welcomed Neesham with back-to-back fours in the seventh over and repeated the trick in the all-rounder\u2019s next over.His opening partner Imam-ul-Haq had also got off to a start, scoring 24 before falling in the 10th over, skying a bouncer by Matt Henry to mid-wicket.\nBabar joined Fakhar in the middle and the duo kept the runs coming with Fakhar, who reached his half-century off 44 balls, seeing two chances dropped soon after \u2014 both off Neesham.\nBowes spilled the left-hander at point when he was at 51 and then Chapman dropped Fakhar at the mid-wicket boundary when he was on 55. How New Zealand were left to rue those chances with Fakhar celebrating the let-offs with a towering six over deep mid-wicket off Sodhi and then went 4-6-6 off the leg-spinner in the 21st over.\nFakhar raised his hundred off 83 balls in the 28th over with Babar completing his fifty off 57 a few balls later and then seeing his partner end the over with a six.\nBabar then smashed Sodhi for a majestic six over extra cover and followed it with his fifth four two balls later but was gone on the last ball of the 30th over after his leading edge was snapped up by Bowes.\nFour overs without a boundary followed and Abdullah Shafique fell to the pressure; a backtracking Henry taking a superb catch as the debutant tried to hit Henry Shipley over mid-off.\nRizwan started off with a backhand punch for a boundary and after surviving a run out \u2014 Bowes failing to hit the stumps with the batter well short \u2014 gave Fakhar the support he needed.\nFakhar raised his bat again after reaching the 150-run mark off 125 mark and then launched spinner Rachin Ravindra into orbit off the first ball of the 43rd over to bring the target down to run-a-ball. He ended the over with a six over the bowler\u2019s head. A disdainful six over square leg off Neesham followed. New Zealand had no answer and Pakistan finished them off with Rizwan, who hit six fours, getting the winning runs.\n"

            "Text": "WASHINGTON: Classified documents \u2014 released recently by a US airman \u2014 show that Pakistan, and some other nations, have been quietly distancing themselves from the United States on key issues like Ukraine.\nThe documents, published by The Washington Post and other US media outlets, include two Pakistani memos warning policymakers not to annoy China to maintain links with the United States.\nIn one of the memos, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Hina Rabbani Khar argues that Pakistan can \u201cno longer try to maintain a middle ground between China and the United States.\u201d\nThe internal memo was sent to official recipients in Pakistan in March.\nTitled \u201cPakistan\u2019s Difficult Choices\u201d, the memo cautions Islamabad should avoid giving the appearance of appeasing the West. It warns that the instinct to preserve Pakistan\u2019s partnership with the United States would ultimately sacrifice the full benefits of the country\u2019s \u201creal strategic\u201d partnership with China.\n\nLeaked memos featuring PM Shehbaz, Khar show Islamabad is distancing itself from US positions on Beijing and Moscow\n\nThe leaked US intelligence document containing the memo does not say how Washington obtained Ms Khar\u2019s memo.\nAnother document, dated February 17, details Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif\u2019s deliberations with a subordinate about an upcoming UN vote on the Ukraine conflict. It also anticipated renewed Western pressure to back the UN resolution condemning Russia\u2019s invasion.\nPakistan is among the 32 countries that have abstained from voting every time a US-backed resolution on the Ukrainian conflict was raised in the UN General Assembly.\nIn the memo, one of his aides advises PM Sharif that supporting the measure would signal a shift in Pakistan\u2019s position following its earlier abstention on a similar resolution.\nThe aide says Pakistan has the ability to negotiate trade and energy deals with Russia, and backing the resolution could jeopardise those ties.\nLast week, Pakistan placed its first order for buying crude oil from Russia and its US Ambassador Masood Khan said Islamabad had consulted Washington before placing the order. The US administration, he said, had no objection to the proposed deal.\nA Washington Post report says the leaked documents show how major developing nations seek to \u201cevade the intensifying standoff between the United States, Russia and China and, in some cases, exploit that rivalry for their own gain.\u201d\nThe documents provide a rare glimpse into how key emerging powers \u2014 including India, Brazil, Pakistan, and Egypt \u2014 are balancing their relations between the US and Russia and China.\nMatias Spektor, a scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said developing nations were reluctant to take sides on the US-China, US-Russia disputes. \u201cIt\u2019s unclear who will end up in a pole position in 10 years\u2019 time, so they need to diversify their risk and hedge their bets,\u201d Mr Spektor added.\nThe Biden administration, however, has told these countries that it\u2019s not asking them to pick sides between the US on one hand and China and Russia on the other.\nThe Post notes that India, too, is avoiding taking sides between Washington and Moscow. One leaked document details a Feb 22 conversation between Indian national security adviser Ajit Kumar Doval and his Russian counterpart, Nikolay Patrushev.\nMr Doval assures Mr Patrushev of India\u2019s support for Russia in multilateral venues and tells him that New Delhi would ensure the war does not come up during a Group of 20 meeting chaired by India, despite \u201cconsiderable pressure\u201d to do so.\nAt the meeting of G-20 foreign ministers in New Delhi a week later, disagreement over Ukraine resulted in a failure to forge a consensus on broader global challenges.\nMr Doval cites India\u2019s resistance to pressure for supporting Western-backed UN resolutions over Ukraine, saying his country \u201cwould not deviate from the principled position it had taken in the past\u201d.\n"

            "Text": "Pakistan and India are currently experiencing an unprecedented heatwave, with cities such as Jacobabad and Sibi in Pakistan recording temperatures as high as 47\u00b0C at the end of April 2022.\nThe heatwave is believed to be a result of the climate crisis. The effects of climate change are making heat waves last longer, devastatingly impacting food and water cycles and public health.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Climate Extremes concluded that temperature extremes are shifting globally. Heat waves are projected to become more frequent and severe in India and Pakistan.\nAround 1.5 billion people in these two countries are affected by this heatwave, with the poorest communities being the most vulnerable. The high temperatures caused by the heatwave can lead to dehydration, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke and worsen chronic cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.\n\nThe urban heat island effect, due to the increase in land use, building density and pollution, makes cities more vulnerable to heat waves\n\nOverstretched hospitals may face additional pressure from people suffering from heat-related illnesses, especially in Pakistan, where electricity load shedding is already causing hardship.\nThe heatwave is expected to hit the poorest and eldest communities the hardest, especially in Pakistan, where electricity load shedding is already causing hardship. Urban centres in Pakistan are experiencing load shedding for up to six to 10 hours, while rural regions face power outages lasting approximately 18 hours a day.\nIrregular water supplies exacerbate the problem for urban populations. Although fans can help circulate cooler air, they are only effective up to temperatures of approximately 37\u00b0C. Air conditioning is prohibitively expensive, even for middle-income families in both countries. The heatwave could result in a significant loss of life.\nGovernment officials are advising citizens, particularly children and the elderly, to take precautions against the extreme heatwave, such as avoiding unnecessary trips during the day.\nOutdoor and indoor workers, such as police officers, street vendors, miners, and industrial workers, are also at high risk of heat stress during extreme heat days. This year\u2019s heatwave is particularly severe and early, with March being the hottest on record, with an average temperature of 33.1\u00b0C.\nUrban areas are more vulnerable to the impacts of the heatwave due to the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. UHIs occur due to a combination of factors, including land use, building density, geography, pollution, and high temperatures.\nThe replacement of green areas with dark, heat-absorbing surfaces, such as asphalt and concrete, is a chief cause of UHIs, and factors such as pollution, climate change, and city sprawl intensify their effects.\nHigher urban temperatures lead to increased energy use during the summer, higher air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, negative impacts on human health and comfort, and warmer stormwater runoff that affects water quality.\nTo address this issue, urban planning interventions can be implemented, such as increasing the reflectance of hard surfaces by painting rooftops white, adding greenery and water features, reducing anthropogenic heat emissions, and improving airflow through the city.\nIn June 2015, a severe heatwave in Karachi resulted in over 1,200 deaths and 50,000 cases of heat illness, catching all levels of government and first responders off-guard. In response, the Commissioner\u2019s Office in Karachi collaborated with the Climate and Development Knowledge Network (CDKN) to develop a heatwave management plan.\nThe plan outlines the actions of implementation partners to ensure that weather conditions and heat health information is timely and specific, organisations can respond to their roles, and strategies and actions become more effective over time.\nDuring the early Mughal era in the Indian sub-continent, various traditional and indigenous methods were used to cope with high temperatures. The early European colonists adapted these methods to suit modern conditions.\nFor instance, they constructed high ceilings and spacious but lowered verandas to provide more shade. Thick layered thatch roofing was used to keep temperatures inside the house lower during nights, and wet tattie \u2014 two to four-inch-thick screens made up of long roots of the Khas \u2014 were used for home cooling.\nIn Mughal buildings, courtyards were often added with vegetation and water bodies to enhance humidity, cool the air by evaporation, keep the dust down, and provide shade for comfortable living during hot, dry seasons.\nEnglish bungalows were built within compounds of shady trees, with rooms having thick walls, high ceilings, and surrounded by covered verandas. Even today, people in villages spend their daytime on lower floors while they spend their nights on the terraces.\n \n \n\nTo combat Karachi\u2019s extreme heat, the government must take significant steps to increase the city\u2019s green cover. Solutions for the urban heat island effect will need to be formulated at different scales, with various quantitative measures developed to model the local climate at the street, neighbourhood, and city levels.\nWith a population of around 20 million, Karachi ideally requires 20m plants, following the one-person, one-plant principle. However, there are currently only 3m trees in the city, which is far too few to make an impact. Ideally, cities should have 12 meters of open space available per person.\nOne approach to increasing the city\u2019s green cover is to transform large parks into urban forests, although this task is too big for the government to complete alone.\nCharitable organisations have already made significant contributions to food, shelter, and health in Pakistan, and their services were effectively utilised during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nAlthough the government has encouraged universities to lead tree plantation campaigns, the impact is only visible when these institutions develop the capacity to nurture and care for the trees.\nWorld Wildlife Fund-Pakistan is making commendable efforts to conserve the country\u2019s endangered forests, precious freshwater, and wildlife. Nonetheless, the task at hand is too vast to be accomplished by a single organisation.\nThe country needs appropriate measures to identify and quantify the effectiveness of different policies, including those related to planning, energy, buildings, and health, over the long term.\nArchitecture that facilitates natural sunlight and ventilation is conducive to the health of the occupants.\nUrban forests, green belts, greenhouses, and vegetation can improve the quality of outdoor spaces and enhance cooling through evapotranspiration. Fountains are an effective way to enhance air quality by spraying water droplets into the air, which speeds up evaporation.\n"

            "Text": "\n\n\n \nDuring colonial India, Hindus and Muslims experienced divergent economic outcomes as socio-economic opportunities were more available for Hindus than for Muslims. Thus, Muslims faced greater inequality, with a smaller middle class than Hindus.\nOne of the main reasons for the establishment of Pakistan was to address the economic disparity. However, due to inherited colonial structure, marginalised communities have continued to be deprived of fundamental rights, leaving them at a disadvantage, even after seven decades.\nThe myth of economic growth has allowed income and wealth inequalities to persist by providing tax concessions and subsidies at the expense of the poor segment\u2019s well-being.\nDuring General Ayub Khan\u2019s tenure in 1960, Pakistan aimed to become an \u201cAsian Tiger\u201d by offering subsidies, tax breaks, and other benefits to the private sector. However, this led to 20 families controlling a majority of the country\u2019s 66 per cent industrial, 97pc insurance, and 80pc banking assets, creating a significant economic gap.\n\nOver 360,000 people are currently trapped in bonded labour in Pakistan\n\nDespite strong GDP growth, this resulted in the lower 50pc of households receiving only 25pc of total personal income while the top 5pc received 20pc. The \u201cDecade of Development\u201d mainly favoured urban industrial elites and rural land-owning elites.\nThe Bhutto regime implemented nationalisation, land reform, and uranium enrichment. Despite this, Pakistan\u2019s GDP volume and per capita income doubled from $10.027 billion and $169.124 in the early 1970s to $19.688bn and $254.3478 in just eight years.\nBhutto\u2019s administration also introduced constitutional reforms and development initiatives, resulting in the achievement of fundamental rights and an impressive 8pc GDP growth by the end of 1978.\nNotably, wages did not increase during Bhutto\u2019s rule, but farmers received loans, resulting in a significant rise in tractor numbers from 2,000 in 1959 to 35,714 by 1975. However, the 1972 Agriculture Census revealed that landowners owned 30pc of farmland with over 150 acres but who operated only 9.2pc of the total farm area.\nBy 1973, 43pc of agricultural labourers were wage labourers, with 794,042 peasants turned into such labourers between 1961 and 1975.\nDespite these efforts, Pakistan\u2019s disparities persist. Bhutto\u2019s nationalised enterprises were returned to their previous owners, and investment controls were eased. Consequently, private sector investment in manufacturing grew by 9.5pc annually from 1978-1983 and accelerated during the last five years of Zia\u2019s regime.\nBy the early 1990s, Pakistan\u2019s per capita income was 25pc higher than India, at $500 versus $390. The industrial sector thrived under Zia, with manufacturing growing over 9pc annually from 1977-1988, a significant improvement from the 3.7pc growth between 1972-1977.\nHowever, it is important to note that during Zia\u2019s regime, the lowest 10pc of the population received only 9pc of the national income, compared to 13pc during Bhutto\u2019s regime, and the highest 10pc increased their share of national income from 38pc to 44pc.\nThe bottom 10pc of the population\u2019s share of national income decreased to 7pc, compared to 9pc in the 1980-90s. Meanwhile, the top 10pc saw their share increase from 44pc to 49pc. Pakistan\u2019s GDP has increased fourfold from $80bn to $348bn as of 2021, primarily due to the flourishing real estate sector.\nHowever, the country\u2019s industrial production decreased from 10.5pc to 7pc, and unemployment increased from 3.5pc to 7pc. Pakistan\u2019s access to finance ratio is the lowest in South Asia at 21.29pc, while India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka have 79.88pc, 50.05pc, and 73.65pc, respectively.\nPakistan\u2019s per capita income remains lower than that of India and Bangladesh, at $1,543 per annum compared to India\u2019s $2,191 and Bangladesh\u2019s $2,554. As a consequence, at the end of 2020, the top 10pc households received 24pc of the total income growth, while the bottom 50pc received 32pc of the income growth.\nGovernment spending on education as a percentage of GDP has remained below 2.5pc since 1947, while current health expenditure as a percentage of GDP has also remained below 3.5pc.\nConsequently, Pakistan has the world\u2019s second-highest number of out-of-school children, with 22.8 million children aged 5-16 not attending school, representing 44pc of the total population in this age group. The number of out-of-school children doubles after primary-school age, with 11.4m adolescents between the ages of 10-14 not receiving formal education.\nThese trends have led to a higher incidence of bonded labour due to reduced basic necessities. Over 360,000 labourers are currently trapped in bonded labour in Pakistan, with a high prevalence of modern slavery, affecting 16.82 out of every 1,000 people, while 74.12 out of 100 individuals are at risk of becoming victims of modern slavery.\nPakistan\u2019s position in the Human Development Index (HDI) has been consistently declining. It was ranked 161 out of 192 countries in the 2021-2022 index. On the flip side, the majority of elected officials, bureaucrats, and army officers come from elite educational institutions such as Aitchison College, cadet colleges, Beaconhouse, and Millennium Education.\nThis depicts that the state structure has consistently favoured the top 10pc of the population, who were a privileged segment during both the colonial era and after independence. This has resulted in income inequality and social divisions.\nThe state has also failed to fulfil its unwritten promise of eliminating inequality for its citizens at the time of independence. As a result, poor individuals continue to lack access to basic necessities, increasing the likelihood that the child of a forced and bounded labourer will also become a labourer, which further fuels fraction, frustration and polarisation in Pakistan.\nThe writer is an assistant professor (PhD Financial Economics) National University of Modern Languages (NUML), Islamabad (abwahid.fms@gmail.com)\n"

            "Text": "Forests play a crucial role in the environment, providing employment opportunities, food, wood, fuel, and animal fodder for approximately 1.6 billion individuals worldwide.\nThey also help mitigate climate change by absorbing carbon dioxide and generating oxygen, making them the largest carbon store on the planet. Deforestation releases carbon dioxide, contributing to global warming.\nCountries should aim to have at least 25 per cent of their land covered by forests to promote sustainable employment and ensure the protection of the environment. Unfortunately, deforestation is happening at an alarming rate, with around 13 million hectares of land being deforested annually.\nGlobally, only 30pc of the land is covered by forests. In Pakistan, only 5.4pc of the land is covered by forests, with an estimated carbon storage of around 243m tonnes.\n\nCountries should aim to have at least a quarter of their land covered by trees, but Pakistan has only 5.4pc of forested land\n\nA scientific study conducted in collaboration with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in 1994 recorded the forest area and tree species in Sindh, but no further research has been conducted. Only 2.5pc of Sindh\u2019s total area is estimated to be forested. Forests can absorb carbon dioxide emissions and produce oxygen, making them known as the world\u2019s lungs.\nThe Red Plus programme was launched by the United Nations Convention on Climate Change in 2013 to protect and promote forests in developing countries through sustainable management and enhancement of carbon stocks. Countries that increase their forest carbon stocks can receive compensation, with $4.5bn allocated for this purpose.\nCurrently, Pakistan is a member of the Red Plus programme, which aims to reduce the environmental impacts of climate change worldwide.\nPakistan received a $3.8m grant from the World Bank in 2015 to support forest maintenance, community involvement in forest management, and modern technology to track environmental and climate changes. However, the effectiveness of this grant in addressing deforestation in Pakistan is unclear, as around 12,000 hectares of land are deforested every year.\n\nSatellite imagery shows that many forests have been depleted and converted into croplands \u2014 it is estimated that 80pc of the riverine forest in Sindh has been destroyed\n\nThe forested area in Sindh has also declined instead of increasing, highlighting the need for better forest conservation strategies. Sindh has three primary categories of forests.\nRiverine forests\nThese forests are located in the Kacha region \u2014 the area between the protective levees constructed along the Indus River. They rely on water from the Indus River and are home to several tree species.\nRiverine forests play a crucial role in preserving the natural environment by preventing erosion along the riverbed and banks. The current riverine forest area is approximately 241,198 hectares (596,000 acres). However, these forests are rapidly declining due to deforestation caused by the lumber mafia and the conversion of forest land for agricultural purposes.\nSatellite imagery of the riverine forests in Sindh has revealed that many of the forests named Monarki, Surjani, Khokhar, Matiari, Ghotana, Unarpur, Manjhand, Khasai, Keti Jorio, Mari, Nasri, Mithiani, Abriputa, Sona Binde, Kamal Dero, Gaji Dero Forest, Phulu, Bahabpur, Madiji, Sadhuja Reserved Forest, etc, have been depleted.\nSatellite imagery shows that many forests have been depleted and converted into croplands. It is estimated that 80pc of the Riverine forest in Sindh has been destroyed.\nIrrigated (Nahri) forests\nThe irrigated forests in Sindh are manually planted and cover an area of 82,195 hectares (203,108 acres). These forests are irrigated through the Sindh irrigation network and are home to various tree species.\nHowever, many of these forests, including the Pai, Makhi, Khipro, and Miyani forests, are facing significant challenges due to water scarcity and illegal logging by the lumber mafia, leading to a loss of trees and conversion to croplands. The precarious state of these forests reflects the overall state of forests in Sindh.\nMangrove forests\nThe mangrove forests in Sindh span from Korangi Creek to Sir/Seer Creek and are located in the tidal floodplain of the Indus Delta. These forests, estimated to have 97pc of all mangrove forests in Pakistan, have decreased in size from 600,000 acres to 200,000 acres but have been increasing over the past 15 years.\nThey are the largest in the world in dry climate forests and the sixth largest overall. Mangrove creeks and islands provide a habitat for marine life and exotic birds, act as a natural barrier against natural disasters, and reduce coastal erosion. Only four species of mangroves remain in the Indus Delta, with Avicenna Marina being the most common.\nAdditionally, one hectare of mangrove forest produces 100kg of fish, 25kg of shrimp, 15kg of crab, 200kg of molluscs, and 40kg of sea cucumber each year.\nIt is evident that the disappearing forests in Sindh pose a significant threat to the region\u2019s ability to mitigate the impacts of climate change. The government, civil society, and citizens must take responsibility for protecting and enhancing these vital natural resources.\nThe use of satellite technology and scientific surveys to combat illegal logging and encroachments, as well as reforestation efforts, are necessary steps that must be taken to restore and expand forest cover in Sindh. Failure to act could have severe consequences for Pakistan and its people, making it imperative to address this issue before it is too late.\nProf Altaf Ali Siyal is from Sindh Agriculture University Tandojam and Pirah Siyal works at the Sindh Environmental Protection Agency\n"

            "Text": "Understanding the historical context is of utmost importance in comprehending the prevalence of regional inequality and the resulting discontent with the federal government in Balochistan.\nSuch disparities are primarily rooted in economic and political imbalances that arise from unequal representation. \nFor instance, the partition of 1971 serves as a hallmark of economic imbalances, where the Western wing received almost double in revenue share compared to the Eastern wing. This highlights the critical role of provincial autonomy in any country. \nSubsequently, the 18th amendment to the Constitution, which devolved Sales Tax on Services (STS) collection to the provinces, was a sign of provincial empowerment. Following this amendment, the 7th National Finance Commission (NFC) Award was announced in 2010-11, which led to the establishment of Revenue Authorities in each province to collect STS.\n\nThe Balochistan Revenue Authority can be a game changer for the province if it is implemented transparently and effectively\n\nAmong these revenue authorities, Sindh took the lead on July 1, 2011, followed by Punjab in July 2012 and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in July 2013. Balochistan Revenue Authority (BRA) was the last to become operational on July 1 2015. This is because the province is the most backwards because it generates fewer services and does not have enough resources to start.\nMoreover, the authority faces challenges such as a shortage of tax experts and legal professionals, the deputation of staff, and reliance on Pakistan Revenue Automation Limited for automation.\nAdditionally, the authority has not developed its own policies and has implemented those of other revenue authorities. The absence of official reports also raises concerns. \nYet, it is imperative that the BRA office be consolidated into a singular building to optimise the authority\u2019s operational efficiency. The office\u2019s current scattered state hinders the BRA\u2019s smooth functioning and necessitates the urgent implementation of a consolidated workspace. These issues must be addressed for the authority to fulfil its mandate effectively. \nGenerating public revenues through the collection of taxes and fees is a fundamental and indispensable means for any region to finance critical investments in human capital, infrastructure, and the provision of services for citizens and businesses. As such, the importance of a modern, progressive, effective, and credible organisation that prioritises optimising revenue cannot be overstated.\nIt is worth noting that the authority has made considerable progress from its previous stance. This is exemplified by the introduction of the Balochistan Development and Maintenance of Infrastructure Cess (BDMIC) in 2019, which is levied on the total value of goods imported by air, land, or sea in the province. \nFurthermore, in 2022, the Balochistan Companies\u2019 Profits (Worker Participation) Act and the Balochistan Worker\u2019s Welfare Fund Act were also introduced, indicating a commitment to promoting worker welfare and participation. \nThe revenue authority may be responsible for collecting taxes, but its impact on the economy goes far beyond that. From promoting investment to enforcing regulations, the authority plays a crucial role in shaping the province\u2019s economic landscape. \nAdditionally, there has been a significant increase in revenue collection. In 2014-15, the collection of sales tax services by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) was only Rs840 million. However, by 2015-16, the estimated and actual collections of Balochistan sales tax services were Rs1.5 billion and Rs2.2bn, respectively. \nFast forward to 2022-23, the estimated collections had increased to Rs25.2bn, with actual collections totalling Rs12.01 bn. It should be noted that the data utilised in this analysis is current up until April 2023. \nFurthermore, it should also be acknowledged that the actual provincial revenue value for 2023 has yet to be determined by the relevant authority. \nMore deep view of the ability of BRA collection can be depicted by examining the percentage contribution of BRA\u2019s actual collection (BSTS+BDMIC) to the actual provincial revenue for each year.\nIn a nutshell, the Balochistan Revenue Authority (BRA) can be a game changer for the province if it is implemented transparently and effectively. Its ability to uplift the financial status of the region cannot be overstated. However, for this potential to be realised, the government must pay attention to the needs and challenges faced by the authority. \nThe writer is a research assistant at the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics, Islamabad\n"

The first condition of talks is, there are no pre-conditions. Mr Khan is so desperate that he wants his way or the highway.\u201d\nIn a conversation with Dawn on Sunday, Mr Iqbal said the federal coalition parties sat with the PTI with an \u2018open mind\u2019; however, if Imran Khan continued to stick to his demand for the dissolution of assemblies (National, Sindh and Balochistan) by May 14, then this was not acceptable to the federal coalition.\n\u201cThe people of Sindh and Balochistan cannot be punished for the folly of Imran Khan who dissolved Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa assemblies to force elections\u2026under the patronage of his \u2018handlers\u2019 in the institutions,\u201d the minister said, adding the PTI would have to agree on a code of conduct for polls besides the same-day elections.\n\u2018Ultimate loser\u2019\n\u201cAnd let me tell\u2026if talks fail the ultimate loser will be the PTI as there is a provision for delaying elections for a year under the Constitution. Imran Khan has warned of creating a law and order situation in the country (if polls are not held this July) and in such a scenario the elections will be delayed for another year,\u201d Mr Iqbal warned.\nWhen asked if the elections would be held in Punjab in May in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s order in case of no breakthrough in parleys, the minister said: \u201cWe clearly see politics behind this apex court\u2019s verdict.\u201d\n \n \n\nDefence Minister Khawaja Asif also does not see a \u2018positive outcome\u2019 of talks. \u201cWhat will be the result of the negotiations with the PTI as they are setting conditions,\u201d he said.\nThe Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), which pushed the PML-N to hold parleys with the PTI on elections, is still optimistic. \u201cI hope that dissolution of the assemblies by May 14 is a proposal and not a condition set by Mr Khan. This suggestion is not viable. Who will present the budget if the National Assembly is dissolved in May? It cannot be left to the caretaker setup to negotiate with the IMF and present the budget (for the upcoming financial year),\u201d PPP senior leader and PM\u2019s special assistant Qamar Zaman Kaira told Dawn.\nMr Kaira said despite such a suggestion the PPP believed better sense would prevail and that these talks would not end up in failure.\nJamaat-i-Islami chief Sirajul Haq, who recently called on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Imran Khan to push them for a consensus on polls, said: \u201cWe are hopeful for a breakthrough in the dialogue and that both the federal coalition and the PTI will not head for a deadlock.\u201d\nOn the other hand, the PTI has also shown optimism that its parleys with the government will succeed.\n\u201cPTI wants the success of talks with the government, but it has formulated a strategy in case of failure. It is not possible for the PTI to sit silently if the Constitution is considered as a piece of trash and the public as insects,\u201d PTI senior leader Fawad Chaudhry said in a tweet.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Chaudhry also called on the people to prepare for a \u2018movement\u2019. \u201cThe movement is starting tomorrow (Monday) with rallies in Lahore, Islamabad, and Peshawar, culminating in a historic long march,\u201d he said.\n"

            "Text": "KARACHI: The ongoing census faces a fresh controversy as both the federal and Sindh governments went public with their differences over the issue on Sunday.\nThe PPP-led Sindh government expressed concerns for excluding those parts of the province where \u201cpopulation growth rate has been recorded higher than a certain benchmark\u201d and warned that the province would reject the result if its reservations were not addressed.\nThe Sindh government\u2019s concern came soon after Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal directed all the provincial governments to complete the field verification/coverage of the population and housing census till May 15 in \u201careas where population growth is not in line with normal demographic trends\u201d and \u201cclose the field operation in all areas exhibiting natural trends\u201d.\nOn the other hand, both a federal government ally and the opposition PTI expressed their reservations over the census results.\n\nMurad says result won\u2019t be accepted if reservations not addressed\n\nIn a strongly-worded letter to Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah made it clear that his government would reject the census result if its reservations were not addressed.\n \n \n\nThe letter, a copy of which is available with Dawn, stated that following a meeting held on Sunday to review the progress of the field operations of the census it was conveyed to the provincial government that the \u201ccensus activity will immediately be closed in those talukas/tehsils where population growth rate higher than a certain benchmark has been recorded\u201d.\n\u201cWe have a strong reservation on this decision as this benchmarking is totally arbitrary,\u201d he said.\n\u201cCiting reasons for his objections, the CM stated: \u201cIt is wrong to judge the population growth of all the districts/talukas against a single universal benchmark. If such a benchmark was universally applicable, [then] there would have been no need to conduct the census at all, as the population growth could have easily been calculated based on that benchmark.\u201d\nHe further said that there are many blocks in almost all the districts of Sindh, which have still not been fully counted.\nThe CM urged the federal government to continue the census process in all the districts of Sindh \u201ctill each and every household and individual is accurately counted\u201d.\nIn Islamabad, the planning minister while chairing a meeting said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had taken strict notice of the repeated extensions of field enumeration activities, APP added. Therefore, the meeting was informed, targeted verification and enumeration operations should be carried out in areas with abnormal population growth, where gaps have already been highlighted using the digital systems architected by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics for the first-ever digital census.\nMr Iqbal stressed that special efforts should be made in urban areas of Punjab, Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and ICT to counter issues of under coverage and low coverage.\nA uniform data-driven policy must be adopted to conclude the field enumeration in all the provinces.\nHe stressed on the completion of the exercise by May 15 for timely handing over of data to the Election Commission of Pakistan.\nOn the other hand, MQM-P, an ally of the PDM government in the Centre, alleged that the population of urban Sindh had been shown in the census less not because of any mistake but under a particular plan.\n\u201cThrough the media and government institutions sources, it has been proved that population of urban Sindh is being shown less under a well-thought-out plan,\u201d claimed MQM-P convener Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqi at a presser.\nIn Lahore, PTI Senator Ejaz Chaudhry termed the ongoing census a \u201cfraud\u201d and said his party had already rejected the census.\nIn a statement, he said political parties were protesting against the veracity of the census and added that the \u201cimported government was busy [doing] rigging in census activity too\u201d.\nMansoor Malik in Lahore also contributed to this report\n"

As per the Meteorological Department, there are chances of more thundershowers and hailstorms over the next 24 hours.\nAfter the continuous downpour and hailstorms which wreaked havoc, the population in the province also faced flash floods, causing suspension of traffic on various roads. Movement on the Quetta-Karachi highway was suspended after a bridge collapsed in Lasbela, causing inconvenience to commuters. A flash flood also suspended traffic between Harnai and Punjab, as the road linking Punjab with Harnai remained submerged in flood water.\nMeanwhile, Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo expressed grief over the loss of precious lives and extended his sympathy and heartfelt condolences to the affected families.\n\u201cControl rooms should be kept active 24 hours a day for emergencies,\u201d he ordered.\n"

            "Text": "KHARTOUM: Sudan\u2019s rival military forces accused each other of fresh violations of a ceasefire on Sunday as their deadly conflict rumbled on for a third week despite warnings of a slide towards catastrophic civil war.\nHundreds of people have been killed and thousands wounded since a long-simmering power struggle between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) erupted into conflict on April 15.\nThe RSF said a formal ceasefire agreement which was due to expire at midnight would be extended for a further 72 hours \u201cin response to international, regional and local calls\u201d.\nThe parties have fought on despite a series of ceasefires secured by mediators including the United States.\nThe situation in Khartoum, where the army has been battling RSF forces entrenched in residential areas, was relatively calm on Sunday morning, after heavy clashes were heard on Saturday evening near the city centre.\nThe army said on Sunday it had destroyed RSF convoys moving towards Khartoum from the west. The RSF said the army had used artillery and warplanes to attack its positions in a number of areas in Khartoum province.\nIn an apparent bid to boost its forces, the army said on Saturday that the Central Reserve Police had begun to deploy in southern Khar\u00adtoum and would be deployed gradually in other areas of the capital.\nSudan\u2019s police said the force had been deployed to protect markets and property that had been subjected to looting. The RSF warned police on Saturday against becoming involved in fighting.\nThe force is a large and heavily-armed division of Sudan\u2019s police force that has fighting experience from conflicts in the western region of Darfur and in the Nuba mountains in southern Sudan.\nIn March last year, the United States imposed sanctions on the force, accusing it of using excessive force against protesters who were demonstrating against a 2021 military coup.\n\u2018No direct negotiations\u2019\nThe fighting in Khartoum has so far seen RSF forces fan out across the city as the army tries to target them largely by using air strikes from drones and fighter jets.\nThe conflict has sent tens of thousands of people fleeing across Sudan\u2019s borders and prompted warnings the country could disintegrate, destabilising a volatile region and prompting foreign governments to scramble to evacuate their nationals.\nThe United States has sent a navy ship to take its citizens, two US officials said, as Britain announced it had arranged an extra evacuation flight from Port Sudan on the eastern Red Sea coast.\nProspects for talks bleak\nThe prospects for negotiations have appeared bleak.\n\u201cThere are no direct negotiations, there are preparations for talks,\u201d UN special representative in Sudan, Volker Perthes, told journalists in Port Sudan, adding that regional and other countries were working with the two sides.\nPerthes, who said on Saturday the sides were more open to negotiations than before, said he hoped a direct meeting between representatives of the sides would be held as soon as possible aimed at \u201cachieving an organised ceasefire with a monitoring mechanism\u201d.\nArmy chief Gen Abdel Fattah al Burhan has said he would never sit down with Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti.\nThe RSF chief in turn said he would talk only after the army ceased hostilities.\nSaudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan, whose government has played a part in mediating ceasefires, met Burhan envoy Daffalla Al Haj Ali in Riyadh, the Saudi foreign ministry said.\n"

            "Text": "DOHA: Months after hundreds of thousands of football fans packed into its hotels and stadiums, Qatar is seeking to remedy a bout of the post-World Cup blues by hosting more international events.\nAlong with the departed football crowds, thousands of foreign workers left the Gulf state after Lionel Messi lifted the coveted trophy on Dec 18. Many of those who stayed on are counting the cost.\nLuxury hotels built for the tournament have laid off hundreds of staff as rooms costing thousands of dollars a night during the tournament can no longer be filled.\nIn a country normally hungry for labour, a shopping mall on the edge of Doha recently advertised 100 jobs and saw more than 1,000 people jostling outside for interviews.\nQatar estimates that the World Cup, which residents once dreaded, brought 1.4 million people to the state.\nAkhtar Patel, who runs a jewellery store in Doha\u2019s Souq Waqif market, said business in comparison is \u201cquiet\u201d. \u201cWe really miss those fans now,\u201d he said.\nThe Eid holiday brought back some shoppers, but the decline has been such that Sandeev Kumar, who runs a print workshop, sent two of his four workers back to India because he could no longer afford to pay them.\n\u201cWe miss the vibe, but we miss the business even more,\u201d he said.\nOn Doha\u2019s seafront promenade, host to a World Cup fanzone, some jobless workers have been reduced to asking for cash handouts, leading the interior ministry to issue a public warning against \u201cuncivilised\u201d begging.\nBut Qatar\u2019s economy remains healthy. After recording a trade surplus of nearly $100 billion last year, growth this year \u2014 bolstered by its natural gas riches \u2014 is predicted by the World Bank to hit 3.4 per cent, among the highest in the Middle East.\nAnd a wave of newcomers has added nearly 100,000 to the population since the World Cup final, taking it to over three million, according to official figures.\nPush for transformation\nAkbar al Baker, head of Qatar\u2019s tourism agency and Qatar Airways, said hotel occupancy in the months after a World Cup is \u201calways low\u201d.\nThe tiny country has made investments in tourism and hosting more major events a focus, Baker added, predicting Qatar will welcome more than five million visitors this year \u2014 more than twice the number in pre-pandemic 2019.\nMechanical diggers are laying the ground for a six-month horticultural expo from October, which Qatar hopes will draw one million foreign visitors. Concrete is also being poured at a new race track to host the second Qatar Formula One grand prix on Oct 8.\nOn Friday, Qatar was revealed as the host of the 24-nation basketball World Cup in 2027, despite having no tradition in the sport.\nCulture Minister Sheikh Abdulrahman bin Hamad bin Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani said that when Qatar first launched its Years of Culture series with other countries a decade ago it was a struggle to find candidates.\n\u201cCountries are now queuing to be part of the Years of Culture,\u201d he told an event for this year\u2019s partner, Indonesia.\nNew prime minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani took office in March and is expected to soon announce new economic initiatives, in part a response to growing competition from Saudi Arabia, which has embarked on many reforms.\n"

Traders refusing to pay risk having their perishable goods stalled at crossing points from the enclave.\nThe increases are the latest in a series of new levies on goods entering and exiting the coastal territory where 2.3 million Palestinians struggle to survive.\nIn July last year, Hamas imposed tax increases on 24 other items, including bottled water and certain clothes, forcing traders to remove some brands from the market when shoppers could not afford the newly inflated prices.\nWassim al Hilu, a food importer-exporter and member of Gaza\u2019s chamber of commerce, said Gazans are already saddled with taxes paid to Israel \u2014 which collects a range of fees on behalf of the Palestinian Authority.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD:  The Capital Development Authority (CDA) has offered 25 acres to Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) for the construction of a cricket stadium in Islamabad.\nRecently, the CDA approached the PCB with the offer of 25 acres near D-12.\n\u201cI have spoken to PCB high-ups a few days ago and informed them that CDA has earmarked 25 acres for the project. Next week, CDA and PCB are going to hold a meeting on it,\u201d CDA Chairman Noorul Amin Mengal told Dawn on Sunday. He said the CDA had 150 acres near D-12 and Shah Allah Ditta which will be utilised for promotion of sports.\n\u201cOut of the total, 25 acres will be given to the PCB for the cricket stadium and we will develop other sports facilities on the remaining land,\u201d he said and added that the cricket stadium in the foothills of Margallas will add to the beauty of Islamabad. The facility will also be used for international cricket matches.\n\nProject to construct stadium in Shakarparian was scrapped by Supreme Court in 2018\n\nAsked about possible backlash from environment activists as the area falls in Zone III, the CDA chairman said he had been told that the area was outside of Zone III, adding even if it falls in the said zone, the civic agency could use it for sports facilities like the ones already constructed near Aabpara such as the sports complex. That area also falls in Zone III.\n\u201cThere is no bar on having sports and recreational facilities in Zone III and even we have hiking tracks in Margalla Hills. But I will check the issue again,\u201d he said.\nIt is relevant to note that the PCB and the CDA had started construction of a stadium in Shakarparian, but in 2018 the Supreme Court scrapped the project for being part of the national park in Zone III.\nRecently, the CDA decided filing a review petition against the order of the Supreme Court for the construction the stadium. However, now the civic agency has decided to offer new sites for the stadium to the PCB.\nIn 1960, the Greek firm, Doxiadis Associates, which prepared Islamabad\u2019s master plan had declared 2,250 acres as a sports centre in Shakarparian. The boundary of the area touches Islamabad Highway in the north, and Murree Road in the south and east. The government constructed the sports complex, a museum, Lok Virsa, a golf course and Islamabad Club in the area.\nHowever, in 1979, through a notification, the government ended the independent status of the area and included it in the national park and Zone III, meaning no new facilities could be developed there.\nThe notification had also added many villages, which were outside of Margalla Hills, to the national park and Zone III. However, successive governments never tried to make amendments to the 1979 notification that resulted into mushroom growth of unregulated construction.\nInterestingly, according to the notification, Saidpur Village is also part of the national park while Super Market partially falls in Zone III.\n"

However, many of them face numerous challenges such as low wages, unsafe and unhealthy working conditions, lack of job security, and inadequate access to healthcare and social protection. \n\u201cPWF is a representative organisation of workers in Pakistan and working for the betterment of workers and protects their rights. PWF continues to struggle for organising informal economy workers and registration of workers in Employees\u2019 Old-Age Benefits Institution (EOBI) and social security,\u201d he said.\n\u201cPWF believes in negotiation and resolution of workers\u2019 issues through social dialogue. We call upon the government of Pakistan to prioritise workers\u2019 rights and welfare by enforcing labour laws and regulations and ensuring that all workers have access to decent work, social protection, and healthcare,\u201d he added. \n\u201cFurthermore, we urge the international community to support our efforts to improve the working conditions and rights of workers in Pakistan. We need global support to achieve our goal of creating a fair and just working environment for all workers,\u201d he said.\nMr Yaseen said that on labour day, people should remember the struggles and sacrifices of workers.\n\u201cLet us stand in solidarity with one another and continue their legacy by fighting for the rights of workers in Pakistan. We demand from the prime minister of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, the minister of human resource development and overseas Pakistanis and other relevant officials to take initiatives for the implementation of labour laws and give legal protection to workers of the informal economy. Necessary amendment in labour laws with consultation of stakeholders and prompt social dialogue. Tripartite Labour Conference will be held as soon as possible,\u201d he said. \nWhile Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has stopped PTI from holding rallies on Word Labour Day, the party has criticised the decision and decided to write to ECP asking it to be allowed to hold rallies as per routine.\nFawad Chaudhry, in a video statement, criticised the direction of the ECP and said that it was strange that while solidarity was being shown with the labourers of Chicago across the globe, in Pakistan political parties were being stopped from holding rallies.\n\u201cWe are writing to the ECP to allow us to hold rallies on Monday (today) as it is for the rights of labourers across the country,\u201d he said.\n"

Sharafat Ali stated that a few days ago, some individuals had attempted to watch a show at the theatre without tickets, but his deceased son had prevented them. \nAs a result, they had threatened him of consequences. On the same night, those individuals had also engaged in a scuffle with staff at another cinema over the same issue, leading to a case being registered against them. \nSharafat Ali suspected that the same accused individuals might have been responsible for his son\u2019s murder.

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: Society for the Protection of the Rights of the Child (Sparc), in collaboration with MuslimAid, on Sunday commemorated the International Day to End Corporal Punishment in presence of educationists, representatives from Ministry of Human Rights and lawmakers.\nThe United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child defines \u2018corporal\u2019 or \u2018physical\u2019 punishment as any punishment in which physical force is used to cause some degree of pain and discomfort however light. In geographic terms, only 65 countries have legally outlawed all forms of corporal punishment, including in homes.\nThe chief guest, Dr Mohammad Arif, director, Ministry of Human Rights, urged for the collective role of civil society, academia, parents and government in curbing violence through shared initiative by the Ministry of Human Rights, including a help line 1099 and a database where authentic cases are filed. He also invited civil society organisations (CSOs) to provide feedback on ICT Child Protection Act.\nNazneen Tabassum of MuslimAid shared that while the UN in Article 19 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child declared it a violation of a child\u2019s rights, teachers continue to use these tactics to maintain discipline and get students to do work, even where it is banned.\n\u201cPakistan is still struggling to stop the recurring cycle of violence; this is high time that the government take initiative to end corporal punishment once and for all,\u201d she said.\nKhalida Ahmed, educational psychologist and member Board of Directors (Sparc), shared findings of a survey conducted by Sparc with children of a selected school in Islamabad where majority of the children (93pc) during discussions said they felt embarrassed when parents screamed at them at home whereas more than half mentioned (65pc) that they felt ashamed when parents made them stand outside in the sun. \nData showed that only 47pc of the teachers believe that physical and humiliating punishment (PHP) is effective to discipline children whereas on the contrary, more that 58pc teachers agreed that PHP makes the child more aggressive.\nDuring the panel discussion, Usman Marwat, DG Senate of Pakistan emphasised on the role of legislation to address PHP and acknowledged efforts of female senators and law makers in highlighting these issues. He lamented on the lack of tolerance that leads to an intolerant society.\nHabibullah Khan, director of National Commission for Human Development (NCHD), said that high dropout of children from schools/out of school children and adult illiteracy exacerbates the situation where the institute is playing a key role in tackling the issue through adult literacy initiatives.\nDr Rubina Fareed, former ICT member of National Commission on the Rights of the Child (NCRC) shared experiences during her tenure on use of life threatening and derogatory punishments to child domestic labourer(s) in ICT where children were either left maimed or have lost lives in the hands of employers.\nAsiya Arif, executive director, Sparc appreciated efforts of legislators in the passage of Islamabad Capital Territory Prohibition of Corporal Punishment Act, 2021. \nShe said this act significantly prohibits corporal punishment at the workplace and in all educational institutions including formal, non-formal, and religious, both public and private, and in child care institutions. \nIshtiaq Gilani, chief executive officer (CEO) of UGood and coordinator of the Child Rights Movement (CRM), briefed participants of a two-month long campaign against corporal punishment to be initiated shortly by CSOs.\nArshad Mehmood, member SAIEVAC (South Asian Initiative to End Violence against Children) expressed concern over the society failing its children and not addressing root causes of PHP where the country can follow positive case studies of neighbouring countries.\nParticipants were apprised of harms of corporal punishment in schools and home settings through a role play by children of Saya school.\nDr Laila Khan of Special Education Centre for Physically Challenged Children (H-9) shared harrowing after-effects of punishment meted to children with disabilities. \nEducationists Dr Afshan Huma of Allama Iqbal Open University and Dr Ghazala stressed on positive teachers\u2019 training with mandatory role of educational psychologists.\n"

            "Text": "RAWALPINDI: Further delay in the start of work on the Kutchery Chowk remodeling project worth Rs6.4 billion may escalate its cost to Rs8 billion.\nA senior official of the district administration feared that if the project was not started in this fiscal year, its cost would further go up. The cost of the project escalated from Rs4.879 billion to Rs6.422 billion in the last two years due to a 25pc increase in the construction material prices, he added.\nHe said the project cost was estimated in November last year and after this the cost of construction material and petroleum prices increased manifold.\nHe said the Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA) will have no option but to surrender the Rs1 billion fund released for the project in the current fiscal year as it was not yet utilised.\nHe said a meeting of the district and garrison authorities will held on Thursday (May 4) to review the project and a final decision will be made whether or not to start work in the current fiscal year.\n\u201cThe RDA awarded the contract to Frontier Works Organisation (FWO) and asked it to submit a traffic plan so construction work will not disturb the routine traffic,\u201d he said.\nHe said the meeting of the district and garrison authorities would also discuss the traffic plan submitted by the contractor.\nOn the other hand, a senior RDA official was of the view that the project was not likely to be launched in this fiscal year as the district administration was yet to acquire the land for the construction of a flyover and an underpass.\n\u201cFatima Jinnah Women University (FJWU)\u2019s historical building formerly known as Prince Mansion, which served as Presidency, and the State Guest House will also lose its 46 marlas while the adjoining Commissioner House and other district administration buildings will not be affected by it,\u201d he said.\nHe said the administration had failed to start initial work on the acquisition of land which would take more than a month and the fiscal year will end on June 30. \u201cIt is not possible to complete the homework within one or two months,\u201d he said.\nAccording to the project, a 2+2 lane flyover will be constructed for Rawat to Saddar-bound traffic, two-lane flyover for Marrir to Rawat traffic, two-lane exit ramp for Rawat to the old airport-bound traffic and Rawat to Marrir-bound traffic.\nA 2+2 lane underpass for the airport to Saddar-bound and an underpass for Iftikhar Janjua Road to the airport-bound traffic would also be constructed.\nUnder the project, a flyover will be constructed to cater to traffic coming from Rawat after the construction of Kharian Motorway which will be connected to Grand Trunk Road and the Rawalpindi Ring Road project. It will provide an easy access to 131,500 vehicles per day. However, in the previous design, the remodeling catered to only 100,000 vehicles a day.\nWhen contacted, RDA Director General Saif Anwar Jappa said the project cost was not yet evaluated and the meeting of the district and garrison authorities would be held on May 4 to review the arrangements to start work on the project.\nHe said the Punjab government had provided Rs1 billion to the RDA for mobilisation of the contractor and in the meeting next week, \u201cwe will make a decision on how to start the work on the project. In this regard, the traffic plan submitted by the contractor would also be discussed.\u201d\nHe said the provincial government was interested in launching work on the signal-free corridor from Koral Chowk to Motorway Chowk and the Kutchery Chowk remodeling and Liaquat Bagh underpass projects to ease traffic rush in the garrison city.\nHe said the RDA had completed the homework and would start the work soon after getting the go-ahead signal from the government.\n"

While the cost of a cup of tea (doodh patti) was increased to Rs70.\nIn October, 2021 the cost of a cup of tea was increased from Rs30 to Rs40 almost 35pc due to the continuous rising price of loose tea, tea bags, milk, sugar and gas.\nThe increase from Rs30 to Rs40 was almost 35pc due to increased cost of loose tea, tea bags, milk, sugar and gas which have not remained constant over the years.\n\u201cIt is justified that tea sellers should be allowed to increase the price of a cup of tea due to a hike in prices of ingredients,\u201d a tea seller told Dawn.\nHe said that his earning was badly affected, while selling a cup of tea for Rs60 and many of his regular customers have either reduced taking tea while some have given up.\nHe said that he has been very worried about the situation and is considering changing his trade as he cannot meet his daily life expenses in this situation.\nThe rise in the price of a cup of tea has had an impact on the business community as well as on people working in offices.\nWhen contacted, a trader said: \u201cI have given up taking tea and offering it to my customers. I will bring a tea kettle from my home and will prepare tea by myself to control my expenses.\u201d\nWhile another school teacher (salaried person) said in his comments that with the increase in the price of a tea cup, he has not been in a position to consume two to three cups of tea in a single day or offer tea to visitors.\n"

This school has 14 girl students.\nSimilarly, there is another girls primary school in Dhoke Haider Khan in Sehr Bagla Union Council where there is zero enrollment due to absence of a teacher. Around four years ago, this school had over 30 students.\nThe third such school is the primary school in Bhenati which has 48 students. Currently, a teacher from the already under-staffed Kakrai elementary school (which has 124 students and now two teachers) has been performing her duties in this school on a temporary basis. \nMeanwhile, primary schools Rhatal (Bann-Chahrian) and Topa Kair are also being run by single borrowed teachers from other schools.\nBesides the issues of teacher-less schools and so-called attachment duties, schools of Murree have been facing shortage of teachers overall. \nSources said there were 234 schools in Murree, including around 151 primary schools. These primary schools face a shortage of teachers, they added.\nThe sources said that there are a total of 1,098 sanctioned posts of primary teachers and out of the total, 366 have been lying vacant. \n\u201cWe have a total of 732 primary teachers. There is need to fill the vacant posts, besides, undoing illogical attachment duties of teachers so that students of all schools could have teachers,\u201d said an official.\nIt is relevant to note here that because of various factors including shortage of infrastructure, teachers and awareness, Pakistan has 23 million out-of-school children, which is the highest figure in the world. \nWhereas, besides this issue, dropout is also a major phenomenon and teacher-less and under staffed schools could be one of the reasons that students drop out of schools.\nWhen contacted, Deputy District Education Officer (Murree) Dr Hajra Shaheen said that there were five teacher-less schools in Murree, adding that through temporary arrangements, she had been running these schools. \n\u201cAs far as posting of teachers on attachment basis was concerned, we have already taken notice of this issue and soon, such temporary duties will be undone,\u201d she said.\nMeanwhile, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Yasin Baloch from Rawalpindi (as education sector of Murree district still falls under the domain of CEO Rawalpindi), said that within the next couple of days, he would cancel orders of teachers serving on attachment basis to ensure posting of teachers in those schools, which were facing shortage of teachers.\n\u201cAs far as the five schools are concerned, I will ensure posting of teachers in all these schools. Currently, I have no idea about such schools as last week I joined as CEO, but let me make it clear, I will resolve this issue,\u201d he said and added that steps will also be taken to fill the vacant teaching posts in Murree. \nA couple of years ago the government had announced over 500 teaching posts, specifically for Murree and Kotli Sattian, but only around 150 teachers could pass the exams, therefore, majority of the said positions remain unfilled.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: As up to 53 per cent of the adult population in Pakistan has no access to banks and related financial services, the gap is being filled by a growing number of Non-Banking Finance Companies (NBFCs), which not only provide various banking services to customers but also rid the market of illegal players.\nAs most Pakistanis fail to avail of banking services, they have no option but to rely on \u2018loan sharks\u2019 to finance household expenditures on credit or for other emergency expenses. However, the NBFCs have been introduced by the government to provide services to the unbanked population in order to eliminate the unregulated credit market. These companies provide financial services, mainly relating to credit, under five categories: investment banks, non-bank microfinance companies, leasing companies, housing finance companies, and discounting companies.\nAs the NBFCs aim to eliminate unregulated and illegal players in the field, their number continues to grow \u2013 despite the economic turndown \u2013 on the back of Chinese investments in the small and micro financial sector.\n\u2018Legend Financial Services\u2019 is the latest firm to obtain a licence from the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP).\n\nOfficial says growth of finance companies will eliminate unregulated credit market\n\nA senior official of the SECP said that registered companies giving digital loans or providing goods on credits were regulated entities and any violation of law, including coercing customers, were checked.\n\u201cSince banks do not operate at a micro level, only these NBFCs can eliminate illegal and unregulated lending, including the sale of household goods at exorbitant credits,\u201d the official said in reference to instalments.\nAs the investments in NBFCs continue to grow, many Chinese law firms have also established their offices in Pakistan to facilitate their clients belonging to mainland China.\nDonna Tang of Esquare Legal firm \u2013 which acquired the licence for \u2018Legend Financial Services\u2019 \u2013 has opened an international office in Islamabad amid millions of dollars of investments by Chinese nationals in Pakistan.\nMs Tang told Dawn said that the entry of Chinese law firms in Pakistan was an important development, citing deepening economic ties between China and Pakistan.\nShe said the enhanced ties highlighted the importance of legal expertise to facilitate investments and will also strengthen confidence of Chinese investors in Pakistan.\n\u201cThe Chinese investments are not only in NBFCs, but our firm has also obtained a licence from the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap) for a Chinese medicine company,\u201d she said, adding that this registration is part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) health corridor project \u2013 an integral component of the CPEC initiative.\n\u201cThe NBFCs play a crucial role in the financial and fintech ecosystem and Pakistan has seen a 600pc growth in the NBFC sector in the last year,\u201d she claimed.\n"

The police chased them and intercepted one of the cars in Gulshan-i-Hadeed near Al-Khidmat Hospital. During the search, the bodies of two young men were recovered from its boot, the police said. \nThe dead were identified as Zahid Razzaq, 36, and Abdul Ghani, 33. Two suspects \u2014 Gulbahar and Mohammed Amin \u2014 were taken into custody, they added.\nThe police also traced another car and arrested one more suspect, Zubair Saqib.\nDuring the investigation, the suspects disclosed to their involvement in stealing oil from an underground pipeline. They dug up a tunnel to get an illegal connection from a warehouse but it caved in while digging and apparently the two persons, whose bodies were recovered from the car, died in the incident.\nIt appeared that the held suspects were transporting the bodies to somewhere else when they were caught. However, officials said they were still investigating the matter.\nAn Edhi Foundation spokesperson said the two had died while digging at a warehouse in Bin Qasim.\nThe bodies were shifted to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for completing medico-legal formalities.\nRecently, two attempts to steal oil from the Pak-Arab Refinery Company (Parco) pipeline passing through the Shah Latif Town and Clifton areas have been unearthed.\n"

The march lasted more than two hours. \nKarachi JI chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman, who led the thousands of protesters from across the city, threw a challenge in his speech to federal authorities and institutions involved in the ongoing census exercise and leaders of ruling alliance to debate with him in public if anyone had any doubts about the Karachi population being less than 35 million. \n\u201cAnd this sea of people here on Sharea Faisal, who represents all ethnicities, sects, religions and national identities, show their mistrust in the ongoing census and they won\u2019t accept any number of Karachi population below 35 million,\u201d he said amid the crowd\u2019s roar. \n\u201cAnd where are the so-called national leaders whether Imran Khan or Nawaz Sharif and Asif Zardari or Asfandyar Wali? Why don\u2019t you speak up for the rights of Karachi and its people? Why don\u2019t you visit and see the state of this city? Let me tell you loud and clear. The people of Karachi won\u2019t forgive any of you if they are deceived again in the name of census,\u201d he remarked. \nHe called it a criminal act on part of political parties representing Karachi not to play their role against the National Census 2017 which put with mala fide intention the city\u2019s population at much less figure than the actual one. Now the same parties, he said, were \u201cbargaining\u201d again for their vested interests and were ready to accept the ongoing census with all its flaws. \n\u201cIsn\u2019t it a joke that the city which is called business capital of the country is crying for jobs for its youths? Isn\u2019t it a fraud that the city which caters to people from every part of the country is pushed against the wall for political gains and in the name of ethnic divide? This mindset will no more work and the JI will exercise its every legal, democratic and constitutional right to resist all anti-Karachi plans,\u201d vowed JI leader. \nHe believed the actual headcount in the city would lead to increase in its provincial assembly seats from 44 to 65 seats, which might pave the way for the election of a Karachiite chief minister in a house of 130 seats and Pakistan People Party would definitely take it as its political suicide. \nOn the other hand, he said, number of households in rural areas of the province was being increased fraudulently to maximize the scope of corruption in the Benazir Income Support Program and other such projects. Progress of Karachi would directly result in the progress of Pakistan, he said and demanded the PPP treat Karachi like the rest of the province.\nHighlighting the negligence, corruption and incompetence of the PPP government, he complained that startup incubators were available in Punjab but not in Sindh. Why no mega development project had been launched in Karachi, why there was no mass transit system in the city and why the entire city was in a shambles, he asked.\n"

They termed counting of immigrants in Karachi a conspiracy to change demography of Sindh and convert Sindhis into a minority in their own province. \nSpeaking at a joint news conference at the local press club, Sindh United Party secretary general Roshan Buriro, Qaumi Awami Tehreek president Ayaz Latif Palijo, Jeay Sindh Mahaz-Riaz chairman Riaz Ali Chandio, Dr Badar Channa and Shafiq Moosvi said that a meeting of the Sindh Action Committee would be convened soon to consider giving a Sindh-wide wheel-jam strike call. \nAyaz Palijo pointed out that Sindh was not accepting the results of the digital census because a fraud was committed by reducing even the numbers of 2017 census. He observed that \u201cSindh doesn\u2019t feature on the agenda of the federal coalition, judiciary and PTI [Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf]\u201d. \nHe wondered that the apex court was silent over this fraud, and regretted that the judiciary focused on \u2018Takht-i-Lahore\u2019 alone for which benches were formed doors of courts had been opened in midnight hours. \nPalijo said a fresh population census was due in 2027 but it was thrust upon the country as early as 2023. He said a Karachi-based party did not have any objection on the [counting of] Burmese, Biharis, Afghans and Bengalis in the census but it had only objection to the population of Sindhis. He said a conspiracy was being hatched to convert Sindhis into a minority within their homeland which was a question of Sindh\u2019s existence.  \nRiaz Chandio said that Punjab wanted to occupy parliament on the basis of fake digital census. The biggest province, he alleged, had been usurping resources of Sindh since day one. He also accused Jamaat-i-Islami and Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan of trying to increase the numbers of Karachi fraudulently and that the federal coalition was part of this conspiracy.  \n\u201cNobody would have any objection if a genuine census is held from Kashmore to Karachi,\u201d Chandio said.\n"

Meanwhile, women and gender minorities in particular are denied minimum wage and decent work. \nThey demanded living wages for all workers be they working in factories, farms or homesteads, as sanitation workers or as domestic workers. \nThey also demanded social security for all and also for the government to take notice of the continuing practice of bonded labour here. \nThe organisations include Joint Action Committee (JAC), Tehrik-i-Niswan, Pakistan Institute of Labour Education and Research (Piler), Peace and Development Organisation and Pakistan Trade Union Defence Campaign (PTUDC).\nKaramat Ali of Piler said that not much is different here in Pakistan today from what the protesters in Chicago faced on May 1 in 1886. \u201cThey were demanding an eight-hour work day and rightful wages. We are fighting for the same here even today. And our women workers are in an even worse condition than the men,\u201d he said. \nFatima Majeed of the Pakistan Fisherfolk Forum said that women workers do as much work as men, perhaps even more and yet they don\u2019t get equal wages. \n\u201cAll of us work hard to earn an honest income but here the women who take care of their homes, their children as well as indulge in hard labour to earn a living are not treated equally though they deserve more respect for working double hard,\u201d she said, adding that they were looking for respect and acknowledgement of their contribution in the country\u2019s economy, too. \nSocial worker and activist Sheema Kermani and Azhar Shaan sang a tarana (anthem) to pay tribute to those who have over the years given their lives while standing up for their rights and demanding justice. They cried for the rights of workers who turn the wheel of prosperity for their country while the stoves in their own kitchens remain cold. But his song also included hope for the future like there is morning after night.\n"

In 1973, for example, on the eve of May Day, an impressive torchlight procession was taken out by the workers in Karachi. The parade, organised by the Muttahida Mazdoor Federation, Sindh, started from Shaheed Chowk in Banaras Colony and terminated at Bara Maidaan after passing through Nazimabad. \nOn May 1, a good number of events were arranged. The PECHS Girls College took the lead over all educational institutions by holding a lively speech contest and a variety show. Presided over by the Provincial Labour Minister, Abdul Sattar Gabol, the function lasted for a little less than two hours ending with an exhibition of paintings with which the students had decorated the auditorium where the event was arranged. \nThen the \u2018first-of-a-kind\u2019 women\u2019s meeting in Karachi was held to assure workers of their sustained support in the struggle to free themselves from exploitation, hunger and disease. Held under the auspices of the Anjuman Jamhuriat Pasand Khawateen at Katrak Hall, it was chaired by the anjuman\u2019s president, Begum Mumtaz Noorani and was addressed by women workers, girl students, labour leaders, writers and poets including Kaneez Fatima, Fahmida Riaz, Saroor Barabankvi, Karamat Ali and Anis Roohi. \nIronically, on May 3, about 500 class IV railway employees went on a lightning strike disrupting railway traffic for over five hours to press the authorities to accept their demands. Their demands included reservation of a separate compartment for all class IV employees; payment of wages as promised to the workers the previous month; and issuance of passes to the gang staff on duty. \nIf that wasn\u2019t enough to disturb the working class movement, on May 4 it was reported that oil paintings depicting the struggle of workers by a young artist were not allowed to exhibit at the Arts Council. Earlier, the council had also cancelled a play having a progressive theme to be staged to celebrate the passing of the country\u2019s new constitution. The paintings, by Shamim Ahmed, were later put on display at the Karachi Press Club. Progressive circles viewed the Arts Council\u2019s measures with concern. \nStaying on the subject of art and politics, on May 6, glowing tributes were paid to the Central Minister for Information, Broadcasting, Hajj and Auqaf, Maulana Kausar Niazi for his invaluable services to the field of literature at a local hotel. On the occasion, books written by Maulana Niazi and sponsored by the National Book Centre of Pakistan were introduced. The publications were: Bunyadi Haqiqatein, Baseerat, Islam Hamara Deen, Aina-i-Taslees and Takhleeq-i-Adam. The tribute was presided over by Pir Hisamuddin Rashdi and the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Karachi, Dr Mahmud Husain was the chief guest. The speakers \u2014 Dr A Waheed, Hamid Mahmud, Syed Mohammad Taqqi and Mumtaz Hasan \u2014 were of the opinion that the author had rendered a great service to the ideology of Pakistan. The books, they added, would go a long way in reforming the younger generation which was rapidly deviating from the teachings of Islam.\n"

Shah press club and on Indus Highway. \nThe protesters\u2019 leaders accused Dadu district administration and Sindh government of failing to take preventative measures to protect urban population and rural areas from the twin disaster.  \nThey said that the breaches in Flood Protective bund, MNV drain and Suprio bund had not been even after several months. The rain had started earlier this year and the rainwater from Balochistan would once again flow into K.N. Shah and villages of Dadu, Mehar and Johi talukas, they feared.  \nThey said that billions of rupees had been embezzled in the name of dewatering K.N. Shah and other areas, supplying ration and providing health facilities though in reality the district administration and Sindh government had done nothing for flood victims. About 1.2 million people had been displaced who had not been rehabilitated yet, they said.  \nThey said the government officers had purchased costly vehicles and bungalows in Hyderabad and Karachi and in foreign countries while the poor flood victims were getting even three time meal and clean water.  \nThey said that politicians, Sindh and federal governments and international donors had forgotten them. Federal and provincial ministers only staged photo sessions in their areas and not helped them, they said.  \nThey demanded registration of FIR against the corrupt officials, who had minted million of rupees and siphoned off money to other countries, for deaths of flood victims who had died on roadsides, camps and tents \nThey said that MPAs and MNAs of flood hit areas of the district were busy embezzling funds reserved for repair and reconstruction of damaged roads and embankments. Recently, Rs2 billion set aside for repair and construction of damaged roads in the district had been swallowed up, they said.\n"

Shortly after, a large hole measuring 20 feet appeared downstream, causing water to gush out. \nThe high water flow resulted in the flooding of several acres of land, affecting sugarcane, fodder, and some mango orchards. With time, the breach widened and submerged the canal bank. \nLocal residents promptly informed the irrigation staff about the situation. However, according to the Senior Engineer Abdul Wahid, there was no breach in the Senawar Minor canal.

She explained that government institutes have been strictly instructed not to comment on suspected or probable cases of monkeypox in order to prevent panic and fear among the public.\nRegarding the two new patients, she mentioned that initial inquiries indicated that they had no significant exposure to the virus, as they had no travel history and had not come into contact with the two confirmed cases of monkeypox reported recently in Pakistan.\nShe added that the IPH has issued a new advisory for state-run and other hospitals in Punjab, outlining the reporting process for suspected or confirmed cases of monkeypox.  \nProf Zarfishan stated that she would be the official focal person responsible for providing information about reported cases of the virus, in order to prevent the dissemination of false information.\nRegarding the samples taken from the suspected patients, she mentioned that they were currently being examined, and a report on the matter would be issued soon.\nMeanwhile, the Punjab health minister took note of a doctor from Nishtar Hospital of Multan for uploading fake information about mpox cases and the virus on social media. A probe committee has been formed to investigate the doctor\u2019s actions and hold him accountable for creating panic among the public.\nAccording to the notification, Muzammil Bashir, additional secretary of health of south Punjab, has been appointed as the convener of the probe committee. \nThree other officials, including Dr Mohammad Azam Khan, a professor of pediatric medicine at Nishtar Medical University Multan, Dr Ali Mehdi, additional medical superintendent of the institute, and Dr Amir Asad, director administration, will assist him as members of the committee.\nThe committee has been instructed to submit a fact-finding report as soon as possible regarding the doctor\u2019s release of false and fabricated information on social media.\n"

The same agony was faced by those passengers who had to disembark here.  \nWhen relatives of some passengers complained to the Assistant Station Master Badshah Khan, he sent a message to the divisional commercial officer of PR\u2019s Sukkur division who ordered an inquiry into the matter. \nOvershooting the platform is punishable for drivers and support staff under the Pakistan Railway laws.\n"

            "Text": "LAHORE: The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) expressed serious concern on Sunday regarding the dire economic situation in the country, the purported increase in child labor and exploitative practices, and reports of suicides allegedly linked to poverty.\nThe HRCP, in a statement issued on Sunday, emphasized the urgent need for land reforms to address economic inequality and expresses alarm at the growth of high-income housing societies, which leads to the depletion of agricultural land and poses a risk of rising food insecurity.\nThe commission strongly believes that the increasing political polarisation has undermined parliamentary supremacy. Concerns over the census and allegations of under-counting must also be addressed, as they have implications for the delimitation of electoral constituencies.\nLocal governments need to be made more effective in all provinces to protect people\u2019s rights. The HRCP also demands greater judicial accountability and transparency in the appointment of judges.\nUnseasonal rains and the growing possibility of floods in Sindh and Balochistan are causes for alarm. Efforts should be made to rehabilitate those displaced by earlier floods in areas that are not vulnerable to further natural disasters.\nThe HRCP is also alarmed by the deteriorating law and order situation in northern Sindh and southern Punjab, including the increase in dacoities and kidnappings, as well as reports of the growing presence of militants in Gilgit-Baltistan and Kohistan.\nThe state must make a concerted effort to protect the rights of vulnerable groups, including Afghan refugees settled in makeshift camps in Islamabad. The long-standing demand for compensation for people displaced by the 2010 Attabad disaster and the Kargil war in Gilgit-Baltistan must be addressed, and every effort should be made to repatriate Pakistani fisherfolk incarcerated in Indian jails. The HRCP is also concerned about the ongoing legal challenges against the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act 2018.\nThe HRCP is especially concerned about the situation of religious minorities, who continue to face discrimination and violence. The bill criminalizing forced conversions, currently with the Sindh government, should be passed without further delay. The implementation of the Sindh Students Union Act must also be expedited.\nThe continued use of Schedule IV of the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1997 to harass human rights defenders, political dissidents, and journalists in Gilgit-Baltistan must stop. Additionally, the journalists\u2019 safety commission established under the Protection of Journalists and Media Professionals Act 2021 should be made operational.\nThe HRCP reiterates its dissatisfaction with the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances, as the perpetrators of enforced disappearances have not been held accountable. Transparency is also needed regarding the allocation of resources to the newly merged districts in KP, as there are reports of unfulfilled allocations. Moreover, concerted efforts should be made to remove landmines in KP.\n"

        },
        "Details": {
            "Text": "LAHORE: The scope of the probe into alleged corruption has been widened after Rs135m bid security issued to a lead partner of a joint venture to get contract of a USD39m gas compression project was encashed by the Oil & Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL) due to irregularities, mismanagement and misuse of power allegedly on the part of the removed managing director (MD) of the Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL).\nAccording to official sources, the issues involving a major loss of Rs135m allegedly on the part of the suspended MD Ali J. Hamdani emerged during various recent internal checks, forcing the authorities to broaden the scope of the ongoing inquiries separately by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and the board of directors (BoD) of the company. \nOn the other hand, Mr Hamdani has allegedly refused to sit in the office allotted to him at 2nd floor of the SNGPL head office in Lahore as he reportedly continues insisting to sit in the MD office that has already been sealed by the management, Dawn has learnt.\nSources said the OGDCL floated tenders for hiring of the EPCC contractor for designing, engineering, procurement (supply), construction, installation/erection, pre-commissioning, commissioning and start up (including performance testing and reliability guarantee test) of the Uch Front End Compression Project through print media on Oct 10, 2021 and Nov 6, 2021 and later extended the date of submission of the bidding documents till Feb 16, last year. \n\nRevelations emerge about suspended MD\u2019s role in Rs135m loss; he denies charges\n\nAfter technical evaluation of the bids received from various companies, one submitted by a JV led by a leading private firm, owned by a former federal minister, with secondary partnership of the SNGPL was found to be \u2018technically responsive\u2019 for the project worth USD39m. The SNGPL, being 50pc partner in the JV led by the private firm, also issued Rs135m to the firm as a part of its share (50pc) for submission of the bid security, amounting to Rs270m in total by the JV to the project owner, OGDCL.\n\u201cAfter finding the bid as responsive technically, the project owner (OGDCL) sought performance guarantee (10pc of the total cost of the project) from the JV. At this, he (the MD) had no option but to consult and get it approved by the BoD under the law. But when he tabled it, the BoD refused to own the decision of the MD, as according to it, he (the MD) neither discussed the project nor had got the company participation as secondary partner of a JV approved before initiation of the bidding process,\u201d a senior official, who requested anonymity, explained while talking to Dawn. \n\u201cFinally, the board rejected the case as being unlawful. The entire procurement process was also not transparent,\u201d the official said, adding that the bid security of Rs135m was later encashed by the OGDCL, causing such a huge financial loss to the company. He said the officers at the SNGPL were also threatened, harassed and coerced allegedly into going along with his orders of issuing the bid bond and entering into contract worth $39m.\nIt merits mention that the outgoing MD has been facing various other allegations, including adoption of a 270km route for Bannu West and Walid 1 gas pipeline project instead of 55km despite being repeatedly agitated by the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) at a projected cost of Rs22bn. \nDuring his tenure of two years, he (being a resident of Karachi) was reported to have travelled to Karachi from Lahore 75 times for personal reasons by making these as official trips through arranging meetings in Karachi instead of Lahore. \n\u201cIn a bid to justify and show his trips as official, he used to take various officers to Karachi along with him that resulted in loss of millions of rupees to the public money.\n\u201cThe MD has entitlement of keeping two vehicles at his or her disposal but he used to keep seven vehicles. Besides, he wanted the company to buy more luxury vehicles in violation of the austerity policy,\u201d said another official source.\n\u201cInternal audit reports also raised observations on misuse of power by him,\u201d he said and added that Mr Hamdani was reported to be \u2018unlawfully\u2019 absent from his official duties for the last two months after the SNGPL BoD barred him from exercising his powers as the MD in February this year while assigning the charge of acting MD to Amer Tufail. The company\u2019s BoD didn\u2019t dismiss him as it only revoked his power of attorney until completion of the inquiries against him. \u201cBut the defunct MD is not ready to come to office without the protocol given to a functional MD only. Some time back videos of his extraordinary protocol went viral on social media inviting harsh criticism against the company management,\u201d the official said.\nHe said the SNGPL\u2019s management is of the view that in accordance with the board\u2019s directives, Mr Hamdani could not use his powers but he was obligated to attend the office on a regular basis like all other employees. Any employee of the company is not entitled to salary if he/she is not attending office regularly, even an officer under suspension has to attend office on working days under the rules. The official said the HR Dept issued notices of unauthorised absence from service to him, but he didn\u2019t bother.\nWhen contacted, Mr Hamdani rejected the allegations and termed the SNGPL\u2019s board immature. \n\u201cThe encashment of the bid security by the project owner is just due to negligence of the sitting management and not me. Why didn\u2019t the company challenge it? And why was this issue not raised when I was the MD?\u201d he questioned.\nHe also rejected the allegation about adoption of a long route for a gas pipeline project. \n\u201cFor taking such routes, many organisations, people used to give their input and it was not the decision of the MD alone,\u201d he clarified, claiming that Ogra had been convinced on the pipeline route. \nMr Hamdani said he made all the trips to Karachi genuinely since the Karachi was the city from where the pipelines were coming to Punjab. \n\u201cThere are several issues that are required to be done while sitting in Karachi and not Lahore,\u201d he argued, adding that why everything bad against him was happening after he was removed.\n"

            "Text": "GUJRAT: PML-N leader and Federal Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif has dared PTI chief Imran Khan to go for protest rallies so that the federal government could leave the negotiations, saying every political step of Mr Khan during the last one year has failed like a flopped movie. \nSpeaking to a media conference at his hometown, Sialkot, on Sunday, Asif said Imran Khan had organised at least three long marches last year but they all failed.  \nHe tendered resignations from the National Assembly, then started seeking their rejection and later dissolved Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa assemblies. Now speakers of both these assemblies had filed petitions seeking restoration of these assemblies, Asif said, expressing surprise at the moves of the PTI chief and his party leaders. \n\u201cEvery political move of Khan has only benefitted the ruling coalition instead of paying dividends to the PTI whereas the PTI leadership has been abusing its previous facilitators. It should be an eye opener for its new facilitators that how this man (Imran) treats the people after getting benefits from them,\u201d the federal minister said. \nReferring to a recently leaked audio of conversation involving the son of former chief justice Saqib Nisar, he said the audio had exposed the pollution in the mind of the then chief justice of Pakistan against the then prime minister Nawaz Sharif. He blamed the nexus between the then judiciary and PTI-led administration for the chaos, causing economic losses to the country. \nCriticising the advice by judiciary for talks between the political parties, Khawaja Asif said with all due respect, the judiciary had adopted the role of a Panchayat instead of giving verdicts as per law and the constitution which was its actual role. \nResponding to a question, the PML-N leader said the timing of Nawaz Sharif\u2019s return to the country would play a vital role in the politics and the PML-N would decide the appropriate time for the return of its supreme leader. However, he indicated that Nawaz might return before the October election this year. \nMr Asif criticised the former Punjab chief minister Parvez Elahi for ending his lifelong affiliation with the Muslim League to become the president of the PTI as Imran Khan used to call him as the biggest dacoit of the province whereas Mr Elahi would often take on the establishment and military leadership for changing \u2018the nappies of Mr Khan\u2019. \nThe federal minister said some elements in Punjab had purchased the USD at Rs300 in the recent past that indicated how much public money had been plundered and then shifted to Spain. \nResponding to another question, he predicted the next fiscal year\u2019s budget to be public-friendly with relief to the salaried and poor classes as economic conditions would improve after the financial assistance from some friendly countries. He said the government had fulfilled all the conditions of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that too would hopefully release the installment.\n"

Consequently, the ombudsman office informed the board of revenue (BoR) that prima facie there was a lack of oversight in monitoring the performance of land acquisition collectors after their attachments with the provincial government departments. \nAs a result, substantial funds deposited with the land acquisition collectors\u2019 accounts by the government remain unused, causing delays in compensating the affected individuals. \nTherefore, an institutionalised system should be devised by the BoR for monitoring the land acquisition collectors\u2019 performance and ensuring timely payments to the owners of the acquired land.  \nThrough liaison with the offices of commissioner Lahore and deputy commissioner Sheikhupura, the district price assessment committee Sheikhupura has settled the compensation price of the acquired pieces of land and payments to the landowners have started by the office of the assistant commissioner/land acquisition collector Ferozewala, concluded the spokesman.\n"

As a result, six rice mills have been sealed, and an FIR has been registered against the accused.\nDeputy Commissioner Adnan Mahmood Awan conducted a crackdown on hoarding based on a tip-off in Daska\u2019s area of Saranwali.\nMr Awan stated they received information that the owners of rice mills had bought wheat and kept it hidden in their warehouses. During the operation, 17,000 bags of wheat were recovered from Mili Rice Mills, 17,000 bags from Hatim Rice Mills, 12,000 bags from Kisan Rice Mills, 17,000 bags from Iman Rice Mills, 14,000 bags from Abdullah Rice Mills, and 13,000 bags from Modern Rice Mills. \nThe recovered wheat has been handed over to the Foods Department, and legal action will be taken against the owners of the rice mills, the DC said and added the government has set a target of 90,000 metric tons of wheat for the Sialkot district this year. To facilitate this, 1,258 empty bags have been distributed to farmers and 10 wheat purchasing centres have been established throughout the district. The administration has bought 573,466 bags of wheat in the ongoing drive.\nMUZAFFARGARH: Up to 5,000 wheat bags were seized, and a stockpiler was arrested during a raid conducted by agriculture officials and the police in Kot Addu district in Ahsanpur. \nThe bags were illegally stored in two warehouses. The raid was carried out by Agriculture Assistant Director Talha Sheikh. The godown at the government seed farm was sealed, and one Samiullah was handed over to the police. \nDeputy Commissioner Salman Khan claimed that the value of the seized wheat was over Rs25 million. The assistant director added that sensitive institutions are actively involved in preventing illegal wheat hoarding, and the targets for wheat procurement will be achieved at any cost. \nOn Saturday, the administration in Chowk Sarwar Shaheed arrested a hoarder and seized 400 bags of wheat. Sources mentioned that the food department has yet to meet its target, as the wheat is not visible in the fields. An official stated that the target for wheat in Muzaffargarh and Kot Addu districts was 141,000 metric tons across 17 wheat procurement centres, but only 80,000 metric tons of wheat have been purchased so far.\nOKARA: The administration prevented the transportation of 36,000 kg of wheat outside the district limits, which violated the inter-district ban imposed by the Punjab government. \nRenala Assistant Commissioner Chaudhry Ziaullah, along with officials from the Food Department and the police, seized 12,000 kg (300 mounds) of wheat in village Kaloowal, and 10,000 kg (250 mounds)  in village Chuchak. In both incidents, tractor-trolleys were impounded at the local police station, and the wheat was transferred to the Bama Bala procurement centre.\nAdditionally, Food Inspector Ajmal Hussain, accompanied by the police, intercepted a tractor-trolley loaded with 14,000 kg (350 mounds) of wheat near Haveli Lakkha. The wheat was taken to the Haveli Lakkha wheat procurement centre, and the vehicle was impounded at the Haveli police station. Cases were registered under the Punjab Food Act in relation to each incident.\n"

On the same night, those individuals had also engaged in a scuffle with staff at another cinema over the same issue, leading to a case being registered against them. \nSharafat Ali suspected that the same accused individuals might have been responsible for his son\u2019s murder.

            "Text": "LAHORE: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Labour Wing president Rana Samee has expressed his disappointment with political parties, stating that no party has genuinely worked for the betterment of labourers after coming into power. He believes that once in power, all political parties, including PTI, forget about the labourers as they are ruled by the elites.\nMr Samee, speaking to Dawn on the eve of Labour Day on Sunday, pointed out that the prices of daily use items have increased significantly, up to 48 percent, which has led to a lack of trust in political parties among the labourers. He warned that such a situation might prompt the labourers to revolt, reminiscent of the Chicago revolution witnessed on May 1, 1886.\nExpressing his regret, Mr Samee stated that the PTI has not presented any agenda or plan for the welfare of labourers. He criticised PTI for including the \u201cSave Constitution \u2013 Save Pakistan\u201d schedule for the Labour Day rally and suggested that the party should have organised rallies across the country instead of just in Lahore, Islamabad, and Peshawar. He emphasized the need for the PTI to unite all stakeholders and stand up for labourers to help them obtain their rightful rights.\nHighlighting the significance of Labour Day in commemorating the struggle of Chicago workers, the PTI labour wing leader stated that the condition of labourers in Pakistan over the past 75 years has been worse than that of the labourers in 1886. He criticized Nawaz Sharif, Imran Khan, and Asif Ali Zardari, claiming that they were in power to protect their business interests and never introduced any programs for the welfare of workers.\nMr Samee lamented that workers are aware that politicians only remember them during election campaigns or opposition days. He pointed out that during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, it became evident that no political party or government was prepared to address the issue of unemployment.\nHe stressed that labour rights have not been effectively implemented in Pakistan, with only two percent of institutions following the government\u2019s minimum salary announcement, while 98 percent have failed to comply. Similarly, laws regarding sick leave, casual leave, annual leave, and gratuity are not being adequately followed.\nHe also criticised the implementation of the 18th Amendment in 2010, stating that it benefited Nawaz Sharif, Asif Zardari, and Imran Khan, but the labour clause, such as the EOBI workers\u2019 welfare fund, was not implemented. He added that the finance ministry had not released Rs162 billion to the workers\u2019 welfare fund, causing delays in development projects such as labour colonies and other welfare initiatives.\nMr Samee noted that only five percent of workers are registered with social security and even they do not have access to adequate medical facilities. He mentioned that a meager amount, less than 10 percent, of the labour welfare institutions\u2019 budget for salary benefits is actually spent on labour. He criticized labour leader unions, federations, and confederations, stating that they are currently inactive in Pakistan, and that the majority of pocket unions have become tools of capitalists and the bureaucracy. \n"

He lamented that the programme had become a target due to the internal political differences within the PML-N. He said Mr Abbasi should either apologise or provide evidence to back the allegations.\nSeparately, the province\u2019s food department has also denied any corruption.\nIn a statement, Punjab Food Director Shauzeb Saeed said his department had provided free flour to deserving families \u201cin a transparent and impartial way\u201d.\nThe eligible households were identified with the help of the Benazir Income Support Programme\u2019s data and verified through the Nadra database.\nHe said the entire process was computerised and all records were safe with the Punjab IT board and district administration, leaving no room for corruption.\nAllegations \nMr Abbasi is part of a group of political mavericks from across the political spectrum holding nationwide seminars under the title \u2018Reimagining Pakistan\u2019. He was addressing a gathering at Lahore\u2019s Government College University where he levelled the allegations.\n\u201cRecently, Rs84bn worth of [free] flour was distributed. I am sorry to say that approximately Rs20bn was looted,\u201d he said of the scheme initiated by PM Shehbaz Sharif and rolled out in Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Islamabad.\n\u201cLook at it any which way. What has the poor man gotten for whom you spent Rs84bn?\u201d he asked.\n\u2018Cat is out of the bag\u2019\nMr Abbasi\u2019s claims about the free flour programme found support among the rival PTI, whose leaders have long claimed corruption in the scheme saying that a more effective way to provide relief was the direct transfer of cash into poor people\u2019s accounts, just like the party did under its flagship Ehsaas programme.\nReferring to the allegations, PTI Punjab additional secretary information Hasaan Khawar said the scheme\u2019s design made it susceptible to corruption.\n\u201cThe easy and transparent way of cash distribution was deliberately ignored. The cat is out of the bag after Shahid Khaqan [Abbasi]\u2019s allegations. The scheme should be thoroughly audited and NAB should be asked to initiate a probe into it,\u201d he tweeted.\nPTI leader Fawad Chaudhry also demanded the NAB launch an investigation in light of Mr Abbasi\u2019s allegations.\nAmjad Mahmood in Lahore also contributed to this report\n"

Mr Bashir, a few months ago, had moved the judicial council against his boss.\nGrounds for CEC\u2019s removal\nThe letter sent to the secretary through the provincial election commissioner said the reference against the CEC will include the alleged use of undue influence for the furtherance of pecuniary interests in real estate and private businesses, and getting lucrative postings for the extended family of bureaucrats. Other accusations include spending of public funds during a financial crunch, failure to comply with constitutional commands, abuse of administrative authority, and tarnishing the administrative fabric of the ECP to influence general elections.\nThe official also sought a statement of assets of CEC Raja and his dependents, minutes of Departmental Development Working Party (DDWP) meetings, and allocations made to the Public Works Department in the financial year 2022-23. A copy of service rules along with amendments, and the seniority list of the ECP officers were also demanded.\n\nAlleges \u2018organisational structure\u2019 is at mercy of Sikandar Sultan Raja in absence of service rules\n\nIn separate letters to the ECP secretary, he declared his intention to challenge the appointments of Secretary Omar Hamid Khan (retired federal secretary), Special Secretary Zafar Iqbal Hussain (retired ECP officer), Additional Secretary (HR) Khalid Siddique (a retired civil servant), noting that these appointments had been made unlawfully.\nThe ECP official also wrote a letter addressed to President Arif Alvi, the National Assembly speaker, the Senate chairman, and members of parliament to invite their attention towards alleged illegal appointments in the ECP made in the absence of service rules. \nThe letter added that the ECP chief has the \u201csole administrative authority without the oversight of the commission \nin the absence of the service rules\u201d. \n\u201cNow the ECP\u2019s organisational structure is at the mercy of the commissioner who has appointed his retired colleagues and class fellows to senior administrative posts.

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: At least 140 cases of threats and attacks against journalists, media professionals and media organisations were reported in Pakistan over the past year, a report showed on Sunday, indicating an annual increase of over 60 per cent.\nThe annual Pakistan Press Freedom Report, prepared by the media rights watchdog Freedom Network, showed that Islamabad was the riskiest place to practise journalism in Pakistan, as 56, or 40pc, violations took place in the city.\nPunjab was the second worst, with 35 (25pc) cases of violations, followed by 32 (23pc) cases in Sindh.\nThe report, released ahead of the World Press Freedom Day celebrated on May 3, noted that the country\u2019s media environment became riskier and more violent in recent months, as the number of attacks surged 63pc to 140 between May 2022 and March 2023 from 86 in 2021-22.\n\nIslamabad emerges as riskiest place with 56 of 140 cases\n\nThe report also documented the killings of at least five journalists in Pakistan in the period under review.\n\u201cThe escalation in violence against journalists is disturbing and demands urgent attention,\u201d said Iqbal Khattak, the executive director of Freedom Network, which tracks press freedom violations around the year and publishes the annual report.\n\u201cAttacks on independent journalism block access to essential information, which is especially damaging during the ongoing political and economic crises when the public needs reliable news to understand the issues and respond to them,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt is ironic that Pakistan in 2021 became the first country in Asia to legislate on the safety of journalists, but one and a half years later, the federal and Sindh journalists\u2019 safety laws have not helped a single journalist resulting in increasing violence against them,\u201d Mr Khattak said.\nIn a statement, he said Freedom Network urged Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to urgently fulfil his promise made at an international conference in Islamabad on Nov 2, 2022, marking the international day to combat impunity of crimes against journalists, to notify the safety commission required under the Protection of Journalists and Media Professionals Act, 2021 so the law passed with bipartisan support by parliament can start helping journalists. The commission\u2019s absence continues to promote impunity of crimes against journalists.\nHe also urged Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah to equip its notified provincial safety commission under the Sindh Protection of Journalists and Other Media Practitioners Act 2021 with resources so that it could help journalists and empower them to combat the impunity of crimes against them in the province.\nOne violation every two days\nThe 140 attacks against journalists in the 11-month period in Pakistan showed that there were 13 cases a month, or a press freedom violation almost every other day.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: Over 80 per cent of Pakistanis do not have access to a library and another 60pc were without playgrounds, res\u00adu\u00adl\u00adting in very low social and civic engagement, acc\u00adording to new research by a government-run think tank.\n\u201cA vast majority of Pakistanis (83pc) do not have access to any library, with only a tiny proportion (4.5pc) being very happy with the one they can access,\u201d said the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (Pide) in its research paper \u201cShaping Minds and Bodies: Do We Have the Facilities\u201d.\nPide\u2019s Pro Vice-Chancellor Dr Durre Nayab said the access to a library remained low for both males and females but the latter had more inadequate access for all age groups.\n\u201cIf people rarely engaged socially, how will they keep themselves mentally and physically alive?\u201d she questioned.\n\nPide report says youth left without avenues for mind nurturing, recreational activities\n\nShe said it\u2019s not that other ages do not need libraries or playgrounds, but with the number of youth present in the country, the importance of having facilities where the young can shape and nourish their minds and bodies become all the more important.\nShe argued that libraries contribute to building communities and public libraries could provide education to those who otherwise cannot afford it.\nThe research found that nearly two-thirds of the urban population (62pc) does not have access to any sort of library, while only a minuscule proportion has access in the rural areas (4.7pc).\nAmong the four provinces, Balochistan came out better than others. Accessibility in KP was the least, with almost 94pc having no access to a library, followed by 84pc in Punjab, 76.1pc in Sindh and 72.3pc in Balochistan. Among the territories, 81pc of people in Islamabad have no access to a library, better than GB\u2019s 83pc and 87pc in AJK. Even in areas where people reported having access to some kind of library, those very happy with the facility remained low.\nDr Nayab elaborated that the report only quantified the reported access. There\u2019s every possibility that even in cases where libraries exist, they could remain inaccessible for a variety of reasons. Some of these reasons can be the awareness about its presence, distance to the facility, working hours and gender-exclusivity or inclusivity.\nWhile the research showed that education improved a person\u2019s reported accessibility to a library, education can also bring awareness and information, which a person without it can lack.\nThe presence of a facility can remain unknown to a person who is not interested in it or lacks knowledge about its existence. Additionally, accessibility to a library increases with increasing educational levels, while increasing income levels does not improve accessibility to a library by any significant margin. It is only for the highest income quantile that we see an observable decline in those reporting not having access to any kind of library \u2014 73.4pc as opposed to 85.5pc for the lowest quintile.\nAccess to playgrounds\nThe research showed 60pc Pakistanis have no playground access. While one-third of the urban population lacked access to a playground, the proportion was three-fourths for rural people.\nAlong with low accessibility, satisfaction \u2014 expressed in unhappy or very unhappy responses \u2014 too was much lower in the rural areas.\nIn terms of access to playgrounds, Punjab fared the best among the four provinces, followed by Balochistan and Sindh. KP showed the highest proportion of people without access to a playground (67.8pc). GB continued to show better trends than other territories, having the lowest proportion of those not having access to a playground (46.3pc). AJK lagged behind, with 62.3pc needing more access to a playground.\n"

However, the fact-finding committee comprising secretary of home and tribal  affairs and deputy inspector general of special branch of police visited the blast site and ruled out possibility of any militant attack on the police station, they added.\nSources didn\u2019t say what triggered the incident, adding the detailed report will bare it all.\nOn April 25, two powerful explosions inside the CTD police station left 18 persons dead and leaving 57 injured including police officials and civilians. The roofs of the CTD office, the police station and the nearby mosque also collapsed in the incident.\n\nFact-finding committee submits report, rules out possibility of attack on the CTD facility from outside\n\nOn the same day, home and tribal affairs department of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa constituted the fact-finding committee to probe the nature of blasts with the direction to submit a comprehensive report covering all aspects of the incident.\n\u201cA detailed report has been submitted and there is no evidence of a vehicle-borne or a suicide blast inside the CTD police station in Kabal, Swat district. No militant factor is involved in it,\u201d sources privy to the developments told Dawn.\nThey said militants always wanted more damage including loss of life and property. For that reason, militants always used ball bearings, shrapnel or any other lethal material but the fact-finding committee did not find even a single ball bearing or its signs at the site, they added.\nSources, who requested anonymity keeping in view sensitive nature of the issue, said that the team visited the blast site and found that there was no impact of ball bearings on the damaged buildings.\n\u201cTo the naked eye, there is no evidence of vehicle-borne or suicide blast. Even the gates of the buildings are intact as per the report,\u201d they said.\nWhen asked if the team found anything related to negligence on part of those, who had to handle the explosives dumped inside the police station, they said that it wasn\u2019t possible to say anything about it as there was nothing left.\n\u201cThe room where the explosive material was kept and its attachments are all gone,\u201d they said. They added that it was evident that the explosives placed in the Malkhana as case property caused the explosions.\nThe explosions, which reportedly occurred on the premises of CTD office, shattered the roof of the police station, the office, and a mosque located inside the station. The blasts also caused fire. According to senior officials, at least 20 policemen were trapped under the debris of the roof, which collapsed due to the intensity of the explosion.\nOn April 26, Inspector General of Police Akhtar Hayat Khan told journalists that the blasts occurred after rocket-propelled grenades, mines and other arms seized in different cases and stored in the warehouse went off owing to short-circuiting of electricity.\nOn the same day, a preliminary investigation carried out by the police department into the twin blasts found that the explosions were caused by an electricity short-circuit at the warehouse and ruled out the possibility of a militant attack on the CTD police station.\n"

He added that a total of Rs5 billion, approved for the hospital, was frozen.\n\u201cThe hospital also faces shortage of funds to pay salaries to its employees but the main issue is that we need funds to ensure provision of medicines, surgical disposable items and other medical supplies to provide services to patients,\u201d he said.\nThe medical teaching institutions (MTIs) as well as the facilities operating directly under health department are complaining of non-availability of funds for payment of salaries to staff as well as procurement of medicines and operational cost.\n\nHealth secretary says matter not brought into his notice\n\nHealth Secretary Mahmood Aslam, however, said that the issue had not been brought into his notice. He said that he would take up the matter with relevant quarters to make sure that employees got salaries and patients received services.\nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa has more than 1,900 health facilities employing over 60,000 staffers including doctors, paramedics and nurses.

They added that in many hospitals, people were being sent to market to buy essential medicines to be given to critically-ill or injured patients.\n\u201cWe need all emergency drugs in the accidents and emergency department to ensure that life-saving procedures take place effectively. A slight delay in medication of serious patients can deteriorate their health condition,\u201d the medical superintend of a DHQ hospital said.\nHe said that the hospitals had already spent the amount they generated from user charges or SCP programme. He said that now the hospitals were desperately looking towards the government to continue their operations.\nA director at one of the MTIs told Dawn that they had paid salaries to Class-IV employees before Eid because they were too poor but other staff was yet to be paid.\nOfficials at health department told Dawn that the financial crunch was unlikely to go away anytime soon and the caretaker government knew it very well.\n\u201cHowever, the government must provide funds for salaries and medical supplies including life-saving drugs to ensure medication of seriously-sick patients in the hospitals,\u201d they said.\n"

            "Text": "PESHAWAR: A large number of people of various villages on Sunday staged protest against power outages and restored supply of electricity by force to their areas from Rehman Baba grid station on Ring Road and Industrial grid station on Kohat Road.\nLed by former MPA of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Haji Fazl Ilahi, the protesters entered Rehman Baba grid station and restored power supply, which was suspended since Sunday morning.\nPeshawar Electric Supply Company (Pesco) has started observing 18 to 20 hours loadshedding in various villages located on the outskirts of the provincial capital including Garhi Atta Mohammad, Dir Colony, Ghareebabad, Garhi Hayat Khan and Tor Baba area.\n\u201cWe entered the grid station at 2pm and still sitting inside it along with scores of people,\u201d one of the protesters told Dawn. He said that a large number of protesters were also sitting outside the grid station.\n\nPesco officials approach police for registration of FIR\n\nHe said that Pesco officials would again suspend supply of power to their villages if they ended their protest or left the grid station. The protesters also chanted slogans against Pesco officials.\nEarlier in the day, the villagers made announcements through loudspeakers from mosques, asking locals to come out of their homes for the protest against what they called the illegal loadshedding of electricity imposed on them by Pesco.\n\u201cThe protesters will sit inside the grid station until a written agreement is finalised with Pesco officials about the schedule for power outages,\u201d a villager of Garhi Atta Mohammad told Dawn.\nHe said that Pesco officials came for negotiation during which the protesters requested them to reduce the duration of loadshedding to 12 hours but they were not ready to agree with the propoal.\nHe said that excessive loadshedding of electricity made lives of villages miserable.\nThrough social media, former MPA Haji Fazal Ilahi also made announcements, asking the residents of Bazidkhel, Garhi Qamar Din, Scheme Chowk, Kaga Walla, Bahadar Kallay to assemble outside the grid stations of their respective areas.\n\u201cThese areas are fed by Kohat Road grid station and Tajabad grid station but the people of these areas often complain about excessive power outages,\u201d he said.\nThe former MPA said that he would not allow anyone to usurp the rights of the people of his constituency. \u201cI will fight for our people\u2019s rights throughout my life,\u201d he added.\nPesco spokesperson Mohammad Usman, when contacted, said that PTI leader Haji Fazl Ilahi threatened the staff of Rehman Baba and Industrial grid stations and forcefully restored supply of electricity to the villages.\n\u201cOur officers have submitted applications with Rehman Baba police station and Bhana Mari police station for registration of FIR against the protesters,\u201d he said.\nHe said that the former MPA gathered a large number of people against Pesco to get political mileage. He alleged that localities in the constituency of Fazal Ilahi were included in the areas of high losses. He said that instead of restoring supply of electricity by force, the issue could have been resolved through dialogue.\n"

            "Text": "PESHAWAR: A young singer has asked culture department to preserve Pashto folk music because it resonates local culture, history and a way of social life of people.\nThe artist, Salman Tabassum, has close resemblance to his mentor late Kifayat Shah Bacha in style and talent to create low and high pitch sounds to add extra charm to folk singing.\nA resident of Swabi district, he has numerous albums to his credit and enjoys widespread popularity owing to his versatile singing style and unique selection of folk poems.\nDuring his studio recording for Eid release in Peshawar, Salman Tabassum sliced out time from his busy schedule to talk to this scribe and dwell upon his singing career and future initiatives. He said that he was in the city for recoding some folk items for a foreign Pashto online radio and TV channel.\n\u201cI was born to a farming family but with a talent of remembering long Pashto folk songs because their contents would always motivate me. Late Kifayat Shah Bacha was one great inspiration that I finally drifted into a magic world of folk singing. I met him during a musical concert in our village,\u201d he said.\n\nSalman says folk songs feature local culture, history and social values\n\nSince his early age, Salman Tabassum became a pupil of Kifayat Shah in music. In 2000, he brought out his first Pashto album titled \u2018Nadan\u2019 that shot him to fame. He told this scribe that he not only followed singing style of Kifayat Shah but also grew long hair, which his mentor used to brandish with Chitrali sitar in his hands.\nTalking about traditional musical instruments, he said that traditional music orchestra was inherently in synch with lengthy Pashto folk songs. He added that most folk songs featured local culture, history and social values.\n\u201cPashto folklore contains description of our long history spanning over centuries. Folk poets have explored references to historic events with cultural significance, therefore, my humble request to KP culture department is to preserve our folk music,\u201d he said.\nRegarding future plans, Salman Tabassum said that he was working on collecting audio and video of noted folk singers so that those could serve as resource kit for research scholars. He said that Swabi district had been home to noted literati, scholars and eminent folk singers.\n\u201cPashto folk music is rich in contents like popular long poems narrating historical events, typical romance and code of Pashtunwali. Folk poetry and folk music both connect us to our cultural roots, its preservation is a must to do job,\u201d said the young artist.\n"

            "Text": "KHYBER: The number of tourists to the picturesque Tirah valley has considerably declined in recent months owing to shortage of facilities and an impending security situation, according to locals.\nThey said that only a small number of young joy seekers made it to Bagh-Markaz, the valley\u2019s business centre, during Eidul Fitr in comparison to previous years when the region was opened for outsiders after the construction of a road.\nBlessed with abundant natural beauty and consisting of thick forests, crystal clear water springs and green meadows, the valley offers a variety of sightseeing to tourists. The region was closed to the outside world for decades till 2014-15 when the people, who were displaced owing to militancy and subsequent military operation, returned to their homes after nearly a decade due.\nThe lush green Arhanga top on border with Orakzai, Kalawooch Daman, Bhutaan Sar, Haidar Kandaw, Dwa Thoey, Than Darra, Takhtakai heights and parts of the Kukikhel-inhabited mountainous areas with sharp cliffs and deep gorges are the region\u2019s main attractions for visitors that were yet to be developed and made approachable to outside tourists.\n\nLocals say shortage of facilities and security concerns keep visitors away from the valley\n\nThe residents of Tirah told Dawn that only four hotels were constructed during the last three years to accommodate outsiders. These hotels are situated in Islamdin Pir-Chattai Sar, Sarrokha locality at the entry of the valley and two more at the main Bagh-Markaz.\nThey, however, regretted that the condition of roads in the valley and those leading to tourist resorts was not good while some of those locations could only be reached on foot.\nQari Naurang, a resident of Luzaka Darra, a beautiful valley near the border of Kurram district, said that depositing of Computerised National Identity Cards with security forces at the entry points of Tirah from Bara, Kurram and Orakzai sides was the first obstacle to outsiders that needed to be done away as it restricted the free movement of tourists in the valley.\nHe said that a ban on entry of Kukikhel to Tirah for unspecified security apprehensions too was not only a setback for tourism but also against the basic rights of free movement of every citizen of the country.\nMr Naurang said that shortage of hotels or rented accommodation facilities was also a major reason of decline in the number of tourists as local customs and traditions did not allow outsiders to establish a camp or pitch a tent for night at any site of their choice in the valley.\nFazal Rabi, a young social activist, said that the valley was also in need of electricity and mobile and internet service alongside foolproof security.\nHe said that recent incidents of terrorism, armed patrolling of suspected militants and subsequent actions by the law enforcement agencies also scared away potential visitors from visiting the valley and surrounding areas.\nThe recent decline in number of tourists, especially during Eid holidays, has also disappointed traders and shopkeepers of Bagh-Markaz as they were expecting additional earnings from tourists along with creation of some part time jobs for unemployed local youth during these days.\nHaji Sher Mohammad, the leader of local traders, said that Tirah was as beautiful as other tourist resorts of the country including Swat, Murree, Nathiagali and Naran but it faced shortage of the required facilities.\nHe said that tourists from different parts of the country were interested in exploring the hidden beauty of Tirah but the current security situation and lack of facilities were stopping them from visiting the valley.\nHe said that provision of required facilities by the government would ensure an upsurge in tourists\u2019 arrival in the valley but would also provide job opportunities to locals alongside enhancing chances of better earnings for traders and transporters.\n"

She had alleged that Awal Said had committed the offence on behest of her son Wali Khan.\nHowever, she later on retracted from her allegations stating that now she had satisfied herself that the two accused persons were not involved in the murder of her daughter.\nThe FIR of the occurrence was registered at Khal police station in Dir Lower district on Feb 8, 2023, under section 302, 311, 201, 204 and 34 of the Pakistan Penal Code.\nThe FIR was registered by additional SHO Sahibzada Khan who stated that he had received information that body of a female was lying in a well inside a government primary school. He stated that he reached the spot and retrieved the body of the deceased, which was partially decomposed.\nHe claimed that he gathered information from the spot according to which the deceased was divorced twice and her reputation as not good in the area.\nHe added that a brother of the deceased named Wali Khan was watchman at the said school and he had killed her on pretext of honour and dumped the body in the well so as to conceal evidence.\n\u201cThe court does agree that the event in hand is prima facie in its kind of honour killing but close perusal of the record made available would transpire that the event in hand is an unseen occurrence and during the investigation positive and direct evidence regarding the commission of the offence has not been collected,\u201d the bench observed.\nBAIL REJECTED: The bench turned down bail plea of an accused arrested on charges of sexually assaulting a minor boy of 10 in Swat district around two years ago.\nThe accused, Salman Khan, was seeking bail on statutory grounds that the case was sent for trial on Mar 21, 2021, but despite passage of over two years the trial had yet to conclude.\nHis counsel contended that he was entitled to bail under section 497 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).\nThe alleged victim had stated that he was forcibly taken to his home by the accused and after sexually assaulting him he asked him to remain silent or he would kill him.\nThe bench observed that the petitioner had allegedly been charged for committing unnatural act with a minor, which attracted the fourth proviso to Section 497 (1) of the CrPC, under which the concession of bail on ground of delay in trial would not be extended to an accused who, in the opinion of the court, was a hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal.\nThe bench directed the trial court to proceed ahead with the trial on day-to-day basis, however, if inconvenient, the trial court may allow the next date of hearing in consultation with the defence counsel.\n"

            "Text": "LOS ANGELES: Negotiators for Hollywood writers and film and television studios engaged in 11th-hour contract talks on Monday to try and avert a strike that would disrupt TV production across an industry grappling with seismic changes.\nThe Writers Guild of America could call a work stoppage as early as Tuesday if it cannot reach a deal with companies such as Walt Disney Co and Netflix Inc. A strike would be the first by the WGA in 15 years.\nWriters say they have suffered financially during the streaming TV boom, in part due to shorter seasons and smaller residual payments. They are seeking pay increases and changes to industry practices that they say force them to work more for less money.\nHalf of TV series writers now work at minimum salary levels, compared with one-third in the 2013-14 season, according to Guild statistics. Median pay for scribes at the higher writer/producer level has fallen four per cent over the last decade.\n\nWriters demand higher pay, greater share of profits from streaming boom\n\n\u201cThe way that it\u2019s looking now is that there won\u2019t be a middle class in Hollywood,\u201d said Caroline Renard, a Guild liaison and writer who has worked on Disney Channel\u2019s \u201cSecrets of Sulphur Springs\u201d and other shows.\nLate-night shows\nIf a strike is called, late-night shows such as \u201cThe Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon,\u201d \u201cLast Week Tonight with John Oliver\u201d and \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d which use teams of writers to craft topical jokes, are expected to immediately stop production.\nThat means new episodes will not be available during their traditional TV time slots or on the streaming services that make them available the next day.\nSoap operas and other daytime shows such as \u201cThe View\u201d will likely be disrupted. News programs would not be interrupted because those writers are members of a different union.\nFurther ahead, the strike could lead to a delay of the fall TV season. Writing for fall shows normally starts in May or June. If the work stoppage becomes protracted, the networks will increasingly fill their programming lineups with unscripted reality shows, news magazines and reruns.\nNetflix may be insulated from any immediate impact because of its global focus and access to far-flung production facilities outside of the US.\nThe last WGA strike in 2007 and 2008 lasted 100 days. TV networks broadcast reruns and more reality shows, and the effects rippled through the California economy as productions shut down and out-of-work writers, actors and producers cut back spending.\nThe strike cost the state an estimated $2.1 billion and tipped its already fragile economy into a recession, according to the Milken Institute think tank.\nStudios do not want another disruption after the Covid-19 pandemic halted production worldwide for months.\nBut budgets are tight, and a new era of fiscal austerity has dawned in Hollywood, with studios laying off thousands of employees and curtailing spending on content.\n\u201cThe writers have legitimate issues here,\u201d said one talent agent close to the bargaining process. \u201cBut the studios and the producers have very legitimate issues also. Their stock prices are down. They\u2019ve overspent on content. They need to show profits to their shareholders.\u201d\n"

As part of government austerity measures, import containers are awaiting clearance and the opening of letters of credit for consumer goods is the least priority of the State Bank of Pakistan.\nThe country\u2019s exports to Afghanistan, China, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, India, Iran, Nepal, Bhutan and the Maldives dipped to $2.744 billion \u2014 just 13.83pc of Pakistan\u2019s total exports of $21.05bn in July-March FY23.\nChina tops the list of Pakistan\u2019s regional exports leaving other populous countries India and Bangladesh behind. But Pakistan\u2019s exports to China posted negative growth in the first 9MFY23 on a year-on-year basis. The bulk of the regional exports share, which accounts for 55pc, is with China while the remaining is for eight countries.\nPakistan\u2019s exports to China declined 28.31pc to $1.524 in July-March FY23 from $2.126bn in 9MFY22. The decrease in export proceeds was noted for the first time in the post-Covid period. However, the imports from China also declined by 48.36pc to $7.745bn on a year-on-year basis during the months under review.\nPakistan\u2019s exports to Afghanistan posted a positive growth of 8.42pc to $400.77m in July-March from $369.63m in July-March 2022. Till a few years ago, Afghanistan was the second major export destination for Pakistan after the United States. The export figures did not include proceeds materialised through the land routes.\nThe exports to Afghanistan started to decl\u00adine in August 2021. The government has allo\u00adwed imports and exports from Afghanistan in the rupee in the post-Taliban regime period. The figures did not reflect those imports made in rupees.\nThe government has also exempted the import of tomatoes and onions from duty and taxes from Afghanistan and Iran. As a result, the imports of these kitchen staples posted massive growth in the past months to bridge the shortage in local supplies.\nPakistan\u2019s exports to Iran on the official channel remained at $0.027m in the first 9MFY23 against no exports last year. Most of the trade with Tehran is carried out through informal channels in border areas of Balo\u00adchistan. The government has allowed the imp\u00adort of onions and tomatoes at Taftan and Gwa\u00addar border customs stations to meet local demands. Pakistan carried out barter trade with Iran.\nThe country\u2019s exports to India declined 78.83pc to $0.221m in 9MFY23 from $1.006m in 9MFY22. In the wake of high prices of vegetables in the domestic market because the standing crops of vegetables and cotton were vastly destroyed. There is a strong demand for allowing the import of cotton as well as vegetables at the Wagah border.\nExports to Bangladesh decreased 9.24pc to $588.29m in 9MFY23 from $648.21m in 9MFY22. And Exports to Sri Lanka dipped by 21.75pc to $222.85m from $284.82m in the same period last year.\nOn the other hand, Pakistan\u2019s exports to Nepal declined by 53.84pc to $2.250m from $4.792m in 9MFY22. Exports to the Maldives increased by 21.84pc to $6.185m from $5.076m. A marginal export worth $0.048m to Bhutan was recorded in the first nine months of the current fiscal year against $0.025m exports last year, indicating a growth of 92pc.\n"

            "Text": "WASHINGTON: The World Bank on Monday unveiled a new methodology and improved safeguards for assessing the business climate in up to 180 countries after embarrassing revelations of data irregularities and favouritism toward China forced it to cancel its flagship rankings two years ago.\nThe bank scrapped its \u201cDoing Business\u201d rankings in September 2021, citing internal audits and an independent probe that found senior World Bank leaders had pressured staff to alter data to favour China. It cited data irregularities that also boosted the rankings of other countries, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Azerbaijan.\nA pilot edition of the new replacement annual series called \u201cBusiness Ready\u201d will be published in the spring of 2024, covering an initial group of 54 economies in Asia, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa, the bank said.\nMore countries will be added in the next two years as the bank refines its methodology and ramps up the new project, which aims to help countries attract investment and boost jobs and productivity to accelerate development.\n\u201cBusiness Ready ... reflects a more balanced and transparent approach toward evaluating a country\u2019s business and investment climate,\u201d the bank said in a statement.\nWorld Bank Chief Economist Indermit Gill said the new approach enabled \u201ca fuller and sharper measure of the investment climate of countries,\u201d something he said was badly needed in a global economy in the midst of a generalised slowdown.\n\u201cBusiness Ready\u201d was shaped by recommendations from World Bank experts, governments, the private sector, and civil society groups, and includes for the first time worker rights, as defined by the International Labor Organization, while acknowledging that regulation can also have positive aspects.\n\u201cThe main thing that went wrong was the data integrity of Doing Business was compromised,\u201d Norman Loayza, director of the World Bank\u2019s Indicators Group, which leads the project, told Reuters. \u201cThe main point for us is that we need to ensure data integrity and we have a very comprehensive approach to do that.\u201d\nData transparency \nTo ensure full transparency, Loayza said the bank would publish all collected data - raw data, scores and the calculations used to obtain the scores - from private sector contributors, as well as from surveys of entrepreneurs, company owners and managers.\nThe bank will also make available the tools needed by outsiders to replicate the results of the data assessments.\nBut World Bank officials were still debating whether to revive the business climate rankings that were at the heart of the \u201cDoing Business\u201d controversy or produce an overall index, Loayza said, with a decision expected prior to the first report.\nLoayza said that while the rankings were criticized for encouraging political pressure to try to lift country scores, they also helped spur nearly 4,000 regulatory reforms in developing and developed economies over the past two decades.\nHe said the new project focuses on 10 topics covering the lifecycle of a firm, including business entry, utility services, labour, dispute resolution, market competition, taxation and insolvency - another move aimed at addressing criticism of the earlier product.\n\u201cWe take into account not only the perspective of the private entrepreneur, but also the perspective of workers, consumers and other market participants,\u201d he said, citing the inclusion of factors such as worker safety, environmental sustainability and market competition.\nTo lay out the new approach, the bank published two key documents: a Business Ready Manual and Guide, specifying detailed protocols and safeguards, including how the bank interacts with governments and lines of approval, as well as a methodology handbook on its indicators and scoring methodology.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: Though closed since June 2015, Pakistan Steel Mills (PSM) is reported to have earned after-tax-profit of about Rs7.45 billion in 2021-22 even though its accumulated losses of Rs206bn went beyond its current assets worth Rs195.5bn.\nIn the qualified opinion of on financial statements, the independent auditors \u2014 Crowe Hussain Chaudhry & Co \u2014 said the PSM fully disclosed its dispute with Sui Southern Gas Company Ltd (SSGCL) on late payment surcharge (LPS) worth Rs59.7bn which increased from Rs52bn in FY21.\nYet, the total assets of the country\u2019s largest industrial unit, shut down by the PMLN government in its previous tenure, have been valued at about Rs839bn as of June 30, 2022, up 65pc over Rs549bn a year earlier, according to the company\u2019s audited accounts for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022. Based on audited accounts, the company paid the salaries for April of its employees from its resources ahead of Eidul Fitr after a gap of more than a decade instead of the federal budget.\nSince the closure of the PSM in June 2015, the country is estimated to have lost about $18bn in foreign exchange for import of steel products used to be produced by the PSM. \u201cThe state of PSM was due to unchecked corruption, inefficiency, over-employment and government\u2019s lukewarm attitude towards its revival,\u201d, according to a summary to a parliamentary committee.\nThe financial statement said the PSM management claimed that based on \u201cthe decisions of the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet, SSGCL should waive LPS which SSGCL did not accede and stopped gas supply during the period and filed a suit against\u201d PSM for recovery of outstanding gas bills and LPS in Sindh High Court. The PSM also filed a counter suit against SSGCL for Rs38.6bn, claiming damages for losses suffered by PSM due to gas supply disruption from June 2015.\nSince the PSM management did not recognise the LPS liability in financial statements with expectations that ECC decisions would prevail and ultimately LPS would not be payable, the independent auditors qualified their audit that they were unable to determine as to what amount would ultimately be payable given SSGCL\u2019s suit instead of LPS waiver under ECC decision.\nBased on audited accounts, the standing committees of the parliament would be examining this week whether a performance audit of successive governments since 2008 should be ordered to conclude if the company was still an asset or a liability which could be revived without government support or disposed of by doling out its real estate assets to creditors and other stakeholders against liabilities.\nThe audited accounts have put the company as a \u2018going concern\u2019 as the management believed that even after the transfer of its core assets to its corporate entity \u2014 Steel Corp \u2014 will still be left with assets worth Rs700bn would be more than sufficient to meet all its expenses. \nPSM\u2019s total assets valued at Rs838.66bn included Rs751bn worth of property including over 17,000 acres of land, thousands of houses, many hospitals, educational facilities etc, plant and machinery and Rs71bn worth of investment property besides other current assets in the shape of stocks, receivables etc. The auditors pointed out under international audit standards that the current liabilities of the firm on the balance sheet exceeded its current assets by about Rs10bn which indicates \u201ca material uncertainty\u201d which may cast significant doubt on the PSM to continue as a going concern.\nThe auditors highlighted that the apex court had ordered an investigation through the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) of the company\u2019s losses in 2008-09 \u2014 the losses continued all through these years \u2014 and FIA investigated and lodged criminal cases. \nFurther, an independent professional services firm was appointed to carry out a forensic audit to determine the depth of corruption. The firm\u2019s report confirmed \u201clarge-scale corruption and mismanagement and amounts attributable\u201d to corruption. The Supreme Court in 2012 transferred the case to National Accountability Bureau (NAB) where the matter remains pending as of now as the financial bleeding continued.\nThe auditors also pointed out that about 12pc shares of the company were awarded to the PSM employees in 2009 under Benazir Employees\u2019 Stock Option Scheme (Besos) to provide a cash payment to employees on retirement or termination against the surrender of these shares by employees back to the government. The employees\u2019 rights had been legally created but to administer the scheme, the government was to transfer 12pc shares of its investment in SOEs to a trust fund. The trust fund for PSM was created in January 2010 but the shares have yet not been transferred to the trust fund.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: Justice Qazi Faez Isa, the senior puisne judge of the Sup\u00adreme Court, has asked for an immediate meeting of Judicial Commission of Pak\u00adistan (JCP), which is long overdue, and suggested the names of chief justices of Sindh and Pesh\u00adawar high courts to fill two vacancies of SC judges.\nAgainst the sanctioned strength of 17 judges, the top court is currently fun\u00adc\u00adtioning with 15 judges including Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial.\nIn a letter sent to all JCP members, Justice Isa has suggested that the vacancies should be filled immediately, and the names of the judges to be nominated should be recommended before time while considering the principle of seniority.\nJustice Isa suggested the names of SHC CJ Ahmed Ali M. Shaikh and PHC CJ Musarrat Hilali for the appointment.\nThe JCP \u2014 a constitutional body that recommends elevation of judges to the superior courts \u2014 last time met in October 2022 when three judges were elevated to the apex court that too after a deadlock over ignoring seniority principle in picking the names of judges for their elevation to the apex court.\nAccording to bar councils, elevating junior judges to top court demoralises senior judges and adversely affect judicial work, asserting that the very fact is predominantly against the principle of seniority as laid down in the Al-Jehad case or judges\u2019 case.\n \n \n\nIn August 2022, the JCP invited Justice Shaikh by a majority decision of five to four to become an ad hoc SC judge for one year if he accorded his consent. But the SHC CJ twice declined to attend the SC sitting as an ad hoc judge and rather expressed willingness to be appointed or elevated to the position of a permanent judge.\nThe Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) then condemned the majority decision to appoint SHC chief justice as an ad hoc judge of the SC, arguing that such appointment was in breach of Article 182 of the Constitution, as only a retired judge could be appointed as an ad hoc judge.\nJustice Hilali took oath as PHC chief justice on April 2. She took several measures to introduce judicial reforms in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa by constituting special benches for commercial and tax disputes, criminal matters, service matters, civil and family cases, with the direction to complete trials within a stipulated period.\nSenior counsel Akhtar Hussain, who represents the PBC on the JCP, told Dawn that he would write to CJP Bandial to invite his attention towards calling a meeting of the JCP rules-making committee for carrying out appropriate amendments in the relevant rules for laying down the criteria for appointments of judges in the superior courts.\nHe was of the opinion that a JCP meeting could not be called before amending the JCP Rules, 2010.\nThe last rules committee meeting, held in March 2022, remained inconclusive but decided to meet again after going through the proposals being agitated by the lawyers\u2019 representatives.\n"

Two of Chaudhry Shujaat\u2019s sons were injured while an arm\u00adoured vehicle was used to break open the gate of Mr Elahi\u2019s residence.\n\u201cThis is completely una\u00adc\u00adceptable,\u201d he said while speaking to journalists and demanded that all those behind the raid be caught and held accountable.\nThe PML-Q chief said he had asked his sons to exercise patience, adding he would speak on the matter at length later.\nEmphasising that he did not want to say anything that could harm national politics as the country was already facing a plethora of crises, Mr Hussain said, \u201cWhen the police arrived at Parvez Elahi\u2019s residence, they were informed that he was at Chaudhry Shujaat\u2019s place.

Pakistan will continue to support all efforts to advance the shared objectives of a peaceful, stable, sovereign, prosperous and connected Afghanistan, a statement issued by the Foreign Office in Islamabad said.\n\nKabul spox says seeking \u2018positive engagement\u2019 with world; diplomats say talk of recognition impossible until women ban reversed\n\nMs Khar will also hold bilateral talks with leaders of other participating countries on the sidelines of the huddle.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUN dilemma\nAhead of his arrival in Doha, Mr Guterres\u2019 office said the meeting \u201cis intended to achieve a common understanding within the international community on how to engage with the Taliban\u201d on women\u2019s and girls\u2019 rights, inclusive governance, countering terrorism and drug trafficking.\nDespite not being invited to the talks, the head of the Taliban representative office in Doha, Sohail Shaheen, said he has met with members of the British and Chinese delegations. He said the UN meeting and \u201cthe importance of engagement\u201d was among the topics raised.\nThough divided on many disputes, the UN Security Council united on Thursday to condemn the curbs on Afghan women and girls and urge all countries to seek \u201can urgent reversal\u201d of the policies.\n \n \n\nDiplomats and observers say, however, that the Doha meeting highlights the quandary faced by the international community in handling Afghan\u00adistan, which the UN considers its biggest humanitarian crisis with millions depending on food aid.\nThe Taliban government\u2019s deputy spokesman, Bilal Karimi, said on Monday Kabul \u201cwants positive engagement with the world\u201d.\nBut \u201cinternal issues\u201d \u2014 such as curbs on women\u2019s rights \u2014 should not factor into decisions about diplomatic engagement and formal recognition, he said.\n\u201cThese should not be used as political tools,\u201d he said. \u201cCountries should have the moral courage to independently come forward for positive engagement.\u201d\nIn an open letter to the Doha meeting released on Sunday, a coalition of Afghan women\u2019s groups said they were \u201coutraged\u201d that any country would consider formal ties with the government that the UN calls the \u201cde facto authorities\u201d.\nThe United Nations and Washington have insisted that recognition is not on the agenda.\nRights groups\u2019 fears have been fuelled by remarks made last month by UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed, who said the Doha meeting could find \u201cbaby steps\u201d that lead to a \u201cprincipled recognition\u201d of the Taliban government.\nThe UN said the comments were misinterpreted.\nNo country has established formal ties with the Afghan administration and UN membership can only be decided by the UN General Assembly.\nA UN official said it was \u201cclear\u201d the Taliban authorities want recognition. Formal UN ties would help the government reclaim billions of dollars of desperately needed funds seized abroad after it took power.\nBut diplomats from several countries involved in the talks said this would not be possible until there is a change on women\u2019s rights.\n"

            "Text": "KOUFROUN: On donkeys or horses, by cart or by foot, hundreds of Sudanese, most of them women and children, each day cross a small, dry stream to find safety in neighbouring Chad.\nAs of Monday, at least 20,000 people had found refuge at a makeshift camp in the Chadian border village of Koufroun, according to the United Nations refugee agency UNCHR, which manages their influx along with other UN agencies.\nThe village lies a few hundred metres (yards) from the border with West Darfur, which with the capital Khartoum is among the worst-hit provinces in the Sudan conflict.\nMost of those arriving have come from the Sudanese town of Tendelti, about 20 kilometres \u2014 the theatre of intense fighting between the forces of army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) led by his ex-deputy Mohamed Hamdan Daglo. Many show up empty-handed \u2014 a sign of a desperate getaway.\nThe UN says at least 100 people were killed in West Darfur in the past week. The toll may be far higher, but information from the area is lacking. Some carry belongings and provisions on the arduous trek in the overwhelming Sahelian heat.\nThey search for shelter under huge but rare acacia trees, under which their predecessors and humanitarian workers have set up makeshift camps. Scattered in small groups over two square kilometres (about half a square mile), some use garments and veils to provide shade from the merciless sun.\nUnder one of the trees, Mahamat Hassan Hamad had built a room with walls of straw and a roof of plastic sheeting, held up by branches, to provide shelter for himself, his wife and their 11 children. The 52-year-old tailor arrived in Koufroun two weeks after having fled Tendelti.\nTrying to hold back tears, he said,  \u201cThe RSF attacked early in the morning, they set fire to our homes and destroyed everything in their path. I took my children to cross the border.\u201d  \u201cToday, I have no food for my children and no means of work \u2014 my sewing machines were taken by the attackers,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe have had nothing from the UNCHR, we survive thanks to solidarity from the local people,\u201d he said.\nNearby, Hinit Issack Abakar, 17, wearing a black hijab, said,  \u201cI had just enough time to pack my diploma, which will help me get into university, and escape with my little brother and sister,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where to find my mother and my father, when the fighting began, they weren\u2019t at home, I\u2019ve had no news,\u201d she said before crying.  \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to live in a refugee camp without parents.\u201d Achai Idriss, a woman in her 30s, said  \u201cI was at the market selling coffee when the fighting started. I had just enough time to collect my belongings and head for the border, like the others.\u201d  \u201cThank heaven, I\u2019ve been able to get my business going again. I make and sell coffee and the money helps me to make ends meet here.\u201d\nThis desolate spot lies some 800 km east of N\u2019Djamena, the capital of Chad, one of the poorest countries in the world. Humanitarian workers are overwhelmed by the demand.\nThe UN children\u2019s agency Unicef is drawing on an emergency stockpile to provide kits with cooking utensils, blankets and mats, said Donaig Le Du, a spokesperson for the agency.\nA French-based NGO called Premiere Urgence Internationale has built a makeshift medical post in Koufroun. Three health workers work there daily and offer consultations, prioritising women, children and the elderly. They see around 100 to 200 people each day, said Ndoumbaye Thertus, the agency\u2019s local chief. \u201cThe main pathologies are respiratory illnesses, gastroenteritis and malnutrition,\u201d he said. The humanitarian situation could quickly become catastrophic at Koufroun, aid workers fear.\n\u201cThe big challenge is supplies \u2014 we need to mobilise donors to provide support,\u201d said Jean Paul Habamungu, head of UNHCR operations in eastern Chad. \u201cAnd let\u2019s not forget that there were already half a million Sudanese refugees in Chad\u201d before the latest conflict, he said.\n"

The placement of containers and closure of roads created trouble for the commuters travelling between Rawalpindi and Islamabad.\nThe Metro Bus Service in the garrison city was suspended and public transport also remained off the roads.\nIt may be noted here that all roads connecting to Murree Road and leading to Islamabad were closed thrice due to rallies and cricket matches between Pakistan and New Zealand last week. People living on both sides of the main road remained disconnected from each other.\nIt has become the practice of law enforcement agencies for the last many years to impound containers and use them to block the roads connecting the garrison city with Islamabad.\n\u201cThe district administration created problems for the people by sealing roads with containers. I had to go to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) from Sadiqabad but there was no road open,\u201d said Mohammad Farhan, a resident of Muslim Town, while talking to Dawn.

It will default soon, despite negotiations with the IMF and the state\u2019s adherence to many of their conditions. We need to align the struggle against the IMF and the anti-poor policies of the state with the struggle for a working-class revolution.\u201d\nWDF leader Tooba Syed declared, \u201cThe origins of Labour Day stem from working-class movements\u2019 fight for an 8-hour working day. Even now, we still witness women, continuing to work more than eight hours a day, in paid and unpaid labour. Our work is undervalued as this benefits corporate and capitalist interests.

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: Health activists have predicted a win-win situation for the government, health authorities and the general public as a new survey showed that tax avoidance due to illicit cigarettes trade will be negligible compared to 40pc claimed by the tobacco industry.\nThey have estimated that the government will get at least Rs60 billion after increasing the federal excise duty (FED) on tobacco products, as an additional revenue in the form of tax and over Rs400 billion will be saved as health cost which will decrease the financial burden on health authorities and the public.\nCountry head for Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids Malik Imran, while rejecting multinational tobacco industry\u2019s claim of illicit cigarettes in the market, said companies continued claiming since 2014 that the share of illicit cigarettes was 40pc of the market.\n\u201cThis number is used consistently to cause panic in the government. According to independent studies, the actual share of illicit cigarettes in the market is around 18pc. A major part of this actually belongs to multinational brands,\u201d he said.\n\nHealth activists say tax avoidance due to illicit cigarettes trade will be negligible compared to 40pc claimed by industry\n\n\u201cNow that a track and trace system has been put in place, the possibility of illicit trade of cigarettes has almost died down,\u201d said Mr Imran.\nHe added that they had conducted a survey to explore the volume of illicit cigarettes in the market. Though the findings of the survey will be made public next week, \u201ctentatively we can say the volume is now negligible.\u201d\nHe said multinational cigarette makers were deliberately spreading propaganda that the volume of illicit trade was increasing after the rise in taxes on cigarettes.\nThere has been an increase in revenues of international cigarette brands this year according to their own reports, he said.\n\u201cThe track and trace system has been implemented fully and no industry is now able to do illegal business,\u201d he stated.\nHe said it was estimated that cigarette consumption had plummeted after the recent taxes on tobacco. He said due to the decline in consumption, health cost of cigarettes is expected to come down to one billion dollars from over three billion dollars annually.\nMr Malik pointed out that after increasing the taxes on cigarettes, the volume of expenditure on tobacco related diseases annually would also be reduced from Rs620 billion to Rs200 billion.\nA research study estimates of the illicit trade market as a percentage of the total cigarette market in Pakistan range from 9pc to 18pc. In contrast, the industry claims that illicit trade was 40pc of the total sales volume.\nSanaullah Ghumman, secretary general of Pakistan National Heart Association, said the increase in the FED on cigarettes was in line with the recommendations of the World Health Organisation (WHO). Therefore, the public should support the government\u2019s move to discourage tobacco consumption.\nHe said the government should stand by its decision of the increase in the FED as this would help collect additional revenue of Rs60 billion from taxes on the cigarettes.\nHe alleged that multinational tobacco companies would show their production less to the government to evade taxes and then sell their under-reported stock in the open market, causing a loss of billions of rupees to the national \nexchequer.\n"

No one can survive in the fast-flowing ice-cold waters of Neelum after a few hours,\u201d said Tahir Mahmood, the deputy commissioner (DC) Neelum.\nAt about 9:15pm on Sunday night, a Toyota hardtop jeep, carrying 11 tourists from Lahore and three locals, including the driver and his helper, had plunged into Neelum River while negotiating a curve near Phulawai village more than 175km northeast of here.\nAfter the accident, rescuers had found one body and five injured survivors on the steep and stony riverbank who were believed to have been thrown out of their seats before the vehicle dived into the river that flows around 400 feet down the unmetalled narrow road at the accident site.\nThe deceased was identified as Ghulam Meera, 22, son of Javed Iqbal, and the injured persons were driver Abdul Latif Butt, his helper Ibrahim, 21, Moeen Ahmed, 24, son of Javed Iqbal, Hasnain, 23, son of Shahzad Ahmed and Mohammad Fahad, 31, son of Mohammad Safdar (residents of Ichhra Lahore).\nThe injured survivors were shifted to CMH Muzaffarabad where their condition was stated to be out of danger.\nSyed Imdad Ali, in-charge of the nearby Janawai police post, told Dawn that as the railing on the hardtop of the vehicle was partially visible in the middle of the river on Monday night, they hoped that the bodies would still be trapped inside.\nHowever, when the divers reached near it they found it was just the hardtop and the body of the vehicle as well as the persons sitting inside had been swept away by the violent currents, he added.\nHe said local divers tried their best to locate the missing persons throughout the day on Monday, but in vain.\nThose who were missing were identified as Umair Ahmed, 26, son of Mohammad Safdar; Bilal, son of Sheikh Maqbool; Shahnawaz, son of Sheikh Maqsood; Waleed, son of Ibrar Ahmed; Azhar Ashraf, 27, son of Mohammad Ashraf, Rahim and Raheel, all from Lahore and Ishtiaq, son of Sarfraz, from Neelum valley.\nDC Mahmood said a special team of six divers had reached the valley from Muzaffarabad to carry on the search operation on Tuesday.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The power sector of Pakistan is a mess and requires comprehensive and swift governance and policy reforms.\nSome of these include development of business models to boost renewable energy, liberalisation of the energy market through deregulation and privatisation, re-negotiations of generation tariffs for independent power producers, segregation and deregulation of the administrative and operational activities of the distribution companies leading towards public-private partnership and implementation of accelerated reforms for modernisation.\nThese and several other policy options and practical solutions for the sustainable development of the sector were put forward in a study \u2018Pitfalls in power sector of Pakistan: accumulation of circular debt - causes, consequences and way forward\u2019 conducted by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS).\nThe research report on the constraints and shortcomings of the power sector is particularly focused on identifying factors contributing to the exponential increase in circular debt which has now reached Rs4 trillion and providing doable solutions.\n\nRe-negotiations of generation tariffs for IPPs, deregulation of administrative and operational activities of distribution firms urged\n\nThe report claimed that the power sector had long been stifled by numerous issues that hampered not only sustainable development but also the efficient progression and strategic growth of this vital sector. As a result, Pakistan has been severely affected by the energy crisis, resulting in a negative impact on the overall economy.\nAmong the factors contributing to the rise in circular debt are dependence on expensive imported fuels, high generation costs from thermal sources, unfavourable rupee-to-dollar parity, poor governance and policy lapses, regulatory issues, inadequate recovery of distribution companies\u2019 revenues, financial sustainability issues, capacity charges, aging infrastructure and line losses. \nThe rise in circular debt requires regular tariff hikes to maintain proper cash flow for public and private entities and this affects the energy affordability of the consumers.\n\u201cAdditionally, the vertically integrated market of Pakistan\u2019s power sector is partially monopolised, where state institutions play a dominant role. This structure results in non-existent competition between the entities. Currently, 78 IPPs are operating in Pakistan and are majorly based on imported fuel,\u201d the study showed.\n\u201cThe country\u2019s total installed capacity is 40,813 MW, excluding K-Electric. The peak demand witnessed in the system during FY2021-22 was 28,253 MW. However, the transmission capacity of the electricity infrastructure has remained stagnant at 23,000 MW. On the other hand, transmission and distribution losses of the state-owned distribution companies in FY2021-22 amounted to over 17pc as against the 13pc target determined by Nepra. So even with surplus electricity, the consumers face loadshedding despite paying higher electricity rates because of obsolete and deficient transmission and distribution system. In this scenario, public-private partnership is the way forward to extricate the power sector from this quagmire.\nThis also requires new investments in the transmission and distribution system and shift to the latest technology to reduce line losses. A major reason for the burden on consumers is the obsolete and less efficient power transmission system; therefore, power transmission must be made an investment priority area along with energy transition and digitization,\u201d it stated.\nCommenting on the report, IPS Chairman Khalid Rahman emphasised the urgency for formulating a financing plan and investment policy by the government.\nHe said investments oriented towards the transmission and distribution system along with digitisation can address the sector\u2019s inefficiencies and also help in rationalising power tariff, one of the highest in the region. \nHe also underlined the dire requirement of public-private partnership to boost the sector.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The committee comprising the Old Grant leaseholders\u2019 representatives and officials of Rawalpindi and Chaklala Cantonment Board (CCB) proposed several relaxations in the lease policy which would be sent to the defence secretary for approval after its finalisation.\nThe Old Grant leaseholders in civic limits of Rawalpindi Cantonment Board have sought a number of relaxations in the 2007 lease policy, including waiver of surcharge on delay in conversion from Old Grant leases into regular one; reduction of lease charges(premium) to minimum level, and the abolition of extra charges on change of purpose of the lease from residential to commercial.\nThe committee was constituted on the direction of the Director General Military Lands and Cantonments (DG MLC) following a meeting of the affected people of Rawalpindi Cantonment Board, who have been protesting against what they termed the cruel and irrational policy for conversion of Old Grant leases into the regular one.\nAfter listening to the grievances of the affected people, whose number was in thousands, the DGMLC directed the executive office of the Rawalpindi Cantonment Board to sit with them and come up with proposed changes to the lease policy so that the same could be sent to defence secretary for final consideration.\n\nChanges seek reduction in premium, abolition of extra charges on lease conversion\n\nThe committee comprising the representatives of Old Grant leaseholders, elected members of the Rawalpindi Cantonment Board and its officials after threadbare deliberations and discussions evolved a consensus on contentious issues and prepared proposed changes to the policy to make it acceptable to the Old Grant leaseholders which was in limbo since its announcement in 2007.\nMohammad Farooq Chaudhry, a member of the committee representing Old Grant leaseholders, informed that they have been opposing the lease policy 2007 since its inception because it is full of flaws. The penalty and premium money for conversion of the Old Grant lease into a regular one is so high that it would be tantamount to repurchase the property.\nSecondly, the rates for change in status of the property from residential into commercial are abnormally high whereas most of the properties with Old Grant lease status have been in commercial use for decades as these properties are located in the commercial hub of the cantonment like Bank Road, Hospital Road and other Bazaar area, Mohammad Farooq Chaudhry, who is president of Twin Cities Restaurants Association, explained.\nHe further informed that the residential properties surrounded by commercial areas were converted into commercial properties as it would not be possible for owners to use them as residential units. All these properties are treated as commercial properties as they have commercial electricity, water and gas connections while Rawalpindi Cantonment Board is also charging them commercial property tax.\nSharing details of the proposed changes the committee has submitted to the office of DG MLC for further action Mohammad Farooq Chaudhry said that first of all they wanted waiver of the penalty or surcharge on the conversion of the Old Grant leases into regular ones and secondly they wanted a drastic slash in the premium of lease conversion, as most of the Old Grant leaseholders are in possession of these properties for generations and in certain cases the leases were secured more than a century ago.\nSecondly, the penalty on change of purpose of these leases from residential to commercial should also be waived as the owners of these properties were compelled to change the status of their properties since they were located in the thick of the business hub of the cantonment, he explained.\nThe proposed changes also included the lifting of the bar on the sale of the properties held under Old Grant as the leaseholders are absolute owners of the superstructures on the leased land and no law of the land can bar them from selling their property.\n"

However, the board and the civic agency have been at loggerheads over several issues.\nNow, after the said notification, the board officials will be able to independently take action against any type of violation in the national park area.\nThe said officials, under the powers given to them, will be able to send anyone to jail and impose fines as well. \n\u201cNow, board officials can take action against violators of rules including those involved in fire incidents in the hills as every year, the hills witness many fire incidents,\u201d said an official. \nWhen contacted, acting Islamabad Wildlife Management Board chairperson Vaqar Zakaria said it was a longstanding demand of the board to have magisterial power.\n\u201cWe have been demanding since long and finally, the chief commissioner conferred the power to our two officers. We welcome this move as it was needed,\u201d he said, adding that the board operates in accordance with the 1979 Ordinance, under which there was no magisterial power given to it and this resulted into several issues.\n\u201cToday, we received the notification and tomorrow we will hold the meeting in this regard. We will see what our officers will now be able to do. I guess, they can take action against those, who disturb the landscape of Margallas and those involved in fire incidents. Similarly, they can also take action against hunters, which is indeed a big development as now we can well protect the Margallas,\u201d Mr Zakaria said and appreciated the chief commissioner for fulfilling the board\u2019s demand.\nMeanwhile, notifications, which were issued by deputy director (administration) on Monday stated: \u201cIn exercise of power vested to him under section 14(3) of CrPC 1898 read with Justice Division notification\u2019s of 1980 \u2026 and all other powers enabling him in this behalf, the Chief Commission (ICT) is pleased to confer powers of Magistrate Ist Class upon Dr Tariq Mehmood Bangash director (wildlife) IWMB [and another notification says, upon Ayesha Shahzad Assistant Director of IWMB] within the territorial limit of Islamabad Capital Territory, to exercise all or any of the powers under Criminal Procedure Code 1898 to perform duties with immediate effect for the period of six months.\u201d\n"

            "Text": "KARACHI: Political parties, civil society and government organisations as well as trade unions organised several events including rallies, seminars and talks across Sindh on Monday to mark Labour Day.\nThe programme were held in Karachi, Hyderabad,  Mirpurkhas, Badin, Sanghar, Sakkur, Shikarpur, Jacobabad, Larkana and Dadu and almost every small city and towns of the province. \nIn Karachi, the Awami Workers Party (AWP), Pakistan Trade Union Federation, Karachi Bachao Tehreek, Women Democratic Front and Progressive Students Federation commemorated Labour Day by a demonstration and peoples\u2019 assembly at the Pakistan Trade Union Federation office in Khamosh Colony, Nazimabad.\nShahid Mahboob from K-Electric demanded that the salaries of the power company workers, which have not been raised since 2011, should be increased as per the rate of inflation today.\n\nCall to allocate 15 seats for labourers in Senate\n\nNisar Ahmed, a labourer and Gujjar Nullah demolition victim, said that no alternative land or compensatory cheques had been provided despite the Supreme Court\u2019s orders.\nRepresenting the Orangi Nullah demolition victims, Murad Hashim urged the state to fulfil its promise of rehabilitating the affected people as ordered by the apex court.\nKarishma Iqbal of the Women Democratic Front said that women and their issues had by and large been ignored by the state and society. She said women were labourers, too, but there was no recognition of their work.\nManzoor Razi, chairman of the Railway Workers Union, lambasted the mainstream political leaders by saying that the provincial and national assemblies of the country comprised feudal lords and capitalists. \u201cAt least 15 seats in the Senate should be given to labourers. The minimum wage should at least be Rs50,000. Every citizen should have protection of livelihoods, homes, and basic necessities should be provided to everyone,\u201d said the veteran labour leader.\nTauqeer Chughtai from the AWP recited a poem on the dismal conditions of labourers in factories and other workplaces.\nAhmed Shabbar from the Pakistan Maholiyati Front said that people were evicted in the name of environmentalism all over Karachi, Sindh and Islamabad. He cautioned the labourers against the deliberate plot of excessive development work in the name of environmentalism. \nKhurram Nayyer, convener of the Karachi Bachao Tehreek (KBT) and general secretary of the AWP-Karachi, said that only workers\u2019 power could challenge that exploitative state.\nShafi Sheikh, president of the AWP-Karachi, said that no one could guard the interests of labourers other than themselves because no one else shared their sufferings. He urged the labourers to come together for themselves. \nJoint rally\nA large number of workers participated in a rally jointly staged by the National Trade Union Federation (NTUF) and Home Based Women Workers Federation (HBWWF) from the Regal Chowk to the Karachi Press Club. \nLed by HBWWF general secretary Zehra Khan and NTUF leader Gul Rehman, the rally participants were chanting revolutionary slogans, carrying banners, portraits of Chicago martyrs and red flags.\nNasir Mansoor of the NTUF said workers in Pakistan completely rejected the current economic and political policies of the rulers and condemned their apathy towards the issues of working classes. \u201cWe have been facing high price hikes, especially food inflation, political uncertainty and lawlessness. The ruling elite has amassed huge wealth within and outside the country, but the common man is deprived of all basic facilities of life,\u201d he said.\nTalking about the worsening economic crisis here, Zehra Khan said that instead of improving the economy, the rulers were happy with becoming slaves of international lenders, especially the International Monetary Fund (IMF), whose deadly debt trap had virtually defaulted the country. \nShe regretted that despite the passage of 10 years after the Baldia Factory fire incident, no solid steps had been taken for the health and safety of workers at their workplaces. \u201cThe situation is just worrisome in the textile and garment sector. The factories making goods for the international fashion brands are openly violating labour rights,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIn order to get rid of the current economic and political crisis, price hike, food inflation, poverty and joblessness, it is necessary that workers forge unity above the discrimination of colour, cast and creed, and struggle for their rights in an organised manner,\u201d she further added.\nThe rally participants demanded that the minimum wage should be fixed at Rs50,000 per month.\nPPP organises labour conference \nThe Sindh labour department organised a conference at the Arts Council of Pakistan, Karachi. \nAddressing the event, Labour Minister Saeed Ghani, who is also the Karachi chapter president of the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), said his party and the government fully believed in the struggle for the welfare and well-being of workers.\nSenator Waqar Mehdi, the PPP general secretary of the Sindh chapter, and  labour leader Habib Junaidi also addressed the conference.\nThey highlighted the areas which required the attention of government and all  rights\u2019 activists for the larger good of the country\u2019s labour class. \nJI rally\nThe Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) took out a rally in Ibrahim Haidri near Coast Guard Chowrangi to observe Labour Day. \nAddressing the rally participants, city JI chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman paid tributes to fishermen and other workers across the country for their sacrifices and hard work despite exploitation by the government and other organisations.\nMWM meeting\nSpeaking at a meeting of the party\u2019s labour wing, Allama Sadiq Jaffari of the Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) paid tributes to the labourers of the country and assured them his party\u2019s support in their struggle for their due rights. \nOther parts of Sindh\nWhile rallies in major cities and towns were organised by the All Pakistan Wapda Hydroelectric Union (CBA), National Labour Federation (NLF), All Pakistan Clerks Association and labour wings of Pakistan Peoples Party, Jamaat-i-Islami, and Sindh Taraqqi-pasand Party, different labour and social welfare organisations, unions of corporations, semi-government and private institutions also took out rallies and held seminars.\nLabour leaders speaking at the events observed that people of Pakistan were faced with an unprecedented inflation and rupee devaluation which had put the very survival of salaried class as well as low- and middle-income groups at stake.\nThe most common demands strongly recommended by the leaders were fixing of minimum wage at Rs50,000, increase in pension by 100pc, introduction of an industry-friendly policy to create job opportunities and withdrawal of all recent hikes in water, power and gas tariffs as well as prices of petroleum products.\n"

They did not name the two parties.\n\u201cWhereas census has been closed in many districts of Sindh where infrastructure is badly damaged and hundreds of thousands of people are displaced following 2022 floods. So instead of reaching to those areas which might require more time, the PBS has kept extending dates in urban centres,\u201d the statement reads.\nThey alleged that the PBS was not prepared for the huge exercise and it made it controversial by acceding to \u201cillegal demands of defeated ethnic and sectarian parties of Karachi\u201d. \nThey said that the PBS overnight fudged the figures in Karachi by abnormally increasing average number of people per block from 1,000 to 3,000.\n\u201cThis shows that so-called Digital Census is not a transparent and fair exercise but a part of a continuous plan to keep numbers of Punjab intact and ensure its political dominance. Over and above it, the PBS has increased the numbers of allied ethnic groups of Punjab from other provinces,\u201d they stated.\nThey said that the extension of the census deadline till May 15 only for Karachi and a few other cities \u201cshows that the federal government wants to fudge the census figures in favour of Punjab and its allied ethnic groups in other provinces to retain political control of one province by hook or by crook\u201d.\n\u201cPeople of Sindh will resort to every step including strikes and blockades to protect their political rights against the onslaught of the Centre and its allies in Sindh. It may be too late for Centre if it perpetuates its unconstitutional role,\u201d the statement concluded.\n"

            "Text": "KARACHI: With the mammoth box office success of Bilal Lashari\u2019s The Legend of Maula Jatt last year \u2014 the film earned Rs100 crore (Rs1 billion) in less than three months in Pakistan alone \u2014 it was expected that some of its success will rub off on the films released on Eidul Fitr this year. Expected is the operative word here. Has it happened? \nFour movies were screened on Eid. They were Money Back Guarantee (directed by Faisal Qureshi), Huey Tum Ajnabi (Kamran Shahid \u2014 who hosts a current affairs show on television), Dorr (Nadeem Cheema) and Daadal (Abu Aleeha). \nWhile there was pre-release hype to some degree for these projects \u2014 except MBG which ran a vigorous campaign and it\u2019s still on \u2014 one thought that a tad more was needed. After all since the masses don\u2019t count on reviews, and all the reviews do is that they tell the story of a movie, films depend a great deal on \u2018word of mouth\u2019. It\u2019s now been a week and if the internet is anything to go by, Money Back Guarantee appears to be heading the race in terms of making its presence felt at the box office. Is that factually correct? \nThe answer to the question will be ascertained in at least two weeks \u2014 perhaps more than that. But trade analysts on social media claim that the Faisal Qureshi-directed venture is leading on that count. On Eid weekend, the film had raked in 6.5crore rupees (Rs65 million) in Pakistan. Huey Tum Ajnabi was in second place which on the second day of Eid was able to collect two crore rupees (Rs20m). \n\nMoney Back Guarantee collects Rs65m in Pakistan on Eid weekend\n\nDealing in figures can be dicey. They can only be verified or denied by those who are in the business. What\u2019s hard to deny is that even if one or two out of the four projects achieve noticeable monetary success, would that be enough to enable the Pakistani film industry \u2014 which includes distributors and exhibitors \u2014 to feel comfortable and happy?\nOne remembers, in 2022 a group of producers held a press conference at the Arts Council in Karachi protesting the release of Hollywood\u2019s Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness alongside some Pakistani films. Thankfully, this year nothing of that sort happened as John Wick \u2014 Chapter 4 is showing along with the above-mentioned four local movies. The action-packed picture, which has done well globally, is doing fine in Pakistan, too. This, at least, shows a sign of maturity on the part of our film fraternity, which implies that it feels secure in its skin. \nHowever, the bigger question remains: will our films be able to do well at the box office consistently? Because if that\u2019s not going to happen, then those who make policies on culture and art will have to find plausible ways of making the film industry prosper.\n"

An officer of additional SP rank would head the force in each district, he said.  \nThe DIG, who was focal person of the proposal, said that Kashmore and Ghotki districts would have 1,500 personnel each while Sukkur and Shikarpur would have 1,000 personnel each in the kathca force. \n\nTells senior police, intelligence and CTD officers the new force will be equipped with sophisticated weapons\n\nThe IGP said the force would be armed with latest weapons. A similar plan was conceived in 1979 as well, he said and expressed the hope that once the force was institutionalised it would bring an end to criminals\u2019 activities in the riverine areas of the four districts. The Sindh government was fully supporting the idea, he said.  \nHe said in answer to a question that criminal justice system had miserably failed and admitted that like police other pillars of the system must also realise \ntheir failure.  \nHe conceded that police investigation system had weaknesses and the government was upgrading it by recruiting 2000 assistant sub-inspectors in the system. \u201cWe are focusing on specialisation in investigation,\u201d he said. \nHe said the department was seeking a \u2018permanent solution\u2019 to the problem and the proposal would hopefully be okayed in the next budget. \nFlanked by DIGs of Larkana, Sukkur and SSPs of both ranges the Sindh police, the IGP said the government had generously accepted all proposals put forth by the police department for capacity building.  \nHe said the department had four challenges, terrorism, street crime, kidnapping for ransom and narcotics. Accessibility to the riverine area was a big hindrance, he said.  \nHe said that if any outlaw wanted to surrender to the law he would be treated in accordance with the law but if he dared challenge the state he would have to face the full force of the government. \nHe said that any police officer found working in cahoots with criminals would have to face severe action as the deportment had adopted zero tolerance policy for such elements in police.  \nHe referred to dismissal of 70 policemen, who were found having links with the \ncriminals, in a day by a police officer and said that pickets were established along the borders of Punjab and Balochistan to check criminals\u2019 movement. The day was not far when Sindh police\u2019s efforts would bear fruit, he said.  \n\u201cWe are launching intelligence-based operations against the criminals active in a small pocket on the right and left banks of Indus in Ghotki, Sukkur, Kashmore and Shikarpur. \u201cWe must assess the size of the problem. Police morale is high and I am confident police will wipe out the criminals from the katcha by working on the new strategy, he said.  \nThe IGP said that 30 dacoits were killed, 143 were injured and 231 hardened criminals were arrested within four months.  \nHe called for sensitising the society to the problem and urged media to adopt international standards in reporting on dacoits\u2019 culture. The media should not glorify criminals, he said.\n"

According to break-up of the Rs4.482bn amount, monetary frauds involving Rs575.306m was mentioned in FIR (No 4/20), Rs379.744m in FIR (5/20) lodged by Jamshoro ACE and Rs527.214m in FIR (No 1/20) filed by Thatta. The ACE claimed that the amount was fraudulently and illegally drawn by the accused in collusion with contractors and companies. \nThe NAB sought transfer of the case from the court of special judge anticorruption (provincial) in October 2020 and since then the case was pending trial before the accountability court.  \nSeveral irrigation officers and officials were found involved in the mega corruption scam and they were facing trial before the accountability court. Some had retired from service.  \nThe DG informed the court that NAB had finalised the reference and submitted it to its chairman for approval. The reference would be filed after NAB chairman returned from umrah and accorded his approval to it, he said. \nThe NAB investigating officer also filed an application seeking merger of two cases of RBOD-II related to Jamshoro district and filed separately by the ACE. The application would be heard on May 27 when NAB was also supposed to file formal reference.\n"

All three of them were working in a private factory, Volka Foods. The family members were found dead at their house when their landlord went there to collect rent. There was a foul smell in the area.  \nThe landlord told police that he had collected rent of the house on March 10 and went there to collect the rent for April after his phone calls went unanswered. Police found an axe smeared with blood. The bodies were shifted to the morgue for post-mortem. \nPolice said the bodies were beginning to decay and it appeared that the incident happened weeks back.  \nMultan City Police Officer (CPO) Rana Mansoor told Dawn the exact cause of death was not known yet and the post-mortem would reveal it.

The National Labour Federation organised the event. \nThe JI, he said, proposed the national vote after Eidul Azha, as the elections were the only solution to the prevailing crises. \u201cI hope the sanity would prevail and the PDM and the PTI would reach consensus on the election.\u201d  \nHe said the political leadership must put aside their mutual differences and evolve an agreement on the polls in the country\u2019s interest.  \nHaq demanded that the government address the concerns of the people of Karachi and other parts in the ongoing census. He also asked the Balochistan government to release the Gwadar Movement leader Hidayatur Rehman Baloch, saying Baloch was put in jail for raising the voice for the fisherman and locals of the port city. The JI, he said, was standing firm for the rights of Gwadar.  \nThe JI chief said the ruling parties have deceived the labourers and working class during every election by making false claims. They, he added, never looked back after getting elected. He appealed to the nation to start a peaceful struggle and vote for the JI candidates in the coming election to get their due share in the country\u2019s resources.  \nCountrywide rallies were held to protect the rights of Gwadar and the oppressed class and release of Hidayatur Rahman Baloch on the appeal of the JI chief on May Day.  \nA large number of people participated.\n"

            "Text": "KASUR: An eight-year-old girl, who was mauled by a pack of stray dogs some two weeks ago at Rodaykay village, succumbed to her critical injuries on Sunday, allegedly because doctors at various public hospitals kept referring her to other health facilities and a private hospital simply refused to admit her for her family not being able to afford the treatment expenses. \nTaking notice of the incident, Punjab interim Chief Minister Mohsin Naqvi has sought a report from the district administration. \nNarrating his plight, Muhammad Abid, father of the victim, a poor tailor, says his daughter Mehreen (8) was attacked by a pack of dogs when she was on her way to a tuition center in the village, some two weeks ago. As a result, the girl sustained dog-bite injuries to her neck, face, belly, legs and chest. \nDoctors at six public hospitals, instead of giving medical aid, just referred the girl to other health facility to avoid responsibility. She could survive, if she was given proper treatment, said  \nAbid says that immediately after the incident, she was rushed to a private clinic in the village where the doctor referred her to the Kasur District Headquarters (DHQ) Hospital in a critical condition.  \nHe alleged that the doctors at the DHQ Hospital, after giving her first aid referred her to the Children\u2019s Hospital Lahore.  \nHe claimed that the doctors at the Children\u2019s Hospital discharged the patient the next day, referring her to the Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH) near Data Darbar.  \nAbid says that the IDH doctors again referred the patient to the Children\u2019s Hospital. \nHowever, he says that he took his daughter to the Ittefaq Hospital, Lahore, where he was advised to move the patient to the Services Hospital, as he could not afford treatment at the private facility (Ittefaq Hospital).  \nThe sobbing father says that on Sunday, when he took his daughter to the Services Hospital Lahore, the doctors declared her dead.  \nDenying Abid\u2019s claim, District Health Authority Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Dr Laeeque Ahmed says the  victim was brought to the Kasur DHQ Hospital on April 15 and was given three  dozes of the rabies vaccine after the prescribed intervals on April 15,  18 and 21. \nHe says that, however, when the girl was brought to  the hospital again on April 25, her condition had deteriorated but there were  no symptoms of rabies.  \nAccording to Dr Laeeq, the patient was  suffering from viral encephalitis/meningitis and was referred to the  Children\u2019s Hospital the same day.  \nJustifying referring her to  Lahore hospital, he said the DHQ hospital was a primary health facility,  while the patient needed specialised care at a better hospital.  \nHowever,  he admitted that the victim was not given anti-tetanus doze to protect  her against viral encephalitis/meningitis, that later caused her death.\nProf Junaid Rashid, head of the Children\u2019s Hospital Paeds department and registrar says the patient, Mehreen, was admitted to the facility at 2.30 am, and was diagnosed with rabies encephalitis.\nHe says the girl was very sick at the time of admission and was given emergency  supportive treatment.  \n\u201cThe patient was examined by the duty doctors who discussed  the case with the senior registrars of the emergency and neurology departments, besides senior deputy medical superintendent of the night shift,\u201d he says. \nProf Rashid says it was decided to shift the patient  in the morning to the Infectious Diseases Hospital (near Data Darba), a specialised facility for the rabies treatment, in the Children\u2019s Hospital\u2019s ambulance. \nHowever, he claims, the girl\u2019s parents left the hospital with the patient on their own early next morning around 6am. The registrar says no other treatment was due or to be given to the patient in the Children\u2019s Hospital. \u201cEvery possible care was already given,\u201d he claims.\nLocal say over a dozen incidents of dog bite had occurred in the area in the last few days, but the tehsil administration was tuning a blind eye to the issue despite repeated complaints.\n"

            "Text": "LAHORE: The Punjab Central Business District Development Authority (PCBDDA) has introduced a blue lane dedicated for the motorists desiring to enter and pass through the CBD and the Centre Point underpasses originating from the Kalma Chowk underpass that has recently been remodeled and linked with the CBD being developed to encourage construction of high-rises and other state-of-the-art infrastructures.  \nThe blue lane aims at providing trouble-free and non-stop public mobility to enter the CBD, Ali Zeb Road, Firdaus Market and Cavalry.  \n\u201cThe CBD Punjab has introduced the \u2018Blue Road\u2019 concept in Lahore, marking the first city in Pakistan to adopt this innovative technology. Blue roads are designed to offer a sustainable alternative to traditional asphalt roads, incorporating heat observation and energy-conserving features to reduce pollution and promote a healthier environment,\u201d said Imran Amin, the chief executive officer of the PCBDDA.  \nThese innovative roads, according to him, utilise a specialised coating that reflects the sunlight, reducing the amount of heat absorbed by the road surface. In addition, the reflective coating improves visibility for drivers at night as well as road safety. The finishing works at the Kalma Chowk remodeling project, which has recently been opened for traffic (except underpasses), are currently underway and being monitored to ensure the timeline given by the caretaker Chief Minister Mohsin Raza Naqvi.  \n\nTraffic to Firdaus Market to use it also; cars going to Liberty not to be allowed\n\n\u201cWe are excited to introduce the \u2018Blue Road\u2019 concept in Pakistan, which has already been implemented successfully in several European and Middle Eastern countries like the Netherlands, France and Qatar. This project will not only bring about environmental benefits, such as heat observation, energy conservation and reduced pollution but also contribute to our vision of creating a modern, sustainable, and inclusive society in Punjab,\u201d Mr Amin explained.  \nThe Kalma Chowk Remodeling Project, also known as CBD boulevard or CBD square project, aims to allow seamless access to the CBD at Walton while avoiding disruption to the existing traffic in the vicinity. The project\u2019s first underpass (from Barkat Market to CBD area at Gulberg and Walton) is of 285 meters length, having two barrels (each of 35 feet width with around 17 feet vertical clearance). Its second two-lane underpass turning toward Ali Zeb Road from Centre Point, measuring 632 metre, has two barrels (38 feet wide each) and 5.1 metre vertical clearance (around 17 feet), fit for all light and heavy transport to pass though easily.  \n\u201cThe CBD Punjab is committed to delivering projects that enhance the standard of living for its residents. The introduction of the Blue Road concept is just one of many initiatives that the authority is undertaking to modernise the city\u2019s infrastructure and improve the quality of life of its citizens,\u201d claimed Amin.  \nTalking to Dawn, PCBDDA Chief Engineer Riaz Hussain said the motorists heading towards the Liberty Roundabout wouldn\u2019t be allowed to use the blue lane as they would only be limited to use three designated lanes.  \n\u201cWe are also scheduled to open the CBD and Centre Point underpasses on May 5 \u2014 the deadline given by the CM,\u201d he added.\n"

            "Text": "\n\nTeams take to the ground for a Test match between Pakistan and India in 1955. \u2014 File photo\n\n \nIn the midst of the oldest park in Lahore lies the sanctuary of cricket; the Lahore Gymkhana Cricket Ground. It is the centrepiece of the historical Bagh-i-Jinnah, formerly known as the Lawrence Gardens, named after colonial-era administrator John Lawrence. This verdant field was established in 1880 and is the second oldest cricket ground in the history of the subcontinent, the oldest being Eden Gardens in Calcutta.\nThis ground featured three historic Test matches and was the first headquarters of the BCCP (Board of Control for Cricket in Pakistan) which was later restructured into the PCB (Pakistan Cricket Board). Many cricketing legends such as Majid Khan, Wasim Raja, Rameez Raja and Imran Khan have played competitive club cricket regularly during their professional years. \nAbdullah Khan Sumbal, the current captain of the Lahore Gymkhana Cricket Club (LGCC) since January 2021 while reminiscing about the cricketing history of this ground, said, \u201cI can vividly recall my college days playing cricket on this ground. Cricketing stalwarts like Majid Khan, Imran Khan, and Wasim Raja used to play regular matches and practice in the nets. It was an amazing experience bowling to them and seeing their prowess. Also, I can still recall facing up to Imran Khan and Abdul Qadir and the nervy twitches it would bring to me.\u201d \nThe former prime minister of Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif, also occasionally played cricket here even during his time in the top office. Similarly, the former chief justice of Pakistan, Justice A.R. Cornelius not only played here but also was the club\u2019s captain.\nThe current secretary of the LGCC, Javed Zaman Khan, who was also the longest serving captain of this club from 1975 to 1995, said, \u201cIn 1977 when England toured Pakistan. Jeff Boycott was strolling in Lawrence Gardens and saw us playing our weekly cricket match on the LGCC ground. \nHe was impressed by how well we played and then he came to us and requested us to play a friendly with the English National Team on that ground. From that time a precedent was set that whenever England toured Pakistan they would always play against us. This practice eventually extended to Australia and New Zealand. The players from these foreign teams used to come and practice with us in the nets. It was truly the golden era of the LGCC. \nThe true beauty of this club lies in its young cricketers, unfortunately only a handful of them are being produced. The nets are rarely used and the youth is turning a blind eye to this cricketing treasure.\u201d\nIt is reported that English batsman Allan Lamb compared this ground with the Lord\u2019s Cricket Ground and Greg Chappel called it the most beautiful ground he has ever set foot on. \nQuaid Khan, one of the regular playing youngsters says, playing the sport which is really close to my heart, that too at a ground which I consider one of the most picturesque in the world for almost three decades now, I consider myself really lucky.\nThe Gymkhana fraternity and game itself has shaped my character and personality in a way which probably schooling alone wouldn\u2019t have done. The weekly fixture at the ground is just not any other cricket game for me but a true escape from tedious work life.\nThe ground also boasts of one of the most beautiful cricket pavilions in the country. Made out of imported oak wood and designed by renowned architects Bhai Ram Singh and G. Stone, the pavilion is truly a masterpiece. Nestled in the pavilion is a cricket museum containing precious cricket artefacts including a ball signed by Sir Donald Bradman and several signed bats by renowned cricketers.\nAccording to one of the many groundskeepers, \u201cWorking here everyday and tending to this beautiful grass in such a serene setting is truly a therapeutic experience which can not be mimicked at any workplace.\u201d  \nThis place should be part of every travel bloggers and foreign tourists\u2019 bucket list visiting Pakistan. My experience on the other hand is very similar to the groundsmen description. \nThe serene setting is most mesmerising to look at and when the winter morning sunlight shines upon the pavilion, it forms a perfect contrast and is a sight for sore eyes. Playing in such a field regularly is every young cricketer\u2019s dream. A field trodden upon by cricketing stalwarts like Imran Khan, Viv Richards, Allan Border and many others.\nThe ground currently hosts three cricket matches a week and still manages to gather about 200 to 300 people across one whole match. \nIt is evident that this ground has lost its glory and it is up to the youth to help regain its lost charm and help bring back the level of cricket that this ground deserves.\n"

            "Text": "BAHAWALPUR: The Lal Sohanra, one of biggest national parks in South Asia, presents a picture of neglect and it needs funds worth millions of rupees for its upkeep, promotion of wildlife and necessary facilities for tourists.  \nThe condition of the sorry state of affairs at the park was noticed by the top government officials, including South Punjab Additional Chief Secretary retired Capt Saqib Zafar, during a visit to the park. Mr Zafar was dismayed to find the enclosures of the wildlife, including blackbucks, nilgai and Chinkara deer, unprotected while the security breach could not stop the rising incidents of their theft during the recent years. On the other hand, the Patisar Lake, comprising 47,000 acres, does not have enough water.  \nTaking notice of the unsafe, unprotected and dwindling flora and fauna, which also faced a threat of extinction in Lal Sohanra, Mr Zafar directed the forest department to take measures for promotion of tourism and protection and breeding of the wildlife in the park. \nDawn learnt that during a visit to the park on Monday, Mr Zafar was accompanied by Deputy Commissioner Bahawalpur Zaheer Anwar Jappa and Divisional Forest Officer Fazal Shah. He expressed disappointment at the poor state of affairs in the national park, stretching over an area of 160,000 acres of land.  \n\nACS takes notice of \u2018sorry state of affairs\u2019 at national park\n\nAccording to an official handout, the additional chief secretary ordered installation of a barbed wire around an area of 65km in the park to cordon off the enclosures of the wildlife. \nDawn learnt that the Patisar Lake, acknowledged as one of the best of wetland areas in the region, is without recreational and amusement facilities for the visitors. \nThe departments concerned, several years ago, had claimed to have undertaken its development work to raise the lake level up to international standards but with the passage of years, the water reservoir looked deserted and without necessary infrastructure and recreation facilities for the picnickers.  \nThe additional chief secretary issued directions to fill the Patisar Lake with the water from the desert branch canal.  \nHowever, the sources say, the irrigation department officials have always been reluctant to supply irrigation water to the lake to give it a new life and provide recreational facilities to the visitors. \nWhenever the irrigation officials\u2019 attention is drawn to the supply of canal water to the lake, they say that the lake is silted and needs desiltation. According to them, without desiltation, the supplying of canal water can neither be possible nor would it prove beneficial for the lake itself.  \nThe sources claim that if the lake is filled with water from the desert branch canal, it can also be a source of income to the tune of millions annually for the forest department, which had auctioned the contract during previous years to catch fish of thousands of maunds from the lake in the winter season. \nThe lake used to be the main source of attraction for the migratory birds from Siberia during the winters besides adding to the scenic beauty of the area. \nIt may be mentioned that the Punjab Forest, Wildlife and Fisheries Department is responsible for the park\u2019s development and upkeep. \nThere have been allegations of the theft of the blackbucks from their enclosures despite the official claims of deployment of watchmen and guards at the enclosures. \nThere have been complaints time and again of the alleged theft of trees from the national park and the forest department higher-ups claimed to have penalised their officials allegedly involved in it.\n"

This accusation led to a scuffle, during which Nabeel repeatedly struck Nazir Ahmad\u2019s head with a rod, causing serious injuries. The attackers also resorted to firing, resulting in Khizer Hayat being injured in the leg.\nThe police officer and his accomplices fled the scene. The injured individuals were taken to the Lalian THQ Hospital, and Nazir was later referred to the Chiniot District Headquarters Hospital in a critical condition to be referred to the Allied Hospital in Faisalabad for treatment, where he succumbed to his injuries.  \nIn the meantime, the CIA officer, in collusion with his colleagues, got a first information report (FIR) registered at the Kandiwal Police Station, naming the aggrieved individuals as the accused.  \nThe FIR was registered under sections 324, 216-A, 382, 440, 252, 186, 148, and 149 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).  \nThe FIR stated that the in charge of the CIA police, Ghulam Shabbir, along with officials Muhammad Nawaz, Fazal Abbas, Mulazim Hussain, Zafar Abbas, Amir Shahzad and Nabeel, went in an official vehicle to arrest proclaimed offender Amir, believed to be present at Nazir Ahmad\u2019s outhouse as informed by a police informant.  \nWhen they raided there, 20 to 25 people, including Muhammad Khan, Ijaz, Muhammad Ashraf, Nazir (the deceased), and Khizer Hayat (the injured), armed with weapons and rods, attacked the police.  \nAccording to the FIR, Ashraf attempted to hit Constable Fazal with a rod, but the rod struck Nazir instead, leading to his death. Another attacker fired at the police, hitting Khizer in the leg, and another shot hit the rear bumper of the official vehicle.  \nThe attackers also tore the uniform of Constable Shahzad, snatched his service card and Rs5,700, and broke the windshield and windows of the official vehicle.  \nNabeel was influential enough to have a press release issued by the district police spokesperson, stating that 50 to 60 individuals had resisted the police\u2019s attempt to arrest proclaimed offenders and had fired shots and attacked the police with rods, resulting in injuries to both attackers and police officers.\nHowever, when the body arrived at the village and the family learned that an FIR had also been registered against them, they staged a protest and appealed for justice on social media. Upon this, the Chiniot district police officer took notice of the incident and, after a preliminary inquiry, ordered registration of a case against police officer Nabeel and his accomplices.\nThe Kandiwal police registered the subsequent FIR against Nabeel and his five accomplices on the application of Ijaz Ahmad, the son of deceased Nazir, under sections 302, 324, 148, and 149 of the PPC. Interestingly, the other nominated police officials and their in charge were not mentioned in the FIR. \nDPO Waseem Riaz stated that the police did not kill anyone. The police raided the proclaimed offender, and those harboring him resisted. During this resistance, the deceased was injured with a blunt weapon, which the police did not carry.  \nHowever, an FIR has also been recorded from the complainant\u2019s side, and the investigation will be conducted on merit.\n"

All that the agencies could do was to watch helplessly. \nThe government placed a ban on the supply of sugar to border districts of Balochistan, but soon there was a spate of complaints that law enforcement agencies were blocking the transportation of wheat and flour as well.  \nConsequently many districts in the province have reported shortage of wheat and flour. This has in turn led to a price spiral.  \nA Customs official said stopping flour-carrying vehicles at checkpoints was \u201cabject cruelty\u201d.  \nHe expressed fears of a massive shortage of wheat flour in Balochistan as transporters were facing problems in carrying the commodity from one district to another. \n\u201cIt\u2019s an irony that at a time when flour mills in other provinces are turning to the latest technology, those in Balochistan are being shut down one by one.\u201d\n"

On Sunday, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal had warned that PTI would be the \u201cultimate loser\u201d if negotiations failed because general elections may be \u201cdelayed for a year under a constitutional provision\u201d.\nHe said the \u201chandlers\u201d had attacked his residence as well as the house of PTI president Chaudhry Parvez Elahi besides detaining party leaders and workers.\nOn Monday, Mr Khan re-asserted that his team would ask the rulers  to dissolve the national and provincial assemblies before May 14 so that  general elections could be held simultaneously.\nClaiming that the \u201cimported government\u201d is planning to present the budget for the next year before dissolving the assemblies and indicating to defy the Constitution and Supreme Court\u2019s verdict by not holding the provincial election on May 14, he said the whole nation would be brought out onto roads to ensure that rule of law prevails in the country.\n\u201cI am warning the thieves and their handlers, the whole nation will come out on roads and ensure that Pakistan is not made a Banana Republic, where might is right and weaker segments of society have no rights,\u201d the former prime minister said.\nWithin the next week, he said, the nation would clearly see whether there was rule of law or \u2018might is right\u2019 in Pakistan. PTI has been peacefully protesting for the last one year just because the already shattered economic conditions could not sustain any kind of disruption.\n\u201cIf the Constitution is overruled by the present imported government then nothing will be left to protect,\u201d he warned, adding that no investors would come to Pakistan to invest and boost the economy.\nMr Khan pointed out that PTI was holding negotiations with the government on the instructions of the Supreme Court to reach an early consensus date for joint national elections.\nHe hailed the \u201cmassive\u201d response by Lahore for the party\u2019s May Day rally.\n\u201cLet this be a warning to those who are thinking of defying SC and Constitution,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cOur people will not tolerate the mafia violating SC orders and Constitution by running away from elections.\u201d\n"

He said the local farmers were badly affected after the destruction of CRBC in the last year\u2019s floods.\nHe said the federal government, despite financial difficulties, had released Rs700 million for rehabilitation of CRBC, which would be completed within one month.\nMr Bacha said the PPP believed in practical measures rather than hollow claims. He said the project was being completed due to personal efforts of PPP central information secretary Faisal Karim Kundi and Ahmad Karim Kundi.\nBesides, he said federal minister Khursheed Shah also took great interest in the matter.\nOn this occasion, state minister Faisal Kundi said the PPP leadership always believed in negotiations among political parties for resolving issues. He said the prevailing issues being faced by the country needed to be resolved through negotiations. However, he said the reservations of the coalition parties over the dialogue with PTI were also genuine.\nHe insisted though the track record of PTI chairman Imran Khan regarding dialogue was not good, PPP hoped for the success of talks.\n\u201cImran Khan on one hand was demanding early elections while on the other he was talking about the restoration of provincial assemblies,\u201d he said.

            "Text": "PESHAWAR: The lack of referral mechanism from district headquarters hospitals to tertiary care facilities has been affecting the treatment of seriously-ill patients.\n\u201cThe government has made several attempts to introduce referral system to lessen burden of patients on the teaching hospitals, which are required to cure the chronic cases. However, teaching hospitals continue to receive cases that are totally manageable at the district level,\u201d according to doctors at the medical teaching institutions.\nThey said that directives had been issued to primary and district hospitals in 2015 to send only those patients, who were not treatable at local level and needed specialised diagnostic and treatment services, to medical teaching institutions. However, they added that, Peshawar-based medical teaching institutions continued to receive patients for whom treatment services were available in district hospitals.\nThey said that the worst-affected were neonates and those patients, who sustained burn injuries. They added that district hospitals referred almost every newborn and burns patient to Peshawar that affected the treatment of seriously-ill patients.\n\nHealth experts say most of cases are manageable at district level\n\nProf Tahmeedullah, the director of plastic surgery centre, told this scribe that patients with 10 per cent burns were sent from district hospitals to his institute despite availability of services of general surgeons at local level.\n\u201cWe have 120-beds, which are enough to effectively treat complicated patients but at times we run out of space due to patients referred unnecessarily form district headquarters hospitals,\u201d he said.\nProf Tahmeed said they had decided to impart free training to surgeons working in district hospitals and introduce a referral system. \u201cThose surgeons, who get training, will manage burn cases at local level and will refer only those patients, who need urgent specialised services,\u201d he added.\nHe said that the trained surgeons would be in touch with them regarding availability of beds, update on patients\u2019 health and other measures to ensure promptly services to the patients.\nPaediatricians at Khyber Teaching Hospital, Lady Reading Hospital and Hayatabad Medical Complex said that newborn children were referred to their health facilities despite availability of children specialists and wards in the districts.\nThey said that as per protocol, primary and district health outlets should be authorised to refer patients to Peshawar when they were in urgent need of tertiary care treatment. \u201cIn this way, direct hospitalisation of people with common illnesses at MTIs can be minimised,\u201d they added.\nThey said that doctors in district hospitals would write patient\u2019s record. Condition of some newborns deteriorate because of their transportation to the provincial capital, therefore, a strong referral system should be put in place to ensure prompt treatment of patients.\nEach of the three MTIs in Peshawar conducts about 15 appendix operations on average per day but these and other minor surgeries can be carried out at local hospitals so that patients with chronic illnesses should not have to wait for their treatment.\nDoctors said that referral would help patients. \u201cIn nursery ward, we have to admit two and more patients on one bed which is medically wrong because they are exposed to infections but we cannot refuse patients,\u201d a doctor at the nursery ward of a teaching hospital said.\nHe said that several suggestions were sent to successive governments to develop linkages between district headquarters hospitals and MTIs but no response was received. In presence of more patients, the quality of treatment was likely to affect, he said.\n\u201cReferral system will ease workload on the hospitals and patients will receive proper care. Currently, 80 per cent patients admitted in MTIs of Peshawar are sent from other districts,\u201d said the doctor.\n"

            "Text": "KHYBER: Representatives of sports associations and leading sportsmen from across seven tribal districts have demanded an immediate abolition of the directorate of sports for the region insisting the body has become redundant since the merger of the erstwhile Fata with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2018.\nThey told Dawn that there was no constitutional or legal provision to \u2018patronise\u2019 a particular department when all other departments were already merged with the provincial secretariat.\nThe association members said the standard of sports in tribal districts was fast declining as the directorate of merged districts complained about a shortage of funds and absence of a service structure for their employees, while the provincial sports directorate disowned all sports and related associations considering the ex-Fata directorate an obstacle to sports promotion and development in the region.\nThey said the merged districts\u2019 sports directorate was short of experts and sports officials and that those occupying key positions had failed to promote sports and patronise talented players.\n\nClaim body lacks funds, facilities to promote sports in tribal districts\n\n\u201cIf the Directorate of Sports for Merged Districts can\u2019t provide us with facilities, then there is no reason for its existence,\u201d Ateequllah Shinwari, an international footballer, told Dawn.\nWith most international appearances to his credit from the merged areas and a national gold medalist, he said that while the 24th National Games were to commence on May 21 but talented players of different games from the merged districts were still clueless about their participation in these national level prestigious games.\nMuddasir Khan, Abudarda, Zahidullah and Akhtar Rasool of the badminton, table tennis, cycling and football associations respectively told Dawn that they were kept in darkness about the inclusion of merged districts players and teams in the forthcoming National Games as trials had so far not been conducted for the national event.\nThey said the merged districts directorate had not provided them with any facilities or required equipment and sports gears during the last five years of its creation.\nThe players said most sports associations ran and operated on their own limited financial resources while the merged districts\u2019 directorate officials were only there to save their own posts instead of doing any good to us or sports.\nThey demanded immediate abolition of the merged districts directorate.\nFarhad Shinwari, a Pakistan Karate Federation coach and a former international martial art player, insisted that the merged districts directorate had so far arranged only inter-merged districts festivals, which were of little use to local players to compete and exhibit their natural talent on a national sports platform.\n\u201cOrganising sports festivals in tribal districts is a complete waste of time and money and should be immediately stopped,\u201d he said.\nMr Shinwari demanded an immediate appointment of a district sports officer along with his staff members to all seven merged districts like other districts of the province.\nHe said DSOs in other districts held local sports events along with trials and preparing their own players of different games for competing at the national level and then international level.\nRaheed Gul, an official of the merged districts sports directorate, told Dawn that he and other staff members weren\u2019t even aware of their official status in the absence of a legal service structure, while the KP sports directorate was unwilling to recognise them as a \u2018legal\u2019 entity.\nHe said most of his colleagues faced an uncertain future as the KP sports directorate didn\u2019t consider them for any senior post though they performed their respective duties on \u2018subordinate\u2019 positions.\n\u201cThough we are employees of the provincial government, we are not considered for any promotion or appointment to a senior post,\u201d he said.\nMr Gul said the erstwhile Fata used to participate in national games as a separate region but that was no more the case as it couldn\u2019t send a separate squad to the 24th National Games from the merged districts due to legal constraints.\nWhen contacted, director-general of the provincial sports directorate Khalid Khan said the process of merging both sports directorates had not yet completed, so both were functioning independently.\n\u201cAs per the merger plan, things have to be settled down in 10 years time,\u201d he said.\nMr Khan said he favoured an early abolition of the merged districts\u2019 sports directorate.\nHe said his department,too, faced problems as the provincial government hadn\u2019t released any funds to it.\n\u201cWe have plans for sports development in the province but are short of funds,\u201d he said.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The committee comprising the Old Grant leaseholders\u2019 representatives and officials of Rawalpindi and Chaklala Cantonment Board (CCB) proposed several relaxations in the lease policy which would be sent to the defence secretary for approval after its finalisation.\nThe Old Grant leaseholders in civic limits of Rawalpindi Cantonment Board have sought a number of relaxations in the 2007 lease policy, including waiver of surcharge on delay in conversion from Old Grant leases into regular one; reduction of lease charges(premium) to minimum level, and the abolition of extra charges on change of purpose of the lease from residential to commercial.\nThe committee was constituted on the direction of the Director General Military Lands and Cantonments (DG MLC) following a meeting of the affected people of Rawalpindi Cantonment Board, who have been protesting against what they termed the cruel and irrational policy for conversion of Old Grant leases into the regular one.\nAfter listening to the grievances of the affected people, whose number was in thousands, the DGMLC directed the executive office of the Rawalpindi Cantonment Board to sit with them and come up with proposed changes to the lease policy so that the same could be sent to defence secretary for final consideration.\n\nChanges seek reduction in premium, abolition of extra charges on lease conversion\n\nThe committee comprising the representatives of Old Grant leaseholders, elected members of the Rawalpindi Cantonment Board and its officials after threadbare deliberations and discussions evolved a consensus on contentious issues and prepared proposed changes to the policy to make it acceptable to the Old Grant leaseholders which was in limbo since its announcement in 2007.\nMohammad Farooq Chaudhry, a member of the committee representing Old Grant leaseholders, informed that they have been opposing the lease policy 2007 since its inception because it is full of flaws. The penalty and premium money for conversion of the Old Grant lease into a regular one is so high that it would be tantamount to repurchase the property.\nSecondly, the rates for change in status of the property from residential into commercial are abnormally high whereas most of the properties with Old Grant lease status have been in commercial use for decades as these properties are located in the commercial hub of the cantonment like Bank Road, Hospital Road and other Bazaar area, Mohammad Farooq Chaudhry, who is president of Twin Cities Restaurants Association, explained.\nHe further informed that the residential properties surrounded by commercial areas were converted into commercial properties as it would not be possible for owners to use them as residential units. All these properties are treated as commercial properties as they have commercial electricity, water and gas connections while Rawalpindi Cantonment Board is also charging them commercial property tax.\nSharing details of the proposed changes the committee has submitted to the office of DG MLC for further action Mohammad Farooq Chaudhry said that first of all they wanted waiver of the penalty or surcharge on the conversion of the Old Grant leases into regular ones and secondly they wanted a drastic slash in the premium of lease conversion, as most of the Old Grant leaseholders are in possession of these properties for generations and in certain cases the leases were secured more than a century ago.\nSecondly, the penalty on change of purpose of these leases from residential to commercial should also be waived as the owners of these properties were compelled to change the status of their properties since they were located in the thick of the business hub of the cantonment, he explained.\nThe proposed changes also included the lifting of the bar on the sale of the properties held under Old Grant as the leaseholders are absolute owners of the superstructures on the leased land and no law of the land can bar them from selling their property.\n"

            "Text": "NEW DELHI: Contra\u00addicting media reports that Asia Cup could be postponed and a parallel tournament, excluding Pakistan, could be played in Dubai in the same window, the Asian Cricket Council sources on Monday told the Press Trust of India that they have not sent out any such proposal to the member nations.\nA report in Pakistan media claimed that if the Pakistan Cricket Board does not agree to play the Asia Cup at a neutral venue, the tournament could be taken away from the country.\nThe hosting rights of the 2023 Asia Cup, scheduled to be held in the 50-over format, are with the PCB but Board of Control for Cricket in India secretary Jay Shah, who is also the ACC chairman, had made it clear that the Indian cricket team will not travel to Pakistan.\nThe PCB has proposed to host Asia Cup on a \u2018hybrid model\u2019, which would see Pakistan play their matches on home soil, while India play at a neutral venue \u2014 in all likelihood Dubai.\nIt is understood that the BCCI wants the entire tournament to be shifted to the UAE, much like the 2018 and 2022 editions when India and Sri Lanka were the tournament hosts.\n\u201cThere has been exchange of messages but no discussion or proposal to postpone the Asia Cup has been floated,\u201d an ACC Board member, privy to discussions on the sidelines of an ICC meet in Dubai, told PTI on the conditions of anonymity.\n\u201cSecondly, if the Asia Cup is cancelled, PCB will be intimated first. Nothing of that sort has happened till now. The ACC chairman (Shah) hasn\u2019t yet put anything on record.\n\u201cTo postpone or cancel the event, the ACC will have to call an Executive Board meeting. The chairman (Shah) can call the meeting in seven days (virtual or physical). To date, there is no intimation about any such meeting,\u201d the source added.\nThe ACC source said that, to the best of his knowledge, the last official mail exchange between the PCB, ACC and BCCI was an invitation sent to the Indian team with assurance of highest degree of security and best hospitality.\n\u201cBut, obviously, it is difficult for India to travel to Pakistan in the current sensitive political environment,\u201d he agreed.\nThe other issue is the amount of money the official broadcaster has committed on telecast deals, that includes at least two assured India-Pakistan games. If the two teams make the final, the third game would be a bonanza.\n\u201cWe must remember the media rights and the agreement with Star Sports, who have paid millions for, at least, two Pakistan vs India matches in the Asia Cup,\u201d he said.\nIt is learnt that when the informal discussion was held between the ACC members about hosting the tournament at a neutral venue, the source confirmed that BCCI did get support from Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC).\n\u201cLook, if the Asia Cup is cancelled after the ACC chairman summons an Executive Board meeting, the ramifications will not just be Pakistan\u2019s World Cup participation but also PCB\u2019s FTP calendar and bilateral relations with Sri Lanka, Afghanistan or Bangladesh.\n\u201cThe situation is still very fluid,\u201d the source said.\n"

            "Text": "\n\nKARACHI: New Zealand cricketers practise at the National Stadium on Monday.\u2014Tahir Jamal/White Star\n\n \nKARACHI: Mohammad Rizwan has recently emerged as an able finisher for Pakistan in the One-day International format, wrapping up the side\u2019s successful chases in the first two matches of the ongoing five-match series against New Zealand. The right-hander, however, is not happy with his new batting position.\nThe change, which according to the batter had been made by the captain and coach, has reaped fruit so far. Having been shifted a spot lower in the batting order to number five, Rizwan stayed unbeaten to take Pakistan across the finish line against the Black Caps with quickfire contributions of 42 and 54 to give the hosts a 2-0 lead.\n\u201cPersonally, I\u2019m not happy with playing at number five and I\u2019d prefer playing at four,\u201d Rizwan said during a press conference ahead of the teams\u2019 practice sessions here at the National Stadium on Monday. \u201cBut that\u2019s not important. It\u2019s not necessary for me to get what I want.\u201d   \nThe 30-year-old said he wanted to stay allegiant with his captain and coach and that he did not plan to express his concerns to the team management. \n\u201cWhatever the captain and coach think is right, they will do it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve made many sacrifices in the past and I am ready to make more according to what\u2019s required by the coach and captain.\n\u201cI play at number four thro\u00adughout my domestic and club career. For Pakistan, in fact, I\u2019ve played at number eight as well. \n\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019ll demand playing at my favourite position that from the coach. According to whatever suits them I\u2019ll try to play accordingly.\u201d\nPakistan are now in a solid position to take an unassailable lead in the one-day series as it shifts from Rawalpindi to Karachi but letting go of a 2-0 advantage in the recent five-match T20 series will play on the hosts\u2019 minds when they take on the visitors in the third match here on Wednesday.\n\n\nPAKISTAN wicket-keeper/batter Mohammad Rizwan gestures during a media conference at the National Stadium on Monday.\u2014PPI\n\n \nRizwan believed the national side may assess their past performances but cannot afford to dwell on them. The batter said he and has team-mates would rather try to do well with the upcoming challenges.  \n\u201cEvery match is important for us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe prefer forgetting what happened in the past whether we have done well or not, because conditions were different, the requirements were different at the Pindi Stadium. \n\u201cOver here [in Karachi], different things are going to happen, so it\u2019s about moving on from the past after assessing our performances and trying to win what\u2019s at hand.\u201d\nRizwan said Pakistan were adapting to the changes the modern game is going through and that the batters eye big scores in every match. The Peshawar-born batter, however, was wary of the factors that conditions bring into play. \n\u201cPitches can be different at times,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the PSL, at Pindi we saw targets of 240-250 being chased but that changed once we switched to the international standard. \n\u201cOur focus is on the fact that conditions should assessed. According to how one-day cricket has changed, we are trying to score 300-350 but it is also true that conditions come into play. In Karachi only we both lost and won matches at 260-270 [in the previous series].\u201d\n"

            "Text": "NEW DELHI: The prospect of Indian Premier League (IPL) franchises becoming primary employers of foreign cricketers over their national boards is moving closer with multi-tournament contracts already being offered to some players.\nEight of the IPL\u2019s 10 franchises own at least one team in another league abroad and the owners of Mumbai Indians and Delhi Capitals have both acquired teams in new T20 tournaments in South Africa, the United Arab Emirates and the United States. \n\u201cSome players have been offered multi-club deals,\u201d Neil Maxwell, Australia\u2019s most prominent player agent, told Reuters. \u201cThe cricket landscape is changing rapidly and already contracting an Australian player has taken a different format.\u201d  \nThe growing number of T20 leagues offering lucrative contracts to the game\u2019s best talent means national teams are sometimes having to play second fiddle. West Indies have struggled for years to field their best players due to scheduling clashes.\nAnd the situation is only likely to worsen for national boards as they struggle to match the multi-league contracts offered to their star players by private franchise owners.\nA clear indication of the IPL\u2019s expanding footprint came last year when its franchises snapped up all six teams in the lucrative T20 league in South Africa.\nThe Indian conglomerates now want their best overseas recruits to represent them in multiple leagues and, according to the Cricinfo website, informal conversations have begun with players from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and West Indies.\nNone of the IPL franchises contacted by Reuters would confirm offers have been made but some cricket boards are already taking defensive measures to protect their talent.\nCricket Australia last month announced a 7.5 per cent pay increase for its centrally contracted players, while also raising the salary cap in its Big Bash League.\nThe England and Wales Cricket Board is planning to increase match fees and offer multi-year contracts to key players to retain its top talent.\nMaxwell, who manages Australia captain Pat Cummins and fast bowler Josh Hazlewood, said boards were offering longer-term contracts for the first time as a \u201cresult of competition\u201d. \n\u201cThis will evolve again as players get more and more choice as to when and where they play.\u201d Cummins is not surprised at how fast the landscape is changing and told Fox Sports: \u201cthere\u2019s going to be other opportunities that are going to be really hard for players to say no to, different franchises around the world\u201d. \n\u201cI think realistically we\u2019ve got to manage players a bit differently to what we have in the past.\u201d  \nTIPPING POINT \nMaxwell drew a parallel with soccer and likened the financial might of the IPL to the English Premier League (EPL), whose clubs employ the cream of international talent. \n\u201cCricket has traditionally survived off country v country competition - this is not sustainable in the long term,\u201d he said. \u201cThe landscape is changing, similar to the EPL system where playing for the club is the priority.\u201d  \nCricket writer Nicholas Brookes, whose \u2018An Island\u2019s Eleven: The Story of Sri Lankan Cricket was Wisden\u2019s Book of the Year in 2023, agreed with the football analogy. \n\u201cClearly, the game is reaching a tipping point with franchise T20 fast becoming the dominating format, and all other forms of cricket left fighting for scraps,\u201d he told Reuters \u201cI think we\u2019re probably heading towards a similar situation to football, where the franchise sides become like Premier League clubs, and where international cricket is marginalised to preordained windows.\u201d  \nWhile the likes of World Cups and the Ashes series would retain their eminence, players prioritising the franchise T20 game over regular bilateral cricket was not  \u201ctotally implausible\u201d, Brookes added.\nThe Federation of International Cricketers\u2019 Associations (FICA) has long identified the potential conflict between T20 leagues and international cricket.\nFICA\u2019s Chief Executive Tom Moffat told Reuters it has been advocating for a fixed global schedule so the two can co-exist, an initiative he believes has become more urgent as private ownership across leagues has accelerated in the last 18 months. \n\u201cThis would likely be best achieved through formal scheduling windows, which we know players are supportive of,\u201d Moffat said.\nOne major board not losing any sleep over the changing landscape is the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), whose coffers are filled with the proceeds from the IPL and which bans its own players from competing in overseas leagues.\nBut even that long-standing policy might come under pressure given the ambition of the IPL franchise owners to expand their global footprint, said Brookes. \n\u201cIt will be interesting to see how things play out between the BCCI and the Indian franchise owners in the years to come as it seems like there could be a conflict brewing there,\u201d he said.\n"

He violated the law and the Constitution. Others who do the same go to jail.\u201d\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also said that some things about the former judge cannot be said on microphone.\nMr Sharif criticised the decisions the former chief justice took during his tenure.

How much more can he [Nisar] defend? He has committed crimes against the nation which are unforgivable.\u201d\nIn the last few months, the former prime minister has made repeated demands to hold the judiciary, as well as former generals accountable, and criticised the judiciary\u2019s historic role in alleged political engineering.\nMost recently, Mr Sharif advocated for a reference to be filed in the Supreme Judicial Council against the bench that delivered the verdict for the Punjab elections schedule. Mr Sharif has also taken on serving CJP Umar Ata Bandial, and framed the actions of the serving CJP and past ones as efforts to bring Imran Khan to power.\nMr Sharif\u2019s daughter, Maryam Nawaz, has already made several scathing allegations against the former chief justice, accusing him of facilitating the rise to power of her arch-rival, Imran Khan.\nLast month, PM Shehbaz Sharif had also accused ex-CJP Nisar of sabotaging development projects initiated by the previous PML-N regime.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Tuesday hinted at charging mark up on over Rs43 billion determined by it for refund to electricity consumers in Karachi under tariff clawback mechanism and to examine the extent of delays in investment for new generation plants over the past seven years before allowing another multi-year tariff (MYT).\nAt a public hearing on KE\u2019s petition for a generation tariff, the Karachi-based industrial consumers suggested that instead of allowing the private utility to set up plants on expensive fuel, efforts should be made to evacuate maximum power supply from the cheaper national grid to facilitate business opportunities in the country\u2019s largest industrial city suffering from additional quarterly charges and fuel cost adjustments higher than the national average.\nThe management of K-Electric has requested the regulator to set separate electricity generation tariffs for its power plants keeping in view central economic dispatch and for better visibility and transparency. For the first time, the integrated power utility is seeking separate licences and tariffs for its generation, transmission and distribution businesses, saying it was in line with the IPPs model followed by the regulator for the public sector distribution companies and independent power producers (IPPs). As per the petition, the KE has requested a generation tariff from Rs22.76 per unit to Rs40.12 per unit for the RLNG-based power generation, and Rs37.31 per unit to Rs54.30 per unit for the (HSD)/HFO-based power generation.\nDuring a three-hour hearing presided over by Nepra Chairman Tauseef H. Farooqui, the members and case officers of the regulator said the investment allowed by the regulator in the previous MYT (for seven years) had not been completed within the given deadlines and even the latest Bin Qasim Power Station (BQPS-3) unit currently in completion phase should have been completed years ago. \n\nUtility seeks generation tariff for its plants\n\nThe Nepra case officers reported that the plants were also given returns based on those investments which could not be passed through mid-year review and stood charged to consumers in tariff.\nThe Nepra members also suggested looking into the issue of plants completing their project life but not being transferred to the government as envisaged under the licences or relevant agreements and whether these plants were taken at their residual value or scrap value. The KE\u2019s chief financial officer Amir Ghaziani and the Nepra team blamed each other for taking different positions while dealing with public sector entities and KE and whether to follow prudent cost principles, cost plus formula or past precedents.\nSome questions were also raised as to what benefit the consumers of Karachi had gotten from KE\u2019s privatisation and previous MYT, Mr Ghaziani said the KE\u2019s average tariff would have gone beyond Rs80 per unit instead of Rs31-32 at present as the utility had reduced losses from 45pc to 15pc and improved recoveries to 95pc which was unprecedented when compared with public sector Discos. He was reminded that some Discos including some larger than KE like Faisalabad, Lahore and Islamabad had fewer losses and higher recoveries than KE.\nKE is currently operating under an MYT regime which will complete its term at the end of the current fiscal year. This time the company has filed for separate tariffs for each of its six plants, all of which can run on dual fuel except for SITE and Korangi Gas Turbine Power Stations.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) missed its collection target by almost 17.57 per cent, or Rs103 billion, for April owing to a steep decline in imports as well as poor sales tax performance, showed provisional data on Tuesday.\nThe revenue collection stood at Rs483bn in April as against the target of Rs586bn. This reversal of trend will make it a daunting task for the FBR field formations to make a huge recovery in May-June to achieve the annual target.\nHowever, April\u2019s collection posted no growth when compared with last year\u2019s Rs483bn. A few more billion may come to the government kitty when book adjustments are made in next few days.\nAs a result of April\u2019s dip, the shortfall widened to Rs381bn as total collection stood at Rs5.638 trillion in 10MFY23 against the target of Rs6.019tr. The tax authorities, however, recorded a 15.67pc growth over Rs4.874tr collected in July-April FY22.\n\nShortfall swells to Rs381bn in July-April\n\nThe growth is much below what the government had committed to the International Monetary Fund to achieve the projected target of Rs7.47tr for FY23.\nOn Feb 14, the FBR raised the sales tax rate from 17pc to 18pc. Similarly, the excise duty on cigarettes also increased significantly. The revenue projection in three and half months from these two measures is estimated at Rs115bn. The overall new tax measures implemented from March 1 were estimated to raise additional tax payments for government kitty in the range of Rs170bn in the next three months.\nAt the same time, the Supreme Court on Feb 7 also ordered big taxpayers to deposit 50pc of their super tax with the FBR.\nAccording to an official source, all these measures did not help FBR to achieve its revenue collection target for April. However, the performance of tax machinery remains below expectations despite several revenue measures.\nThe impact of over 36pc inflation besides the highest-ever depreciation of the rupee is also not reflected in the revenue collection.\nThe data shows that collection from direct taxes reached Rs2.514bn in 10MFY23 against a target of Rs2.368bn, which was surpassed by 6.16pc. A growth of 44pc was recorded when compared with last year\u2019s collection of Rs1.750tr. One of the major reasons is the collection of the super tax in April following the order of the Supreme Court. The income tax refund paid was Rs14bn in 10MFY23 against Rs11bn in 10MFY22, an increase of Rs3bn. \nThe sales tax collection stood at Rs2.089tr in 10MFY23 against Rs2.071tr in 10MFY22, reflecting an increase of 1pc. The sales tax collection fell short of the target by Rs280bn or 11.81pc to Rs2.089tr against the target of Rs2.369tr.\nThe domestic sales tax collection did not perform well despite unprecedented inflation as well as an increase in GST rate to 18pc from 17pc.\nThe customs collection fell 6pc to Rs752bn in 10MFY23 against Rs798bn last year. This was mainly due to a nearly 29pc decline in overall imports in 10MFY23.\nThe federal excise duty also fell short of the target by Rs71bn to Rs281bn in 10MFY23 against the target of Rs352bn. However, the excise duty collection posted a growth of 10pc when compared with last year\u2019s collection of Rs256bn in 10MFY22.\n"

            "Text": "KARACHI: The Aga Khan Fund for Economic Development (AKFED), which is the overseas sponsor of Habib Bank Ltd, is going to use its accumulated dividends worth Rs3.5 billion to buy additional shares of the country\u2019s largest lender from the stock market, a regulatory filing said on Tuesday.\nThe announcement is first of its kind by any corporate entity with overseas sponsors given that the laws governing the repatriation of dividends didn\u2019t allow it until recently.\nPakistan is facing a dollar shortage, which has led the authorities to impose official and semi-official restrictions on the outflow of foreign exchange. As a result, multinationals haven\u2019t been able to repatriate their profits in the form of dividends to their overseas headquarters.\nPending repatriations amount to roughly $1.5bn, according to Amir Paracha, president of the Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI).\n\nLucky Cement announces buyback\n\nBoth inflation and the rupee\u2019s depreciation against the dollar are eating into the accumulated \u2014 but yet to be repatriated \u2014 dividends of multinationals. These companies couldn\u2019t reinvest their dividends even into a profit-generating bank account \u2014 let alone in the stock market \u2014 and repatriate the same along with additional returns.\n\u201cThe OICCI team met the governor of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) last Friday to discuss this issue. The governor told us the SBP is going to allow foreign companies to invest their dividends in government securities and the stock market,\u201d said Mr Paracha while speaking to Dawn on Tuesday at the office of Unilever Pakistan Ltd, where he serves as CEO.\nThe regulatory filing by Habib Bank, which came on the first working day after the OICCI team\u2019s meeting with the SBP governor, said the purchase of shares will be \u201cin accordance with applicable regulatory approvals\u201d. The notice didn\u2019t specify the purchase period.\nThe share price of Habib Bank rose 7.49 per cent, maximum allowed in a day, to Rs77.94 apiece on Tuesday. At the going rate, the foreign sponsor should be able to purchase 45.3 million shares, constituting about 3.1pc of the bank\u2019s total shareholding. AKFED already owns 51pc shareholding in Habib Bank.\nThe SBP hasn\u2019t formally notify any change in the regulation. Its spokesperson didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nMeanwhile, Lucky Cement Ltd announced on Tuesday it\u2019d buy back 23.8m of its shares in a second buyback from June 2 to Nov 20 using the firm\u2019s distributable profits.\nAt the going rate of Rs431.25 apiece, the exercise will cost the cement maker roughly Rs10.2bn.\nThe firm completed its first buyback of 10m shares at Rs4.35bn in March.\nThe practice of listed firms buying back their shares is becoming increasingly popular in Pakistan. The total number of shares goes down once a company conducts a share buyback for cancellation. As a result, its break-up value and profit per outstanding share go up. However, some analysts oppose the practice on the pretext that the exercise deprives the stock exchange of valuable shares.\nSpeaking to Dawn, Lucky Cement Chief Financial Officer Atif Kaludi said the buyback will benefit shareholders because it increases the net worth of each share in percentage terms and, resultantly, its eventual value.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think buybacks are bad for the stock market. Cash flows from companies to investors who can either reinvest it in the stock market or use that liquidity for any other purpose. The economy needs cash right now, and we\u2019re doing exactly that,\u201d he said.\n"

            "Text": "OUTSIDE the Khuzdar Press Club stands a column topped with the likeness of a hand cast in iron and holding a pen. The imposing structure seems to celebrate the notion of a free press. The reality could not be more different. In 2014, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) ranked Khuzdar, the capital of Khuzdar district in central Balochistan, among the world\u2019s 10 most dangerous cities for journalists. \nThe same year, Amnesty International described the area as a \u201cgraveyard for journalists\u201d, after at least six media persons were murdered here in the preceding few years. Among them were two of the press club\u2019s presidents and its general secretary. It was a chilling message to the journalist community as a whole. \nThe threats were unrelenting. \u201cSome of my colleagues in Khuzdar stopped answering their phones,\u201d recalled a journalist in Quetta. Several repo\u00adrters moved to other towns for safety; some gave up journalism altogether. Twice, the press club was shut down: the second time for a year. Khuzdar Press Club President Mufti Siddique Mengal told Dawn: \u201cWe closed it out of fear because we realised we couldn\u2019t do journalism any longer. When [the state was] faced with recrimination from the outside world, they forced us to open.\u201d Khuzdar district, indeed Balochistan as a whole, still remains a graveyard for journalism.\nToday is World Press Free\u00addom Day, an occasion to recognise the importance of the media in strengthening demo\u00adcracy. To hold the authorities accountable, the media must be independent and free to report on abuses of power, corruption, anti-people policies, etc. But in Pakistan, an increasingly securitised state led to a weakening of civil institutions; and that, coupled with the corporatisation of the news business, began eroding hard-won media independence. Journalists that refused to toe the line were silenced, sometimes with deadly force. In 2022, Pakistan ranked 157 out of 180 countries on RSF\u2019s World Press Freedom Index, a drop of 12 places since the previous year. According to a report by Freedom Network, an independent national media watchdog, at least 53 journalists were murdered in the country from 2012 to 2022. Only in two cases have convictions been obtained.  \n\nNowhere else in the country do media persons confront such a multi-dimensional threat landscape\n\nBut if journalism is a dangerous profession in Pakistan, nowhere do journalists have to navigate the kind of multi-dimensional threat landscape as they do in Balochistan. Unsurprisingly, most media persons Dawn spoke to in Quetta and Khuzdar for this report did not want to talk on the record. \u201cThere are so many actors now that it\u2019s easy to kill anyone and put it on someone else. Security forces, separatist outfits, tribal sardars, anyone can take offence at what we say or report,\u201d said a reporter in Quetta. Most conceded that they were reduced to paper-pushers: \u201cWe write what the authorities want us to write. We can\u2019t present the real facts.\u201d \nEnforced disappearance is among the burning issues many journalists say they cannot cover. \u201cWhen [Supreme Court Chief Justice] Iftikhar Chaudhry was holding hearings into missing people\u2019s cases until 1.30am in Quetta, we\u2019d take shelter of the court to report the statements that victims\u2019 families gave before the bench. Sometimes their words would even move the judges to tears,\u201d a senior correspondent recalled. \u201cWe can\u2019t even do that now. In fact, on electronic media we\u2019re not allowed to do so at all.\u201d \nWhat underscores the glaring gap in the coverage of enforced disappearances in Balochistan is that the protest camp for missing persons is right next to the Quetta Press Club. \nOne journalist said: \u201cWhen Mama Qadeer [founder of Voice for Baloch Missing Persons] comes here to hold a press conference in the hall, even the journalists on the premises don\u2019t attend it because they know the news won\u2019t be carried.\u201d He added with a sardonic laugh, \u201cThough a few journalists will turn up, those whose job it is to report to the intelligence agencies.\u201d\nPoor working conditions rub salt into the wounds of Balochistan\u2019s journalists. \u201cMany media persons are not even getting minimum wage,\u201d says a senior correspondent. \u201cSub-editors are getting Rs8,000 to Rs12,000. Even reporters for bigger papers get no more than Rs25,000 at most.\u201d \nThat is if they get paid at all. Very seldom are district correspondents paid by their news organisations. These reporters have no choice but to moonlight as journalists while holding paying jobs. Many are public-sector employees; quite a few are contractors; some are even members of political parties. There is an obvious conflict of interest in such a situation. That is why the Balochistan Union of Journalists has only 145 members, including four women. \u201cOnly full-time journalists with an appointment letter from their employer can be members,\u201d explained BUJ President Irfan Saeed. \u201cNevertheless, we always take a stand if something happens to them.\u201d \n\n\nIllustration by Radia Durrani\n\n \nBUJ General Secretary Manzoor Ahmed believes press clubs in Pakistan should be strengthened by treating journalism as a profession, much like medicine, law or engineering. \u201cThere should be a service structure for journalists to be promoted from junior reporter [all the way up] to bureau chief, shift incharge and director news,\u201d he told Dawn. \u201cSimilarly, there should be experience criteria to qualify them to become [current affairs] analysts. That way journalists from Balochistan will have more of a presence in important positions in mainstream media.\u201d\nIn recent years, media houses have reduced their outlay, and in a province that gets short shrift in so many respects, the fallout has been brutal. At a gathering of journalists at the Quetta Press Club, they can barely contain their resentment. \u201cBefore I had an office, a DSNG, a SIM and a mobile. Now I get only a SIM with data,\u201d said one reporter. \u201cToday I was asked to do the filming with my mobile, because our camera is out of order and the one they sent as a replacement is in even worse condition,\u201d claimed another. \nBureaus are being run with two individuals, sometimes even one. Considering there is no \u2018beat\u2019 system in Balochistan, which means a reporter must cover everything \u2014 from bomb blasts to sports and prices of vegetables \u2014 it makes for an exhausting and demoralising existence. The lack of basic knowledge about the province among assignment editors at head offices elsewhere in the country also rankles. \u201cWhen Chinese engineers were attacked in Gwadar, an assignment editor called their reporter in Quetta to ask how much time would it take him to get there. I told him, it takes 12 hours. Put up a map in your office.\u201d\nThen there is the one-dimensional view through which news about Balochistan is filtered. \u201cThe province\u2019s coverage is limited to bomb blasts,\u201d said a correspondent bitterly. \u201cMedia house owners say \u2018what business do we get from Balochistan that we should give it more space\u2019? It reflects their attitude to Balochistan in general. \nWhile Balochistan has never had a vibrant media, the profession was not quite so sterile and restrictive as it has now become. A bureau chief in Quetta recalled that during the trial for Justice Nawaz Marri\u2019s murder, which was carried out in 2000 allegedly on the orders of Khair Bux Marri by his sons, journalists would freely report Mr Marri\u2019s views. Things changed when the Baloch insurgency broke out. As the security footprint in the province expanded, the right to free speech was slowly but surely throttled.\nThe state did not only respond militarily to the insurgency. Violent extremist groups and pro-establishment tribal militias were given carte blanche to hunt down Baloch militants. The extremists began targeting Balochistan\u2019s Shia Hazara community in horrific acts of sectarian violence while the militias evolved into \u2018death squads\u2019 that killed people for political as well as non-political reasons. Among the most notorious of these outfits was the Baloch Musalla Difaee Tanzeem (BMDT) led by a native of Khuzdar named Shafiq Mengal. Journalists, teachers, doctors and intellectuals died in target killings. \u201cIt was a way to spread fear in society, and to prevent anything from being reported,\u201d said a journalist in Khuzdar. \nNadeem Gurgnari, a Khuzdar-based reporter, paid the ultimate price for his journalism: the murder of his two sons. On Oct 25, 2012, the brothers were on their way to do some Eid shopping when they were targeted by two armed men on a motorbike. Siraj died on the spot while Manzoor was mortally wounded. \u201cMy wife and I found ourselves alone at the Civil Hospital. It was such a lawless time that even doctors weren\u2019t coming to work,\u201d recalls Mr Gurgnari who was the Khuzdar Press Club president at the time. \u201cI told her to take Siraj\u2019s body home while I rushed Manzoor to [another] hospital \u2014 but he also died later.\u201d No one has been held accountable.\nEven within Balochistan\u2019s complex dynamics, Khuzdar district is a particularly difficult place to report from also because of its entrenched tribal culture. Some of the most powerful Baloch sardars are based here. As one enters the district when travelling by road, posters of Sanaullah Zehri, Israrullah Zehri, Akhtar Mengal, etc can be seen intermittently along the highway. As a reporter put it: \u201cEven politics here is the preserve of the sardars\u2026 If you write against them or the sardari nizam, they\u2019re not going to do a case of defamation against you. They\u2019ll settle things the tribal way.\u201d \nStories about the impunity of the sardars are legion. One allegedly had several women working in his family home killed after he found they had stolen some gold. Another story goes that one time the police tried to apprehend a line of non-duty paid cars on the highway but had to watch helplessly as the convoy disappeared into the residence of a tribal chief. Some of the younger generation is also accused of a gamut of crimes, including rape, abduction and murder. None of this has ever made it into the news. \u201cThose who could write about it are all like us, with no power or money. If we wrote about these things, our bodies would be found the next day,\u201d said a reporter. \nBack in Quetta, the Online International News Network\u2019s office seems to wear its bloody past with defiance. The walls in the bureau chief\u2019s office are painted red, and the bullet holes in the wall behind his desk have not been plastered over. This was where Irshad Mastoi, when he was the bureau chief, used to sit and where he was shot dead on Aug 28, 2014. Ghulam Rasool Khajjak, a trainee reporter working in the same room was also gunned down in the attack, as was their accountant, Mohammed Younus.\nA little over a year later, then interior minister Sarfaraz Bugti called a press conference to announce the arrest of two suspected BLA militants for the crime. Their video confession was played on the occasion. Some of Irshad\u2019s colleagues asked the minister to arrange a meeting with the accused so they could gauge the veracity of the claim. But a few weeks later, the men were killed in what was claimed as a police encounter, leaving Irshad\u2019s family and friends with deep misgivings to whether the real killers had been caught at all.\nThey wondered whether Irshad\u2019s conversations with separatist commanders were a factor in his murder. Baloch militant groups would almost invariably contact Online News when they wanted to claim an operation, possibly because giving a statement to a news agency meant wider dissemination. In November 2015, Afzal Mughal, the current bureau chief was also picked up in the middle of the night by the agencies. He was released after over 12 hours of detention.\n\u201cThey call everyone from time to time to tell us about national interest,\u201d another journalist told Dawn. \u201cOnce a [Balochistan Liberation Front] commander contacted me via satellite phone to issue a statement. \u2026Soon a [Military Intelligence] colonel called me from an unknown number to ask for that commander\u2019s number. I stalled him by saying I\u2019d have to speak with my editor first. I was worried that if I gave the number, [the security forces] would trace and kill him, and then I\u2019d be in trouble with the militants. Luckily, he didn\u2019t ring back.\u201d This is the kind of minefield that journalists in Balochistan have had to walk for years.\nIn one way, however, the situation has improved. Whether insurgents or violent extremists, lawless elements no longer need to threaten journalists to disseminate their message; they can do that themselves on social media. \nBut even the fact that the threat to life has somewhat reduced in recent years means little in an environment where journalism remains devoid of vitality. Everyone in the province knows where the many red lines are, and they are careful not to cross them. \nMore details and visuals can be accessed on dawn.com\n"

But according to Mr Qureshi, the two sides merely agreed that political parties should endeavour to follow the path which is in the public interest and in line with the Constitution.\nHe said it was also agreed that the talks should not be used as a delaying tactic. The PTI leader also spoke about the need to work out an implementation mechanism.\nInitially, Mr Qureshi said, PTI wanted elections to the Punjab and KP assemblies within 90 days, as per the Constitution, while the government wanted elections to all assemblies on a single day following the expiry of the National Assembly\u2019s term in August.\nHe said that during the talks, both sides tried to come closer to each other\u2019s positions. Outlining his party\u2019s viewpoint, he said the National Assembly and provincial assemblies of Sindh and Balochistan should be dissolved before May 14, to be followed by elections.\nHe said the PTI was ready to go to the National Assembly to give constitutional cover to the delayed elections, adding that they sought a written agreement with the government, which could be presented before the Supreme Court to ensure its implementation.\nWhile there was no official word on when a next round of talks would be held, sources said the two sides had exchanged fresh sets of proposals.\nAs per the sources, PTI now wants elections somewhere in mid-August.\nShortly before the third round of talks concluded, Mr Gilani and Railways Minister Khawaja Saad Rafique came out of the committee room where the dialogue is being held, ostensibly to establish telephonic contact with the party leadership to seek fresh instructions.\nShortly afterwards, the PTI team also came out for consultation over the government\u2019s proposals regarding an election date.\nWhen the two teams met again after consulting their respective leaderships, they exchanged written proposals once again.\nThe first round of the talks was held on April 27, hours after Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani wrote separate letters to Leader of the House Ishaq Dar and Leader of Opposition Dr Shahzad Waseem, asking them to nominate members from both the treasury and opposition benches for a special committee to initiate talks.\nThe third round came after a four-day interval; the previous round of talks was held on Friday. During this time, PTI ally and former Punjab chief minister Pervaz Elahi\u2019s home was raided, which the PTI termed an effort to sabotage talks. However, they resolved to stay on the table despite such spoilers.\nIn addition, cabinet ministers such as Javed Latif and Khawaja Asif also openly opposed the dialogue with PTI, prompting the opposition party to seek clarification from the government.\n"

            "Text": "\u2022 Asif demands review of all controversial court decisions since 1947\n\u2022 PAC chief seeks details of judges\u2019 expenses, vows to summon court officials\n\u2022 Body to probe audio leak featuring ex-CJP\u2019s son\nISLAMABAD: The ongoing executive-judiciary standoff took a fresh turn on Tuesday when angry treasury and opposition members advised the National Assembly speaker not to comply with the Supreme Court\u2019s latest directive, seeking the record of parliamentary proceedings regarding a law aimed at clipping some powers of the chief justice of Pakistan (CJP), saying they were ready to face all possible consequences of this \u2018disobedience\u2019.\n\u201cEnough is enough. If they want a war, then there will be a war. The parliament will not surrender,\u201d Khawaja Asif said, and also for constituting a special parliamentary committee to examine and review all controversial decisions taken by the apex court since 1947.\nLater, in an apparent tit-for-tat move, the National Assembly approved a motion authorising the speaker to constitute a committee to probe the alleged leak of a conversation between a Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leader and the son of former CJP Saqib Nisar, where the latter purportedly demanded Rs12 million for a party ticket in the Punjab Assembly elections.\nThe motion was moved by Shahida Akhtar Ali of the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) after a number of lawmakers mentioned the latest audio leak in their speeches and called for action against those who had been \u201cfacilitating\u201d PTI chief Imran Khan.\nAt the outset of the first NA sitting after Eid holidays, PML-N stalwart and Defence Minister Khawaja Asif lashed out at the judiciary for summoning the record of assembly proceedings, saying that parliamentary proceedings were open to the public and even telecast live.\nHe asked the speaker to write a letter to the CJP, asking him to provide the court\u2019s proceedings of the hearing of the case regarding the law that had been passed by the parliament.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe defence minister said parliament was ready to provide a record of its proceedings, but on the condition that the apex court should also provide a record of its own proceedings and tell the nation how those judges, who had earlier recused themselves from hearing the case, were later included in the bench.\nMr Asif said the court was asking politicians to hold negotiations, whereas 15 judges were unable to sit together. He said the PTI had come to the power in 2018 with the help of \u201cfacilitators\u201d, alleging that this facilitation was still available to the party.\nReferring to the execution of former prime minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and the disqualification of Yousuf Raza Gilani and Nawaz Sharif by the courts, the minister said the time had come for them to \u201cprotect\u201d their prime ministers, irrespective of their political affiliation.\nHe asked the speaker to form a special committee to examine the martyrdom of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and disqualification of elected prime ministers, he added. He declared that the parliament, being the supreme institution and defender of the Constitution, would not \u201callow any extra-constitutional move, and surrender its supremacy and authority.\u201d\nThe minister said a lawmaker received salary of Rs168,000 and always faced accountability whereas the judges were receiving big salaries, besides huge perks and privileges and even lifetime pensions, but who would make them accountable, recalling that perhaps only two judges had faced disqualification in the country\u2019s judicial history.\nPTI dissident and Public Accounts Committee (PAC) Chairman Noor Alam Khan read out articles 66 and 69 of the Constitution and asked the speaker not to provide any record of house proceedings to the court.\nHe said that not only members of parliament, but even secretariat staff could not be summoned by any court with regard to parliamentary proceedings.\nArticle 66(1) states: \u201cno member shall be liable to any proceedings in any court in respect of anything said or any vote given by him in Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament)], and no person shall be so liable in respect of the publication by or under the authority of Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament)] of any report, paper, votes or proceedings.\u201d\nArticle 69(2) says: \u201cNo officer or member of Majlis-i-Shoora (Parliament) in whom powers are vested by or under the Constitution for regulating procedure or the conduct of business, or for maintaining order in Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament), shall be subject to the jurisdiction of any court in respect of the exercise by him of those powers.\u201d\n\u201cYes, we will provide you the record of the proceedings, but only when you give us your own proceedings as to what is happening in the SC? How much money do you spend? How many bullet-proof cars do you have? And how many plots you have obtained?\u201d said Mr Khan, regretting that the SC had previously stopped its registrar from appearing before the PAC in violation of the Constitution.\n\u201cI am calling the principal accounting officer of the Supreme Court to come to parliament and answer the questions of the honourable members\u2026 If he doesn\u2019t come, then I tell you that I will issue his arrest warrants and I want the whole parliament to stand with me,\u201d Mr Khan claimed amid desk-thumping by the members.\nThese views were supported by other MNAs, including independent Aslam Bhootani, PPP\u2019s Shazia Marri and even the JI lawmaker.\nMeanwhile, the speaker rescheduled the May 15 joint sitting of the parliament to be held on Thursday, while the NA will meet today (Wednesday).\n"

            "Text": "LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Tuesday directed former prime minister Imran Khan to join investigation being carried out by police into cases against him.\nThe PTI chief reached the court along with his counsel amid strict security as a larger bench, headed by Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, resumed hearing on his petition challenging the registration of as many as 121 cases against him.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nJustice Aalia Neelum, Justice Tariq Saleem Sheikh, Justice Anwarul Haq Pannun and Justice Muhammad Amjad Rafiq were other members of the bench.\nAt the outset, Justice Najafi told Barrister Salman Safdar, the counsel for Imran Khan, the petition was well drafted but legal points were not easy to be found due to the details about the petitioner and his government.\nWhen Justice Neelum asked whether the petitioner was nominated in all the FIRs, the counsel said he would take 15 minutes to present the whole case record before the bench. He said politically motivated cases had been registered against the petitioner by police at the behest of the government.\nThe counsel said it was a matter of a 71-year-old citizen who appears before courts to seek bail every other day, which is not humanly possible.\nJustice Najafi asked the counsel to present legal points if he wanted to get the cases quashed.\nBarrister Safdar said as many as 140 cases had been registered against the former prime minister since the Wazirabad attack on him. He said police themselves became complainants these cases. He said many cases had been discharged by the courts which established the mala fide of the government and police.\nThe counsel pointed out that police had registered a case against 2,500 persons and only Imran Khan obtained a pre-arrest bail in it.\nJustice Najafi reminded the counsel that the points raised by him were supposed to be decided by trial courts. \u201cWhy do you want to bypass the legal process?\u201d the judge asked the counsel.\nTo a court\u2019s query, the counsel said the petitioner had secured pre-arrest bails in 25 cases.\nJustice Pannun asked the counsel to say clearly as to what relief he wanted from the court.\nJustice Neelum observed that the service of a court summons was not facilitated by the petitioner and the police lodged another case. She asked the counsel whether a police officer was not injured when the security personnel visited the petitioner\u2019s Zaman Park residence to serve the summons.\nThe counsel expressed his inability to confirm it.\nThe judge observed that the alleged incident needed to be investigated and the petitioner should let the police complete their probe.\nBarrister Safdar argued that the petitioner had not been provided with entitled security being a former prime minister.\nTo an observation by Justice Najafi, the counsel admitted that no new FIR had been registered against the petitioner since the larger bench had taken up the matter.\nExtraordinary relief\nOpposing the petition, an additional advocate general argued that the petitioner was asking for an extraordinary relief from the court by claiming that he was a former premier and won a cricket world cup.\nJustice Pannun asked the law officer how many times 150 cases were registered against an individual since the creation of Pakistan.\nThe law officer, however, said the petitioner had not joined the investigation in any of the cases against him.\nJustice Neelum observed that the pre-arrest bail was granted on assurance of joining police investigation. She noted that the petitioner previously alleged a police operation during Eid holidays but nothing happened.\nImran Khan\u2019s counsel assured the bench that the petitioner was ready to join the investigation into all cases.\nThird assassination attempt\nWith court\u2019s permission, the PTI chief also spoke and alleged that a third assassination attempt was being hatched against him. He said he survived two attempts on his life, one in Wazirabad and another at Islamabad Judicial Complex, where the intelligence apparatus had taken charge of the building a night before the hearing.\n \n \n\nMr Khan said his life was in danger and frequent appearances before courts will expose him more to danger. Without naming anyone, he said they wanted to eliminate him.\nJustice Najafi told the ex-PM that he should have trust in the court and directed him to join the investigation and sought a report from the government on May 8.\n"

He noted that a demand for constituting a full court had also been put forth during the hearing of the case concerning holding elections in the country.\nCJP observed that it was an embarrassing situation for the court since the demand was then made that certain judges shouldn\u2019t sit on the bench.\nEach judge has his standing and their orders should be respected, obeyed and implemented by each institution, the CJP emphasised.\nHowever, the CJP put the request for a full court aside, observing that it will be considered again during the next hearing.\nInnocent until proven guilty\nThe bench also ignored a request made by PBC Executive Committee Chairman Hassan Raza Pasha to consider excluding at least one of the bench members \u2014 Justice Mazahar Ali Naqvi \u2014 against whom misconduct complaints have been filed.\nNearly half a dozen complaints have been filed with the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) accusing Justice Naqvi of misconduct and accumulating assets beyond means.\nUnmoved by the request, the CJP defended his fellow\u2019s presence on the bench and stated that the power to include or exclude judges from the bench was vested with him under the rules.\nCJP Bandial then referred to a 2010 case in which the apex court ruled that the mere filing of a reference by the president against a judge didn\u2019t impair their working unless an adverse opinion or recommendation was issued by the SJC against the said judge.\n\u201cThis has been a practice for the last many years,\u201d CJP observed, adding there were many judges against whom complaints were filed before the SJC.\nDescribing the Supreme Court (Practice & Procedure) Bill, 2023 as a \u2018first of its kind\u2019 law concerning the third pillar of the state, the chief justice wondered could independence of the judiciary being part of the salient features of the constitution ever be modified, changed or altered.\nThe CJP also mentioned Entry 55 from the Federal Legislative List, which outlined the scope of the jurisdiction and powers of the Supreme Court.\nThe list is a compilation of subjects over which the Centre has exclusive power to make laws, like maintaining the army, foreign policy, citizenship, etc.\nThe CJP observed that provision 55 of the list imposed certain limitations regarding legislation against the top court. AGP Mansoor Usman Awan also requested the court to reconsider its last order staying the bill\u2019s implementation since it provided legal recourse of appeal and review, but the court didn\u2019t entertain the AGP\u2019s plea and maintained its April 13 decision to suspend the law. Further proceedings were postponed till May 8.\nThe bench directed the PBC, Supreme Court Bar Association, PML-N, PPP, PTI and other parties to furnish concise statements at the next hearing.\nMeanwhile, Information Minis\u00ad\u00adter Marriyum Aurangzeb has defended the legislation.\nIn a statement, she said the bill has amended Article 184(3) and introduced a transparent and fair system to regulate the chief justice\u2019s powers. \u201cIt is the right of the judiciary to interpret the Constitution but not rewrite it or impose restrictions on the legislative power of the Parliament,\u201d the minister said.\n"

            "Text": "RAWALPINDI/TAXILA: An outbreak of measles wreaking havoc in Rawalpindi district has raised questions on the performance of the District Health Authority and district administration regarding the vaccination campaigns.\nAs many as 256 children have contracted measles in the district from January to April while eight children succumbed to the disease due to measles in three government-run hospitals during the last month.\nAccording to the District Health Authority, 142 children were suffering from measles in Rawal Town\u2019s 46 union councils and 24 in Taxila, while the remaining children contracted the virus in the other five tehsils of the district and cantonment areas. \nAs many as 30 children are admitted to various government hospitals in the garrison city.\n\nOver 160 cases of viral infection reported in Rawalpindi district; child dies in Taxila\n\nThe Punjab Primary and Secondary Healthcare Department took serious notice of the issue and asked the district authorities to take preventive measures to avoid the spread of the virus. The anti-measles vaccine is necessary to protect infected children from pneumonia, malnutrition and brain diseases.\nA senior official of the health department said that after the outbreak of measles in the district, the department started the inquiry led by Dr Waseem Ahmed, additional director of the Expanded Programme of Immunisation (EPI), but the inquiry report has not been completed.\nHe said that it was the responsibility of the district health authority to make a proper plan in October and November and utilise all the vaccinators who were hired to do the job.\nHe said that the anti-polio campaign was to be utilised to carry out vaccination for measles as well but the health authority did not use this campaign for measles. \u201cIn door-to-door campaigns, vaccinators can check the vaccination card of the children less than five years but they did not do this,\u201d he said.\nWhen contacted, District Health Officer Dr Ehsan Ghani said that measles was under control now as the health authority started taking preventive measures and kicked off a campaign in the affected areas of Rawalpindi district\u2019s Rawal Town, cantonment and Taxila.\nHe said most children less than nine months contracted the virus. \u201cThe vaccination starts with a nine-month-old baby, and the booster shot is given to less than five years old children,\u201d he said.\nTo a question about how babies contracted the virus, Dr Ghani said the virus was active in the district and mostly unvaccinated children contracted the virus.\n\u201cPeople coming from other districts especially Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were responsible for transmitting the virus as the children were not vaccinated,\u201d he alleged.\nIn Taxila, the local administration and health authorities are on their toes as measles has broken out in various rural and urban areas of Taxila and Wah.\nAccording to officials, one child died due to the virus while 20 more confirmed cases have emerged.\nBesides this, more than 60 suspected cases were reported in various localities of Taxila and Wah.\nSources said in Sarai Kala, a child identified as Shafiullah succumbed to the disease while at least 12 children were reported measles-positive.\nResidents of the Sarai Kala, Pind Gondal, Jameelabad, Mashraqiabad, and Ahmednagar questioned the activities of the anti-measles teams in this area and called upon the authorities to carry out an audit of these teams as due to their alleged negligence the children were affected. \u201cWith just a little rise in temperature, a variety of contagious diseases has started affecting children; what would happen when the temperature would peak during June and July,\u201d asked Munaza Peerzada.\nDistrict Surveillance Officer Dr Muhammad Ali said that the outbreak was reported to the concerned authorities for launching booster doses among children, aged between six months and five years.\nWhen contacted, Deputy District Officer (Health) Dr Shahzad Hassan confirmed the outbreak of measles in the rural and urban localities of the area. Responding to a question, he said that from January 2023 till now, 20 confirmed and more than 60 suspected measles cases are reported in the area.\nTaxila AC Salman Akbar Warraich claimed that the overall situation was under control and local administration with the assistance of health authorities was taking all possible measures to prevent the spread of the disease.\n"

He reprimanded examination staff in Government High School Mangwal for non-compliance with standard operating procedures (SOPs) and poor performance. \nThe controller examination conducted raids on various examination centres. He visited Government High School Anjra and caught another candidate cheating. He also suspended supervisor of the centre at Government High School Jaffar for suspected working in the centre.\nMr Khan said that students were the architects of the future, therefore every possible effort should be made to ensure the conduct of fair and transparent examinations for honest evaluation and assessment of their hard work and skills.\nIn this regard, he expressed concern over the increasing trend of copying. \nThe lack of competence and skills in today\u2019s society is due to cheating in examination, he said and added that this is the reason why the majority of apparently educated people today do not meet the criteria of ability and competence.\nHe said that it was the duty of teachers and parents to play their role towards making the new generation honest and tell them not to cheat as this would not help them in their practical lives.\n\u201cThere is a dire need to rid the society of this scourge.

Road in a residential area of Hassanabdal affected scores of people and left a number of people, mostly children, hospitalised, rescue officials said on Tuesday.\nAccording to residents, the leakage of ammonia gas created panic in the area and forced a number of people to leave their homes to avoid the impact of the toxic gas.\nThey said since a nearby school was closed due to examinations, a major disaster was averted.\nMohammad Imran, a resident of the area, told Dawn that employees of the factory \u201cillegally operating in the compound\u201d escaped when the ammonia gas started leaking. Mr Imran claimed it was a rescue team that responded to the emergency and managed to control the leakage.\n\nAt least one dozen manufacturing units operating in residential areas\n\nAs per reports, the workers were on routine duty when suddenly the gas started leaking due to \u201cdefective and substandard\u201d gas cylinders. Attock District Emergency Officer Ali Hasnain said that following the incident, the rescue officials entered the factory and controlled the leak by shutting off the main valve of the gas cylinder.\nHe said that liquid ammonia is used as a refrigerant in ice plants as it takes a lot of energy from the surroundings to vaporise.\n\u201cExposure to high concentrations of ammonia in air causes immediate burning of the eyes, nose, throat and respiratory tract and can also result in blindness, lung damage or even death in severe cases. Inhalation of lower concentrations can cause coughing, and nose and throat irritation,\u201d Mr Hasnain said.\nProtest against factory\nFollowing the gas leakage incident, the locals held a protest against the administration and the factory owners.\nTalking to mediapersons, they said that despite repeated written complaints, the administration was reluctant to take action and demanded the immediate shutting down of the units running in the residential area.\nA resident, Tahir Durrani, said such manufacturing units should not be allowed to work in residential areas as they might prove fatal for inhabitants.\nAn official of the local administration said gas leaked from an old cylinder kept in the warehouse of the factory.\nMohammad Nawaz, Attock\u2019s bomb disposal commander, said the bomb disposal squad visited the premises as well, adding that the gas leaked due to possible negligence of the employees or substandard gas cylinders.\nAccording to sources, almost a dozen manufacturing units, most of them unregistered, were operating in the residential areas by violating all the standard operating procedures (SOPs) and security measures with the connivance of local administration, including the Civil Defence and environment department.\nThey said the gas leakage incidents often happened due to substandard material and added the environment department was responsible for checking the licences and the condition of the units, while the Civil Defence was responsible for the supervision of the security measures taken by these units.\nThey added all manufacturing units running in the city were not only unregistered but also violating SOPs.\nWhen contacted, Assistant Commissioner Dr Sana Ramchand said that soon after the incident, the local administration swung into action and took steps to control the situation.\nShe said the premises were sealed for illegal activity and a report was sought from the environmental department to take legal action against the owner of the manufacturing unit over negligence.\nDr Ramchand said such manufacturing units would not be allowed to operate in the residential area and violators would be dealt with iron hands.\n"

The youth was also banished from the village for three months. \nThe jirga, held in Darri Sundrani village of Kandhkot-Kashmore district on Monday evening, heard arguments of representatives from the two sides and issued its decree.   \nThe matter had caused an unending hostility between the two sides before it was finally taken to the jirga.\nAccepting the decree, the Saifullah Balkani side deposited part of the fine amount (Rs100,000) on the spot and undertook to pay off the remaining amount within the next three months.\nTrader robbed of Rs1m\nLeaders of various associations of traders held a protest along with residents of Khairpur on Tuesday after armed suspects robbed a prominent businessman, Shankar Lal, who is also a leader of Pakistan Peoples Party\u2019s minority wing in the district. \nShankar Lal told the area police that the robbers struck at his seed and fertiliser outlet, located in Khairpur along the old National Highway and snatched around Rs1 million, mobile phones and some costly items from him and his son.\nSoon after the robbery, a large number of shopkeepers led by Anjuman Tajiran-i-Khairpur president Lala Abdul Ghaffar Sheikh, Abu Abdul Atif Sheikh, Altaf Memon, Garmuk Muk Makija, Kamlesh Kumar, Mir Ashiq Talpur and other traders took to the streets of Khairpur and blocked the highway. \nThey deplored that the personnel present at the nearby police post did not take any action to foil the robbery giving the culprits to escape easily.\nThey urged the Khairpur SSP to ensure arrest of the culprits within the next 24 hours and recover the booty from them. In case of police failure, the protest would be extended, they warned.\n"

It remains the top cause of death and disabilities in the country.  \nPrior to the Covid-19 pandemic and the 2022 floods, the report points out, an estimated 75 per cent of Pakistani children were in \u2018learning poverty\u2019, unable to read and understand a simple age-appropriate story by age 10.  \n\u201cImagine the trajectory from birth to adulthood of a child born in Pakistan today. There is a risk that the child may not survive to her fifth birthday. Even if she does reach school age, there is a further risk that she does not start school, let alone complete the full cycle of pre-primary, primary, and secondary education that is the norm in more advanced countries.  \n\u201cThe time she does spend in school may translate unevenly into learning. When she reaches age 18, she carries with her lasting effects of poor nutrition and health in childhood that limit her physical and cognitive abilities as an adult,\u201d the report says.   \nPoor HC outcomes \nThe Pakistan\u2019s Human Capital Index (HCI), according to the report, value of 0.41 is low in both absolute and relative terms.  \nIt is lower than the South Asia average of 0.48, with Bangladesh at 0.46 and Nepal at 0.49.  \nPakistan\u2019s human capital outcomes are more comparable to those in Sub-Saharan Africa, which has an average HCI value of 0.40.  \n\u201cDespite favourable demographic tailwinds, Pakistan is currently unable to reap its rightful dividends due to inadequate investments in education, health, social protection, and the labour force.  \n\u201cIts public investment of about 2.5 per cent of GDP in education and 0.9 per cent on health is much lower than the global average and the average for similar economies. Pakistan spends about 0.6 per cent of GDP on social safety nets, compared with the global average of 1.5 percent.\u201d  \nThe report also highlights the large disparities across socioeconomic and geographic groups. Provincial inequalities, it says, are wide on the HCI and its components, notably for stunting and expected years of schooling.  \n\u201cIn schooling, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab are at the expected level for Pakistan\u2019s economic development, with the average child growing up with at least 9 years of formal schooling \u2014 though when adjusted for quality, this is equivalent to only 5.1 years.\u201d \nSindh and Balochistan, the report says, are at much lower levels, with the average child growing up with around 7.7 and 5.4 years of schooling, respectively.  \n\u201cWith only 89 per cent of children surviving until their fifth birthday, Balochistan is at the very bottom \u2014 globally. The trajectory of child development and human capital accumulation for children born in Balochistan and Sindh is further undermined by the fact that almost half of the children under five in the two provinces are stunted.  \n\u201cEven in Punjab, where stunting is the lowest among the provinces, one-third of children are stunted.\u201d  \nLow female labour force participation \nAccording to the report, the strongest driver of low human capital utilisation in Pakistan is low female labour force participation rate \u2014 23 per cent in 2018. Having more than three in every four women outside the labour force underscores the need to make better use of the human capital that Pakistan generates now and in the future.  \n\u201cIf existing trends continue, it (Pakistan) will miss out on the associated economic development possible from a potential demographic dividend in the future as well,\u201d the report says.  \nDuring the launch, the chief minister spoke about how the government responded to the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic and the devastating floods of 2022, which had increased poverty levels from 30 to over 40 per cent in the province.  \nThe chief minister also shared progress of different projects, including the $110m WB-assisted Sindh Water & Agriculture Transformation Project.  \nEarlier, Vice President for Human Development at WB Mamta Murthi along with her delegation met the chief minister.\n"

He viewed the Punjab and KP assemblies were dissolved under Article 112 and those who were not conducting the polls within 90 days were violating the Constitution.\nHe also questioned the tabling of the resolution regarding the completion of the provincial assembly. \u201cIt seemed that the purpose of bringing the resolution in the Sindh Assembly today is that the judiciary does not take any decision,\u201d he remarked.\nArif Mustafa Jatoi of the GDA supported the resolution, but said that there was history of dissolution of assemblies before completion of their respective tenures.\nMover of the resolution Burhan Chandio criticised the PTI leadership and said that the country was facing the devastation of floods and the PTI chief was demanding for early elections.\nShaharyar Mahar of the GDA said that his party supported the spirit of the resolution although they had reservations over the PPP\u2019s \u2018selectiveness\u2019.\nSyed Abdul Rasheed of the MMA, PPP members Sharmila Farooqui, Imdad Pitafi and Raja Razzaq; PTI\u2019s Khurram Sher Zaman and MQM-P\u2019s Rashid Khilji and Sadaqat Hussain also spoke.\nEarlier, before the commencement of the session, the PTI members present in the house protested over the delay in proceedings. They gathered before the rostrum of the speaker and chanted slogan.\nThe sitting was adjourned to Friday.\n"

            "Text": "HYDERABAD: Qaumi Awami Tehreek president Ayaz Latif Palijo has termed selection of only six urban districts for extension in census deadline \u2018discriminatory\u2019 saying it reflects policymakers\u2019 bias towards rural Sindh where aborigines reside for centuries. \nPalijo said in a letter addressed to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Federal Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal on Tuesday that the selective extension was a mean attempt to divide people of Sindh. The days of \u2018divide and rule\u2019 were gone and entire Sindh stood united against such injustice, he said.  \nHe called for complete scrapping of the census exercise since it was based on discrimination and was part of an anti-Sindh plan to undercount actual population of the province in general and in rural areas in particular.  \nHe urged the premier and the federal minister to scrap ongoing census exercise since it was based on dishonesty and discrimination and reminded them that although international norms and the country\u2019s constitution required that census be held every 10 years but this one was being conducted only after five years under the influence of some ethnic groups.  \n\nComplains of discrimination between urban, rural population in letter to PM\n\nHe said that people of Sindh would not remain silent if injustice was meted out to the province. The QAT and other political parties of Sindh had been warning since January this year that they would reject the census results if their reservations were not addressed, he said. \nHe said that a 12 member-advisory committee formed to finalise a working paper for holding of census exercise did not have a single demographer from Sindh. The census, he said, was a subject that fell under the purview of Council of Common Interests (CCI) but all decisions on its conduct were taken by a coterie of anti-Sindh individuals, who had made Census 2017 and 2023 controversial and unacceptable, he said. \nPalijo said that highly inaccurate and moth-eaten block maps were fed into tablets used in the much trumpeted digital census and thousands of villages of Sukkur, Larkana, Mirpurkhas, Benazirbad and Hyderabad divisions and over 20 million people living in riverine areas, Kohistan, Thar, Nara, Achro Thar, coastal belt and Kachho were left out of the count. \nHe said that it was a shame that even British colonial rulers who used only pencils and paper in their census had not done such injustice to Sindh as the technologically advanced federal government had done. Other countries completed counting within a single day while this census was lingering on for two months, he said. \nHe said that Rs35bn spent on this exercise had gone down the drain because not only the methodology but the very intent was foul. Therefore, he said, no extension in census date could undo the damage done to Sindh.  \nGovt urged to take back hike in life-saving drugs\u2019 prices \nPalijo demanded in a statement issued here on Tuesday immediate withdrawal of recent raise in the prices of life-saving drugs and said it was tantamount to depriving the poor of their right to life.  \nHe said that rulers were in fact making death cheaper than life. The insensitive government did not have anything for labourers, peasants and the poor and their life did not matter to them because they saw people as only their \u2018voting machines\u2019.  \nHe said that privileged class easily proceeded to London, Dubai and America for treatment and that was why public healthcare sector had been left in a shambles. \nThe government must put an end to anti-people steps and take back raise in the prices of life-saving drugs, he said.  \nHe said that on the one hand people did not have quality healthcare facilities while on the other medicines\u2019 prices were being raised, which were already pretty beyond their reach.  \nHe said that healthcare facilities, if any, were available only to rulers, capitalists, jagirdars and the affluent, leaving only a faulty, malfunctioning health system for the poor.  \nHe said that PML-N, PPP, JUI-F and MQM would not be allowed to play with integrity of Sindh through digital census. These parties might do anything for their lust for power but they should leave Sindh alone, he said, adding real change could be brought about with change in system and not change of faces.  \nPalijo said that rich, capitalists, rulers and jagirdars had handed over the country to international imperialist forces for their petty gains. Pakistan faced a crisis and it required a national government to settle down things, he said.\n"

            "Text": "SAHIWAL: Three workers of a cold storage fainted while many people in the surroundings suffered breathing problems and eye rashes after the leakage of ammonia gas from the unit located on the Madhali Road on Tuesday. \nThe residents of private residential colonies like Rafi Garden and Al-Razaq Villas complained of breathing problems while they had cough, eye burning problems and throat irritation. \nThe gas leakage reportedly created panic in the area and forced a number of people to escape to other areas in a bid to avoid the bad effects of gas. The locals thought it was the effect of some spray being done on the crops in the nearby fields. Later, it was declared that a pipe of ammonia gas broke in the Green Cold Storage.   \nRescuers 1122 received three emergency calls from the people as well as the cold storage unit premises. The rescuers reported that none of the citizens fainted but factory sources informed the media that three cold storage employees who tried to repair the pipe had lost consciousness. However, they recovered on receiving first aid on the site.  \nEhtasham, a resident of the Rafi Garden, said a sharp stinking smell had spread in the whole colony. The first team that responded to the situation was Rescue 1122 while none from the civil defense or Environmental Protection Department reached there. \nThe rescuers said it took 40 minutes for the cold storage mechanic to fix the leakage by replacing the rusty iron pipe.  \nTTP MAN HELD: The Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) arrested an alleged militant of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) on Tuesday, recovering hand grenades and explosives from him. \nCTD officials claimed the suspected militant was arrested in an operation conducted in the jungle on the south side of the Pakpattan Canal on the basis of some clues.  \nThey said two hand grenades, three detonators and explosive material was also recovered from the suspect.  \nThey said the suspect was identified as Amaad Ali Pathan, a resident of Islamabad. \nAfter registration of a case, the suspect was shifted to an undisclosed location for investigation.\n"

They also visited the fields to assess the performance of soybean accessions grown in collaboration with UAF.  \nThe professors from the Chinese University of Hong Kong expressed hope that their germplasm will be of great value in establishing the soybean crop in the country.  \nProf Dr Khan stated that these efforts will be a step forward in reducing soybean imports and will serve as a significant milestone in making the country self-sufficient in soybean production.\nSELF-IMMOLATE: A grade eight student of a private school in Ghulam Muhammadabad area of Faisalabad attempted to self-immolate on Tuesday after being prohibited by his father from using or having a mobile phone.\nAccording to the Razaabad police in Faisalabad, 13-year-old Zainul Abideen went to school after his father, Sajjad Ahmad, took his mobile phone and gave him some money to fill the petrol tank in his motorcycle.\nAccording to his teachers and classmates, he left school after a few minutes, and at a deserted place near Chak 219-RB, he sprayed petrol on his clothes and set himself on fire.\nSome passersby tried to extinguish the fire, but a major portion of his body had already been burnt. Rescue 1122 shifted him to the burn unit at the Allied Hospital, where his condition was reported to be serious.\nGCUF: Teachers from the Government College University, Faisalabad, (GCUF) staged a protest demonstration in front of the university registrar\u2019s office against the non-payment of disparity reduction allowance (DRA) to them.\nOffice bearers of the Academic Staff Association announced their boycott of the upcoming Punjab assembly election duties as a form of protest. They informed reporters that, according to the decision of the Punjab government, all employees of different departments were being paid a 15 per cent DRA along with their salaries. However, university teachers and other employees were being deprived of this allowance, as the Higher Education Commission has deemed the university an autonomous institution.  \nThey stated that the district election commissioner had announced the election duty training schedule for them, but they would not attend the training until their demand to approve a 15 per cent DRA for all GCUF teachers and employees is met.\nSEMINAR: A one-day international seminar was organised by the Directorate of International Linkages of the GCUF on Tuesday.  \nThe seminar aimed to raise awareness among students about the benefits of using biological materials and making them reusable.  \nProf Dr Amanullah from the Canadian University of Alberta delivered a lecture on biological materials obtained from renewable resources.  \nThe Director of International Linkages, Prof Dr Shahzad Ali Shahid Chattha, presented a report on the performance of the directorate to the seminar participants. \nHe also provided information about the agreements with international universities, as well as the academic activities and scholarships associated with them.  \nRegistrar Pro Dr Hidayat Rasool, Prof Dr Farhat Jabeen, and other department heads participated in the seminar. The seminar also discussed various educational activities and employment opportunities in Canada for Pakistani students and teachers.\nFIRE: After a strenuous effort, firefighters managed to extinguish a fire that broke out in a restaurant, located on Canal Road near the Chak 204-RB bridge in Faisalabad.  \nThey prevented the fire from spreading to the adjacent filling station.  \nThe kitchen, electronics and parts of the building were damaged in the restaurant.  \nAccording to a report from Rescue 1122, the fire was caused by a gas leak in the kitchen.\n"

They told the bench that the police first attacked the house of the petitioner and later registered a case on terrorism charges against him and others. They said an ACE team came to arrest the petitioner despite him being on protective bail. \nThe bench, headed by Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, allowed the protective bail to Parvez Elahi till May 4 and directed him to approach the court concerned before the next hearing. \n\nTurns down request to bar ACE, police from action\n\nLater, a single bench, comprising Justice Asjad Javed Ghural, also granted protective bail to the former CM in the graft case by the ACE till May 15. \nOn a separate petition by Parvez Elahi\u2019s son Rasikh Elahi, Justice Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar directed the ACE director general and the Punjab police to submit reports about the cases and the raid at the petitioner\u2019s house for the arrest of his father. \nHowever, the judge turned down a request of the petitioner to restrain the police and the ACE from registering any new case against the former CM and arresting him before the submission of the detailed report summoned by the court. \nJustice Dogar asked the petitioner\u2019s counsel as to how the court could restrain the respondents from the arrest. \n\u201cHow can this court believe your version without seeing the reports of the respondents?\u201d the judge asked the counsel. \nThe counsel said last night another raid was conducted at the Gujrat residence of the PTI president. \nThe judge directed the ACE and the police to submit their reports by the next hearing. \nPreviously, the LHC, on April 28, had granted interim protective bail till May 6 to Parvez Elahi in the case of alleged corruption registered by the Gujranwala office of the ACE. \nThe same night, the police and the ACE launched an operation at the Gulberg house of Elahi to make his arrest. The operation lasted for eight hours without any success. \nParvez, Wajahat residences raided\nA joint team of Gujrat police and the Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) conducted raids at the Kunjah House and Nutt House \u2013 residences of former chief minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi and former federal minister Chaudhry Wajahat Hussain \u2013 late on Monday. \nThis was the fourth raid by the law enforcement agencies on the residence of former chief minister and his son MNA Moonis Elahi during the last couple of months. No arrest could be made in these raids. \nHowever, the residence of Wajahat Hussain (Nutt House) was raided by the police for the first time. Some policemen also entered the premises of the residence by scaling its boundary wall but nobody was arrested. \nSources says the police also conducted raids on the houses of two supporters of the Chaudhrys, including Sheikh Shekaz Aslam in Kunjah town and another one near Mungowal, without making any arrest. \nMeanwhile, Chaudhry Wajahat and his son Musa Elahi could not appear in the court of Additional District and Sessions Judge Younis Laar on Tuesday. Their bail before arrest had been extended till May 2 on the previous date of hearing. \nThey had been booked by the Karianwala police station in two different cases of alleged life attempt and firing on the house of a former Hajiwala union council chairman Muhammad Ali Gujjar of the PML-N in February the last. \nTheir lawyers informed the court that Mr Wajahat and his son had tested positive for Covid-19 and could not appear in the court. \nThe judge then fixed May 12 as the next date of hearing in both the cases. \nStrict security arrangements had been made by police in and around the compound of the district courts during the hearing.\n"

The judges should give decisions without fear,\u201d the PTI leader said.\n\u201cIf people can\u2019t protect their constitution, we have no right to be called a nation. We are no different from Sudan and Afghanistan.\u201d\nLashing out at Maryam Nawaz, Mr Chaudhry said she had been railing against the chief justice, Justice Maza\u00adhir Naqvi and Justice Ijazul Ahsan because she wanted the bench to break up to \u201csave the Sharif and Zardari families\u201d.\nMr Chaudhry said Maryam Nawaz was feeling uneasy because her corruption cases would be restored automatically if NAB laws were reversed.\nThe PTI senior vice president revealed that Bushra Bibi had decided to lodge a criminal case against Ms Sharif for defamation as she had accused Bushra of taking bribes for getting documents signed by authorities when the party was in power. .\n\u201cShe (Bushra Bibi) never participated in any political activity. She used to visit panahgahs (shelters) only. Although the former first lady is an apolitical person. Maryam continues to hurl allegations against her,\u201d Fawad Chaudhry said.\nHe went on to claim that the PTI-led coalition was the only government in the country\u2019s history which was untainted by corruption.\nExpenditures\nSpeaking about expenditures incurred on former prime ministers\u2019 and presidents\u2019 security, camp offices and foreign tours, he alleged Shehbaz Sharif had outdone all by spending a whopping Rs 8.72 billion on foreign tours while Imran Khan spent the \u201cleast amount\u201d as premier \u2014 Rs 170 million.\n\u201cNawaz Sharif\u2019s expenditures were over Rs 4.31bn, Asif Ali Zardari\u2019s over Rs 3.16bn, Shahid Khaqan Abbasi (Rs  350m), Yousaf Raza Gilani (Rs 240m), Pervaiz Ashraf   (Rs 30m) and Mamnoon Hussain (Rs 300m).\u201d\nMr Chaudhry said the government had refused to disclose expenditures incurred on Foreign Mini\u00adster Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari\u2019s foreign tours.\nMr Chaudhry hailed the report by the US Commission for Religious Freedom for \u201cobserving that PM Shehbaz Sharif weaponised blasphemy laws\u201d to punish Imran Khan and members of his cabinet.\n\u201cThis indictment of the present government shows the world is now waking up to HR violations in Pakistan.\nA group of 100 congressmen will jointly ask the US State Department to take note of custodial torture and other HR violations in Pakistan.\u201c\n"

According to officials, flash floods were reported in seasonal streams and rivers in different Balochistan districts, including Chaman, Musakhail, Qila Abdullah, Qila Saifullah, Pishin, Muslim Bagh, Harnai, Kech and other areas.\nIn KP, bouts of rainfall and snow disrupted life and caused flooding in Peshawar; some parts of Hazara division including Musa-da-Mussala, Koh-i-Makra and Malka-i-Barbat; and Lower Dir. Meanwhile, the Met Office has predicted more rains and thunderstorms in different districts of Balochistan over the course of the next two days.\n"

Even some primary schools have more classrooms than our university,\u201d a faculty member told Dawn.\nHe said the enrolled students belonged to Darra Adamkhel, Waziristan, Hangu, Lakki Marwat, Bannu and other areas of the southern region of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\nThe teacher complained about the shortage of classrooms and said when a class was in progress, the students of another class waited outside.\nHe said as enough space wasn\u2019t available to hold classes, the precious time of the students, who showed up from far-off areas, went to waste.\n\u201cTeachers feel embarrassed when students wonder when the university buildings will be in place,\u201d he said.\nHe said in the morning, the university used 10 classrooms spared for it by the college, while all rooms got available in the later part of the day after the college students returned home.\nWhen contacted, Vice-Chancellor of the Fata University Mohammad Jahanzeb Khan said that after establishment of the university, its administration faced land acquisition and security-related issues.\n\u201cAs settlement has so far not been done in the Darra Adamkhel area like the rest of the tribal region, it took a lot of time to acquire land for construction of buildings,\u201d he said.\nThe VC said the unavailability of water was another big issue in the region.\nHe said that around two years went to waste due to the Covid-19 pandemic and funds were not released during that period for putting up the building.\nMr Khan said that work on some buildings would be completed by June 30 leading to the shifting of the university to them in July and August.\nMeanwhile, a university teacher told Dawn on condition of anonymity that enrolments were on decline for not having space for students and quality education.\n\u201cNo student has taken admission in the first year of BS (Bachelor of Students) mathematics,\u201d he said.\nThe teacher said as the construction work wasn\u2019t completed on time, the project\u2019s cost escalated.\nA student claimed that he and other learners came to the university to get an education but returned after roaming around after finding rooms occupied.\nHe demanded of the government to prevent learning losses by immediately releasing funds for the early completion of work on the university\u2019s own campus.\n"

            "Text": "PESHAWAR: An anti-terrorism court here on Tuesday remanded a suspected facilitator of a suicide bombing in Khyber tribal district into custody of Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) for seven days.\nThe court directed that the suspect identified as Inamullah should be again produced on May 9. The suspect was produced amid strict security in the court.\nThe investigation officer told the court that the suspect was arrested in connection with the January 19 suicide bombing at Takhta Baig checkpost in Jamrud, Khyber, which had left three policemen killed and several others injured.\nHe said that the suspect facilitated the suicide bomber, who blew himself in the checkpost, and his handlers in the commission of the offence. He stated that they needed physical custody of the suspect so as to interrogate him about his other accomplices.\nLast month, CTD had also claimed to have arrested six other suspects involved in the occurrence.\nSimilarly, the law enforcement agencies had also reportedly killed in an encounter a key suspect in the case identified as Satana Jan, a resident of Jamrud tehsil.\nOne of the suspects had reportedly told the investigators that the suicide bomber was an Afghan national and he was brought to Pakistan by Satana Jan, who had also provided him weapon and suicide vest.\nMeanwhile, the court sent to prison on 14-day judicial remand a lawyer arrested few days ago by CTD on charges of demanding extortion from one of his relatives in the name of a proscribed organisation.\nThe FIR of the alleged occurrence was registered at CTD police station on April 27 on complaint of Kashif Qasim, who claimed that he received a letter on February 11 from an anonymous person, who asked him to pay Rs5 million as extortion money, failing which he and his family would be blown in an explosion.\nThe complainant alleged that few days later he received another letter wherein it was mentioned that if he did not pay the money then he should hand over two of his minor sons to them to be kept at a seminary in a tribal district and would be used as suicide bombers at some suitable time.\nThe complainant suspected that his relative Advocate Mohammad Anwar Khalil was involved in sending threatening letters to him and demanding extortion by using the name of Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. Following initial inquiry, CTD arrested the lawyer.\nPeshawar Bar Association had condemned the arrest and also observed strike in local courts on April 29. \nThe association had denied the allegations against the suspect and claimed that he was an elder and was having property dispute with his cousins due to which he was implicated in a fake case.\n"

            "Text": "KHYBER: Extension of almost all the regular laws to the merged districts after the region\u2019s merger with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2018 could not ensure any qualitative change in the nature of reporting in the militancy-affected areas as tribal journalists are still faced with threats and intimidations from both state and non-state actors.\nWhile journalists across the globe celebrate World Press Freedom Day today (May 3), mediapersons in the seven merged tribal districts believe that the environment has become more confused for them during the last five years of merger as they are yet to know, who is wielding actual authority in their districts and to whom they approach to redress their grievances.\nShams Momand, a senior journalist from Momand district, told Dawn that tribal journalists were now increasingly worried about their safety as they were once again faced with the \u2018frightening\u2019 phenomenon of \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018bad\u2019 Taliban that resurfaced in some southern parts of the merged districts.\nCiting the abduction and torture of Bannu-based tribal journalist Gauhar Wazir by apparently \u2018good\u2019 Taliban few days ago, Mr Momand said that that police were yet to register an FIR of the incident despite protests by mediapersons.\n\nConcerns grow as militancy returns to erstwhile Fata\n\nHe said that the situation during the fresh wave of terrorism had become more volatile and insecure for tribal journalists as they got direct threats from suspected militants or the non-state actors whenever a reporter filed a story or uploaded a post on his social media account about the activities of militants or any military operation.\nKhadim Khan Afridi, a journalist from Bara tehsil of Khyber, remained in the \u2018illegal\u2019 custody of Counter-Terrorism Department for two weeks in May last year for the reason that a suspected person with the same name was wanted for an attack on police in Peshawar few years ago.\nNarrating his ordeal, Khadim Afridi told Dawn that the CTD sleuths treated him like a hardcore militant while confiscating all his necessary documents on May 11, 2022 and then kept him incommunicado for two weeks. He added that CTD was yet to return him his necessary identification cards after his release on May 27, 2022.\nRelating the incident to the observance of World Press Freedom Day, he said that he was punished only for his fair and critical reporting of different government departments in Khyber.\nHe said that along with restrictions and intimidations from \u2018official quarters\u2019, tribal journalists received even death threats from local tribesmen on reporting of some honour-related stories as such reports were considered a taboo in the so-called tribal society.\nKhiyal Mat Shah, another journalist from Bara, said that things were yet to change in a positive direction as he himself was threatened by suspected militants operating from Afghanistan when he reported the killing of a local militant commander affiliated with outlawed Lashkar-i-Islam few months ago.\nHe said that tribal journalists were concerned about their safety as the laws for their protection were yet to be made operational in the merged districts. \u201cWe still work in an environment of fear as no one is ready to shoulder the responsibility of our safety,\u201d he lamented.\nImran Shinwari, former president of Landi Kotal Press Club, was more concerned about the access to information in the post-merger scenario.\nHe said that access to information was very difficult as a majority of the government officials refused to attend telephone calls of tribal journalists or respond to their text queries.\n\u201cIt is very unfortunate that we have not yet made the progress, which the journalists in other parts of the world have so far made in the field of journalism,\u201d he said.\nHe said that the local customs and traditions were one of the main hurdles to progress of journalism in tribal districts.\nImran Shinwari also lashed out at the local leaders of different political and religious parties along with civil society activists, saying they were very friendly when a story was published in their favour but they turned very critical and at times abusive whenever a news report was published about misdeeds.\n"

Mr Malik supported the demand of the information department\u2019s employees and said that the director-general should be from among the employees of the directorate. He demanded of the caretaker government to cancel the recent posting of a bureaucrat to the directorate.\nSenior journalist Shamim Shahid, in his speech, said that posting to the vacancy should be filled from among the employees of the information department.\nHe said that if authorities didn\u2019t cancel the appointment, the then strategy of journalists regarding future course of action was ready.\nOn the other hand, the employees announced that they would stage a protest on the lawns of the directorate\u2019s offices on the Warsak Road at around 10am.\n"

As soon the reserve fund is restored their treatment would resume as usual. However, others services will stay afloat as usual.\nThe free treatment programme, started in 2016, has been facing financial issues since the installation of the caretaker government in the province. The State Life Insurance Corporation suspended the programme on April 19 owing to non-payment of its dues by the government but restored it the very next day after intervention by Prof Abid Jameel, the former health adviser to caretaker chief minister.\n\nOfficials say meeting being held today to discuss the issue\n\nThe treatment services were resumed when the government issued Rs2 billion on April 21 but a similar amount was yet to be paid to the firm, executing the programme.\nThe SLIC officials said that they had informed health department that as per agreement of SCP programme, the cost of treatments beyond the covered limit was financed from the account of reserve fund.\nThey said that each and every patient was entitled to avail secondary and tertiary care services worth Rs400,000 in normal circumstance but requiring more money from the SCP was approved by reserve fund committee.\nThe patients suffering from cancer or those undergoing dialysis or getting intensive care in ICU in addition to those undergoing kidney and liver transplants are also beneficiaries of the reserved fund because the services they need cost more than Rs400,000.\nOfficials said that SCP was informed that there was no money left in the reserve fund due to which the services could not be extended to patients anymore.\n\u201cContinuation of treatment under reserve fund could not be extended due to which we have requested to issue funds for resumption of the treatment of the patients, who have exhausted their approved under the agreement,\u201d they said. They added that standard secondary and tertiary treatments under the programme would, however, remain continued.\nOfficials said that the government was required to pay the SLIC an amount of Rs6 billion for March and April so that the patients requiring more money for their treatment could be entertained. They added that the insurance company maintained reserve fund from the premium they received from the government.\nIn each instalment paid by the government, the SLIC deposits 1.5 per cent in the reserve fund, which is utilised for the treatment of those patients, who have already exhausted their approved amount under the package.\nThey said that stoppage of services from reserve fund would adversely affect the cancer, dialysis, accidents and ICU patients because they could not discontinue their treatment. They said that more than 500 patients were undergoing dialysis only the hospitals in Peshawar. There are other patients in Swat, Dera Ismail Khan, Abbottabad, who regularly receive free dialysis under SCP. They will be hit hard as they will have either to pay from their pocket or discontinue their treatment.\nSimilarly, cancer and ICU patients will be at the receiving end as they cannot stop their treatment. However, the patients waiting to undergo liver and kidney transplants can wait.\nSenior officials at the secretariat said that a meeting would be held with caretaker chief minister today (Wednesday) to discuss the issue and help the patients through allocation of the desired funds to the insurance firm.\n"

I mean, I\u2019m 34 in just under a month. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll be back. We\u2019ll see.\u201d\nAppearing in the Championship will be a new experience for Smith, who has a superb Test record in England, where he averages nearly 60 from 16 matches.\n\u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019ve never done and have always wanted to do, so the stars aligned in a way,\u201d he said.  \u201cI\u2019m excited.\u201d\nOne of Smith\u2019s new team-mates at Sussex will be England seamer Ollie Robinson, who in March forecast Ben Stokes\u2019 side would give Australia a  \u201cgood hiding\u201d in the Ashes after they were beaten 4-0 in Australia in 2021/22.\n\u201cOllie bowled to me yesterday [Monday] actually,\u201d said Smith.  \u201cI left one, the third ball, and he knocked me over [bowled him], so that wasn\u2019t ideal. But I was impressed with him actually when he was out in Australia. I thought he had some really good skills. He\u2019s quite tall, he hit some good areas and looks like he\u2019s got better since then.\u201d\nEngland\u2019s Test team are transformed since captain Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum took over last year, winning 10 out of 12 matches in dynamic style.\nBut doubts persist over whether such tactics will work when their batsmen face an Australia attack including Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Nathan Lyon.\n\u201cThe aggressive brand they\u2019ve played has been great to watch from afar,\u201d said Smith.  \u201cBut coming up against it, hopefully it doesn\u2019t come off.\u201d\nSussex\u2019s decision to sign the prolific batsman has led to criticism that they are aiding one of England\u2019s key opponents in a way unlikely to be reciprocated in Australia.\nBut the player himself said he would have no qualms were England batting ace Joe Root to turn out for New South Wales ahead of an Ashes campaign in Australia.\nSussex coach Paul Farbrace said Smith\u2019s  \u201cwinning mentality\u201d, run-scoring and cricket knowledge would benefit a youthful squad.\n\u201cThis morning our seamers are running in bowling at Puj [India\u2019s Cheteshwar Pujara] in one net and Steve in the other \u2014 that is a fantastic learning already,\u201d he said.\nFarbrace, a former England assistant coach, added:  \u201cSport\u2019s all about opinions \u2026.The fact that people are talking about Championship cricket is only good for the game.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got good friends who think that we\u2019re helping Australia to win the Ashes. We\u2019re not at all. I think this is really good for English cricket.\u201d\nSmith added:  \u201cHopefully I can do some really good things the next few weeks and people are just able to watch me and how I go about it. Hopefully, that\u2019s enough for them. but I\u2019m also here to talk if anyone wants to talk any cricket.\u201d\n"

            "Text": "KARACHI: The last time Fakhar Zaman played an international match here at the National Stadium, he scored a century against New Zealand. The knock, however, turned out to be in losing cause as late fireworks by Glenn Phillips sealed a 2-1 One-day International series win for the visitors on a peak winter night in the metropolis.\nFast-forward three months, the Black Caps are back in Pakistan for five more one-dayers and are 2-0 down thanks to consecutive Fakhar hundreds in Rawalpindi \u2014 match-winning ones this time.\nWith scores of 117 and 180 not out on his back, the opener will be back in Karachi for the third match of the series on Wednesday and it will be expected of him to help Pakistan achieve an unassailable lead.\n \n \n\nWith a squad depleted by the absence of their top players due to the ongoing Indian Premier League, New Zealand did manage to tie the preceding five-match T20 series after losing the first two matches. In the one-dayers, though, Fakhar is standing between the visitors and a similar comeback.\n\u201cFakhar Zaman has played incredibly in the last two matches and I think to be able to break that initial partnership is going to be very important for us as a bowling unit,\u201d New Zealand spinner Ish Sodhi said during the pre-match press conference here on Tuesday.\n\u201cThe last two games he\u2019s just played exceptionally well and taken a couple of games away from us and that\u2019s been pretty amazing to watch he\u2019s at the top of his game.\n\u201cVery important to look to take early wickets I think that\u2019s where Pakistan have definitely beaten us in these games.\u201d\nAs Pakistan wicket-keeper/batter Mohammad Rizwan said a day earlier, the conditions in Karachi \u2014 set to host the last three matches of the series \u2014 will be different to those in Rawalpindi.\nThe change in conditions and the fact that the New Zealand bowlers will be better prepared against Fakhar, the fiery southpaw may have a tricky challenge at hand.\n \n\nNEW ZEALAND spinner Ish Sodhi gestures during a press conference at the National Stadium.\u2014APP\n\n\u201cI think our bowling unit has been really good in terms of coming together and trying to formulate plans against Fakhar,\u201d said Sodhi, who has established himself as the frontline spinner for the Kiwis just before the ICC Men\u2019s Cricket World Cup in India later this year.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got three games to go so we\u2019re going have to find a way to be able to get him out and that\u2019s something really exciting.\u201d\nNew Zealand\u2019s bowling strategies will be built around their Sodhi-led spin attack featuring Cole McConchie and Rachin Ravindra. On their last visit to Karachi, the dry and cold atmosphere helped the spinners.\nThe weather in the hustling city is hot and humid now and the pitches at the National Stadium may not provide as much assistance to spinners as they did in January.\n\u201cWe played here two or three months ago but I think during that time it was a different climate,\u201d observed Sodhi.\n\u201cA few of the Pakistani players were saying that it used to be a little bit wet during winter and so when there was a bit of moisture it probably held on the wicket slightly more and you know you got a bit of purchase as a spin bowler.\n\u201cBut I think having a look at it yesterday, it looks quite dry. Generally when you see that white sheen on the wicket it\u2019s quite low but I think it\u2019s important not to have too many preconceived ideas before you go in and see the wicket and you really have to take that time to assess and fortunately in one day cricket you\u2019ve got a little bit of time up your sleeve to have a look at how the wicket is playing and then make your plans for the rest of the game.\u201d\nNew Zealand are not getting carried away by the confidence they got from their exploits in the T20 series. Sodhi believed it would be a huge challenge for the inexperienced visitors to repeat the feat in a format which demands more patience.\n\u201cLooking at the T20 series it was fantastic that we were able to make a bit of a comeback after two losses,\u201d said the 30-year-old. \u201cWe played fantastically well with a very, very inexperienced side, not only in games but especially in these conditions, we did really well for that.\n\u201cThe ODI is obviously a slightly longer game, so you have to be patient for longer periods of time.\n\u201c..so the quicker we can adapt to these conditions having played here earlier this year a few of us we can pass that information on to the younger guys they haven\u2019t played here before and hopefully we can hit the ground running when it comes to the first ODI in Karachi tomorrow.\u201d\nIn the remaining part of the series, Pakistan will have the option the test hard-hitting batter Iftikhar Ahmed \u2014 who replaced an injured Haris Sohail in the squad \u2014 at the number five position in place of Rizwan, who has openly expressed his unhappiness over being made to play a spot lower than what he would prefer. Meanwhile, pace spearhead Shaheen Shah Afridi is expected to replace fast bowler Ihsanullah for the third ODI as Pakistan continue to adopt a rotation policy for their quicks.\n"

The reference has been filed by PML-N leaders Malik Muhammad Ahmed Khan and Ataullah Tarar \u2014 both special assistants to the prime minister.\nThe reference was filed under Article 218 (3) of the Constitution and the Elections Act on charges of taking bribes in return for tickets awarded to the PTI candidates. The list of PTI ticket holders, relevant documents and records were also attached to the reference for action. A transcript of the purported audio leak of Najam Saqib was also affixed to the reference.\nBesides, Imran Khan and the former CJP and his son Najam Saqib, PP-137 ticket-holder Abuzar Chaddhar, Mian Uzair, Ejaz Chaudhry, who is chairperson of the Reconciliatory Committee for Central Punjab, and PTI Secretary General Asad Umar were also made parties to the reference.\nAccording to the PML-N leaders, the party election tickets of the Punjab Assembly are being bought and sold in violation of the laws, ethics, and democracy. It alleged that the PTI was polluting the \u201csacred field of politics\u201d by allegedly indulging in corruption during the award of party tickets.\nThey noted that the persons mentioned in the reference are \u201cdirectly involved in this crime\u201d while Imran Khan himself gave party tickets last week. The PML-N leaders claimed that the persons associated with the leaked clip have been exposed after the audio clip went viral on media on April 29.\nThe PML-N leaders in their reference asked ECP to order an immediate inquiry into the corrupt practices while also seeking disqualification of the accused from contesting elections due to their \u201ccorrupt and irregular conduct\u201d. They also sought strict action against corrupt practices under Section 174 of the Elections Act against the accused persons.\nThe reference also urged cancellation of the tickets awarded by the PTI to its candidates for elections to the Punjab Assembly while also urging the commission to restrain the accused, especially Imran Khan, Asad Umar, and Ejaz Chaudhry, from any future role in the award of party tickets. The reference also urged the ECP to remove Imran Khan as the PTI chairman for engaging in corrupt practices.\nThe leaked audio purportedly featured two separate telephonic conversations between Najam Saqib and party ticket-holder from PP-137, Abuzar Maqsood Chaddhar, and Mian Uzair. The three individuals could be heard allegedly talking about the provincial assembly ticket recently issued by PTI.\n"

Caught between these two forms of extreme pressure, many journalists are, in practice, forced to censor themselves.\u201d\nThe same trend can be found in Bangladesh (163rd), where RSF says governmental persecution of independent media has intensified in the run-up to elections that are due to be held in the coming months.\nAnother regional issue it highlights is the persistence of \u201coff-limit questions and taboo subjects\u201d that prevent journalists from working freely. \u201cThis is clearly the case in Afghanistan (152nd), where the Taliban government does not tolerate no straying from their fanatical version of Islamic law and where women journalists are in the process of being literally erased from the media landscape,\u201d the report notes.\nThe RSF ranking states that overall, only 52 countries of the world can be described as providing a \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018fairly good\u2019 environment for journalism.\nRed lines\nThe change of government in Pakistan, however, is said to have \u201cloosened constraints on the media\u201d, even though it continues to be among the world\u2019s most dangerous countries for journalists \u201cwith three to four murders each year that are often linked to cases of corruption or illegal trafficking and which go completely unpunished\u201d.\nAny journalist who crosses red lines is liable to be the target of in-depth surveillance that could lead to abduction and detention for varying lengths of time in the state\u2019s prisons or less official jails, it says.\nHighlighting weak protections for journalists, the report notes that the Protection of Journalists and Media Professionals Act, passed in 2021, is conditional on reporters adopting a certain \u201cconduct\u201d, and those who cross the implicit lines dictated by the authorities are exposed to heavy administrative and criminal penalties \u2014 such as sedition.\n"

Whether auto assemblers or fertiliser producers, these companies jack up prices through cartelisation,\u201d he added.\nKhawaja Asif said it was ironic that the head of an automobile firm, as well as that of a fertiliser company, were members of the regulatory bodies. \u201cThe regulators are the beneficiaries,\u201d Khawaja Asif quipped.\nMembers of the committee conceded that part of the blame lay with them since they had not spelt out policies to regulate the car assembling and fertiliser production businesses.\n\u201cExploitation of the customer is at its peak. I accept my fault for not looking after the interests of the customer first,\u201d Khawaja Asif admitted. He suggested that import of Japanese cars be allowed to end the assemblers\u2019 monopoly.\nNo head of any car assembly firm attended the meeting despite invitation.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Wednesday concluded that ex-Wapda distribution companies (Discos) and K-Electric would charge between 34 paise and Rs3.70 additional fuel cost, respectively, from their consumers for power consumed in March, under monthly fuel cost adjustment (FCA) mechanism.\nThe decisions were made on the completion of two separate public hearings. The Discos and KE would together thus pass on a cumulative additional burden of about Rs8.4 billion on consumers across the country under the FCA in the current month\u2019s bills. This would entail additional revenue of about Rs5.47bn to the KE and Rs2.95bn to Discos.\nThe public hearings were presided over by Nepra Chairman Tauseef H. Farooqui and attended by all four provincial members \u2014 Rafique Sheikh, Maqsood Anwar, Muthar Rana and Amina Ahmed.\nNepra\u2019s case officers said that K-Electric had sought an FCA increase of about Rs4.49 per unit for March consumption, involving a financial gain of about Rs6.4bn. After minor adjustments, Nepra worked out the FCA increase at Rs3.70 per unit to provide Rs5.47bn additional finances to KE.\nLikewise, Discos had proposed an additional FCA of Rs1.17 per unit to generate about Rs9.5bn in the billing month of May. The regulator, however, calculated a positive FCA of 34 paise per unit with a revenue impact of about Rs2.9bn.\nThe representatives of the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) that pleaded the case for an increase in FCA on behalf of Discos said the electricity demand in March was almost 23pc lower when compared to the same month last year mainly because of constrained industrial activities and fair weather conditions.\nThe power generation was 8pc lower than last year owing to lower LNG supply and minimal power evacuation from Shanghai Electric\u2019s power plant.\nNepra\u2019s members expressed concern that load-shedding remained a constant factor despite lower demand and noted that the power system had been hamstrung by governance challenges as evident from lower LNG supply resulting in load-shedding and when supplies were available the power system could not utilise it. The CPPA representatives conceded that an end to load-shedding would have reduced capacity payments.\n"

The new category will also attract new investors in the capital market as it offers greater convenience for managing investments via online means.\nThe framework includes net worth requirements of Rs7.5 million and a single member company is also eligible to apply.\nSECP has also notified licence issuance and renewal fees at Rs50,000 and Rs25,000, respectively, for online-only brokers.\nMoreover, existing brokers may also switch to this new category to lower their overhead costs and remain focused on the core business of trading.\nThe launch of online-only brokers is expected to revolutionise the way investors buy and sell securities by providing a new level of convenience and accessibility as investors will no more be required to call or visit a physical office to place trades, which is often inconvenient and time-consuming.\nThe SECP has said that the move would encourage entrepreneurs and individuals to undertake the brokerage business under this regime and applicants can obtain more information on the licence and the application process at the PSX website.\n"

            "Text": "KARACHI: Pakistan\u2019s overall oil sales plunged 47 per cent year-over-year to 1.171 million tonnes in April, while the total sales shrank by 24pc to 13.970m tonnes in the July-April period of FY23.\nHowever, oil sales rose 6pc month-on-month in April.\nFurnace oil (FO) consumption in April 2023 was 72,000 tonnes compared to 461,000 tonnes in April 2022, while sales fell 16pc on MoM. The July-April FY23 FO sales clocked in at 1.866m tonnes, 40pc down from the same period last fiscal year.\nA 50pc decline was witnessed in diesel sales to 461,000 tonnes in April 2023 from 919,000 tonnes in April 2022, while a 28pc drop was recorded in 10MFY23 to 5.283m tonnes. However, there was an increase of 16pc MoM sales.\nPetrol sales posted a drop of 25pc YoY in April 2023 to 580,000 tonnes, while it recovered by 4pc MoM. Total petrol sales in 10MFY23 declined by 17pc to 6.173m tonnes.\nAn analyst at Top Line Research said April 2023 YoY fall in sales was mainly driven by a massive drop in FO and diesel sales.\n\u201cDuring 10MFY23, oil sales were down due to economic slowdown with a decline visible in all major petroleum products. Higher inflationary environments, particularly the prices of petrol and diesel have had a major impact on demand,\u201d he said.\nThe analyst anticipated depressed oil sales in the future amid high inflationary pressure and the government\u2019s inability to lower oil prices.\nAn analyst at Insight Research said the influx of Iranian petroleum products also hit domestic sales, while demand for furnace oil remained thin due to low power generation.\nHowever, sales recovery in diesel during April 2023 from March 2023 was due to higher transport activities amid the Eid holidays and harvesting of wheat crop.\n\u201cThe widespread availability of Iranian diesel, especially in the country\u2019s southern region, is hurting diesel offtake due to a significant price differential between Pakistani and Iranian diesel. Foreign exchange scarcity to import petroleum products is further causing the authorities to turn a blind eye to this issue,\u201d the analyst said.\nGlobal oil prices are witnessing a decline, with Brent trading at $75/bbl, down from the average of $84/bbl in April 2023.\nThe analyst added that if this trend continues along with the stability of the rupee against the dollar, petroleum prices are likely to go down, which may lead to an improvement in sales of oil marketing companies in the upcoming months.\nAttock Refinery Limited (ARL), in a stock filing on Wednesday, said stocks of diesel in the refinery reached a high level with very little/no ullage in storage tanks.\n\u201cWe are left with no option except to go for a shutdown of our main distillation unit of 32,400 barrels per day to manage the critically high diesel stocks and carry out essential maintenance including that of allied downstream units for five days.\u201d\nDiesel lifting by the oil marketing companies (OMCs) from ARL has remained low during the last two months due to multiple reasons including the possible inflow of smuggled products. ARL said the refinery would partially operate at around 25pc capacity during the said period. However, adequate inventories of products are available to meet the demand.\n"

            "Text": "\u2022 Fixing poll date exclusive domain of electoral watchdog, ECP plea maintains\n\u2022 Watchdog worried snap polls in KP, Punjab will compromise transparency of general elections\nISLAMABAD: A day after the government and opposition agreed in principle to hold elections in one go, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) asked the Supreme Court to revisit its order, which fixed May 14 as the date for polls in Punjab.\nIn its plea, ECP said changing the election programme was the solitary domain of the commission under Section 58 of the Elections Act 2017. It may be relevant to note that a day after the judgement directing polls on May 14 was released, the ECP also issued an amended election schedule in line with the top court\u2019s order.\nIn the fresh plea, the ECP has asked the court to take back its April 4 judgement \u201cin the interest of justice\u201d, emphasising that Article 254 should be used to stultify the constitutional imperative of holding the elections within 90 days, but the apex court should also look at the ground realities. The provision suggested that failure to comply with requirements as to time does not render an act invalid.\n\u201cAll provisions of the Constitution are required to be read together in harmony to make the provisions effective, workable and meaningful,\u201d the review petition argued and added the April 4 order by the Supreme Court was per incuriam (lack of jurisdiction) to the Constitution; therefore, it needs to be revisited.\nCompromise on fair polls\nThe review petition explained that Punjab and KP have 173 and 55 National Assembly seats, respectively, out of a total of 326 seats, which makes the total seats for Punjab and KP about 72 per cent of the assembly\u2019s total strength.\nThe general elections to the National Assembly are due in the near future, as the assembly is completing its term in August 2023, ECP said, adding that the commission requires government machinery which is non-partisan to conduct the general elections fairly and in accordance with the law,\nIt urged the court to consider ground realities in true perspective since if the elections are held while permanent governments are in place in Punjab and KP, the sanctity, objectivity and fairness of the elections to 72 per cent of the general seats of the National Assembly would inevitably be compromised.\nThe commission submitted its concerns in writing during the hearing that culminated in the April 4 order, the review petition recalled. It added the question of harmonising Article 218(3) and Article 224 as well as the provisions of the Elections Act was of first impression and has not been dealt with by the superior courts.\nThe petition stressed that the ECP has even been guarded under Article 222 from any parliamentary intervention and its power cannot be diluted, whittled away, or abridged through parliamentary intervention.\nFor a change of the date, the Constitution is silent and Section 58 of the Elections Act comes into play, the petition said, arguing the Supreme Court relied upon Section 57 of the Elections Act to designate the president as authority for fixing the date where the assemblies stood dissolved by efflux of time.\nIt is not conceivable why the Supreme Court took upon itself the task of appointing a poll date which certainly is not the constitutional function assigned to the judicial organ of the state, the review petition argued, adding the change of election programme was the solitary domain of ECP under Section 58 of the Elections Act.\nThe constitution is silent regarding the change of date of elections and when the constitution itself was silent, recourse had to be made to the Elections Act, the petition said.\nSolitary domain under Section 58\nOne of the key stages of the election programme is the date of the poll, the petition reminded. The legislature while enacting sections 57 and 58 of the Elections Act was cognisant of the fact that situations may arise due to which the dates for the elections may be required to be changed, the plea added.\nAnd to give an example, the petition recalled, the general elections of 2008 was delayed by 40 days by ECP keeping in view the exigency and requirement of that time. That is why, the legislature while enacting Section 58, put the overriding phrase \u201cnotwithstanding anything contained in Section 57\u201d, at the very start of Section 58(1), knowing it all well that Section 57 enumerates something which was contrary to what Section 58 would consider as permissible.\nThe petition emphasised that the courts interpret the law but they do not re-write it. As per a literal interpretation of the provision of Section 58, change of the election programme or giving a fresh programme, of which poll date is an essential component or stage, is the domain of ECP.\nUnder no provision of the constitution or the law, the review petition argued, Supreme Court could have taken the exercise upon itself to appoint the poll date through April 4 order, adding the constitution was an organic document, it blossoms and evolves with time. The appointing of a date or changing it is an executive exercise, and certainly not a judicial exercise, the petition emphasised.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The PTI submitted a report to the Supreme Court on Wednesday seeking the implementation of its last month\u2019s order to hold elections in Punjab on May 14, after the party and the coalition government failed to develop consensus on a date for simultaneous polls across the country despite agreeing that they could be held on the same day.\nIn the four-page report, submitted a day after the two sides concluded the make-or-break round of the much-awaited negotiations on polls, the PTI told the top court that \u201cin spite of the best efforts of parties, no solution within the Constitution\u201d was found.\nTherefore, the apex court\u2019s April 4 decision to hold elections in the Punjab Assembly on May 14 should be implemented \u201cin letter and spirit\u201d, said the report, signed by PTI leaders Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Fawad Chaudhry and Senator Syed Ali Zafar.\nThe talks between the PTI and the government began last week on Supreme Court\u2019s advice. Three rounds were held, on April 27, April 28, and May 2.\nLast month, the Supreme Court asked political parties to sit together for the sake of the Constitution and arrive at a consensus date for holding simultaneous elections for the National and provincial assemblies in the country.\nIn its report, the PTI furnished complete details of the deliberations stating that the party extended a proposal to the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) alliance, suggesting that it was ready to accept simultaneous elections to the National and provincial assemblies with certain conditions.\nOne condition was that the National Assembly and the provincial assemblies of Sindh and Balochistan should be dissolved on or before May 14, so that countrywide polls could be held within 60 days, i.e. in the second week of July 2023.\nBesides, in order to give a constitutional cover to holding elections to the Punjab and KP assemblies beyond the period of 90 days, MNAs belonging to PTI would rejoin the National Assembly and a one-time constitutional amendment validating the delay in elections beyond the period of 90 days for Punjab and KP assemblies shall be carried out by mutual consent of the political parties, the PTI had proposed.\nBesides, all the parties shall agree that the election results would be accepted as a whole subject to individual grievances in accordance with the law. And an agreement in writing to the above effect shall be submitted before the Supreme Court to ensure that the implementation of the agreement was complied with by the parties in letter and spirit.\nThe PTI report said the government rejected these proposals and instead proposed that the National Assembly and the Sindh and Balochistan assemblies could be dissolved on July 30, after which elections across the country would be held in 90 days, in the first week of October.\nThe report said the members of both the teams of PTI and PDM deliberated and held a dialogue \u201cwith full sincerity\u201d for three days \u2014 on April 27, 28 and May 2 \u2014 and that parties arrived at a certain consensus, such as the dialogue between political parties was important and the solution to all political questions ultimately lay with the political parties.\nMoreover, both teams would endeavour to hold this dialogue with full sincerity and try to arrive at a solution that was in the best interest of the people and Pakistan and in accordance with law and the Constitution, it said.\nBesides, the two sides agreed that dialogue would not be used as a delaying tactic and was without prejudice to and had no bearing on the April 4 judgement of the Supreme Court for holding elections to the Punjab Assembly until and unless an agreement within the confines of the Constitution was arrived at between the parties and such agreement was implemented.\n"

However, he said, during his appearance before the five-member larger bench of Lahore High Court the other day he got injured due to stampede, adding that at age of 71 the healing process is slow and, therefore, his client was left with no other option but to seek exemption.\nChief Justice Farooq reminded the lawyer that Mr Khan had not joined the investigation as yet.\nBarrister Safdar said the PTI chairman had given an undertaking to the LHC for joining the investigation and he would accompany him.\nHe argued that previously Mr Khan had sought exemption for security reasons but this was the first time that he was seeking it owing to medical reason.\nAdvocate General Islamabad Barrister Jahangir Khan Jadoon pointed out that the medical certificate annexed with the application for exemption had been issued by the Shaukat Khanam Memorial Hospital (SKMT). He said SKMT belongs to Mr Khan.\nJustice Farooq observed that medical report of any private hospital could not be treated on a par with the certificate issued by a state-run hospital.\nMr Khan\u2019s counsel said that since the former prime minister had remained under treatment at the SKMT for three-and-a-half months for injuries he suffered in a gun attack at a rally last year, he had submitted the medical certificate from that hospital.\nThe bench reminded the counsel that on April 18, the court order was very clear and warned that the bail granting order could be recalled over Mr Khan\u2019s absence.\n\u201cWe cannot amend this order,\u201d observed Justice Farooq and directed the PTI chairman to appear in person on Thursday (today) otherwise the court would cancel his bail.\n"

            "Text": "LONDON: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif touched down in London on Wednesday evening, just days ahead of the coronation of King Charles III, who has invited scores of world leaders to witness the historic occasion, but the visit may hold greater political significance.\nPM Shehbaz was received at the airport by Pakistan\u2019s High Commissioner Moazzam Ahmad Khan and David Gordon-MacLeod, a special representative of the British foreign secretary.\nThe prime minister has a packed agenda for the trip, as he will participate in an event for Commonwealth leaders in London on May 5, and attend the coronation the following day.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe premier\u2019s London trip is also being viewed as significant as he is expected to consult his elder brother and PML-N supreme leader Nawaz Sharif over the political situation back home.\nWith the PML-N-led coalition government locked in a battle with the judiciary and the opposition PTI, and little hope for elections as ordered by the court, the two brothers will no doubt have plenty to discuss when it comes to the party\u2019s future course of action \u2014 and the possibility of the elder Sharif\u2019s long-awaited return to the country.\nSince assuming office, Mr Shahbaz has visited London on three key occasions, the most recent one in November 2022, ahead of the new army chief\u2019s appointment.\n \n \n\nNow, with the ruling coalition and PTI having exchanged proposals following talks on the timeframe of elections, PM Shehbaz\u2019s visit to London is also being seen as a consultative visit, where he is expected to apprise his elder brother of the political situation back home and seek counsel on a future course of action.\nGiven Nawaz\u2019s experience as a three-time prime minister and seasoned politician, observers say there is little doubt that PM Shehbaz will want to seek his brother\u2019s advice on how to respond to the Supreme Court\u2019s deadline to hold Punjab elections on May 14.\nThough the final date of elections will jointly be decided by the coalition partners in the PDM alliance, it is Nawaz who may leverage his relationship with bigwigs such as Maulana Fazlur Rahman and Asif Ali Zardari to evolve some sort of consensus.\n\u201cThe brothers will certainly discuss all these issues, but Mian sb is already well aware and well-informed about everything going on and is in touch with us all online,\u201d a party insider told Dawn.\nNawaz\u2019s opinion may also be sought on how the party should proceed in its public tussle with the judiciary. Going by the elder Sharif\u2019s public statements demanding accountability of the judiciary, and his criticism of decisions by CJP Umar Atta Bandial, it seems likely that the PML-N may double down on its policy of defiance.\nFor months now, the impression in Pakistan has been that the PML-N wants to delay elections till such time as the economic situation comes under control and it can regain the political capital lost to issues such as inflation.\nBut many in the PML-N \u2014 most notably minister without a portfolio Javed Latif \u2014 feel an election date should only be set when Nawaz\u2019s return to Pakistan is certain, as his physical presence on the ground is seen as critical to battling the PTI narrative that has gained popularity in Punjab.\nOn Wednesday, when asked by reporters outside Stanhope House about his upcoming meeting with his brother, Nawaz was all smiles when he confirmed the two would meet.\n\u201cWhether things work out for Imran Khan or not, things will certainly work out for Pakistan,\u201d he said.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He stressed that Pakistan cannot allow India to further isolate it.\nIn addition to deliberating upon important regional and international issues and signing some of the institutional documents, the Council of Foreign Ministers will finalise the agenda and decisions to be adopted by the 17th SCO Council of Heads of State Meeting, scheduled to take place in New Delhi on July 3-4, 2023.\nThe foreign minister is also expected to meet with his counterparts from friendly countries on the sidelines of the meeting.\nIndia has also sent invitations to the foreign ministers of China and Russia along with other Central Asian countries.

But India and Pakistan have a canny way of upstaging the global agenda.\nThe inevitable surprises between the two are lurking in the wings; there are the usual homilies and genuine words of encouragement for a rapprochement, that could start with a talk between the Indian and Pakistani foreign ministers, analysts say.\n\u201cDialogue should continue even when neighbouring countries are not on good terms with each other,\u201d writes Sudheendra Kulkarni, the inveterate peace activist. \u201cThe alternative to talking is fighting wars, and wars have consequences that are rarely positive,\u201d he notes.\n\u201cBut if you think this will mark the resumption of long-stalled dialogue between India and Pakistan, and thus break the ice in their frozen relations, you will be disappointed,\u201d Mr Kulkarni wrote in a write up for NDTV.\nSo why have Indian and Pakistani governmental attitudes become so inflexible as to leave no scope for readiness to avail even rare opportunities? India Today\u2019s analysis may offer an insight.\n\u201cBilawal\u2019s arrival in Goa, five days ahead of the Karnataka elections, gives no succour to hopes of a bilateral breakthrough,\u201d says V. Sudarshan in an analysis piece.\nThe Agra Summit took place in the shadows of crucial elections in Uttar Pradesh, which the BJP later lost.\nMr Bhutto-Zardari\u2019s visit comes at a time when the stated Pakistani position is that there can be no serious bilateral engagement with India as long as the abrogation of Article 370, in 2019, is not revoked.\n\u201cThis is a story as well. If Bilawal still washes up in Goa, it is a sign that realpolitik has triumphed over posturing once again,\u201d says Sudarshan.\n"

            "Text": "UNITED NATIONS: South Asia leads global reductions in child marriage but still needs 55 years to eliminate the practice if it does not speed up the pace, says a UN report released on Wednesday.\nTo meet the UN target of eliminating child marriage by 2030; South Asia needs to accelerate the pace of reforms by seven times, says the report released by the UN Children\u2019s Fund (Unicef).\nWithin South Asia, Pakistan is third in reductions, behind Maldives and Sri Lanka but ahead of India, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Nepal and Bhutan. About 18 per cent women in Pakistan are still married in childhood, which is slightly better than the global average of 19pc.\nAccording to the statistics released on Wednesday, Pakistan still has nearly 19 million child brides as 1 in 6 young women in the country are married in childhood. The minimum legal age for marriage in Pakistan is 18 but about 18pc of girls are married before 18. The age gap between a child bride and her groom is often between 40 to 60 years. At 51pc, Bangladesh has the highest rate of child marriages in South Asia. Maldives has the lowest, only two per cent.\nIndia is home to the largest number of women who married in childhood. One in three child bride lives in India. There are about 34pc women in India who married in childhood. The majority of Indian women married in childhood, gave birth as adolescents.\nSouth Asia leads the world in progress on reducing child marriage. Yet, one in four young women in South Asia were first married or were in union before their 18th birthday.\nThe region is home to around 290 million child brides, accounting for 45 per cent of the global total. Levels of child marriage vary considerably across the region, from over 50pc in Bangladesh to 2pc in the Maldives.\nIn Pakistan, India, Nepal, and Bangladesh child brides are more likely to report that wife-beating is justified, and they often experience such violence themselves.\nIn Pakistan, 55pc of child brides say that wife-beating is justified. In India, 41pc say the same thing. Thirty-three per cent and 28pc in Bangladesh also justify wife-beating. Child brides in South Asia are more likely to live in poor households, have less education and reside in rural areas.\nThree in four child brides in the region give birth while they are still adolescents. The vast majority of child brides in South Asia are out of school.\nUnicef, however, also reports that the practice of child marriage has continued to decline globally, driven predominantly by a decline in India, which is still home to the largest number of child brides worldwide.\nProgress is also evident in other contexts, including in populous countries where the practice has historically been common, such as Bangladesh and Ethiopia. Some smaller countries, such as Maldives and Rwanda, are moving closer to elimination.\nCommenting on the good news, Unicef observed that \u201cthe experiences of these countries illustrate that progress is possible in a variety of settings.\u201d\nBut the UN agency warned that a \u2018polycrisis\u2019 \u2014 of war, climate shocks, and the Covid pandemic \u2014 threatens the fragile gains made towards ending the scourge.\n"

            "Text": "DAMASCUS: Visiting Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi hailed Syria\u2019s Bashar Al Assad on Wednesday for overcoming sanctions and achieving \u2018victory\u2019 in the country\u2019s 12-year-long civil war, in which Tehran has been a major ally.\nThe Syria conflict has killed more than 500,000 people, displaced millions and battered the country\u2019s infrastructure and industry. While the front lines have mostly quietened in recent years, large parts of the country\u2019s north remain outside government control.\n\u201cSyria\u2019s government and people have gone through great difficulties, and today we can say that you have overcome all these problems and achieved victory despite the threats and sanctions imposed on you,\u201d Raisi told Assad, according to a statement from the Syrian presidency and Iran\u2019s IRNA news agency.\nTehran has provided economic, political and military support to Syria, helping Damascus claw back most of the territory it lost at the start of the conflict and positioning itself in a leading role as Assad seeks to focus on reconstruction. Both countries remain under heavy Western sanctions.\n\nRaisi\u2019s visit is the first by an Iranian president since civil war broke out in 2011\n\nAssad told Raisi that Syria-Iran ties \u201cwere stable and steady during difficult times despite heavy political and security storms that struck the Middle East\u201d, according to the statement. Iran \u201cdid not hesitate to provide political and economic support (to Syria), and even offered blood,\u201d Assad added.\nRaisi\u2019s visit is the first by an Iranian president to Syria since the war broke out, and comes at a time when more regional capitals are re-engaging with the internationally isolated government in Damascus.\nThe large Iranian delegation includes the ministers of foreign affairs, defence, oil, roads and urban development as well as telecommunications.\nAssad and Raisi signed memoranda of understanding on \u201clong-term strategic cooperation\u201d, covering fields including in oil, aviation, railways and agriculture, SANA said.\nThe visit comes just weeks after Iran\u2019s landmark, Chinese-brokered agreement to restore ties with regional rival Saudi Arabia, which has sparked a flurry of diplomacy in the Middle East.\nIranian government spokesperson Ali Bahadori Jahromi said on Tuesday that \u201cboth countries are ready for the highest level of cooperation\u201d.\n\u201cThe purpose of this trip is economic,\u201d he said, adding that the two countries could also \u201ccooperate\u201d on Syria\u2019s reconstruction.\nSecurity forces were heavily deployed in key parts of the Syrian capital, while billboards with portraits of the two presidents reading \u201cwelcome\u201d in Arabic and Persian lined the airport road. The last Iranian president to visit Damascus was Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in September 2010.\nAssad has officially visited Tehran twice since the war broke out, the last time in May 2022. The regional atmosphere following the Saudi-Iran rapprochement has made Raisi\u2019s visit \u201cmore appropriate\u201d, said Damascus-based analyst Osama Danura.\nAssad is hoping full normalisation of ties with wealthy Gulf monarchies and other Arab states will also help finance reconstruction.\nIn April, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan made the first visit to Damascus by a Saudi official since the start of the war.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: The planning wing of the Capital Development Authority (CDA), which is considered a backbone of the civic agency, has been facing several challenges as its scope and manpower were not extended despite multiple decisions to equip it to meet contemporary challenges.\nCurrently, the situation of the planning wing is not much different than the capital master plan, which too has not been updated giving way to a number of planning issues in the city.\nSome three decades ago, the CDA had decided that the scope of the planning wing would be extended and the CDA board in 1995 approved some new directorates \u2013 namely Land Survey and Mapping, and Urban Planning-II \u2013 but these departments have yet to be notified. The CDA officials said that a notification was required for the implementation of the CDA board decision in 1995.\nMeanwhile, in 2018, the civic body decided to establish a new directorate, the Monitoring and Evaluation of Housing Societies Directorate. Still, a notification for this directorate was not issued despite a lapse of five years.\n\nPlanning wing officers complain of overwork, delays in promotions\n\nUnrest among officers\nThe non-implementation of the board decisions has also caused unrest among the officers of the planning wing who said their promotions were also overdue. Last week, they submitted a representation to the member planning, requesting to get the notification of board-approved directorates and also take steps for the promotion of officers.\n\u201cLet me check, why board decisions are not implemented and why promotion cases are still pending,\u201d CDA Chairman Noorul Amin Mengal told Dawn. Mr Mengal said that he would hold a meeting of the planning wing to resolve these issues.\nOn the other hand, the officials of CDA said that for the entire rural area \u2013 from Tarnol to the border of Murree \u2013 only one director was supposed to do the planning work. Similarly, for the urban areas, there was only one director heading the urban planning division.\nThe officials said that in the 1970s there were four Sectors in Islamabad i.e. F-6, F-7, G-6, and G-7, and one director of urban planning was deputed to oversee the city\u2019s planning. \u201cNow there are more than 40 sectors and the scope of the work has increased manifold, but the Directorate Urban Planning-II approved in 1995 was not notified till today. Meanwhile, the post approved in 2018 for the monitoring of housing societies was still inactive.\nPending promotions and ad hocism\nPlanning Wing, one of the authority\u2019s most essential departments, has been facing a multitude of problems because of overburdened officers and a shortage of manpower. This has hampered several essential functions of the civic agency, such as the planning for new sectors, implementation of the master plan, regulation of housing societies, and creative planning work.\nThe entire wing has no director general (DG); it has only one director of grade-19 who has been performing as a deputy director general. While, all directorates \u2013 Regional Planning, Master Planning, Urban Planning and Housing Societies \u2013 were being run by deputy directors whose promotions are pending for years.\nEven so, the Departmental Promotion Committee of one officer had already been held he was not promoted yet, while there is an officer, who was declared eligible for promotion to grade-19 by the Federal Public Service Commission but he was not promoted even though the CDA high-ups summoned him twice for an interview in 2005-6.\nOn the other hand, other wings have been promoting their officers timely unlike the planning wing, an official of the wing told Dawn.\n\u201cMy friend\u2026who joined the engineering wing a few years after me, got promoted to the post of director four years ago, and now he is making efforts to become a deputy director general,\u201d he said, adding that he was still working as a deputy director.\nMember Planning Waseem Hayat Bajwa told Dawn he was cognisant of the workload and pending promotions of officers of the planning wing.\n\u201cYes, I have received a representation, but let me make it clear that the directorates, which had been approved by the board, will be [eventually] notified and all eligible officers will be promoted,\u201d he added.\n"

We would like to know how cracks have developed in the new Margalla Road. Payments to the contractors must be stopped immediately whether it is the Frontier Works Organisation (FWO) or the National Logistics Cell (NLC),\u201d said PAC Chairman Noor Alam Khan.\nHe took up the matter after discussing the audit report of the Ministry of Industries and Production at the Parliament building on Wednesday.\nThe Margalla Road, which is yet to be formally inaugurated, stretches from GT Road to D-12 and has been opened for traffic. However, it is yet to be formally inaugurated as some work on it is still pending, including a 700-metre portion of the road.\nMr Khan observed that cracks had developed on both sides of the road near Shah Allah Ditta underpass, raising questions over the quality of construction work.\nReportedly, CDA\u2019s Member Engineering Syed Munawar Shah said that cracks developing in newly-built roads were a matter of routine, adding that the road was still incomplete.\n\u201cSo far, handing/taking over of the road has not been done. But we opened it to facilitate the public. The cracks in question will be redone within a few days. In this portion of the road, we had to do a 10 to 12 feet filling,\u201d he said, adding that except a small patch the entire road was state-of-the-art,\u201c he said.\nA few days ago, the chairman of CDA had visited the site and directed the contractor to resolve the issue.\nNonetheless, cracks in the newly constructed Margalla Road suggest substandard quality of work, observed Mr Khan.\nThe CDA is executing the project through another contractor - National Logistics Cell (NLC). The project worth around Rs3.9 billion also has five culverts and an interchange at E-11 and is supposed to be completed in six months.\nSimilarly, Member of National Assembly (MNA) Wajiha Qamar, said that chairman of CDA also needed to explain the increase in encroachments across the federal capital, especially in markets. The committee wondered why seating arrangements in front of restaurants were removed one day but a few days later, chairs were seen again on sidewalks and blocking public access areas.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: President Dr Arif Alvi has rejected three separate representations of State Life Insurance Corporation of Pakistan (SLIC) and directed the latter to pay insurance claims worth over Rs3.2 million to the complainants and report compliance to the Wafaqi Mohtasib within a month.\nWhile rejecting the petitions, President Alvi found that maladministration was established against SLIC in all three cases where it had repudiated insurance claims of the complainants on the grounds that the insurance policyholders had pre-insurance ailments which they had wilfully hidden at the time of obtaining the policy.\nThe president gave these directions while rejecting three separate representations filed by SLIC against the decisions of the Wafaqi Mohtasib.\nAs per details, Samina Shahzadi, Mohammad Mehfooz, and Seeta, the complainants, stated that their family members had obtained insurance policies from SLIC worth Rs2.9 million, Rs198,290, and Rs192,000 respectively. After the deaths of policyholders, SLIC refused to pay the death insurance claims to the complainants. Feeling aggrieved, the complainants separately approached the Wafaqi Mohtasib, which passed orders in their favour.\nThe corporation, then, filed separate representations with the president against the decisions of the mohtasib, which the president also rejected. In the case of Ms Shahzadi, the president observed that her deceased husband, Mohammad Saeed Ahmed had died due to Covid-19, as reported by ABWA Hospital and Research Centre, Faisalabad, and not due to the pre-insurance ailment of brain tumour as claimed by SLIC.\nIn the case of Mr Mehfooz, the president pointed out that the policy was issued to his sister Ms Chand Bibi on 26.12.2018 and she died on 19.12.2021, after the expiry of a period of over three years and seven months. Similarly, he noted that the policy was issued to Jodho Mal, the husband of Ms Seeta, on 31.12.2018, who later died on 17.03.2021 after the expiry of a period of over two years and two months.\nThe president highlighted that as per Section 80 of the Insurance Ordinance, 2000, no policy of life insurance effected after the commencement date of the ordinance, could be called in question after the expiry of the two-year period on the ground that a statement made in the proposal for insurance or in any report of the medical officer was inaccurate or false. He further observed that in both cases, the confidential reports of the field officers of SLIC had declared the policyholders as healthy at the time of issuance of the policy and had categorically stated that they knew the deceased since birth.\nThe president concluded that since maladministration on the part of SLIC stood established in all the three cases, therefore, representations were being rejected and SLIC was directed to pay the death insurance claims to the complainants.\n"

            "Text": "ISLAMABAD: Azerbaijani traditional Mugham singers on Tuesday night opened the eyes and ears of their audiences to the emotionally rich and graceful sounds of their land.\nThe live concert was organised by the Embassy of Azerbaijan in Islamabad, to celebrate the 100th birth anniversary of Heydar Aliyev, the national leader of the Azerbaijani people.\nAccording to organisers, the first frets of Mugham - one of the main genres of Azerbaijani folk music \u2013 sounded in ancient times. Its performance art dates back to the tradition of recitation of the Holy Quran or even earlier - to Avesta hymns.\nThe meaning of the word Mugham was interpreted as God-sent music and for its numerous admirers - it was not only a beautiful lyrical melody but also a state of mind, a way to merge with the world, and a kind of cosmic philosophy.\nMugham was performed by three musicians \u2013 a tar player, a kamancha player, and a singer \u2013 khanande. The lead singer led the main theme decorating it with improvisations and emotional shades. The audience was impressed with the energy and enthusiasm and with a concert of music that was hauntingly beautiful, playful, and dramatic.\n\u201cFor the Azerbaijani people, Mugham is music, philosophy, and a kind of meditation, which helps to uncover spiritual bases in people, having a healing effect on the soul and mind and forming a cosmism of thinking and everything that laid the basis of multiculturalism - the modern progressive policy of the Republic of Azerbaijan,\u201d the organisers said.\nIn 2003, the Azerbaijani Mugham was proclaimed as a masterpiece of the oral and intangible heritage of humanity. The Azerbaijani Mugham was inscribed on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2008.\nAmbassador of Azerbaijan in Islamabad, Khazar Farhadov, extended his gratitude to all his guests, diplomats and local dignitaries for joining him and his team in the celebration.\nIntroducing Heydar Aliyev, Ambassador Khazar Farhadov informed his guests that 2023, was declared the \u2018Year of Heydar Aliyev\u2019 in Azerbaijan and this important occasion was being celebrated solemnly in his country and abroad.\n\u201cEvery nation had genius personalities who played the role of saviours in the history of national freedom and independence. The renaissance and awakening of national consciousness started with Heydar Aliyev\u2019s coming to power, and the independence of Azerbaijan became eternal and irreversible,\u201d said Khazar Farhadov.\nHeydar Aliyev proved that he was a visionary and decisive politician when he first led the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic from 1969-1982.\nAs a result of the intense activities of Heydar Aliyev, great successes were achieved in the economy, industry, agriculture, education, and culture, the ambassador said.\nThe ambassador said that Heydar Aliyev was the architect of the development of Azerbaijan-Pakistan relations. \n\u201cHe attached great importance to Pakistan. In April 1996, Heydar Aliyev paid an official visit to Pakistan. Several documents were signed between Azerbaijan and Pakistan during the visit. This visit played an irreplaceable role in the development of relations between the two countries,\u201d he said.\n\u201cPakistan and Azerbaijan have very good and friendly relations. These relations are based on our ancient historical traditions. It is no coincidence that Pakistan is one of the first states to recognise the independence of our country after Azerbaijan declared its independence,\u201d the senior diplomat said.\n\u201cPresident of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev attaches great importance to Azerbaijan-Pakistan relations, which were constructed by Heydar Aliyev. The ties between the two brotherly countries are at a high level in all fields,\u201d the ambassador said.\n"

In early days of the enumeration, it was quite common, but it was not seen for past many weeks.\u201d\nHe said that it was probably for the first time since the federal government intervened and deputed teams of the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) to assist and lead the enumeration process being conducted by provincial administrations. \n\u201cTo address the complaints of the political parties, these teams are conducting visits in high-rise buildings which were left uncounted or not counted at all,\u201d he said.  \nHe referred to the district-wise details of population so far counted in Karachi which showed Central district with total 3.42 million people followed by East district with 3.17m people enumerated so far.  \nThe Korangi district with 2.92m people ranked third so far followed by West with 2.27m, Malir 2.21m, Keamari 2.18m and South becomes the smaller district in terms of population with 1.81m people.  \nThe officials were not sure about a further extension in the May 15 deadline of the enumeration process, but they were confident that with the passage of time, the number of population counted daily would fall gradually as the teams had \u201calmost completed the job\u201d.  \nOnly last week PBS authorities after a detailed briefing to ministers, lawmakers and leaders of political parties in Islamabad decided in principle to extend digital census till May 15.  \nThe census exercise was launched on March 1 and was supposed to be completed in a month, but the deadline was extended several times.  \n\u201cIn Karachi, the teams comprising PBS officials from Karachi and Islamabad were deputed in the last week of Ramazan,\u201d said another official. \u201cThere were reports people living in several high-rise buildings which housed hundreds of thousands of individuals were not counted. The same complaints were made by different political parties. So it was decided to constitute PBS teams and attach them with the field enumerators. The PBS teams are actually focusing those high-rises and they have almost completed their job.\u201d  \nThe political parties mainly Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan, Jamaat-i-Islami and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf have already warned that they will not accept the \u201cflawed\u201d census if any attempt was made to manipulate the number of Karachi population.  \nThe nationalist parties as well as Sindhi intellectuals have already demanded that the process of census be stopped forthwith as they believed the deadline only in urban areas has been extended to rig the results.\n"

            "Text": "KARACHI: Police on Wednesday booked and arrested a policeman in a case pertaining to the killing of a young man in a \u2018fake\u2019 encounter near Liaquat National Hospital.\nOn Tuesday, the police claimed to have killed young Kamal Kishan in an encounter by dubbing him a mugger. However, Kishan\u2019s family and friends lodged a forceful protest outside the New Town police station prompting the authorities to order a probe.\nRelatives of the victim also staged a protest near the office of the DIG-East in the morning.\nThe police registered a murder case against Inspector Farman Ali Shah on the complaint of the victim\u2019s father at the New Town police station.\nAbdul Rehman, a cousin of the victim, said he was converted to Islam. He added that Inspector Shah was also arrested in the murder case.\nThe victim\u2019s father stated in the FIR that the held policeman killed his son after snatching Rs80,000 from him.\nHe stated that Kishan and his friend, Aneel, both residents of Shanti Nagar, had gone to Lyari to collect money from his relatives as he needed the amount for the marriage of his daughter. They were returning home when a police mobile intercepted them on Stadium Road.\nThe complainant stated that the held inspector snatched the cash and other valuables from Kishan. After snatching the cash, he asked him to run and as he moved he fired from behind, killing him on the spot.\nEarlier, the police had claimed that Inspector Shah of the investigation wing was standing near the Liaquat National Hospital in plain clothes when a passer-by informed him that two armed pillion riders were on the run after snatching his cell phone.\nThey had claimed that the officer immediately challenged the fleeing suspects, who fired on him and when he returned fire, one of them got killed while his accomplice fled. The police also claimed to have recovered a pistol and the snatched cell phone from the dead.\nLater, the SSP-East appointed a senior officer to conduct a probe and on his report the New Town police lodged an FIR under Section 302 (premeditated murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code.\n"

            "Text": "KARACHI: Most parts of South Asia are likely to experience normal to below normal rainfall and an increase in both maximum and minimum temperatures during the southwest monsoon season (June-September) this year, according to a statement of South Asian Climate Outlook Forum (SASCOF-25).\nThe statement, shared by the Pakistan Meteorological Department with the media on Wednesday, was finalised during a recently held meeting of the forum.\nThe regional climate outlook had been collaboratively developed by all nine national meteorological and hydrological services of South Asia with the support from international experts at the 25th session of the South Asian Climate Outlook Forum conducted online.\nThe process involved an expert assessment of the prevailing global climate conditions and forecasts from different climate models from around the world. \n\nRelatively dry weather to give Sindh and Balochistan chance to focus on rehabilitation efforts in flood-hit areas, says Dr Sarfaraz\n\nThe experts have forecast above normal minimum temperatures over most parts of South Asia except parts of the foothills of Himalayas and above normal maximum temperatures in most parts of the region except central and parts of southern region of South Asia.\n\u201cThis means that most parts of South Asia including Pakistan are likely to have relatively warmer and dry monsoon this year except some pockets, such as parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan and northeast Punjab, where normal weather pattern during the season is likely to prevail,\u201d Chief Meteorologist Dr S. Sarfaraz said.\nHe, however, was quick to add that SASCOF\u2019s statement was a preliminary assessment based on climate indicators of April and that the forum would come up with more reliable data for June-September season later this month when the experts would review May\u2019s weather conditions.\nAccording to the statement, the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) \u2014 a cyclical climatic event with three phases (El Nino, La Nina and a neutral phase) \u2014 is one of the global climate phenomena that have significant influence on the year-to-year variability of the monsoon over South Asia.\nAsked how this phenomenon affects regional climatic conditions, Dr Sarfaraz explained that El Ni\u00f1o events were associated with warming of the central and eastern tropical Pacific, while La Ni\u00f1a events were the reverse, with a sustained cooling of these same areas.\n\u201cThese changes in the Pacific Ocean and its overlying atmosphere occur in a cycle known as ENSO. Over the last three years, we have experienced the La Nina that began in September 2020 and ended in March 2023, contributing to above normal rainfall and drop in maximum and minimum temperatures in the region including Pakistan.\n\u201cCurrently, neutral ENSO conditions prevail over the tropical Pacific. The latest global models forecast indicate that the El Nino conditions are likely to develop during the upcoming season, causing a relatively dry and warmer monsoon this year,\u201d he said.\nDr Sarfaraz pointed out that the decades-old data of the Met department showed that the country had relatively dry monsoon whenever El Nino conditions prevailed in the region.\nHe described the forecast as positive news particularly for Pakistan that had experienced devastating floods last year. \n\u201cA relatively dry monsoon would definitely provide a great opportunity to our provincial governments particularly in Sindh and Balochistan to gear up rehabilitation efforts in flood-stricken areas. Both provinces are likely to have less than average rainfall and warmer monsoon,\u201d he said.\nWhen asked about the severity of this summer, Dr Sarfaraz said it was hard to predict it right now. \u201cThere are still two months to go. Besides, intra-seasonal variability in the monsoon season is high, which makes credible assessment very difficult at this stage.\u201d\n"

            "Text": "KARACHI: The Sindh High Court (SHC) on Wednesday directed advocate general of Sindh to inform the court why detained leader of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Ali Amin Gandapur was not being released despite his having obtained bail in both the cases.\nThe bench, headed by Justice Omar Sial, also asked the AG, prosecutor general of Sindh and office of attorney general to put on record the details of all FIRs registered against the PTI leader till May 11.\nWhen the bench took up a petition seeking details of cases lodged against Gandapur for hearing, the lawyer for the petitioner informed the court that two cases had been registered in Sindh, one each in Mithi and Shikarpur districts and the PTI leader had obtained bail in both cases.\nHowever, the counsel argued, he was not being released from central prison Sukkur by the authorities concerned.\nThe bench issued notice to the provincial law officer and directed him to give reasons in his reply for not releasing the former federal minister.\nUmer Amin Gandapur, a brother of the PTI leader, moved the SHC and contended that as per his information, a number of FIRs had been registered against his brother at Dera Ismail Khan, Islamabad and other cities of the country, including police stations in Sindh.\nThe petitioner argued that he could exercise his fundamental right to get copies of the FIRs registered against his brother, if any, and therefore, had approached the police authorities in Sindh but they were reluctant to provide any kind of information in this regard, which was tantamount to denying right to access justice and fundamental rights.\nHe asserted that Gandapur had falsely been implicated in a number of FIRs without any rhyme or reason by the present government and the PPP-led provincial government as they were bent upon unleashing political persecution against the PTI leader. \nGandapur was arrested at a court in D.I. Khan and was first shifted to Islamabad and then brought to Lahore and now he had been detained at central prison in Sukkur, he added.\nThe petitioner\u2019s counsel contended that it was a settled principle of law that multiple FIRs under the same offence against a person could not be lodged, and was also against the principle of double jeopardy, but all the cases in question were registered against the former minister under the same charges while Section 123-A of Pakistan Penal Code was the prerogative of the state and could not be imposed by the police or a private person.\n"

Balochistan and Punjab provinces had done legislation in this regard and enacted Fertiliser Act, it said. \nThe meeting regretted 50pc water shortage in Sindh despite the fact that river flows had been adequate lately. \nStill, it said, over 50pc water shortage was being reported and tail-end\u2019s watercourses and channels were not getting their required supplies.\nIt said that proper cultivation was not ensured and crops were drying up as lining of Safaraz Wah to Kissana Mori had not been carried out properly. \nThe gates of Sarfaraz canal had not been fixed yet, it said and demanded an immediate end to smuggling of wheat, fertiliser and sugar to a neighbouring country in broad daylight without fear of law.\n"

Some of them were later handed over either to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) or the Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) to probe corruption charges against them.\nMoonis\u2019 friend Ahmad Faran Khan was allegedly subjected to \u2018severe torture\u2019 before he was presented before the court of law. Former prime minister Imran Khan had condemned the torture and said that the Elahi family and its associates were being harassed by the government and the powers that be through fake cases and other tactics for staying loyal to him.\nAccording to Khan, Mr Elahi was told by the powers that be that \u2018red line\u2019 had been drawn around him (Imran Khan) and he (Elahi) should refrain from dissolving the Punjab Assembly. \u201cMr Elahi however dissolved the assembly on the request of Mr Khan and afterwards the elements in the power circle got active to teach him a lesson,\u201d a source told Dawn on Wednesday.\nLast week, the ACE and police had launched a major operation at Mr Elahi\u2019s Lahore residence breaking its main gate through an armoured vehicle and allegedly harassed the family women to arrest him. Mr Elahi escaped the arrest and subsequently secured pre-arrest bail from the court.\nThe Elahi family alleges that Punjab caretaker chief minister Mohsin Naqvi has been \u2018super active\u2019 in instituting fake cases against its members and associates for having a grudge against them.\nOn Wednesday, the ACE claimed that Moonis\u2019 political secretary Sohail Asghar Awan escaped from its custody in Gujranwala.\nIt said Awan was being taken to the hospital at night after his condition deteriorated but he got a chance and escaped from custody.\nIt said the ACE and police teams had been formed to arrest him. \u201cIf any ACE official is found involved in the escape of the suspect, strict legal action will be taken against him,\u201d it said.\nThe ACE alleged that Mr Awan was involved in a road corruption scam for awarding the project in Gujrat to his favourite contractor after taking bribes.\nMr Awan\u2019s wife Faiza Sohail said in a statement that Mr Awan was abducted by some people who came in white cars. She said ACE Director General Sohail Zafar Chattha was also involved in her husband\u2019s kidnapping. She said after finding nothing illegal against her husband and failure to present any evidence in court, they planned to abduct him. She urged the judiciary to take notice of this and order the release of her husband. Mr Awan\u2019s family also held a demonstration against his \u2018abduction\u2019.\nMoonis Elahi said in a tweet: \u201cUnknown persons have now started picking up people from police custody. Sohail Asghar Awan was acquitted in every fake case but he would be implicated in another. Now when he would be handed back to the authorities more fake cases including the one related to his so-called escape would be registered against him.\u201d\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The petitioner said he had no knowledge as to how many cases had been registered against him by the respondents.\nHe asked the court to order the respondents to furnish complete details of the cases against him so that he could avail legal remedy.\nHearing another petition of Elahi against the raid conducted on his Gulberg house in Lahore, Justice Sheikh directed the ACE additional director general to submit a reply to a show-cause notice served on him.\nEarlier, Additional DG Waqas Hassan, assisted by a law officer, stated that the raid was conducted to arrest Mr Elahi in a case wherein he was not on bail.\nAsked about his alleged contemptuous remarks regarding the court\u2019s order, the ACE officer said he could not even think of committing contempt of court.\nThe judge adjourned further hearing till Thursday (today). \n"

Finally, the attending doctors got samples of one of the suspected patients, Akhtar, on Wednesday morning and sent them to the IPH for the test.\nAn ambulance of the Rescue 1122 transported the samples to the IPH where reports, generated in the evening (the same day), showed Akthar was negative for the virus.\nWhile the samples of the other patient, a woman, were drawn and dispatched to the IPH on Wednesday afternoon after the institute IPH experts insisted that the Punjab government guidelines for handling such cases should be followed in letter and spirit.\nTalking about the negligence of the LGH administration, the official source said they were unwilling to get the woman tested, arguing she might be suffering from chickenpox or some other disease.   \nHowever, the IPH experts were of the view that not getting a suspected patient tested could endanger others.   \nat this, the official said, the hospital dispatched the woman\u2019s swabs to IPH on Wednesday afternoon and the report was expected on Thursday (today).\nMeanwhile, he said, the IPH sent a request to the WHO through the health department for the provision of 500 more kits for more tests.\nThe IPH had a stock of 100 kits and two of these were used to test the two suspected patients of the virus at the LGH.\nMeanwhile, the IPH also imparted training to the staff and officials of the Rescue 1122 and the Civil Aviation Authority for handling of the suspected patients of the monkeypox.\n"

The eight-member bench, headed by CJP Bandial, had already stopped implementation of the law even before the president\u2019s assent to it, prompting a strong reaction from the lawmakers.\n\nAsif proposes committee of whole house to look into court decisions since Justice Munir\n\nMr Abbasi said it was a serious matter concerning the \u201csovereignty and supre\u00admacy\u201d of the parliament. Recalling that in 1997, the then NA speaker Ilahi Bakhsh Soomro had provided the record of the parliament to the former CJP Syed Sajjad Ali Shah, he said it should not happen. \u201cConstitute a committee of the whole house to hold a debate on the matter. Call the chief justice of Pakistan to ask him as to why and for what purpose he is seeking the record,\u201d said ex-PM Abbasi.\nDefence Minister Khawaja Moham\u00admad Asif supported Mr Abbasi\u2019s proposal and reiterated his demand that there should be a parliamentary probe into the past controversial role of the judiciary. He also called for the formation of the committee of the whole house.\nThe minister said the committee should be tasked to \u201cinvestigate the decisions of higher courts since Justice Munir to give legal cover to constitutional violations\u201d till date. He said this was a fact that the two constitutional institutions were at loggerheads as \u201ca clash of opinion\u201d existed between the two on the interpretation of the constitution.PTI dissident and leader of the opposition Raja Riaz also asked the speaker not to provide any parliamentary record to the SC. He alleged that the judges were involved in selling of the PTI tickets in Punjab for Rs50m, claiming that he knew the names of the candidates who had purchased the tickets.\nGhaus Bux Mahar of the GDA made it clear that his party was not part of the ongoing tirade against the judiciary.\nThe National Assembly will meet again at 11am today (Thursday).\n"

Mandviwalla, Senators Farooq H. Naik, Anwar-ul-Haq Kakar and Kamil Ali Agha talked about widespread reports of smuggling of foreign currency and other commodities. They alleged one after the other that various agencies and forces deputed on borders were directly responsible for the smuggling, otherwise, movement of such large quantities could not take place.\nSenator Kakar said a new situation had arisen particularly at Chaman and Taftan borders for a year and half as over 30m litres of Iranian diesel and petrol was being smuggled into Pakistan on a daily basis, while there was complete silence of criminal nature on the matter. He alleged deputy com\u00ad\u00admissioners were issuing tokens against Rs40,000 per consignment and Rs10bn to 15bn amount was exchanged every month.\nHe said bigwigs and hidden faces of top influence were running this business in the name of unemployed youth in the province, but it was an open secret that instead of unemployed youth and poor people powerful and influential were involved in the game. \u201cIs this the mandate of deputy commissioners? Who has given DCs such powers?\u201d he questioned.\nRates for clearance\nSenator Kamil Agha said each truck of smuggled goods had a fixed rate of Rs500,000 to Rs600,000, whereas between Rs100,000 and Rs300,000 was being charged for clearance at each checkpoint. He said two to three known markets were operating in all the major cities where smuggled goods were freely available.\nSenator Naik and Agha asked the FBR and customs intelligence to explain why they had been unable to check the menace and deplored that Pakistan economy was passing through a critical phase but dollars were smuggled out unhindered while the prices of essential commodities were affecting the people of Pakistan, some people were making fortunes by exporting them illegally.\nMinister of State for Finance Dr Aisha Ghous Pasha told the committee that smuggling had become such a challenge that the PM had personally taken notice of the situation and had constituted an inter-agency committee to prepare a multi-pronged strategy to overcome smuggling.\nAn official of customs intelligence told the committee that 43,000 bags of urea and 42,000 bags of sugar were confiscated from Khuzdar within three days and arrangements were being made to manage the posts thro\u00adugh joint teams of different agencies.\n"

They said about 5,000 bags were  sold daily in Abbottabad during Ramazan. \nThey asked the KP chief secretary to contact his counterpart in Punjab to find a solution to the issue.\n"

            "Text": "PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court has upheld conviction of a person by a trial court for killing two youngsters while resorting to firing in the air during a marriage ceremony in Hangu district around four years ago.\nA single-member bench of Justice Sahibzada Asadullah dismissed an appeal filed by the convict, Syed Nasir Hussain, and ruled that the prosecution had fully proved its case against him. The convict had started firing in the air during a function held in connection with marriage of Hassan Ali on March 31, 2019.\nDuring firing, he lost control over his Kalashnikov rifle that resulted in injuries to two youngsters named Muzamil Abbas and Mohammad Khan. They were taken to a hospital but they succumbed to their injuries.\n\nFIR against petitioner was filed in Hangu four years ago\n\nThe FIR of the occurrence was registered at City police station, Hangu, on complaint of an uncle of the deceased Muzamil Abbas wherein the appellant as well as the bridegroom were charged for the commission of the offence.\nThe appellant was convicted by an additional district and sessions judge whereas the bridegroom was acquitted.\nThe court sentenced the appellant to three years rigorous imprisonment under section 15 of Arms Act. He was also convicted under section 322 (un-intentional murder) of Pakistan Penal Code. He was directed to pay Diyat amount of Rs2.77 million each to the legal heirs of the deceased persons. The court ordered that he should remain imprisoned till payment of the Diyat money.\nAdvocate Syed Bilal Jan appeared for the complainant and stated that the appellant had escaped from the scene of occurrence and was subsequently arrested by police. He argued that the rifle used in the occurrence was also recovered on his pinpointing.\nHe argued that the appellant was directly charged in the FIR and the evidence on record connected him with the commission of the offence. He stated that one of the deceased was 14 years of age whereas the other one was 19. He added that because of their young age, the appellant did not deserve any leniency.\nThe appellant\u2019s counsel contended that his client was falsely implicated in the instant case as he had not attended the said marriage function. He added that the prosecution had also not laced on record any invitation card to prove that any marriage function was taking place at the time of occurrence.\nHe argued that no weapon was recovered from his client and in fact the rifle produced by police was given to them by the complainant party and by the appellant.\n"

They said youngsters from not only the provincial capital and the adjoining areas but also from Islamabad joined the car drifting and dragging \u2018competitions\u2019.\n\u201cWe usually race or drift inside RMT on a special track or on Jamrud Road, where fewer people drive after 10pm, that too on weekends,\u201d said Naeem Khan, a 25-year-old resident of Warsak Road, who has modified his 1994 model Suzuki Khyber.\nHe said as he worked at his father\u2019s factory all the week, so car drifting and dragging was the only source of entertainment for him. \u201cWe block all the U-turns on Jamrud Road so that nobody enters the racing-route, making it safer for racers and those who travel on the road in routine,\u201d Khan told Dawn. He said the activity continued for only two or three hours.\nAccording to city traffic police, a special unit has been formed to patrol the area after 10pm to curb the dangerous practice since duty hours of the traffic police were between 7am to 10pm.\n\u201cThese youngsters start car racing and drifting as soon as the duty hours of traffic police end at 10pm,\u201d chief traffic officer Qamar Hayat said, adding, however, that the special unit would not allow the youngsters to do stunts on roads.\nHe said the traffic police had arrested dozens of motorcyclists involved in one-wheeling on the Northern Bypass.\n"

He said streets of the town were in bad shape for want of repairs. He said roads linking dozens of sectors had not been carpeted for years. \nMr Islamuddin said there was nobody to listen to the complaints of overbilling by the residents.

He accused the labour department officials of letting the industrialists exploit the poor workers.\n\u201cLabourers are forced to work for 12 hours instead of eight hours in harsh conditions, but there is no one to stop this exploitation,\u201d he said. \nNoor Rehman Jadoon, a member of the Pakistan Workers Federation, recalled that a few years back they had got registered a union of workers, but industrialists stalled its functioning through different tactics, including setting up a pocket union, to cover up the workers\u2019 exploitation.\nHaleem Shah, another leader, said implementation of labour laws in GAIE was an uphill task because of resistance from industrialists.\nArif Shah, a member of the district human rights committee, said industrialists misled the relevant officials about the workers\u2019 rights.\nWhen contacted, Sharif Ahmad, assistant director labour, admitted that a number of units in Gadoon Estate did not even pay the minimum wage of Rs25,000 per month to workers. He said a few days ago the department had fined a manufacturing unit Rs60,000 for not implementing the minimum wage policy.\n"

            "Text": "KARACHI: It was breezy here at the National Stadium on Wednesday night, but it was humid too. Down 2-0 in the five-match One-day International series, New Zealand weren\u2019t letting their hopes slip in the third match.\nWith the asking rate rising and less than 10 overs to go, the visitors had to do something to save the series. Captain Tom Latham had been solid on the crease, but more was needed.\nAs soon as the left-hander tried something different \u2014 an attempted scoop against Mohammad Wasim\u2019s pace \u2014 he saw his stumps flying.\nCole McConchie, though, did not relent after Latham was gone. The right-hander threatened to take it away from Pakistan \u2014 who gave him an extra life thanks to Abdullah Shafique\u2019s dropped catch \u2014 bludgeoning the Pakistan bowlers all around the ground.\nHis partners at the other end though failed him as New Zealand eventually went down, giving Pakistan an unassailable 3-0 lead.\nNew Zealand had started their pursuit to a 288-run target well. Tom Blundell, who had replaced Chad Bowes at the top of the order, and Will Young got them off to a flying start, finding boundaries around the ground against Pakistan pacers Shaheen Shah Afridi, Naseem Shah and Wasim. The pair was past 50 as early as the end of the ninth over.\nPakistan made their first breakthrough in the 16th over when a brilliant throw by Agha Salman at third man ran out Young (31 off 41) just a ball before Blundell brought up his maiden ODI half century.\nThe incoming Daryl Mitchell was given two lives by Pakistan; first when wicket-keeper Mohammad Rizwan failed to grab on a faint edge off Nawaz in the 19th before the slow left-armer dropped the batter off his own bowling, also injuring his finger before being taken for an x-ray.\nMitchell (21), who had scored centuries in the first two matches, looked dangerous when he smashed Wasim for two boundaries in the 21st over but holed the quick out to Abdullah at square leg two overs later.\nBefore New Zealand could recover from the blow, they were hit by another in form of another run out and this time Wasim made an impact as a fielder, as Rizwan collected a rocket throw for him to dislodge the striker\u2019s end to end Blundell\u2019s time at the wicket for 65.\nLatham and Mark Chapman (13) brought stability, but their 50-ball partnership for 40 ended when Naseem cleaned up the latter with an outswinger that knocked over off-stump.\nIn the next over, the incoming Henry Nicholls found Abdullah and square leg off Salman\u2019s off-spin before Latham (45) succumbed to Wasim.\nMcConchie, who was 64 not out off 45, hit Shadab Khan for a six in the next over before smashing Wasim for three fours. The right-hander reached his 50 off just 36 balls with a huge six off Shaheen. He hit two more fours but at the other end, Shaheen and Naseem got rid of the New Zealand tail.\nEarlier, the slowness of the pitch and disciplined bowling by the New Zealand attack required Pakistan batters to work hard for their runs.\nAlthough Fakhar Zaman \u2014 who was coming into the match at the back of consecutive hundreds in the first two matches \u2014 failed in repeating the feat for the third time, it was a 90-run knock off 107 by his opening partner Imam-ul-Haq that provided the base for Pakistan\u2019s total.\nThe bespectacled left-hander combined with his friend and Pakistan captain Babar Azam (54) for a 108-run partnership off 121 balls for the second wicket but the pair shared just 10 fours and two sixes between them.\nBabar and Imam\u2019s partnership was complimented by crucial contributions of nearly run-a-ball 32 and 31 by Mohammad Rizwan and Agha Salman before Shadab played a 10-ball cameo for 21 runs to take Pakistan close to the 300-run mark.\nWhile McConchie\u2019s off-break gave away just 46 runs in 10 overs, it was pacer Matt Henry who was among the wickets for New Zealand, taking crucial wickets of Fakhar, Babar and Salman and giveing away just 54 runs.\nHenry gave New Zealand the first breakthrough when Fakhar (19 off 26) uncharacteristically played way across the line of the ball to sky it and get caught.\nImam had also flicked Henry for three fours in a row to make up for his slow start but put on the brakes again as soon as spin was introduced into the attack. Between the 12th and 18th over, Pakistan hadn\u2019t scored any boundaries before Babar lifted McConchie over long-on for a six.\nNot long after Babar and Imam brought up their fifty partnership, Imam launched McConchie over midwicket for another six in the 21st over.\nPakistan brought up their 100 in the next over, which also saw Imam reach his 50 off 67 balls. Playing at 55 off 75 balls, Imam miscued an attempt to clear mid-off, where Latham dropped a tricky chance before Babar reached his 50 off 58 balls with a cut past backward point for a boundary off Shipley in the 27th over after he had flicked and pulled for two .\nImam jumped down the track to lift leg-spinner Ish Sodhi down the ground for four more in the next over but soon saw Babar play on Henry onto his stumps. The opener was awarded another reprieve at 71 when Henry dropped him off his own bowling in the 31st over.\nAfter Abdullah was dismissed by McConchie, Imam succumbed to Milne in the 38th over, misjudging a delivery angling into him to see his stumps shattered before Rizwan, Salman and Shadab helped Pakistan to 287-6.\nScoreboard\nPAKISTAN:\nFakhar Zaman c Blundell b Henry 19\nImam-ul-Haq b Milne 90\nBabar Azam b Henry  54\nAbdullah Shafique c Latham b McConchie  19\nMohammad Rizwan c McConchie b Milne 32\nAgha Salman c Milne b Henry 31\nMohammad Nawaz not out  11\nShadab Khan not out 21\nEXTRAS (LB-2, W-8)  10\nTOTAL (for six wkts, 50 overs)  287\nDID NOT BAT: Shaheen Shah Afridi, Mohammad Wasim, Naseem Shah. \nFALL OF WICKETS: 1-37 (Fakhar), 2-145 (Babar), 3-182 (Abdullah), 4-192 (Imam), 5-246 (Salman), 6-261 (Rizwan)\nBOWLING: Henry 10-2-54-3 (2w), Milne 10-1-56-2 (1w), Shipley 10-0-73-0 (5w), McConchie 10-0-46-1, Sodhi 10-0-56-0.\nNEW ZEALAND:\nW.

He improved a little in the second but not sufficiently to trouble Alcaraz, who moved his opponent around at will.\n\u201cI played at a great level, I didn\u2019t let him dominate, I went on the attack the whole time, and above all, I returned really well,\u201d said Alcaraz, who won in one hour 22 and minutes.\n\u201cI played a complete game, and that\u2019s how we have this result \u2014 but it\u2019s not a normal result against [Zverev].\u201d\nIn the last eight, the Murcian will face Karen Khachanov who dispatched Andrey Rublev 7-6 (10-8), 6-4 in another all-Russian battle.\nMedvedev, second seed in the Spanish capital, has admitted he struggles on clay and fell to another defeat against Karatsev on the dirt, as he did in Rome two seasons ago.\nKaratsev triumphed comfortably in the first set tie-break, his ball striking immaculate throughout the clash, hitting 28 winners to just four unforced errors.\nHe will face Zhizhen Zhang, who became the first Chinese player to reach the quarter-finals of a Masters 1000 event.\nZhang eked out a nailbiting victory over world number 10 Taylor Fritz, 3-6, 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (10-8).\nWorld number five Tsitsipas will face lucky loser Jan-Lennard Struff, who saw off Pedro Cachin 7-6 (9-7), 6-7 (7-9), 6-3.\nThe other quarter-final pits Croatian Borna Coric, ranked 20th, against Germany\u2019s Daniel Altmaier.\nSABALENKA MAKES SEMIS\nAustralian Open champion Sabalenka struggled badly at first against Sherif but turned the two-hour match around convincingly to reach the semi-finals.\n\u201cI was just trying to keep fighting to keep playing my game and find my rhythm,\u201d said Sabalenka.\n\u201cShe\u2019s a clay court specialist and I\u2019m very happy with this win. It was a very tough one.\u201d Sherif, the first Egyptian to reach a WTA 1000 quarter-final, capitalised on Sabalenka\u2019s erratic start to break in the first game.\nSabalenka will face Greek world number nine Maria Sakkari after she came from behind to beat Romanian Irina-Camelia Begu 6-7 (3-7), 6-4, 6-2 in the second quarter-final.\n"
