The new findings, published online in the journal Neuron, could help researchers better understand how mood states transition naturally.\nIt could also lead to a more complete understanding of how fast-acting anti-depressants work and help researchers identify previously unknown targets for new antidepressant medications, Medical Daily reported.\n\u201cChronic sleep loss is well studied, and its uniformly detrimental effects are widely documented,\u201d said Professor Yevgenia Kozorovitskiy at the varsity. \u201cBut brief sleep loss, like the equivalent of a student pulling an all-nighter before an exam, is less understood. We found that sleep loss induces a potent anti-depressant effect and rewires the brain. This is an important reminder of how our casual activities, such as a sleepless night, can fundamentally alter the brain in as little as a few hours.\u201d\nRead:\u00a0Depression is real: Pakistani celebrities talk mental health after Maulana Tariq Jamil's son's death\nIn the research, the team developed a new experiment to induce acute sleep loss in mice that did not have genetic predispositions related to human mood disorders. \nThe experimental setup needed to be gentle enough to avoid causing substantial stress for the animals but just uncomfortable enough to prevent the animals from falling asleep. After a sleepless night, the animals\u2019 behaviour shifted to become more aggressive and hyperactive, compared to controls that experienced a typical night\u2019s sleep. Using optical and genetically encoded tools, the researchers measured the activity of dopamine neurons, which are responsible for the brain\u2019s reward response. They found activity was higher in animals during the brief sleep loss period.\nWhile researchers do not fully understand why sleep loss causes this effect in the brain, Kozorovitskiy suspects evolution is at play. \u201cThe anti-depressant effect is transient, and we know the importance of a good night's sleep,\u201d she said.\u201d\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 23rd, 2024.\n", "2": "Punjab Healthcare Commission has introduced mandatory registration and licensing requirements for hair transplant centres, alongside a ban on using the term \"clinic\" with beauty salons.\nThe commission has also prohibited the use of unregistered products categorised as medicines in all hair transplant centres and beauty salons.\nAccording to official sources, directives have been issued, urging immediate registration and licensing for all such establishments, with a one-month timeframe for compliance.\nThe registration process will be conducted online through the Punjab Healthcare Commission, which will issue the registration licenses.
