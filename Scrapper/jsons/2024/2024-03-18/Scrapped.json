to earn Real Madrid a commanding 10 point lead at the top of La Liga in a 4-2 rout of Osasuna on Saturday, with fading title rivals Girona falling to a 1-0 defeat at Getafe.\nThe Brazilian forward mesmerised for Los Blancos and reached 18 goals across all competitions this season, while Dani Carvajal and Brahim Diaz also found the net in an entertaining romp for Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s side.\nGirona, second, were undone by Yellu Santiago\u2019s first half strike and have now suffered four consecutive away defeats \u2014 started by a demoralising 4-0 thrashing at Madrid.\nThird-place Barcelona, 11 points behind Real, travel to face Atletico Madrid, fifth, and can overtake Girona with a victory.\nAthletic Bilbao rose above Atletico to fourth with a 2-0 win over Alaves thanks to a brace from Gorka Guruzeta.\nReal were without top goalscorer Jude Bellingham, completing a two-match suspension but, with Vinicius in full flow, barely missed the England international at El Sadar in Pamplona.\n\u201cI congratulated him, he had an extraordinary game, he made good decisions, he moved very well without the ball, that\u2019s where\u2019s he\u2019s improved the most,\u201d Ancelotti told reporters. \u201cWith the ball he\u2019s always efficient and without it he\u2019s spectacular at the moment, he\u2019s so fast.\u201d\nVinicius\u2019 name made headlines this week after Real Madrid filed a legal complaint over alleged racist insults aimed at the Brazilian by Atletico Madrid and Barcelona fans, but on the pitch the forward\u2019s quality continues to speak for itself.\nThe 23-year-old dispossessed Alejandro Catena, ran through and calmly rolled the ball past Sergio Herrera to break the deadlock after four minutes.\nOsasuna were quickly back level through Ante Budimir, who finished from close range at a corner.\nVinicius was booked just before half-time for dissent, his fifth yellow  card of the season in La Liga \u2014 meaning he is now banned for Athletic  Bilbao\u2019s visit to the Santiago Bernabeu at the end of March.\nCarvajal restored Real\u2019s lead after 18 minutes, using the outside of his foot to steer a curving shot into the far corner. \nDiaz scored the third goal for the visitors in the 61st minute, before Vinicius got his second three minutes later with a low finish from a tight angle inside the box \u2014 it was the striker\u2019s 12th league goal of the season.\nIker Munoz pulled one back for Osasuna in stoppage time before Real almost wrapped up the win in spectacular fashion, but youngster Arda Guler hit the bar with an effort from just inside Osasuna\u2019s half.\nMeanwhile, Getafe, despite the absence of top goalscorer Borja Mayoral, were able to inflict a fourth consecutive away defeat on Michel Sanchez\u2019s slumping Girona.\n\u201cEvery defeat worries us, we want to fight to get into the Champions League,\u201d Michel told reporters. \u201cWe have a historic chance to do it and if we

in the world rankings next week.\n\u201cTo be able to end something like this, it\u2019s incredible for me,\u201d Spain\u2019s Alcaraz said of busting the Italian\u2019s streak.\nFinal against fourth-seeded Russian Medvedev is a repeat of last year\u2019s championship decider.\nMedvedev also had to fight back in a 1-6, 7-6 (7/3), 6-2 victory over 17th-ranked American Tommy Paul. In the final he\u2019ll be out to thwart Alcaraz\u2019s bid to become the first repeat Indian Wells ATP champion since Novak Djokovic won three straight titles from 2014-2016.\nAlcaraz and Sinner\u2019s semi-final was disrupted by a three-hour rain delay at 2-1 in the first set but proved worth the wait as the 20-something stars put on a show.\n\u201cMatches with Jannik are always special,\u201d Alcaraz said.  \u201cWe know we have to play at our highest level to win. We have to put magic on the court, unbelievable points and for the crowd it is also wonderful.\u201d\nSinner quickly seized the initiative when play resumed, winning four straight games to pocket the first set.\nHe saved the only break point he faced, and gained the insurance break for a 5-1 lead, pouncing on a short ball for a stinging cross-court passing winner on break point.\nAlcaraz turned it around in the second set with a savvy change of style, backing up to give himself more time on the returns and gradually working his way into the match.\nHe broke Sinner with a deep volley winner for a 3-1 lead and held for 4-1 in a game that had fans on their feet cheering a thrilling rally at the net.\nHe saved break points in the seventh and ninth games before sealing the set with a drop-shot winner.Sinner\u2019s mistakes were multiplying in the third set and Alcaraz broke in the third game, delivering a high backhand volley to end another scrambling rally.\nWorld number three Sinner, who had dived to get a ball back, came up shaking out his right arm and rubbing his elbow.\nHe suddenly was powerless to stop Alcaraz, who won five straight games, clinching the match with a forehand winner.\nIt was the second straight year that Alcaraz stopped Sinner in the Indian Wells semi-finals.\n\u201cIt\u2019s for sure not the ending that I wanted, but playing against him, it\u2019s always tough,\u201d Sinner said.  \u201cI tried to play good tennis, which I have done, especially in the first set.\n\u201cThen I made a couple of mistakes. The momentum has changed. He raised his level.\u201d\nMedvedev said the chilly evening conditions made it hard to find a groove in the opening set against Paul, but like Alcaraz he was able to make some adjustments.\nHe won the first four games of the second set but Paul attacked the net aggressively to claw back and force the tiebreaker, in which the American rolled his ankle on the sixth point.\nMedvedev won the last five points of the tiebreaker to level the match and seized a 5-1 lead in the third, finally fending off a pair of break points in the final game to close it out.\nThe reward is a chance to avenge last year\u2019s loss to Alcaraz and claim the only one of the six hardcourt Masters 1000 titles he has yet to win.\nPublished in Dawn, March 18th, 2024\n", "2": "ROME: Lazio won their first match since the resignation of Maurizio Sarri, with a 3-2 victory on Saturday at Frosinone, who are sinking towards relegation from Serie A.\nMattia Zaccagni\u2019s leveller seven minutes before the break and a second-half brace from Valentin Castellanos made sure that Lazio snapped a three-match league losing streak under Sarri\u2019s former assistant Giovanni Martusciello.\nSarri officially stepped down on Wednesday after a disastrous season with the Roman club which has Lazio ninth in Italy\u2019s top flight.\nItalian media report that Igor Tudor will replace Sarri on a permanent basis.\nFrosinone are 18th after picking up just two points from their last eight matches.\nEusebio Di Francesco\u2019s side are one point behind Empoli who are just outside the \nrelegation zone and were beaten 1-0 by Bologna on Friday.\nLecce moved four points ahead of Frosinone with a 1-0 win at rock-bottom Salernitana in their first match under new coach Luca Gotti.\nGotti replaced Roberto D\u2019Aversa who was sacked on Monday for headbutting Verona striker Thomas Henry in their previous fixture last weekend.\nPublished in Dawn, March 18th, 2024\n", "3": "BRASILIA: Manchester United midfielder Casemiro is out of the Brazil squad for this month\u2019s friendlies against England and Spain due to injury, coach Dorival Junior said on Saturday, with Porto winger Pepe set to take his place.\nCasemiro is the latest absence for Brazil, following injuries to Manchester City keeper Ederson, Arsenal striker Gabriel Martinelli and Paris St Germain defender Marquinhos, ahead of a match at Wembley on March 23 and one in Madrid\u2019s Santiago Bernabeu three days later.\n\u201cFrom a preliminary list of 50 names, 13 had already been ruled out by injury at their clubs,\u201d coach Junior said. \u201cUnfortunately, we also lost Casemiro.

strikes, Raheem Sterling missed a penalty and Axel Disasi gave Leicester hope with a farcical own goal early in the second half.\nWhen Stephy Mavididi scored an eye-catching equaliser, Chelsea were in turmoil once again as the hapless Sterling earned the wrath of the home support.\nBut Leicester\u2019s Callum Doyle was sent off for a professional foul on Nicolas Jackson, setting the stage for the Blues\u2019 late revival.\nChelsea have failed to win a single domestic trophy since their most recent FA Cup triumph six years ago.\nThe west Londoners are languishing in 11th place in the Premier

"KARACHI: The ninth edition of the HBL Pakistan Super League is set to culminate in a title-deciding clash between a side for which finals have been a curse lately and a team which doesn\u2019t know how to lose one.\nHere at the National Bank Stadium on Monday, Multan Sultans will play their third PSL final in a row, the first of which resulted in their maiden trophy, but the other two saw them go down to Lahore Qalandars \u2014 by 42 runs 2022 and by an agonising margin of one run last year.\nAs they go for another shot at glory, their opponents will be Islamabad United, who have made it to the final for the first time in six seasons, but on both the two occasions they were involved in the title clash \u2014 2016 and 2018 \u2014 they were crowned the champions.\nLed by Pakistan\u2019s star all-rounder Shadab Khan, United have arrived in the final with just the right momentum, fueled by a resurgent win over Peshawar Zalmi in the second Eliminator on Saturday.\nUnited had chased down 229 runs to beat Sultans in their last league match before that, giving them a psychological edge over the Mohammad Rizwan-led unit.\nEnding up as runners-up in the last two editions may seem like a matter of hard luck for the Sultans, but that\u2019s not how the franchise\u2019s players are looking at it. They have been directed by their captain Rizwan to put in even more effort on Monday.\n\u201cLast year we lost by one run, we have lost three matches this season and that too very close margins,\u201d Sultans batter Usman Khan observed while talking to Dawn on Saturday. \u201cRizwan tells us to make sure that we work hard to avoid that one ball or the one moment that may potentially let us down at the end of the game.\u201d\nRizwan\u2019s active nature on the ground as a leader of his pack and his shrewd decision making has been impressive once again this season and many in the cricketing circles have called for the wicket-keeper/batter\u2019s appointment as the Pakistan captain.\n\u201cBefore every match he tells us to go inside the ground with a champion\u2019s mindset,\u201d revealed Usman. \u201cAnd the way bucks all of us up even if we make mistakes is something that keeps our morale high.\u201d\nRizwan\u2019s support has helped Usman plunder 373 runs at a stunning average of more than 124 in only six outing this season with the support of two centuries. He is placed third in the league\u2019s batting charts only under Rizwan who is second with 373 runs to his name.\nRizwan\u2019s counterpart Shadab is not far behind in terms of runs and is well among the wickets as well. He has smashed 301 runs with a strike-rate of nearly 147, mostly playing at number four for United. With his leg-spin Shadab has hunted down 11 victims.\nHis average, however, is on a slightly higher side making him less lethal of a spin option than Sultans\u2019 Usama Mir, who is the highest wicket-taker this season with 23 scalps and his average, 15, is half as much as Shadab\u2019s.\nBut the all-rounder is blessed with the experience and utility of Imad Wasim, who has emerged as United\u2019s trump card in the latter stages of the tournament. He won the match with the bat in the recent wins against Sultans and Zalmi, while also demonstrating expertise with his left-arm spin.\n\u201cHe is one of the best all-rounders in the world right now,\u201d Shadab said after the match against Zalmi. \u201cYou can\u2019t doubt his ability after how he has won the last three knockout matches of us.\n\u201cWe are lucky to have him in our team.\u201d\nImad put up a match-winning partnership of 98 runs with Pakistan discard Haider Ali to snatch the second Eliminator from Zalmi\u2019s jaws after the Babar Azam-led side had taken five United wickets in the space of 11 overs.\nHaider, who has been dubbed as a wasted talent after emerging as an explosive batter in his early days, hit three towering sixes to wrap up the game for United, and Shadab believed such players were worth investing in.\n\u201cSome players need more love and respect than others and Haider is one of them,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t write them off on the basis of a few bad performances.\u201d\nUnited\u2019s depth and Sultans\u2019 consistency will be tested in the final on a playing surface, which is likely to be on the slower side but is also expected to provide value for good batting.\nPublished in Dawn, March 18th, 2024\n", "8": "KARACHI: Peshawar Zalmi head coach Darren Sammy sat dejected, sunk in his chair in the press conference room after Islamabad United had knocked his team out of the HBL Pakistan Super League on Saturday.\nThe former West Indies skipper had been associated with Zalmi since the first season of the PSL \u2014 first as captain and then as coach \u2014 and his is the only franchise that has succeeded in qualifying for the playoffs in all of those seasons.\nFor that level of consistency, Zalmi have won the title only once, and for Sammy, that is far from enough.\u201cBeing consistent doesn\u2019t mean anything to me without a trophy,\u201d he told reporters after the loss against United. \u201cI think that\u2019s what we look to or aim to get every year.\n\u201cNine playoffs, one trophy; that\u2019s not enough\u201d\nSammy rued how Zalmi lost both the Qualifier and the Eliminator, as he criticised how his players \u201cdidn\u2019t execute plans\u201d in the latter.\u201cWe\u2019ve always got in the first hurdle, this year again we had two bites at the cherry and we could not move on,\u201d he observed.\nSammy believed United approached the game with a relentlessness that has defined the side season in season out.

I don\u2019t know, but obviously some athletes might choose not to go if they\u2019re not competing for Russia.\n\u201cI mightn\u2019t be right, but I think that I\u2019ve read something that it might be as little as 40.\u201d\nNeutral athletes will compete only in individual sports without flags, emblems or national anthems, and athletes who actively support the war in Ukraine, or are contracted to the Russian or Belarusian military, are not eligible.\nMoscow, which describes the invasion as a  \u201cspecial military operation\u201d, called the restrictions  \u201cillegitimate, unfair and unacceptable\u201d, but Russia\u2019s Olympic chief, Stanislav Pozdnyakov, has confirmed its athletes would not boycott the Games.\nBecause of doping sanctions that prevented them from competing under the Russian flag, 335 athletes took part in the 2021 Tokyo Summer Games as the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) team, winning 71 medals. Belarus sent 101 athletes who won seven medals.\nThe ROC has since been suspended by the IOC for recognising regional Olympic Councils in territories annexed from Ukraine, a decision upheld by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) last month.\nOf 4,600 athletes who had qualified for the Games at the time of the December decision on neutral athletes, eight were Russians and three held Belarusian passports. More than 60 Ukrainians had qualified.\nSome sports, such as equestrian, have announced they will not allow any athletes from the two countries to compete, while World Athletics has had a blanket ban on Russian and Belarusian athletes since early 2022.\nOthers, such as World Swimming and the International Tennis Federation (ITF), will allow Russians and Belarussians to compete under the IOC restrictions.\nRussia\u2019s world number four tennis player, Daniil Medvedev, said earlier this month he was looking forward to competing and would abide by the rules.\nThe Paris Olympics run from July 26 to Aug 11.\nPublished in Dawn, March 18th, 2024\n"}, "Link": {"0": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1822133/vinicius-hits-brace-as-real-distance-girona", "1": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1822132/alcaraz-faces-medvedev-for-indian-wells-title-after-stopping-sinner-streak", "2": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1822131/castellanos-helps-lazio-down-frosinone", "3": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1822130/casemiro-out-of-brazil-squad-with-injury", "4": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1822129/ocallaghan-beats-titmus-to-send-olympic-warning", "5": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1822128/kane-scores-to-set-record-in-bayerns-5-2-win-at-darmstadt", "6": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1822127/chelsea-survive-leicester-scare-to-reach-fa-cup-semi-finals", "7": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1822126/hbl-psl-2024-sultans-look-to-break-curse-as-united-eye-another-triumph-in-final", "8": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1822125/consistency-means-nothing-without-a-trophy-says-zalmi-coach-sammy", "9": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1822124/sri-lanka-bangladesh-hit-by-key-injuries-for-odi-decider", "10": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1822123/paris-games-could-feature-only-40-russian-athletes-says-iocs-coates"}, "Category": {"0": "sport", "1": "sport", "2": "sport", "3": "sport", "4": "sport", "5": "sport", "6": "sport", "7": "sport", "8": "sport", "9": "sport", "10": "sport"}, "CreationDate": {"0": "2024-03-18", "1": "2024-03-18", "2": "2024-03-18", "3": "2024-03-18", "4": "2024-03-18", "5": "2024-03-18", "6": "2024-03-18", "7": "2024-03-18", "8": "2024-03-18", "9": "2024-03-18", "10": "2024-03-18"}}
