It was staged at Agha Khan Auditorium, University of Peshawar, under the auspices of Niaz Adabi Sangar (NAS) in collaboration with Dosti Welfare Organisation as part of its thirrd edition of 11-day Peshawar Literature Festival ( PLF).\nA large number of students, teachers and visitors watched the stage play. Around nine students performed in the live stage play and earned a thunderous applause from the audience.\nShazia Rehan, a student of English department, told this scribe that the hour-long live performance was filled with clandestine humour blended in high seriousness of boarding student life.\nProf Aseer Mangal, chairman of NAS, on the occasion said that the play being relevant was staged for raising awareness among students to devote themselves to achieving their desired career goals and avoid idle activities on the campus. He added that university campuses served as the seat of learning alongside grooming up youth for future social and political challenges.\nMasood Ahmad Shah said that the script of the play carried a significant message for youth and therefore, the performance registered a wholesome impact on tasteful audience. He said that such live theatrical performances should be encouraged on campus.\nJalaludin Mamoond, a student from Bajaur tribal district, who played a role in the play, stated that its central theme revolved around purposeful use of time and its wastage led to disastrous end as most students residing in the hostels away from their parents\u2019 eyes spent their precious time in pointless things on the campus.\nProf Gulzar Jalal Yousafzai remarked that late Prof Azam being a renowned playwright knew the psyche of students and parents\u2019 expectations, therefore, organisers selected it from a collection of his personal essays and adapted for live stage performance.\n\u201cI strongly believe such live plays, if encouraged, will help to instil a spirit of future vision among youth. Mr Shah and young performers did perfect justice to the show,\u201d he said.\nPublished in Dawn, February 28th, 2024\n"}, "Link": {"0": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1817619/phc-stops-police-from-arresting-gandapur", "1": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1817617/pti-leaders-want-gandapur-to-order-probe-into-poll-rigging", "2": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1817615/one-killed-over-family-dispute-in-swabi", "3": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1817613/drugs-shortage-in-hospitals-blamed-on-centralised-purchasing-system", "4": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1817611/protesting-municipal-workers-seek-salary", "5": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1817609/bannu-admin-asked-to-turn-greenbelts-into-picnic-spots", "6": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1817608/man-gets-14-years-jail-for-blackmailing-boys", "7": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1817607/khyber-man-sentenced-to-death-in-murder-case", "8": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1817606/womens-political-participation-discussed", "9": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1817605/mansehra-traders-complain-roads-in-bad-shape", "10": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1817604/rs5m-raised-for-treatment-of-poor-cardiac-patients", "11": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1817603/spring-plantation-drive-kicks-off-in-lower-dir", "12": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1817624/fazl-says-his-party-not-interested-in-pa-opposition-leaders-slot", "13": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1817623/five-die-as-bus-falls-into-haripur-gorge", "14": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1817622/woman-arrested-in-haripur-for-strangling-minor-nephew", "15": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1817621/two-workers-of-drug-company-killed-in-bajaur", "16": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1817620/wheat-shortage-feared-in-chitral", "17": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1817602/play-staged-in-peshawar-to-motivate-students-for-meeting-future-challenges"}, "Category": {"0": "peshawar", "1": "peshawar", "2": "peshawar", "3": "peshawar", "4": "peshawar", "5": "peshawar", "6": "peshawar", "7": "peshawar", "8": "peshawar", "9": "peshawar", "10": "peshawar", "11": "peshawar", "12": "peshawar", "13": "peshawar", "14": "peshawar", "15": "peshawar", "16": "peshawar", "17": "peshawar"}, "CreationDate": {"0": "2024-02-28", "1": "2024-02-28", "2": "2024-02-28", "3": "2024-02-28", "4": "2024-02-28", "5": "2024-02-28", "6": "2024-02-28", "7": "2024-02-28", "8": "2024-02-28", "9": "2024-02-28", "10": "2024-02-28", "11": "2024-02-28", "12": "2024-02-28", "13": "2024-02-28", "14": "2024-02-28", "15": "2024-02-28", "16": "2024-02-28", "17": "2024-02-28"}}
