This results in widespread price increases; exacerbating the financial strain on consumers already battling relentless inflation for the past two years, he added.\nRead:\u00a0Industries at risk as energy costs surge\nPBF President stressed that the consumer demand was poised to reduce further as a result; which would further prompt a reduction in manufacturing activities. The resulting inflation also rules out any possibility of a reduction in interest rates in the foreseeable future; leading to the further downfall of the private sector.\nKhawaja Mahboob urged the government to conduct an all-encompassing reassessment of its energy pricing framework as electricity prices for industrial consumers are well above 17 cents/kWh which is twice as high as those in regional economies like Bangladesh and India.\nWith yet another increase in gas prices, manufacturing activity is no longer financially feasible in Pakistan and there will be no investment \u2013 domestic or foreign in the country under these conditions.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 24th, 2024.\n", "2": "Rawalpindi Department of Excise, Taxation and Narcotics Control has received smart cards for new registration of 40,000 vehicles and motorcycles from the central office in Lahore.\nThe cards have been handed over to Pakistan Post for delivery to the owners of these smart computerised registered cards.\nThey will be distributed among their owners at their doorsteps from Monday, February 19.
