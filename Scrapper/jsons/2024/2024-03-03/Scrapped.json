the industrialists to install air pollution control system.\nThrough a letter sent to the HEZ chairman, District & Sessions Judge/Consumer/Commercial Disputes Court, Haripur, Muneera Abbasi pointed out that steel mills and factories in the HEZ were the major contributors of environmental pollution caused mostly by use of tyre powder and oil. \nThe letter pointed out that these factories avoided using natural gas to save production costs, thus compromising the human life and health insurance.\nThe judge pointed out that due to frequent burning of tyres and their oil in the furnaces of steel mills and other factories the life of residents of surrounding localities, wildlife, passersby and workers and officers of factories was at risk due to health hazards.\nThe judge asked the chairman HEZ to ensure that the units creating environmental pollution stopped the practice. \nThe judge also advised him to appoint a monitoring officer from his office, who should liaise with the registrar of her court, director Environment Protection Agency and assistant director industries, Haripur, to launch an effective drive against the polluters.\nShe also directed the chairman HEZ to make the industrialists to ensure that their air pollution control system was functional, and the industrialists, who had not yet installed the system, must be forced to do so.\nThe Hattar industrialists are accused of using the old tyres and oil extracted by processing the unusable tyres in the furnaces of steel mills and some other factories, causing respiratory complications to workers, passersby and residents of neighbouring localities. \nThe local media has drawn the attention of EPA and local authorities to the grave issue many a time, but to no avail.\nThe industrialists are also held

The CEO said 169,107 cardiac procedures, 530,041 dialysis, and 54,710 chemotherapy sessions were also performed under the SCP.\nMeanwhile, the representatives of public sector hospitals hailed the government\u2019s move to clear the SLIC\u2019s dues for the resumption of the health insurance programme.\nThey said the Lady Reading Hospital was waiting for the SLIC to pay it Rs2bn for the treatment of those entitled to the SCP, while the Peshawar Institute of Cardiology also expected its unpaid amount of Rs1.5bn.\nThe Hayatabad Medical Complex and Khyber Teaching Hospital await payment of Rs600m and Rs500m each from the insurer. These four major hospitals have stopped services on the SCP due to non-payment of dues by the SLIC.\nSources said the SLIC didn\u2019t make any payments to the hospitals in the last six months as it wasn\u2019t receiving dues from the government.\nThey said not only big hospitals but the insurance company, too, had to clear the dues of district hospitals to ensure the continuation of their services.\n\u201cWe are ready to start free healthcare after the assurance of regular payments by the new government. We hope that the programme will have smooth sailing like in the past when PTI ruled the province,\u201d a hospital\u2019s representative told Dawn.\nHe said non-payment of funds by the caretakers limited services under the health insurance scheme to emergency patients only.\nPublished in Dawn, March 3rd, 2024\n", "12": "KOHAT: The residents, including clerics, destroyed a \u201cmiracle site\u201d in a mountain of Lachi tehsil here on Saturday.\nElders of the Shahi Banda village told Dawn that women both from the area and far-flung localities carried their babies with disabilities through the natural narrow passageway firmly believing that the exercise will turn the infants healthy.\nThe elders said that the women also tied colourful pieces of cloth to the branches of a nearby tree hoping that their desires would come true.\nElder Abdul Basit said that the people brought babies with disabilities to the passageway for cure. \nHe said that the miracle site was destroyed with the help of hammers.\nThe elder said that though young, educated people were opposed to superstitions, the elderly, especially women, still believed them.\nPublished in Dawn, March 3rd, 2024\n"}, "Link": {"0": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1818619/management-of-hattar-economic-zone-asked-to-control-air-pollution", "1": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1818618/prices-of-vegetables-fruits-surge-in-mansehra-ahead-of-ramazan", "2": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1818617/injured-swabi-footballer-dies", "3": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1818616/action-sought-against-pti-workers-for-throwing-shoe-in-kp-assembly", "4": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1818615/role-of-lawyers-lauded", "5": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1818614/gandapur-takes-oath-as-chief-minister", "6": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1818613/charsadda-school-holds-annual-day", "7": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1818612/two-thieves-arrested-in-swabi", "8": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1818624/22-killed-as-rain-snowfall-batter-kp-for-second-day", "9": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1818623/bannu-traders-complain-of-excessive-power-gas-cuts", "10": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1818622/two-held-stolen-goods-recovered-in-abbottabad", "11": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1818621/resumption-of-sehat-card-plus-on-cards-as-govt-agrees-to-clear-dues-of-state-life", "12": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1818620/residents-destroy-miracle-site-in-kohat"}, "Category": {"0": "peshawar", "1": "peshawar", "2": "peshawar", "3": "peshawar", "4": "peshawar", "5": "peshawar", "6": "peshawar", "7": "peshawar", "8": "peshawar", "9": "peshawar", "10": "peshawar", "11": "peshawar", "12": "peshawar"}, "CreationDate": {"0": "2024-03-03", "1": "2024-03-03", "2": "2024-03-03", "3": "2024-03-03", "4": "2024-03-03", "5": "2024-03-03", "6": "2024-03-03", "7": "2024-03-03", "8": "2024-03-03", "9": "2024-03-03", "10": "2024-03-03", "11": "2024-03-03", "12": "2024-03-03"}}
