0,LPG price reduced slightly,Both local and imported LPG rate reduced by 81 paise per kg.,"ISLAMABAD: Because of exchange rate gains over the past month, the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) on Friday slightly reduced the price of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).
Both local and imported LPG rate was reduced by 81 paise per kg, bringing the cost of 11.8kg domestic cylinder down by Rs9.51 or 0.31pc for March.
In a notification, Ogra set the price of LPG at Rs215.49 per kg for March instead of Rs216.30 per kg in February. As such, the price of 11.8kg domestic cylinder was set at Rs2,542.78 against Rs2,552.30 last month. The cylinder price has gone up from Rs2,322 since June last year.
On the other hand, the price of a commercial cylinder (45.4kg) was reduced by Rs36 to Rs9,783.24 against Rs9,820 in February. Its price has gone up from Rs8,939 since June last year.
The regulator had historically been determining the local pricing because of very limited imports of about 20pc. The traders and LPG dealers, however, started charging the prices of both products at higher rates by deceiving the consumers that they were supplying imported products because of the non-availability of local gas. As a consequence, Ogra was given the power in May last year to also fix the uniform rate for local and imported LPG.
Now that the situation had changed drastically with a share of imports increasing to almost 50pc, Ogra had ad now started determining the same price for both local and imported products as it could not be differentiated in the market if the consumers get local or imported LPG. 
Therefore, it had “notified the maximum price of indigenous LPG which shall be regulated at the maximum price at all levels of the supply chain for indigenous as well as imported LPG”.

1,Fresh data paves way for interest rate cut,"""We can expect a current account surplus of $100m to $150m in February,” says head of research at Arif Habib Ltd.","KARACHI: The latest trade and inflation data has fostered a renewed sense of optimism among financial markets, researchers and bankers, sparking expectations of potential monetary easing and economic growth acceleration.
The trade deficit shrank by 30 per cent during the first eight months (July to February) of the current fiscal year, while inflation unexpectedly fell by a significant margin from 28.3pc in January to 23.1pc in February.
“With the trade deficit clocking in at $1.7 billion, we can expect a current account surplus of $100 million to $150 million in February,” said Tahir Abbas, head of research at Arif Habib Ltd.
 
 

“The State Bank may potentially start a monetary easing cycle from March onwards with the inflation slowing down and core inflation hitting a 13-month low,” Mr Abbas said, adding that the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI)-based inflation reading includes recent gas tariff revision alongside hikes in petroleum prices. “We believe that inflation will continue its downward trajectory,” he said.
The significant decline in inflation in February has provided policymakers with enough space to ease the monetary policy. The State Bank has kept the interest rate at 22pc to counter high inflation during the current fiscal year.
“There could be many reasons behind the low inflation number, but one thing is very obvious that diminished uncertainties and bold economic decisions of the current dispensation discouraged hoarders and speculators,” Rashid Masood Alam, a senior banker, said, referring to the caretaker government.
“Fiscal-side improvements also resulted in incr­eased confidence, thou­gh hike in power, gas and petrol prices might push it back,” Mr Alam said.
During the July-February period, the trade deficit was $14.9bn compared to $21.3bn a year ago, a year-on-year decline of $6.4bn. This was considered a great relief for the economy struggling to pay back the huge external debt servicing of about $25bn this fiscal year.
The country also benefited from an increase in exports, which jumped 9pc year-on-year to $20.35bn during July-February.
Researchers find the situation helpful for the economy, provided the trend persists for a more extended period.
“It is good for the country that exports are going up and inflation is coming down,” said Samiullah Tariq, head of research at Pak-Kuwait Investment and Development Company.
As for inflation, the base effect was also at play, and the impact of the increase in utility prices was diluting, he said, adding that agriculture exports were supporting the overall exports on the trade side.
However, researchers and bankers were not sure that the latest data would also improve the current account balance. They believed that the 9pc increase in exports was good for the economy but was not the solution for the heavily indebted country.
Similarly, some experts did not find the 23.1pc inflation helpful for an economy facing serious problems of economic growth. Last year’s negative economic growth and this year’s expected growth rate of 2pc were considered highly disappointing for the economy of 240 million population.

2,CPI inflation decelerates to 23.1pc in February,"It is the lowest reading in 20 months, down from a peak of 37.97pc in May 2023.","ISLAMABAD: Inflation, measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), decelerated to 23.06 per cent year-on-year in February from 28.34pc in the preceding month due to a slight decrease in the prices of food products.
It is the lowest reading in 20 months, down from a peak of 37.97pc in May 2023.
Until December 2023, the headline inflation had consistently hovered around 29pc for three consecutive months. It was mainly due to escalating prices of essential kitchen items, along with increases in gas and electricity rates. However, starting from January 2024, the inflation rate has begun to show a downward trend.
 
 

In February, the food index fell 1.62pc month-on-month due to a drop in the price of perishable and non-perishable products. This is one of the key reasons for the minor reduction in total inflation, while other groups continued to rise.
The first eight months’ average inflation for FY24 was recorded at 27.96pc compared to 26.19pc during the corresponding period last year. This exceeds the government’s projection of 21pc.
The IMF has also forecast the average inflation for FY24 at 25.9pc, a significant easing from the previous year’s 29.6pc.
The month-on-month inflation showed no change, the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics reported on Friday. The inflation was recorded at 31.5pc in February 2023.
The headline inflation has remained elevated since mid-2022 after the PMLN-led coalition government took several measures demanded by the IMF to unlock stalled funding.
The urban inflation in February was 24.9pc year-on-year and 0.2pc month-on-month, down from 30.2pc  and 2.4pc in January. The rural inflation was 20.5pc YoY and a decline of 0.3pc MoM in February, down from 25.7pc YoY and 1.9pc MoM in January.
The goods and services in the CPI basket are divided into 12 major components with different weights. The indexes for the two groups with the highest weight — “food and non-alcoholic beverages” and “housing, water, electricity, gas, and fuels” — both saw an annual increase of over 19.04pc and 43.78pc, respectively, in February.
Food, core inflation
Food inflation for February stood at 20.02pc in urban areas and 19pc in rural areas, whereas non-food inflation was 28.2pc in urban areas and 22.1pc in rural areas.
Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, slightly declined to 15.5pc in urban areas compared to 17.8pc last month. In rural areas, core inflation was recorded at 21.9pc, down from 24.6pc.
Main contributors
In urban areas, the food items whose prices saw the highest increase in February on a month-on-month basis included fresh fruits (6.87pc), honey (3.18pc), fish (3.14pc), besan (2.47pc), pulse moong (2.16pc), pulse gram (1.48pc), meat (1.23pc), gram whole (1.15pc), condiments and spices (1.06pc), beverages (0.75pc), dry fruits (0.60pc), pan prepared (0.46pc), beans (0.45pc), rice (0.45pc) and pulse mash (0.34pc).
MoM decline was recorded in prices of eggs (32.27pc), tomatoes (25.02pc), onions (7.98pc), tea (7.87pc), potatoes (5.63pc) and cooking oil (0.99pc).
In the non-food category, increase was observed in gas charges (10.04pc), motor fuel (3.53pc), furniture and furnishing (1.78pc), appliances/articles/products for personal care (1.06pc), household servant (1.03pc), electricity charges (0.90pc), cleaning and laundering (0.83pc), personal grooming services (0.80pc), solid fuel (0.79pc) and transport services (0.68pc).
A decline is observed in non-food category of Liquefied Hydrocarbons (1.69pc) and Stationery (0.11pc).

3,Merchandise exports grow for sixth month,Trade gap narrows 30pc in 8MFY24.,"ISLAMABAD: Merchandise exports maintained a bullish trend for the sixth consecutive month as shipments grew year-on-year by 17.54 per cent to $2.57 billion in February, indicating a recovery of export-led industrial growth.
According to data released by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics on Friday, the exports increased by 9pc to $20.35bn in the first eight months of FY24 from $18.67bn in the same period last year.
The trade deficit narrowed year-on-year by 1.95pc to $1.71bn in February. The overall trade deficit in eight months decreased by 30.18pc to $14.87bn as compared to $21.29 in the previous year.
The IMF’s first review of the $3bn Stand-by Arrangement projects Pakistan’s export proceeds over the next five years to be much less than the commerce ministry’s ambitious $100bn goal by the end of FY28.

Trade gap narrows 30pc in 8MFY24

The fund anticipates Pakistan’s exports will increase gradually from $30.84bn in FY24 to $32.35bn in FY25, $34.68bn in FY26, $37.25bn in FY27 and $39.46bn in FY28.
 
 

Caretaker Commerce Minister Gohar Ejaz said in a statement Pakistan remains committed to implementing policies that promote export-oriented industries, diversify export markets, and attract foreign direct investment. These efforts are expected to further improve Pakistan’s trade balance in the coming months.
“Our exports are now diversifying as manufacturing and engineering exports grew 15pc and agriculture and food exports witnessed a robust expansion of 70pc,” Mr Ejaz commented.
 






He further said while this is a positive development, there is a need for continued vigilance. “We must maintain our focus on policies that boost competitiveness and streamline trade processes,” the minister further said.
He said these positive trends reflect the caretaker government’s commitment to promoting trade and economic growth.
The commerce ministry has yet to announce the strategic framework to provide regional competitive energy pricing, working capital support, speedy refund payments, enhanced market access, and diversification of products.
At the same time, imports also rose by 8.89pc to $4.28bn in February from $3.93bn in the same month last year. The import bill fell 11.87pc to $35.22bn in July-February FY24 from $39.96bn over the corresponding months last year.

4,"Lower output, imported cars dent vendor sector","“However, the hopes are pinned on the new government for sustainable recovery,” says chairman of Thermosole Industries.","ISLAMABAD: The automobile vendor industry is facing tough challenges due to low production and a surge in the import of used cars, but the potential growth in the auto sector, driven by new entrants, is expected to provide a boost in the near future.
Auto sector vendors urged the government to ensure policy consistency, stating that the supply and demand crisis in the local auto industry has led to frequent plant shutdowns for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), negatively impacting vendors overall.
Nabeel Hashmi, chairman of Thermosole Industries (Pvt) Ltd, said that the local vendor industry has been consistently in turmoil due to economic conditions, soaring vehicle prices, and political uncertainty. 
“Weak demand, coupled with issues in LCs in the recent past, has had a serious effect on current businesses, while heavy imports of used cars are contributing factors to the industry’s plight,” he said.
At the same time, he added that the local auto industry has started to show signs of recovery after witnessing an average 50 per cent decline for continuous 18 months, which, in turn, will prove beneficial to the vendors’ industry. 
“However, the hopes are pinned on the new government for sustainable recovery,” Mr Hashmi added.
As the vendors expressed concerns that their heavy investments into the upgradation of their facilities for overall localisation, which includes procuring machinery and tools to make metal and non-metal parts locally, were being underutilised. 
They added that the significant investments in the latest machinery and infrastructure were underutilised, as the plants were currently operating at less than 60-70pc capacity due to low-capacity volumes and supply chain disruptions.
Another vendor stated that from July to January in the current fiscal year FY24, more than 21,874 used cars were imported, whereas in the same time period last year, only 2,990 used cars were imported.

5,"Pak Suzuki delivers shocking Rs180,000 price hike","Raises price of Alto VX to Rs2.331m, Cultus VXR to Rs3.858m and Swift GL MT to Rs4.421m.","KARACHI: Despite a stronger rupee in the last five months, Pak Suzuki Motor Company Ltd (PSMCL) on Friday shocked buyers with a massive price hike of Rs65,000-180,000 for various models.
In the first week of September 2023, one dollar was trading at Rs307.10 in the interbank market as compared to the current rate of Rs279.19, thus bringing down the landed cost of imported parts and accessories.
Without mentioning any reason of price hike in the circular issued to the authorised dealers, PSMCL has enhanced the price of Suzuki Alto VX, VXR, VXR AGS and VXL AGS to Rs2.331 million, Rs2.707m, Rs2.894m and Rs3.045m from Rs2.251m, Rs2.612m, Rs2.799m and Rs2.935m, up by Rs80,000-95,000.
 
 

With a jump of Rs110,000-180,000, the new prices of Suzuki Cultus VXR, VXL and AGS models are Rs3.858m, Rs4.244m and Rs4.546m versus Rs3.718m, Rs4.084m and Rs4.366m.
Suzuki Swift GL MT, GL CVT and GLX CVT now carry new price tags of Rs4.421m, Rs4.719m and Rs5.125m as compared to Rs4.366m, Rs4.654m and Rs5.040m, up by Rs65,000-85,000.
Justifying the price hike, PSMCL’s Head of Corporate Affairs Shafiq Ahmed Sheikh claimed that the company had not increased the prices for over a year despite suffering huge losses due to suspension of production for several reasons.
He said given inflation, overhead expenses, increasing raw material and accessories costs and shipment/freight charges have made it very difficult for Pak Suzuki to hold the current selling prices.
In addition to the Red Sea situation, it was difficult for the company to control prices due to higher freight expenses. He claimed that the company had passed a minimal portion to the consumers while it was absorbing the major portion of higher costs.

The index remained in the positive territory for most of the session but the trading volume shrank further over the previous day.
The inflation slowed to 23.6pc in February from 28.34pc in January also revived market expectations of a cut in interest rate in the upcoming monetary policy review.
Topline Securities Ltd said the election of PMLN’s Ayaz Sadiq as speaker of the National Assembly improved investor sentiment suggesting that the new government has the desired numbers if there is support from all coalition parties to take tough and unpopular decisions to put the economy on the right track. 
The continuous buying by foreign corporates and mutual funds during the outgoing week also reflected the restoration of foreigners’ confidence in the economy as the International Monetary Fund has already announced to work with the new government to ensure macroeconomic stability in Pakistan.
As a result, the KSE-100 index closed at 65,325.68 points after gaining 747.16 points or 1.16 per cent from the preceding session.
The overall trading volume dipped 18.82pc to 344.22 million shares. The traded value also fell 21.50pc to Rs13.38bn on a day-on-day basis.
Stocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included Kohinoor Spinning Mills Ltd (71.35m shares), K-Electric (19.42m shares), Treet Corporation (17.47m shares), WorldCall Telecom Ltd (12.46m shares) and Cnergyico (9.60m shares).
Shares registering the biggest increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Rafhan Maize Company Ltd (Rs450.00), Mari Petroleum Ltd (Rs113.50), Nestle Pakis­tan (Rs90.00), Philip Mor­ris (Rs52.00) and Pakistan Services Ltd (Rs47.20).
Companies registering the biggest decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Khyber Tobacco Company Ltd (Rs26.32), Mehmood Texti­le (Rs17.72), Bata Pakistan (Rs17.00), Al-Ghazi Tractor Ltd (Rs14.24) and Abbott Laboratories Pakistan Ltd (Rs11.24).
Foreign investors remained net buyers as they picked shares worth $0.85m.
