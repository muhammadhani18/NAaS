0,"Amid voter apathy in Iran, incumbents set to tighten grip after polls",Partial results expected today; state media portrays ‘good’ turnout.,"DUBAI: Iranians voted for a new parliament on Friday, in an election seen as a test of the clerical establishment’s legitimacy at a time of growing frustration over economic woes and restrictions on political and social freedoms.
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has called voting a religious duty, was among the first to cast his vote in Iran.
“Vote as soon as possible ... today the eyes of Iran’s friends and ill-wishers are on the results. Make friends happy and disappoint enemies,” Khamenei said on state television.
The election is the first formal measure of public opinion after anti-government protests in 2022-23 spiralled into some of the worst political turmoil since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. 

Partial results expected today; state media portrays ‘good’ turnout

Iran’s rulers need a high turnout to repair their legitimacy, badly damaged by the unrest. But official surveys suggest only about 41pc of eligible Iranians will vote. Turnout hit a record low of 42.5pc in the 2020 parliamentary election, while about 62pc of voters participated in 2016.
State TV, portraying a general enthusiastic mood with live coverage from across Iran interspersed with patriotic songs, aired footage of people braving snow to vote in some towns and villages. Several people told state TV that they were voting  “to make the supreme leader happy”. 
Over 15,000 candidates were running for the 290-seat parliament. Partial results may appear by Saturday.
Activists and opposition groups were distributing the hashtags #VOTENoVote and #Election­Circus widely on the social media platform X, arguing that a high turnout would legitimise the Islamic Republic.
Officials said the participation was  “good”, state media reported, but witnesses said most polling centres in Tehran and several other cities were lightly attended. A two-hour extension of voting announced by state TV was followed shortly by another two-hour extension — taking the close of voting to 18.30 GMT — to allow late-comers to cast ballots.
“I am not voting for a regime that has restricted my social freedoms. Voting is meaningless,” said teacher Reza, 35, in the northern city of Sari. 
Imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi, a women’s rights advocate, has called the election a  “sham”.
Crisis and crackdown
The parliament, dominated for over two decades by political hardliners within the religious Islamic Republic, has negligible impact on foreign policy or a nuclear programme that Iran says is peaceful but the West says is aimed at making nuclear arms — issues determined by Khamenei. 
With heavyweight moderates and conservatives staying out and reformists calling the election unfree and unfair, the contest is essentially among hardliners and low-key conservatives who proclaim loyalty to Islamic revolutionary ideals.

1,"Resource extraction could surge 60pc by 2060, UN warns","Enormous expansion of infrastructure, energy demand and consumer consumption over the last half century has driven a tripling of the world’s use of materials, the Global Resource Outlook said.","PARIS: Extraction of Earth’s natural resources could surge 60 per cent by 2060, imperilling climate goals and economic prosperity, the UN said on Friday, calling for dramatic changes in energy, food, transport and housing.
Enormous expansion of infrastructure, energy demand and consumer consumption over the last half century, particularly in wealthier countries, has driven a tripling of the world’s use of materials, according to the Global Resource Outlook by the UN Environment Programme’s Internatio­nal Resource Panel.
And the hunger for natural resources — everything from food to fossil fuels — keeps growing by an average of more than 2.3 per cent per year, it said.
People in wealthy countries drive most of that demand, using six times more materials and responsible for ten times more climate impact than those in low-income countries, according to the analysis.
Extraction and processing of the huge amount of resources accounts for over 60 per cent of planet-warming emissions, the report said, as well as devastating ecosystems and harming human health.
Lead author Hans Bruyninckx said the current trajectory would cause the world to far exceed the temperature limits set out in the 2015 Paris Agreement, in which countries agreed to cap global warming “well below” two degrees Celsius and preferably at 1.5C.
“You’ve got resource use that is increasing, too much impact on Earth systems that is not tenable,” he said, adding that unequal access to resources across the world was also “untenable”.
But he acknowledged that natural resources would be needed “to turn things around”, both to boost development in poorer nations and to provide the minerals and metals needed for the energy transition.
The report follows an agreement by countries at UN climate negotiations last year in Dubai, to triple global renewable energy capacity this decade and “transition away” from polluting fossil fuels.

Shots were heard across the city as authorities battled assailants who had targeted police stations, a police academy and the Toussaint-Louverture International Airport.
“Today, we announce that all armed groups are going to act to get Prime Minister Ariel Henry to step down,” gang leader Jimmy Cherisier, known by the nickname Barbecue, said in a video posted on social media before the attacks began.
“We will use all strategies to achieve this goal,” he said.  “We claim responsibility for everything that’s happening in the streets right now.” 
Armed gangs have taken over entire swaths of the country in recent years, unleashing brutal violence that has left the Haitian economy and public health system in tatters.
At the same time, the Caribbean nation has also been engulfed in widespread civil and political unrest, with thousands taking to the streets in recent weeks to demand Henry step down after he refused to do so as scheduled.
Under a political deal concluded following the assassination of president Jovenel Moise in 2021, Haiti was supposed to hold elections and Henry cede power to newly elected officials by Feb 7 of this year, but that hasn’t happened.
The attacks came as Henry is currently in Kenya, which is moving to head up a multinational mission greenlit by the UN Security Council to help the Haitian police wrest back control of the country.
Schools, universities and businesses halted their activities.

Researchers identified five calf burials conducted by the giant mammals in West Bengal state in 2022 and 2023, according to the study published in the Journal of Threatened Taxa this week.
They found in each case that a herd carried the deceased calf by the trunk and legs before burying it in the earth with its legs facing upward.
“Through opportunistic observation, digital photography, field notes, and post-mortem examination reports, we suggest that the carcasses were buried in an abnormal recumbent style irrespective of the reasons for the calf’s death,” the study said.
In one instance the herd loudly roared and trumpeted around the buried calf, the authors wrote.
The study found only calves are carried away for burial, owing to the “non-feasibility” of transporting heavier adult elephants by the rest of their herds.

4,Australian leader sparks uproar with ‘foreign criminal’ tweet,Ley posted the message after Victoria police arrested a 44-year-old man — a former immigration detainee — and charged him with a number of sexual offences.,"SYDNEY: Australia’s deputy opposition leader is under fire for a post claiming “foreign criminals” are attacking women, after an immigrant was detained for sexual assault — only for police to admit they got the wrong man.
In a tweet condemned by the government as “grubby”, Sussan Ley of the conservative Liberal Party sought to tap into voter concerns about crime and migration ahead of a weekend by-election in Dunkley, Victoria.
“If you do not want to see Australian women being assaulted by foreign criminals, vote against Labour,” the opposition Liberal Party’s deputy leader posted on Thursday on X. The tweet remained on the social media platform despite calls for her to take it down.
Ley posted the message after Victoria police arrested a 44-year-old man — a former immigration detainee — and charged him with a number of sexual offences.
On Thursday, however, police apologised for arresting the wrong man, saying closed-circuit video images later identified a different, similar-looking man as the alleged culprit.

5,"More than one billion now afflicted by obesity, experts say","The “epidemic” is particularly hitting poorer countries and the rate is growing among children and adolescents faster than adults, according to study.","PARIS: More than one billion people around the world are now suffering from obesity, with the number having more than quadrupled since 1990, according to a study released by the Lancet medical journal.
The “epidemic” is particularly hitting poorer countries and the rate is growing among children and adolescents faster than adults, according to the study carried out with the World Health Organisation.
The study, released ahead of World Obesity Day on March 4, estimated that there were about 226 million obese 
adults, adolescents and children in the world in 1990. The figure had risen to 1,038 million in 2022.
Francesco Branca, director of nutrition for health at the WHO, said the rise past one billion people has come  “much earlier than we have anticipated”.
While doctors knew obesity numbers were rising fast, the symbolic figure had previously been expected in 2030.
Researchers analysed the weight and height measurements of more than 220 million people in more than 190 countries to reach the estimates, Lancet said.
They estimated that 504 million adult women and 374 million men were obese in 2022. The study said the obesity rate had nearly tripled for men (14 per cent) since 1990 and more than doubled for women (18.5 per cent).
Some 159 million children and adolescents were living with obesity in 2022, according to the study, up from about 31 million in 1990.
The chronic and complex illness is accompanied by a greater risk of death from heart disease, diabetes and certain cancers. Being overweight increased the risk of death during the coronavirus pandemic.
Countries in Polynesia and Micronesia, the Caribbean, the Middle East and North Africa have suffered more from the rise.
“These countries now have higher obesity rates than many high-income industrialised countries, especially those in Europe,” the study said.
“In the past we have tended to think of obesity as a problem of the rich, now a problem of the world,” said Branca, who highlighted the fast lifestyle changes in low and middle-income countries.
Eating badly helps obesity 
The “very rapid transformation of the food systems is not for the better”.
Majid Ezzati of Imperial College London, the study’s lead author, said there were signs that obesity was levelling out in some southern European countries such as France and Spain, “especially for women”.
But he said that in most countries there are more people suffering from obesity than being under-weight, which the study said had fallen since 1990.
While not eating enough is the main cause of being under-weight, eating badly is a prime factor for obesity.
“This new study highlights the importance of preventing and managing obesity from early life to adulthood, through diet, physical activity, and adequate care, as needed,” said WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
He added that “getting back on track” to meet global targets for cutting obesity rates “requires cooperation of the private sector, which must be accountable for the health impact of their products”.
The WHO has supported taxes on sugary drinks, limiting the marketing of unhealthy foods to children and increasing subsidies for healthy foods.

Using tractors and bales of hay, farmers briefly brought traffic to a halt on the famed avenue near the Arc de Triomphe monument, only a short distance from President Emmanuel Macron’s office, the Elysee.
The protesters, who held up banners on the avenue, said their action was aimed “at saving French agriculture”.
Farmers across Europe have been protesting for weeks over what they say are excessively restrictive environmental rules, competition from cheap imports from outside the European Union and low incomes.
Farmer Axel Masson said about 100 of his peers had gathered at the arterial roundabout “in a peaceful and law-abiding manner”.
Some of the protesters handed out bags of potatoes to motorists stuck in crawling traffic around the Arc de Triomphe.
Several were seen chatting with police officers before the arrests.
“The Rural Coordination takes over the Arc de Triomphe symbolically and peacefully,” the farmers’ union said earlier in a statement on social media platform X, adding that it was a cry to “save” agriculture in France.
It said it “wants quick action to save 45 per cent of our farms which are in financial distress”.

MONTREAL: Former Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney, who made his political mark in the 1980s with the signing of a ground-breaking free trade agreement with the United States that later expanded to include Mexico, died on Thursday. He was 84.
“It is with great sadness we announce the passing of my father,” Caroline Mulroney, a politician in Ontario, said on X. “He died peacefully, surrounded by family.” 
Brian Mulroney, Can­ada’s last Cold War leader, opposed apartheid in South Africa and helped secure a landmark treaty on acid rain with Washington.
But he brought in a consumption tax still reviled by Canadians to this day, and his efforts to drive constitutional reform, in large part to bring wayward Quebec into the fold, ended in failure.
A lawyer by training, Mulroney was ambitious and charming, with twinkling blue eyes and a baritone voice. He was at ease in both of Canada’s official languages, French and English.
He briefly came out of retirement to advise current Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on a revamped continental trade deal.
“I’ll never forget the insights he shared with me over the years — he was generous, tireless and incredibly passionate,” Trudeau said.
Born on March 20, 1939, in Quebec to a family with Irish roots, Mulroney entered university at 16, where he first got 
involved with the Progr­essive Conservatives (now known as the Conservative Party).

8,"Hamas, other Palestinian groups stress ‘unity’ at Moscow talks","RAMALLAH: Palestinian factions, including Hamas and Fatah, said on Friday they would pursue  “unity of action” ...","RAMALLAH: Palestinian factions, including Hamas and Fatah, said on Friday they would pursue  “unity of action” in confronting Israel after representatives met at Russia-hosted talks.
The meeting in Moscow on Thursday brought together Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Fatah and other Palestinian groups for talks on the war in Gaza and an eventual post-war period.
It came on the heels of the resignation of the Palestinian Authority government, which is led by Fatah and based in the occupied West Bank.
Outgoing prime minister Mohammad Shtayyeh called for intra-Palestinian consensus as he announced the resignation, and some analysts said the development could pave the way for a government of technocrats that could operate in the West Bank and Gaza after the war.
Arab and Western leaders have been pushing for reforms to the Palestinian Authority as they discuss possible reconstruction efforts.
A statement on Friday by the Palestinian factions represented in Moscow said there would be an  “upcoming dialogue” to bring them under the banner of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO).
Thursday’s  “constructive” talks saw agreement on points including the need for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and the creation of a Palestinian state, the statement said.
The PLO is internationally recognised as representing Palestinians in the Palestinian territories and diaspora.
Discussions in recent years about integrating Hamas into the PLO have ended in failure.
In recent years, Moscow has strived to maintain good relations with all actors in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, including Fatah and Hamas.

9,Deadlocked WTO talks drag on with no breakthrough,"“I think we’re leaving here empty-handed,” one delegate said.","ABU DHABI: World Trade Organisation (WTO) negotiators extended talks again in Abu Dhabi on Friday as they struggled to break a political deadlock after five days of high-level negotiations.
It was far from clear whether a consensus could be reached among the WTO’s 164 members before the new deadline of late night. Several delegates warned that countries remained far apart as organisers announced a fifth extension.
“I think we’re leaving here empty-handed,” one delegate said.
On the fifth day of the ministerial meeting, most ministers had already gone home, with only India’s Piyush Goyal and European Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis staying back. Goyal was smiling and shaking hands outside a meeting room barely 30 minutes from an informal ministerial meeting, as delegates gathered in small groups next to a coffee stand.
Delegates were seen earlier huddled outside meeting rooms, drinking coffee while others were poring over documents or typing urgently on mobile phones. 
Negotiators released new draft deals on Friday, which showed that all-night talks failed to reach a breakthrough. The biennial high-level meeting of trade ministers from around the world is seeking to revise global commerce rules on a broad range of issues from fishing and farming to e-commerce.
A document circulated by the WTO said, “Time is running out”. “It is everyone’s hope that this postponement allows reaching agreement,” it said.

10,Texas battling ‘largest wildfire in its history’,"HOUSTON: Texas emergency crews were struggling on Thursday to contain the largest wildfire in the state’s history,...","HOUSTON: Texas emergency crews were struggling on Thursday to contain the largest wildfire in the state’s history, with the blaze leaving at least one person dead and scorching a million acres as it raged out of control.
The Texas A&M Forest Service said six major fires, fueled by winter heat and ferocious winds, were actively burning, five of them across the state’s northern area known as the Texas panhandle.
The largest, the Smokehouse Creek Fire, started on Monday, grew to a record 1,075,000 acres (435,000 hectares) in size, and was just three percent contained, the forest service said.
With Smokehouse Creek merging with another blaze, it has now become the state’s largest-ever wildfire, surpassing the East Amarillo Complex disaster that torched 907,000 acres in 2006. While preventive evacuations were ordered across multiple localities, the body of an 83-year-old woman was found in the city of Stinnett, a Hutchinson County emergency services spokesperson, Deidra Thomas, told ABC News.
She also said about 20 structures in Stinnett had been razed by the fire.
Governor Greg Abbott on Tuesday issued a disaster declaration for 60 Texas counties, a move that frees up resources to battle the fires.
President Joe Biden, while visiting the southern border, told reporters that 500 federal personnel were working on fire suppression in Texas.
