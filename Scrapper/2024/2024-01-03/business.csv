0,Exports rise to 18-month high,Trade deficit shrinks over 40% reaching $1.7 billion in December,"Pakistan’s trade deficit contracted by over 40% last month due to a continued tight lid on imports and, for the first time, a better performance in exports in this fiscal year that crossed $2.8 billion – the highest mark in one and a half years.
The trade deficit – the gap between export receipts and import payments – shrank to $1.7 billion in December over a year ago, reported the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics on Tuesday. In absolute terms, there was a $1.1 billion reduction in the deficit – equal to the last International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan tranche – due to a combination of a healthy trend in exports and tight control over imports.
On a year-on-year basis, in December, exports amounted to $2.81 billion, higher by $511 million, or 22.2%, compared to the same month of last year. It was the highest monthly inflow of exports since June 2022 when the country received $2.9 billion. However, Pakistan had not maintained the momentum built in June 2022, and since then, exports were hovering around $2.5 billion on average.
Imports dropped 12.2% and remained in the vicinity of $4.5 billion last month. As a result, the trade deficit narrowed by 40% to $1.7 billion in December. Pakistan has been struggling hard to secure non-debt creating inflows on a sustainable basis aimed at lessening its dependence on foreign debt. The country needs, on average, $25 billion to $30 billion every year, at least for the next three years, to repay the maturing debt and finance the current account deficit.
The foreign exchange reserves remain low, standing at $7.7 billion, on the back of a few major injections by the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. The IMF is expected to approve the second loan tranche of $700 million next week.
The government has hoped to contain imports to less than $55 billion and to earn $30 billion in exports during the current fiscal year. This still leaves it with a gap of $25 billion to be bridged through foreign remittances. Foreign direct investment has not yet started picking up.
During the first half of the fiscal year, the gap between imports and exports further shrank to $11.1 billion, according to the national data collecting agency. The trade deficit was $5.8 billion or over 34% less than the comparative period of the last fiscal year, it added.
The continued tight control over imports has lessened the pressure on foreign exchange reserves. The low available financing leaves the government with no option but to keep managing international trade.
The IMF has so far not created any issue over the restrictions that Pakistan placed on imports. During the recent review talks, the IMF has cut its projections for the current account deficit and imports. But the latest statistics indicate that imports may now remain even lower than the already downward revised projections by the global lender.
Read Exports increase by 8% in June
During the July-December period, Pakistan imported $26.2 billion worth of goods, down by $5.1 billion, or a little over 16%, compared with the same period last year. Imports during the first six months were equal to only 45% of the new IMF projection of $58.4 billion that it would release next week. The IMF had not accepted the finance ministry’s projection of imports worth $54.5 billion during this fiscal year.
Effectively, every saved dollar through the reduction in imports is taking the pressure off the reserves that still remain at a critical level, equal to only 1.5 months of import cover. The curb on imports does have implications for the country’s economic growth and inflation. The IMF has also lowered the economic growth forecast to 2% for this fiscal year after it remained negative 0.2% in the previous year.
The PBS stated that exports picked up during the July-December period and stood at nearly $15 billion. There was a $740 million increase in exports in six months – slightly more than the next loan tranche that the IMF would approve on January 11th.
The six months’ exports were equal to 49% of the IMF’s downward revised projection of $30.6 billion. On a month-on-month basis, the trade deficit also narrowed down by 13.4%. Exports increased by 9.2% to just over $2.8 billion last month compared to November. Imports remained almost flat at $4.5 billion.
The rupee swings continue post the IMF talks. After peaking at Rs288 to a dollar, it has again started marginally appreciating on a daily basis, and its value has now dropped below Rs282.

1,PBC advocates long-term reforms in IMF negotiations,Urges incoming govt to take sustainable measures for economic revival,"When the new government will prepare to negotiate the 24th programme with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Pakistan Business Council (PBC) has emphasised the need for long-term and reform-focused agreements. In its agenda for the incoming government, the PBC rejects short-term conditionality-laden programmes and urges a commitment to sustainable reforms.
The PBC’s agenda underscores the economic challenges facing Pakistan and asserts that external aid is not a reliable solution. Rather than relying solely on outside assistance, the council suggests achieving revenue goals through measures such as increasing energy tariffs and enhancing tax collection from taxpayers. Notably, the agenda stressed the importance of deep reforms in the energy sector and highlights debt profiling as crucial to alleviating default concerns and restoring confidence.
The document makes it clear that the new government must address economic issues without providing extensive concessions. The PBC advocates for limited direct subsidies through the Benazir Income Support Fund, underscoring that subsidised industries should strive for self-sufficiency.
Competitive energy tariffs are identified as essential for reviving the local industrial sector, with the agenda calling for the removal of underlying defects. To address the current account deficit, the PBC recommends increasing export volume rather than relying on temporary measures like restricting imports.

The promotion of value addition in Pakistan is seen as a key strategy for enhancing competitiveness and expanding exports. The agenda stresses the importance of investing in vocational training to boost workforce productivity, given the significant population growth and the lowest workforce strength in South Asia.
The agenda highlighted the inevitability of expanding the tax net, but it cautioned against burdening taxpayers excessively. Instead, it encourages a focus on reducing debt dependence through judicious cuts in non-development expenditures and efficient use of development expenditures.
Provinces levying property and agricultural taxes are suggested to receive concessions in the National Finance Commission (NFC). The agenda recommends the closure or sale of loss-making public institutions, arguing that the country can no longer afford their financial drain. Additionally, the private sector is urged to prioritise international markets over domestic ones and invest in sectors like agriculture, mining, tourism, and import-reducing projects.
Finally, the agenda highlighted the perennial challenge of ensuring food security for a growing population and its impact on the trade deficit. Pakistan’s status as a food-importing country necessitates strategic investments in seeds, technology, finance, and cold chain storage to ensure a sufficient and affordable food supply—an essential component for any robust economic indicator.

2,High prices drive down oil demand,Petroleum consumption dips 7% to 1.24m tons in December,"The demand for petroleum products dropped 7% to 1.24 million tons in December 2023, driven down by elevated prices of petrol and diesel and a significant reduction in consumption of expensive furnace oil in power plants.
Citing data of the Oil Companies Advisory Council (OCAC), local research houses reported that the demand for petroleum products had been 1.34 million tons in the same month of the previous year.
Cumulatively, in the first half (Jul-Dec) of the current fiscal year, the consumption of oil products dipped 15% to 7.69 million tons as compared to 9.03 million tons in the same period of last year.
Talking to The Express Tribune, Akseer Research Director Mohammad Awais Ashraf said that Pakistan saw a drop in consumer demand for petrol and diesel mainly due to the surge in their prices over the past one year. 
He said that on average petrol price increased 24% in one year to Rs276 per litre as compared to Rs216 per litre a year ago. Similarly, diesel price surged 20.5% to Rs276 per litre as opposed to Rs229 per litre a year ago.
Moreover, a slowdown in industrial output including power generation explained why the demand for petroleum products – mainly furnace oil and diesel – shrank in December and in the first half of FY24. The director said the price spike came after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) asked the government under its loan programme to withdraw the consumer subsidy on oil products and keep adjusting petroleum prices in line with the global trend.
Read Oil prices set to end year 10% lower
Besides, rupee depreciation of almost 20% in 2023 also pushed energy prices to higher levels as Pakistan met over 70% of energy demand through imports. He, however, pointed out that at present prices were notably lower compared to the record high seen in the recent past. Falling international oil prices and the return of stability to rupee-dollar exchange rate helped pass on benefits to end-consumers.
He pointed out that furnace oil demand declined significantly after the government decided to phase out the expensive option for power generation. The arrival of a new and cheaper nuclear power plant and local coal-fired power plants helped get rid of furnace oil.
The research house director projected that the consumption of petroleum products would stabilise around current levels ahead of the expected bumper crop of wheat this season (October 2023 to March 2024) and because of the turnaround in cotton crop.
“The demand for petroleum products will remain 14-15% lower in the full current fiscal year compared to FY23.” However, prices were expected to remain near and around current levels in the second half (Jan-Jun) of FY24, he said.

The privatisation of the HEC concluded with the formal handover of share certificates to the buyer, IMS Engineering. The ceremony took place in the presence of the Caretaker Federal Minister for Privatisation, Fawad Hasan Fawad, as announced by the Privatisation Ministry on Tuesday.
Mahmoud Haq, Chairman of IMS Engineering, shared the company’s plans for HEC. The focus is on better utilisation, aiming for exports ranging from $250 million to $300 million within the next two to three years. IMS Engineering plans to replace the current setup with state-of-the-art German-made machinery and equipment.

4,Stocks slip over high inflation reading,"KSE-100 index dips 312.18 points, settles at 64,349.60","Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Tuesday experienced a downturn, following a highly bullish session a day ago, primarily owing to dismal data revealing that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) surged to 29.7% year-on-year (YoY) in December 2023.
In the morning, the trading session began on a robust note, touching intra-day high at 65,333.69 points while building the momentum on the previous gains. However, very soon, the market saw a rapid decline influenced by a number of factors.

The index experienced rapid fluctuations throughout the day, ultimately declining to the intra-day low at 64,213.62 points. It was unable to maintain the 65,000 mark and closed near the day’s low with modest losses.
“Stocks closed lower amid dismal data on CPI inflation that surged 29.7% YoY in December 2023,” said Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti.
“Slump in global equities, pre-poll uncertainty and investor concerns over whopping losses of the ailing SOEs played the role of catalysts in bearish close of the market.”
At close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded a decrease of 312.18 points, or 0.48%, and settled at 64,349.60.
Topline Securities, in its report, stated “Pakistan equities’ market concluded at 64,349, reflecting a decline of 312 points”.
“Throughout the trading day, the index demonstrated volatility within a range of 1,120 points, reaching intra-day high of 65,333.70 (+671.92) and low of 64,213.63 (-448.16) points,” it said.

5,Cement sector sees 4.6% growth in dispatches,"Exports experience 155.85% surge, reflecting positive momentum","Cement dispatches, in December 2023, witnessed a robust increase of 4.63%, totalling 4.06 million tonnes compared to 3.881 million tonnes in the same period of the previous fiscal year. Data from the All Pakistan Cement Manufacturers Association (APCMA) revealed that local cement dispatches during the month reached 3.536 million tonnes, showing a decline of 3.81% compared to December 2022. However, exports surged significantly by 155.85%, reaching 524,656 tonnes, a massive increase from the 205,061 tonnes recorded in December 2022.

6,Enforcement of track & trace system stressed,Large-scale smuggling of foreign cigarettes causing revenue loss,"While expressing concerns over widespread smuggling of foreign cigarettes, policymakers have called for deploying a track and trace system effectively and bringing the informal sector to the tax net.
During discussions in a recent meeting of the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC), the policymakers observed that tobacco was a major unorganised sector.
They noted that a very little amount of taxes was being collected from the formal tobacco sector owing to large-scale smuggling of foreign cigarettes, which was not under the tax net.
They underlined the dire need for taking effective measures to stop smuggling and bring the informal tobacco sector to the tax net to increase the country’s revenue. In this regard, they suggested, the track and trace system should be effectively deployed.
During a briefing, British American Tobacco (BAT) Group Area Head of Legal and External Affairs, Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa (WEST) Mona Iskandarani urged the government for a critical need for the proper implementation of track and trace system to combat the sale of smuggled and illicit cigarettes.
She emphasised that the success of the system would depend on its application across the board coupled with a sustained enforcement drive to control the sale of smuggled and illicit cigarettes. The formal cigarette industry insists that delay in enforcement of track and trace system is causing significant losses and has called for strict enforcement measures.
Though the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has taken some measures, the industry demanded sustained efforts across the supply chain to combat the illicit cigarette trade.
Read PM terms smuggling ‘existential threat’
Despite a 15-month lapse since the end of the deadline, only two out of over 40 cigarette manufacturers have implemented the track and trace system.
Shockingly, since its implementation in July 2022, the illicit sector’s share had grown from 37% in financial year 2021-22 to 63% by the end of 2023-24. This increase is expected to cause a revenue loss of Rs310 billion to the government in FY24.
Illicit manufacturers openly flout laws by using counterfeit stamps, placing stamps over polypropylene wrapping on cigarette packs, and even applying stamps manually.
The formal industry stressed that this undermined the purpose of the track and trace system, which was aimed at monitoring production volumes. Illicit cigarette packs without graphical health warnings and track and trace stamps were freely available in the market.
Most of the non-duty-paid cigarettes were being manufactured in AJK, requiring stringent enforcement measures at the entry and exit points to prevent the tax-evaded cigarettes from entering the country.
According to industry players, the battle against illicit cigarette trade depends on a swift and comprehensive implementation, coupled with sustained enforcement efforts. It is essential to preserve the integrity of the tobacco industry and protect government revenues.

7,'Not a single issue addressed',"Business leaders criticise decades of neglect, plead for urgent solutions","Despite the formation of a coordination committee two months ago and assurances from the caretaker government, business leaders in Hyderabad lament that not a single issue affecting the city’s business community has been addressed.
They highlight that Site Hyderabad, facing neglect for over two decades, is grappling with numerous issues affecting industrialists and traders. They express frustration, citing civil bureaucracy as more of a hindrance than help. However, they acknowledge the commendable efforts of Caretaker Sindh Chief Minister Justice (retd) Maqbool Baqar and his team, including Sindh’s Caretaker Minister for Industries and Commerce Mohammad Younus Dagha, Sindh’s caretaker Local Government Minister Mobin Jumani, and Sindh Industries and Commerce Secretary Abdul Rasheed Solangi.
On the directive of Sindh’s industry minister, the Coordination Committee was formed two months ago, and two meetings were held. However, business leaders express disappointment as no tangible progress has been observed so far.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, they criticised the consecutive elected governments over the past two decades for their failure to address problems. In contrast, they acknowledge the caretaker setup as more effective for forming committees and conducting meetings to address pending issues.
Hyderabad Chamber of Small Traders and Small Industry (HCSTSI), President, Muhammad Farooq Shaikhani, pointed out that the last elected government of Sindh, led by former chief minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, approved Rs1.1 billion to restore the damaged infrastructure of SITE Hyderabad. This decision was made in response to a fair demand from the entire business community of Hyderabad district. He urged the caretaker chief minister of Sindh to bring up this matter in the upcoming cabinet meeting for prompt release of the funds to resolve the longstanding issue of poor infrastructure.
Read Falling business confidence
He expressed dismay that despite clear instructions from the Sindh chief minister, no technical report has been submitted for the storm and sewage nullah on Auto Bhan Road in Latifabad, known for its commercial activities. Additionally, he highlighted the need for demarcation of 300 acres of land allotted in 2007, for which the cost has already been paid by industrialists.
Concerns are raised about unchecked encroachment in the industrial area of Hyderabad, covering 1,264 acres with approximately 650 industries. He mentioned that a 75-year-old graveyard was established in Tando Yousuf when Hyderabad’s population was 600,000, and now it has surged to 3.5 million. In 1999, 220 acres of land in the Ganju Takkar area were allocated for a graveyard, but unfortunately, no developmental activities, including the construction of a boundary wall, mosque, morgue, and other necessary facilities, have been undertaken. The stakeholders urged that action against the land grabbers were overdue.
Amir Shahab, Chairman of Hyderabad Site Association of Trade and Industry Works Committee, described the terribly dilapidated infrastructure of SITE Hyderabad as a nightmare, where loaded trailers and trucks often overturn due to inadequate infrastructure. He points out the lack of proper street lights, contributing to rising street crimes after sunset.
Shahab pleaded for the implementation of the Express Feeder to ensure uninterrupted power supply to small industries, addressing the challenges posed by prolonged power load shedding. He urged Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (HESCO) to promptly address power issues affecting industrial production and causing delays in fulfilling export orders.
