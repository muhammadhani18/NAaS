0,SC overturns PHC decision on RO’s appointment,CJ says he suspected tactics are being employed to prevent elections,"Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa raised eyebrows at the courts on Tuesday for making decisions on election-related matters without hearing the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), indicating that these decisions could be a tactic to hinder the electoral process.
Accepting an appeal from the ECP, the court overturned the decision of the Peshawar High Court (PHC) regarding the suspension of the returning officer (RO) for PK-91 Kohat constituency of the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Assembly.
Emphasising the importance of due process in electoral matters, Chief Justice Isa questioned how were the courts making decisions without hearing the ECP. He said that he suspected tactics were being employed to prevent the elections.

A three-member bench, led by Chief Justice Isa and including Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar and Justice Musrat Hilali, took up the ECP’s appeal. Earlier, the PHC suspended the appointment of RO for PK-91 Kohat without notifying the ECP.
The ECP’s lawyer informed the court that 31 candidates were vying for PK-91 Kohat, with the nomination papers of 12 candidates had already been scrutinised, those of the remaining 19 candidates were scheduled for scrutiny by January 5.
Accepting the ECP position, the court set aside the PHC decision and remarked that it was understandable that someone objected that the RO was related to some candidate, but it unacceptable that someone wanted the RO of his or her own choice.
At one point, the chief justice said that it was very strange, adding that it was beyond comprehension as to why unnecessary applications were being filed. He added that an RO fell ill and his medical certificate was also on record. When another was appointed, the PHC suspended the appointment.

4,RO summoned over appeal against Nawaz’s nomination papers,Appellant asks whether or not the apex court's decision is binding on all institutions,"An election appellate tribunal on Wednesday summoned the returning officer (RO) on an appeal filed against the acceptance of PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif's nomination papers from NA-130.
The objection raised pertained to Nawaz's lifetime disqualification.
The registrar's office had initially raised objections to the appeal for not annexing the attested copy of the RO's decision, however, Justice Rasaal Hassan Syed of the tribunal removed the objection.
The appellant asked the election tribunal if the nomination papers of an individual who has been disqualified by the Supreme Court can be accepted and whether the judgement of the apex court was not binding on all institutions.
The appellant also questioned the possibility of being restricted from contesting elections without an adverse order from the RO.

The petitioner emphasised the unique nature of the matter, asserting that their nomination papers were rejected without any objection. The petitioner’s counsel argued that their client faced punishment for demanding the nomination papers of Nawaz, against whom objections were intended.
The petitioner implored the tribunal that the RO of constituency NA-130 had first refused to give the petitioner a copy of the nomination papers of Nawaz when he disclosed before him that he wanted to file objections against Nawaz. After the RO’s refusal, he had to file a sole objection that Nawaz’s nomination papers could not be accepted in the presence of lifetime disqualification by the country’s top court.
Furthermore, the petitioner further stated that the RO declined to provide the receipt of the objection. Astonishingly, despite the RO's assurance of no objections against the petitioner, their name was excluded from the final list, while Nawaz had been included in the candidate’s list.
The petitioner appealed to the LHC to overturn the RO's decision, arguing for the exclusion of their name and the rejection of Nawaz's nomination papers due to permanent lifetime disqualification.

5,Letter comes to PTI’s rescue in polls case,"Party manages to convince SC to issue notice to Punjab police chief, chief secretary","The PTI legal team on Wednesday faced a tough time in the Supreme Court when they struggled to provide specific examples of not getting a level playing field in Punjab in the context of the upcoming general election scheduled for February 8.
However, it finally managed to convince the three-member bench, led by Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa, to seek a report from the Punjab police chief as well as chief secretary on the actions they have taken in the light of a letter from the Punjab election commissioner.
In the letter, the polls supervisor for the province had asked the authorities to ensure a conducive environment for all the candidates during submission of nomination papers with returning officers (ROs).
The bench also comprising Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar and Justice Musarrat Hilali took up a contempt petition filed by the PTI against the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and other executive functionaries for not complying with the court’s December 22 order.
PTI counsels—Latif Khosa and Shoiab Shaheen—appeared before the bench, which remained unimpressed with their arguments. The chief justice stopped Khosa from making political statements before the bench several times.

Finally, the PTI lawyers referred to the two-page letter of the Punjab election commissioner.
The people who witnessed the proceedings agreed that if the lawyers had not attached this letter with the petition, they would not be able to convince the SC for issuing notices to the provincial authorities.
Some legal experts said the PTI should engage professional counsels in such matters.
Although the PTI has a big legal team, they said, the majority of them are more interested in contesting elections. Likewise, PTI leaders should strongly condemn the ongoing social media campaign against CJ Isa.
It was visible that the PTI legal team had not come prepared. They said there are two reasons why the PTI is failing to get any big relief from the CJ.
Firstly, the party mostly relies on social media where its supporters put pressure on the judges to get favourable results. Secondly the PTI uses the judicial forum for political gains.
Since 2012, the party has filed several petitions in the apex court on different issues and has remained successful to get relief a number of times. However, their strategy is not working in CJ Isa’s case.
The party has approached the SC in several matters during the incumbent CJ term. However, it is unable to get favourable results. CJ Isa is, however, ensuring that the general elections are held on February 8.

During the hearing, CJP Isa asked PTI lawyers to challenge the ROs orders for rejection of nomination papers in elections tribunals. Even he urged them to file petitions without getting certified copies of the ROs order. The hearing of the case was adjourned till Monday.
Legal experts believe that the matter related to allotment of an election symbol is more important. The
PTI is likely to approach the apex court in this regard.
The fate of this case will decide whether the general elections are held on February 8. Some rival powers do not want the PTI to contest elections with its iconic symbol of a cricket bat.

7,"Over 0.5m illegal immigrants repatriated, Senate told",Interior ministry says close to 1.15m still residing in country,"More than 500,000 illegal immigrants had been repatriated so far under the government’s deportation drive against illegal aliens, the interior ministry informed the Senate on Tuesday. The reply was submitted in response to a question raised by Senator Mohsin Aziz on the number of illegal residents in the country as well as the number of those who were deported.
In Oct 2023, the government had given an ultimatum to all undocumented immigrants, especially the Afghans, to leave the country by Oct 31, warning that in failing to do so they would risk imprisonment and deportation to their respective countries.
After the deadline lapsed, the caretaker government formally initiated a nationwide crackdown to expel illegal foreign nationals, majority of whom were Afghans. As the move prompted criticism from Afghanistan and human rights groups, the government insisted that it was not aimed at any particular ethnic group.

In its reply, the interior ministry elaborated on the number of deportations. “Around 1.7 million illegal aliens are unlawfully living in the country, majority of whom are Afghans. They are living without any legal documentation necessary for staying in the country. Approximately, 541,210 people have been sent back after the cabinet’s approval of the deportation plan for illegal residents,” the ministry said, adding that close to 1.15 million were still residing in the country.
The ministry said that efforts were under way to identify and deport the remaining people. It added that 271,985 people were repatriated via Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and 159,161 through Balochistan. It said that according to data from the Integrated Border Management System, a further 110,064 had also left the country.

8,Dawar's convoy escapes attack in North Waziristan,DPO says search operation against unidentified assailants underway,"Unidentified assailants on Wednesday targeted the convoy of former MNA and National Democratic Movement (NDM) chief Mohsin Dawar in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s North Waziristan. The local police said that while Dawar, who is a candidate from NA-40, was campaigning, his convoy came under fire in Tehsil Miranshah village Tapi.
However, Dawar, shielded by his bulletproof vehicle, remained unharmed during the assault. The police responded swiftly and immediately relocated the politician to a nearby secure location, while law enforcement initiated a search for the assailants. The police revealed that gunfire damaged the front and side windows of Dawar’s car, but the bullet-proofing ultimately safeguarded him from harm, allowing for his secure evacuation to a protected site.

In response, security personnel accompanying former lawmaker engaged in retaliatory firing, forcing the attackers to flee the scene. District Police Office (DPO) Rohan Zaib said that Dawar was provided with full-proof security and he remained unhurt during the attack. He added that a search operation against the unidentified assailants is underway.General Secretary of the NDM, Muzammil Shah Roshan, condemned the attack on Dawar in strong words. Roshan confirmed that the former MNA and other colleagues remained safe during the incident.
 
Today we had a corner meeting of NDM at Tappi village in Miran Shah. At 10:55 as we were entering the village my vehicle got attacked. They began with AK-47s and I could see them preparing an RPG as well, but due to the return firing of my comrades they ran away. 1/4
""We demand an immediate notice of the attack from the Election Commission of Pakistan and the federal government, and we urge them to conduct a thorough investigation,” he added. “Such cowardly attacks cannot dampen our spirits or the spirits of our comrades.” It is pertinent to note that the incident follows another recent event in Mir Ali, where six barbers were tragically killed by unidentified perpetrators on Tuesday. The absence of arrests in this case has created a sense of panic and unease among the local people.

9,ECP indicts Imran and Fawad in contempt case,PTI to challenge indictment inside jail in high court,"The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) indicted former prime minister Imran Khan and former information minister Fawad Chaudhry in a contempt case held inside Adiala Jail on Wednesday. Both Imran and Fawad, detained in Rawalpindi’s renowned prison in connection with different cases, appeared before the four-member bench led by ECP provincial member from Sindh, Nisar Durrani. When the bench read out the charge-sheet, both politicians pleaded not guilty.
The proceedings were attended by ECP’s lawyers and counsels for Imran and Fawad, including Barrister Ali Bukhari, Barrister Umair Niazi, and former minister’s wife, Hiba Fawad. The bench adjourned the case till January 16. Stringent security measures were in place during the contempt case hearing.
After the hearing, lawyer Ali Bukhari mentioned in a media conversation that he informed the ECP about Imran’s leading counsel, Shahid Shoaib's engagement in the Supreme Court. He urged the ECP not to rush and delay the proceedings.

""However, the Election Commission did not postpone the hearing and proceeded with reading out the charges. Our second request was against Imran's trial in jail, but the ECP dismissed it,” he said. The lawyer expressed the party’s determination to challenge the charge-sheet in the high court.
Barrister Umair Niazi stated that the charges were baseless and Imran alleged statement did not constitute contempt for the chief election commissioner (CEC) and the ECP.
He mentioned that Imran Khan informed the bench that his party has approached the Supreme Court against one of the commission members and advocated for that member's removal from the bench. Niazi highlighted that PTI dissolved assemblies in two provinces where it held power to ensure timely elections. “However, the ECP failed in conducting the elections. PTI is being excluded from elections under the London Agreement,"" he claimed.
Hiba Fawad mentioned to the media that during the hearing, it was revealed that a reference was filed against an ECP member who is part of the bench, rendering them unable to preside over this case. She claimed that her husband was not given the opportunity to respond to the ECP’s show cause notice, and the polls supervisory authority rushed to indict him.

“We will, nevertheless, defend ourselves at every level of the case,” she said. PTI leader Asghar Chaudhry informed the press outside the jail that during the proceedings, Imran became furious with the bench. “He [Imran] told the ECP members they are biased and might one day face trial under Article 6 for high treason,” he said, adding that the ECP members were taken aback by this statement.
The ECP initiated contempt proceedings against PTI's former chairman Imran in August 2022, along with former PTI leaders Asad Umar and Fawad Chaudhry, for allegedly using ""intemperate"" language against the CEC and the polls oversight authority.""
