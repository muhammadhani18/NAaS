0,Indian farmers plan new march on Delhi,"Will also block railway lines across the country on March 10, says one protest leader.","NEW DELHI: Indian farmers plan to march to the capital New Delhi on Wednesday as they push their demands for higher crop prices, a protest leader said, after several rounds of failed talks.
Farm union leaders are seeking guarantees of state support or a minimum purchase price for farmers’ produce.
“On March 6, farmers will come to Delhi from all over the country by train, bus and air,” protest leader Jagjit Singh Dallewal told reporters. He said farmers would also block railway lines across the country on March 10.
The protests began in early February with hundreds of farmers in East Punjab aiming to take their campaign to Delhi. They were blocked by police and paramilitary troops at Shambhu, at the border with neighbouring Haryana state, about 200 km from the capital.
The government announces support prices for more than 20 crops each year, but state agencies buy only rice and wheat at the support level, which benefits only about 6 per cent of farmers who raise those two crops.
In 2021, when the administration of Prime Minister Narendra Modi repealed farm laws, the government said it would set up a panel of growers and government officials to find ways to ensure support prices for all farm produce.

1,One-fifth of Mekong River fish species  face extinction,Depleted fish populations will affect millions whose livelihoods rely on the river.,"BANGKOK: One-fifth of fish species in the Mekong river face the threat of ext­inction, according to a new report from a coalition of regional and international environmental groups.
The Mekong — among the world’s most biodiverse rivers, surpassed only by the Amazon and the Congo — is home to some 1,148 recognised spe­cies of fish, with millions of people relying on its waters for their incomes.
But it faces a multitude of threats, according to environmentalists, including dam-building, sand mining, poorly managed fisheries, habitat loss and the introduction of non-native species.
The report said 19 per cent of fish species in the river are seriously threatened by the changes, highlighting how depleted fish populations will affect millions whose livelihoods rely on the river.
“The alarming decline in fish populations in the Mekong is an urgent wake-up call for action,” said Lan Mercado, WWF Asia-Pacific Regional Director.
“We must act now to reverse this disastrous trend because the communities and countries of the Mekong cannot afford to lose them.”

2,Artificial glaciers help stave off drought in Kyrgyzstan,The glacier currently measures five metres high and about 20 metres long. At the height of winter it was 12 metres tall.,"SYN TASH: In the Tian-Shan mountains of Kyrgyzstan, villagers have made an artificial glacier to provide water for their drought-hit farms. Standing on the ice hillock, farmer Erkinbek Kaldanov said he was optimistic about harnessing nature to counteract climate change.
“We won’t have any more problems with water,” said the farmer, who was worried for his sheep last year after some unusual temperature spikes. “When the glacier melts, there will be enough water for the livestock and to water the land in Syn-Tash,” the surrounding district, he said.
The glacier currently measures five metres high and about 20 metres long. At the height of winter it was 12 metres tall.
Local residents made it over a period of two weeks in autumn by re-directing water from the peaks of Tian-Shan, which tower more than 4,000 metres high in northern Kyrgyzstan.
Kaldanov and others are being forced to adapt since natural glaciers in Central Asia — the main water source for the region — are slowly disappearing due to global heating.
A 2023 study in the journal Science predicted that the acceleration in the melting of the glaciers would peak only between 2035 and 2055. The lack of snow, also due to higher temperatures, does not allow them to regenerate.
‘Less and less water’
The extent of the problem can be seen in satellite images of Central Asia and in the regular warnings issued by the United Nations. The problem has a knock-on effect on the lowlands of Central Asia, in more arid countries like Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.
This in turn feeds into existing tensions between the different countries, which still share water resources under a complex and obsolete scheme inherited from the Soviet era.
“There is less and less water every year. The water tables are emptying out, the springs are drying up and we have problems with grazing,” said Aidos Yzmanaliyev, a spokesman for the Syn-Tash farmers.
Finding solutions is urgent, particularly as farming represents around 10 percent of the fragile Kyrgyz economy and two thirds of its inhabitants live in rural areas. In the north of Kyrgyzstan, a country accustomed to revolutions and uprisings, the lack of water has already stoked social tensions in previous periods of drought.

3,Songwriter Raye sweeps Brit Awards,"LONDON: Rising star Raye on Saturday swept the UK’s top music awards, setting a record for winning the most prizes...","LONDON: Rising star Raye on Saturday swept the UK’s top music awards, setting a record for winning the most prizes in a single year.
The 26-year-old singer-songwriter scooped six awards including best artist, R&B act, new artist, song of the year for  “Escapism” and album for  “My 21st Century Blues”.
Her award for best songwriter was pre-announced. Accepting the best new artist award she called the win  “overwhelming”, adding  “this is wild”.
“What is actually happening right now?” a delighted Raye told the audience at London’s O2 arena. “The artist I was three years ago would not believe the sight she is seeing today. 
I’m in control, I’m my own boss now,” she declared. She had made history even before the ceremony started by being nominated for a record seven prizes in one year.
The Londoner, whose real name is Rachel Keen, had been up against six other female artists out of the 10 shortlisted in the gender neutral best artist category following a controversy last year.
Not a single female artist ended up being shortlisted in the category in 2023 after the merging of the best female and male artist categories for the first time a year earlier.
That led Brit Awards chairman Damian Christian to complain about a  “disappointing lack of female representation”, blaming a dearth of eligible 2022 releases by big female stars.
This year the shortlist was extended from five to 10 and included Dua Lipa and Jessie Ware, newcomer Olivia Dean, and Mercury Prize winners Little Simz and Arlo Parks, as well as Raye.

4,UN expresses deep concern over Gaza incident,UNITED NATIONS: The UN Security Council has expressed deep  concern over the tragic incident that unfolded in Gaza ...,"UNITED NATIONS: The UN Security Council has expressed deep  concern over the tragic incident that unfolded in Gaza on Thursday when  more than 100 Palestinians lost their lives, and several hundred  sustained injuries as Israeli troops ope­ned fire on a food convoy. 
The incident occurred at a large gathering surrounding a  humanitarian assistance convoy southwest of Gaza City, with Israeli  forces supervising the process. 
A UNSC statement on Saturday evening called on “all parties to  refrain from depriving the civilian population of the Gaza Strip of  basic services and humanitarian assistance” and to urgently increase aid  deliveries to the war-torn territory. 
An earlier statement, which explicitly blamed the Israeli military  for the disaster, was blocked by the US and replaced with softer  language. A Russian attempt to insert text calling for a ceasefire was  also denied. 
In its latest statement, the council underscored the imperative to  protect civilians and civilian infrastructure, emphasising the  obligation of all parties involved to comply with international law. 
While acknowledging that Israel has initiated an investigation into  the matter, the Security Council called for transparency and  accountability in the process. The statement concluded by urging Israel “to keep the crossings open  to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza, to facilitate the opening of  additional crossings to meet large-scale humanitarian needs, and to  support the rapid and safe delivery of relief items to the population  throughout the Gaza Strip.” 
During the earlier session, Arab nations encountered significant  resistance from the US as they sought support for the statement,  accusing Israeli forces of intentionally targeting and killing Gazans. 
The US Deputy Envoy to the UN, Robert Wood, emphasised the lack of  complete information on the ground as a major challenge. “We don’t have  all the facts on the ground. That’s the problem,” Wood stated following  consultations with the 15-member council. 
Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian Authority’s envoy to the UN, revealed  that 14 members supported the statement drafted by Algeria. In the  aftermath, Mansour held discussions with US Ambassador Linda  Thomas-Greenfield, urging the Security Council to condemn the killings  and pursue those responsible for the alleged massacre.

5,Biden’s border policies seen as ‘conspiracy to overthrow’ US,GREENSBORO: Republican frontrunner Donald Trump accused President Joe Biden on Saturday of engaging in a...,"GREENSBORO: Republican frontrunner Donald Trump accused President Joe Biden on Saturday of engaging in a  “conspiracy to overthrow the United States” through lax security policies that have allowed millions of migrants to stream across the US border with Mexico.
Speaking at a campaign rally in Greensboro, North Carolina, Trump appeared to be suggesting, as he has in the past, that Democrats are hoping to convert migrants who enter the country illegally into reliable voters.
Biden’s administration, Trump contended, seeks to collapse the American system, nullify the will of the actual American voters and establish a new base of power that gives them control for generations.
Trump elaborated at an evening rally in Richmond, Virginia, after repeating the allegations. Referring to the Biden White House, he said,  “They’re trying to sign (migrants) up to get them to vote in the next election.”  Trump also accused Biden of providing  “aid and comfort to foreign enemies of the United States” as part of his border policies.
In response, Biden’s campaign pointed to a border security bill in Congress Trump helped torpedo last month by urging Republicans to vote against it.
“Once again Trump is projecting in an attempt to distract the American people from the fact he killed the fairest and toughest border security bill in decades because he believed it would help his campaign. Sad,” said Biden spokesperson Ammar Moussa.
Under pressure from Republicans who accuse him of failing to control the border, Biden called on Congress last year to provide more enforcement funding and said he would  “shut down the border” if given new authority to turn back migrants.
Last month, however, a bipartisan immigration bill stalled in the US Senate after Trump told Republicans not to support it even though it contained several border-security measures they had sought.
In past statements, Trump has suggested that Democrats are purposefully allowing migrants into the country to grow their political support, a longstanding claim espoused on the far-right known as the great replacement theory.
Only US citizens can vote in federal elections. But Trump has made border security a central tenet of his campaign as polls show voters in both parties becoming increasingly concerned about the steady stream of migration.

6,Ship sunk in Red  Sea attack ‘threatens marine life’,"ADEN: A UK-owned ship attacked by Yemen’s Houthi militants last month sank in the Red Sea, the US military...","ADEN: A UK-owned ship attacked by Yemen’s Houthi militants last month sank in the Red Sea, the US military confirmed on Saturday, as it echoed a warning from Yemen’s internationally-recognised government that the vessel’s cargo of hazardous fertiliser posed a risk to marine life.
The Belize-registered Rubymar is the first vessel lost since the Houthis began targeting commercial ships in November against Israel’s war on Gaza. The Houthis’ drone and missile assaults have forced shipping firms to divert ships to the longer route around southern Africa, disrupting global trade by delaying deliveries and sending costs higher.
The sinking bulk carrier also “presents a subsurface impact risk to other ships transiting the busy shipping lanes of the waterway”, US Central Command (Centcom) said in its statement on social media platform X.
The Iran-aligned Houthis, who control the north of Yemen and other large centres, say their campaign is a show of solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.
Rubymar’s sinking marks the first vessel lost since Houthis began targeting commercial shipping in November. The ship was hit by missiles on February 18 while sailing through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait. The crew then abandoned the vessel and evacuated to safety.
The Houthis say they have been targeting ships linked to Israel, the US and the UK in an attempt to pressure them to end Israel’s war on Gaza
Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, the head of the Houthi supreme revolutionary committee, said that the group held UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his government responsible for the vessel sinking because of their support for the genocide and siege of Palestinians in Gaza.
The Houthi attacks have prompted a series of strikes against their positions by the United States and Britain, and have led other navies to send vessels to the region to try to protect the vital Suez Canal trade route.
The ship sunk by the militants’ attack was carrying about 21,000 metric tons of fertiliser, Centcom said.
Ahmed Awad bin Mubarak, the foreign minister in Yemen’s internationally-recognised government in Aden, said in a post on X: “The sinking of the Rubymar is an environmental catastrophe that Yemen and the region have never experienced before.
“It is a new tragedy for our country and our people. Every day we pay the price for the adventures of the Houthi militia ...” the internationally-recognised Yemen government, backed by Saudi Arabia, said. The Yemen’s government has been at war with the Houthis since 2014.

7,‘Who will call me mother?’: woman mourns twin babies killed during Israeli strike,‘Who will call me mother?’: woman mourns twin babies killed during Israeli strike,"GAZA STRIP: As men searched for survivors beneath a Gaza home pummelled by an air strike, Rania Abu Anza gazed down on Sunday at two children who did not survive: her infant twins.
The Palestinian woman said she had gone through multiple rounds of fertility treatment to achieve her dream of becoming a mother, only to have it taken away by the carnage in the Gaza Strip.
“Who will call me mother from now on? Who will call me mother?” she said through tears on Sunday as she clutched her lifeless babies, the face of one still spattered with blood.
The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said Wissam and Naeem, not yet six months old, were among 14 people killed in the overnight strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, which it blamed on Israel. All of the dead were members of the Abu Anza family.

‘Who will call me mother?’: woman mourns twin babies killed during Israeli strike

They joined the 30,410 fatalities, most of them women and children, reported by the ministry since Israel launched military operations last October. The Israeli military did not immediately respond for comment on the Rafah strike.
‘All of them children’
While Rania Abu Anza waited to bury her son and daughter, back at the rubble of the family home men shouted the names of those they hoped had survived:  “Yasser! Ahmed! Sajjar!” Israel says its campaign is intended to eliminate Hamas fighters, but Shehda Abu Anza, who said the home belonged to his uncle, insisted it housed only civilians.
“They were sleeping at eleven-o-clock at night. All of them children. Honestly there was no military presence in the house, only civilians,” he said.
“No soldiers, only civilians.” Another relative, Arafat Abu Anza, bemoaned the lack of equipment to extract possible survivors. “There are 15 people in the house... I’m cleaning the area. We are trying to extract people, to see where they are. Four floors fell.” 
Nearly 1.5 million Palestinians have sought refuge in Rafah, raising fears of mass casualties should Israel go ahead with a planned invasion of the city. Mediators are trying to lock in a truce that would at least temporarily halt the fighting before Ramazan, which begins on March 10 or 11, depending on the lunar calendar.
Any deal will come too late for Rania Abu Anza, who recounted the chaos of the strike and how she was told her children were gone. “I started shouting, ‘My children, my children,’” she said. “I asked the rescuers to search for my kids in the rubble. They pulled them. 
They told me, ‘Your children are dead.’”

Hundreds of pro-Palestinian demonstrators had gathered in front of the Art Gallery of Ontario, where Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was due to host his Italian counterpart Giorgia Meloni, according to Canadian media reports.
“Due to security concerns, the event was cancelled,” Jenna Ghass­abeh, a spokesperson for the Cana­dian prime minister’s office, said without giving further details. Meloni, whose country holds the rotating presidency of the Group of Seven (G7) nations, is visiting Canada ahead of a leaders’ summit in Italy in June.
Earlier in the day, the two leaders held talks where they discussed what Meloni described as a  “very difficult Middle East crisis”.
According to Canadian public broad­caster CBC, protesters opposed to Canada’s response to the Israeli aggression. Between 200 and 300 demonstrators took part in the protest, according to the CBC.
Videos and photos circulating on social media showed a heavy police presence near the gallery.

9,Iran conservatives secure bulk of seats in elections,"Two days after Friday’s vote for members of parliament, authorities still counting ballots.","TEHRAN: Iranian conservatives secured the bulk of seats in elections for a key clerical body and the national legislature, local media reported on Sunday, estimating a record low turnout.
Authorities were still counting ballots two days after Friday’s vote for members of parliament and for the Assembly of Experts, which selects the Islamic republic’s supreme leader. The election, in which a vetting process barred many hopefuls from running, took place with Iran suffering a severe economic crisis deepened by international sanctions.
The official IRNA news agency put the turnout at around  “41 per cent” among 61 million eligible voters. No official figure had yet been announced.
The reformist daily Shargh predicted the next parliament would be  “in the hands of radical conservatives” who  “took advantage of the opportunity created by the low participation”.

Two days after Friday’s vote for members of parliament, authorities still counting ballots

Etemad, another reformist newspaper, reported that turnout was lower in Iran’s bigger cities than its smaller ones, and that there was a significant number of  “blank votes”.
Fears of a low turnout had swirled ahead of the elections after a state TV poll found more than half of respondents were indifferent about the elections.
‘Wake-up call’
Turnout in the capital Tehran was around 25pc, according to Iranian
media, which reported that ultra-conservative candidates secured 12 of the 30 parliament seats alloted to the capital.
Some seats have gone to a second round, which will take place in either April or May, IRNA reported.
The pro-government Iran Daily said authorities should see the low turnout as a  “wake-up call and redouble their efforts to fortify their support base”.
Reformist daily Ham Mihan said that  “the soul of the elections was lost” and that turnout was  “far from victorious” which could have  “political repercussions” for Iran’s system.
Political analyst Mohammad Mohajeri said conservatives and ultraconservatives will emerge as the main winner in the elections due to  “sharp decline in the participation rate”.
A record figure of 15,200 hopefuls were competing for seats in the 290-member parliament. Another 144 candidates sought a place in the 88-member Assembly of Experts, which is exclusively made up of male scholars.
By allowing a large pool of candidates, the government wanted  “to create local competition and increase participation” to help attract voters, journalist Maziar Khosravi said.
Iran’s 2020 parliament was elected during the Covid pandemic with a turnout of 42.57 per cent — at the time the lowest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Former moderate president Hassan Rouhani cast his ballot on Friday despite his disqualification from running for the Assembly of Experts after 24 years of membership.
Another former president, the reformist Mohammad Khatami, was among those who did not vote, according to a coalition of parties called the Reform Front.
In February, Khatami had said on his official website that Iran is “very far from free and competitive elections”.

10,S. Korean doctors rally as healthcare standoff escalates,The striking professionals have defied a Feb 29 government deadline for them to return to work or face legal action.,"SEOUL: Thousands of South Korean doctors protested on Sunday in Seoul in an escalating standoff with the government over medical training reforms, which has seen junior doctors quit en masse, plunging hospitals into chaos.
Around 10,000 junior doctors quit and stopped working nearly two weeks ago to protest hikes to medical school admissions from next year meant to combat shortages and an ageing society.
The striking professionals have defied a Feb 29 government deadline for them to return to work or face legal action, including possible arrests or suspensions of their medical licenses. The protestors wore black masks and waved signs saying:  “We oppose the medical school admissions increase”.
“The government is pushing the reforms unilaterally and that the doctors can not accept under any circumstances”, Kim Taek-woo of the Korea Medical Association told the crowd of protestors.
“The government is very aware of the reasons why all doctors are opposing the increase in the medical school admissions but are exploiting policies to turn doctors into slaves forever”.
The mass work stoppage has taken a toll on hospitals, with crucial treatments and surgeries cancelled, prompting the government to raise its public health alert to the highest level.
Around half of the surgeries scheduled at some major hospitals have been cancelled since last week, according to the health ministry.
Under South Korean law, doctors are restricted from striking, and the government this week reques­ted police investigate people connected to the stoppage. While the return to work deadline has passed, the government would still  “exercise utmost leniency for trainee doctors if they return to work by the end of today”, Interior Minister Lee Sang-min said on Sunday in a KBS television interview.

11,India to open strategic naval base near Maldives,Relations between the two countries have soured since pro-China President Mohamed Muizzu won elections last year,"NEW DELHI: India’s navy has said it is bolstering forces on  “strategically important” islands close to the Maldives, with a new base set to open just days before Male starts sending home Indian forces.
Relations between India and the Maldives have soured since pro-China President Mohamed Muizzu won elections last year after promising to expel Indian forces.
India is suspicious of China’s growing presence in the archipelago nation, which straddles key east-west international shipping routes, and the new base will extend New Delhi’s  “operational surveillance” of the area, the navy said in a statement late on Saturday.
Muizzu has asked India to withdraw 89 security personnel based in the Maldives to operate reconnaissance aircraft, with the first batch due to leave by March 10 and all to depart within two months.
President Mohamed Muizzu vowed to remove foreign military troops from the island nation. Subsequently, India confirmed that the Indian military personnel in the Maldives will be replaced with technical personnel, underscoring a recalibration of bilateral relations amidst geopolitical dyna­mics in the Indian Ocean region.

Relations between the two countries have soured since pro-China President Mohamed Muizzu won elections last year

The current Muizzu administration is dissatisfied with India’s infiltration into Maldivian internal affairs in terms of security and politics over the years. This is perceived by some in India as the Maldives leaning towards China and distancing itself from India, Qian Feng, director of the research department at the National Strategy Institute at Tsinghua University, told the Global Times.
“Against this backdrop, the passage of the Chinese research vessel further intensifies the suspicion of Indian officials toward the development of China-Maldives relations,” he said. 
The new base, opening March 6 on India’s Lakshadweep islands, will turn an existing small detachment into an  “independent naval unit”, according to the navy’s statement.
India’s Lakshadweep islands lie about 130 kilometres (80 miles) north of the Maldives, with the new naval base on the island of Minicoy situated at their closest point. India’s navy already has a base on the Lakshadweep island of Kavaratti, but the new base will be about 258 kilometres (160 miles) closer to the Maldives.
“Minicoy is the southernmost island of Lakshadweep which straddles the vital sea lines of communications,” the navy said.
It said the base will boost anti-piracy and anti-narcotic operations, and was part of a policy to  “incrementally augment security infrastructure at the strategically important” islands.
“Basing of an independent Naval unit with requisite infrastructure and resources will enhance the overall operational capability of the Indian Navy in the islands. The base will enhance operational reach and facilitate Indian Navy’s operational effort towards Anti-Piracy and Anti-Narcotics Opera­tions in Western Arabian Sea. 
It will also augment Indian Navy’s capability as the first responder in the region and augment connectivity with the mainland. The establishment of a Naval base is in line with the Govt of India’s focus towards comprehensive development of islands,” a government release said.

A Russian drone hit an apartment block in the southern port city early on Saturday morning, partially destroying several floors and leaving more than a dozen people under the rubble. The attack killed at last four children, including two babies less than a year old, according to statements by Zelensky and the regional governor.
“Mark, who was not even three years old, Yelyzaveta, eight months old, and Timofey, four months old,” Zelensky said, naming the youngest victims of the strike in a post on Telegram. “Ukrai­nian children are Russia’s military targets,” he said.
Local officials said the toll could rise further as there were still people una­ccounted for more than 36 hours after the strike. 
There was no comment on the attack in Moscow, which denies targeting civilians despite excessive evidence of Russian stri­kes on residential areas and the United Nations having verified at least 10,000 civilian deaths.
Ukraine’s emergency services said they had found the bodies of families huddled together as they sifted through the rubble on Sunday. “A mother tried to cover her eight-month-old baby with her body. They were found in a tight embrace,” the agency said on Telegram.
Ukraine’s interior ministry separately reported one death and three people wounded in the southern Kherson region, while police said an airstrike on a residential quarter of Kurakhove, a town in the eastern Donetsk region, injured 16.
