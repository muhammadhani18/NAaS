0,"Punjab, Balochistan lead in costly food",Most provincial officials have not even logged into official app to check inflation.,"ISLAMABAD: Punjab and Balochistan are the two most expensive provinces in terms of the gap between actual and prices fixed by district administration of essential food items, according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS).
PBS has ranked the provinces in terms of the gap between the market prices and those set by district administrations. The exercise is aimed at highlighting issues of governance in controlling the prices.
Put differently, the rankings reflect the performance of various chief secretaries, who serve as the administrative heads of provinces.
In Punjab, Faisalabad leads the ranking with an average gap of 60.15 per cent between market prices of essential food items and the rates set by district administrations. This is followed by Multan at 51.41pc, Bahawalpur at 35.46pc and Rawalpindi at 33.34pc.

On the other end of the scale, Lahore exhibits the lowest average gap at 8.39pc, trailed by Sargodha at 10.89pc, Sialkot at 20.53pc and Gujranwala at 21.92pc. This data underscores the significant variations in price regulation across different cities within the same province.
In Balochistan, the city of Quetta recorded a price gap of 46.86pc closely followed by Khuzdar at 46.29pc. It is important to note that the PBS only monitors prices in these two cities within Balochistan.
In Sindh, Karachi leads with a significant price gap of 44.06pc, followed by Hyderabad at 35.29pc. These cities represent urban Sindh. In contrast, in the interior of Sindh, the city of Larkana has a price gap of 24.62pc, with Sukkur trailing closely at 22.94pc.
In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the city of Bannu recorded the highest price gap at 29.66pc, followed by Peshawar at 11.22pc. The PBS only monitors these two cities in the province for comparison.
Meanwhile, in Islamabad, the price gap was recorded at 38.09pc, indicating a lack of effective administration in controlling prices for consumers. This significant discrepancy between market prices of food items and those set by the district administration reflects the poor monitoring by the district administration of the federal capital.
The gaps in prices have been worked out with the help of the Decision Support System for Inflation (DSSI), which reflects the various district administrations’ failure to enforce official prices. The PBS has developed the DSSI to provide information about the prices of essential commodities to the National Price Monitory Committee (NPMC), federal ministries, provincial governments and district administrations.
The DSSI provides a ranking mechanism for districts through which the management at the provincial and federal levels can monitor the price variation on a weekly and monthly basis in 17 major cities of the country.
DSSI monthly report
Amid back-breaking inflation that has remained a cause of concern for the policymakers, high-ranking bureaucrats in two provinces — Sindh and Balochistan — appear least interested in utilising the DSSI, a tool created to monitor the prices of essential consumer goods in the country.
In contrast, the other two provinces — Punjab and KP — showed some interest, with the top bureaucrat from the largest province dedicating the most time to monitoring prices through the DSSI.
The chief secretary of Punjab logged into the DSSI app 21 times in February, while the chief secretary of KP followed with three logins. However, the chief secretaries of Sindh and Balochistan did not log in even once during the same period to monitor the consumer price levels in their respective provinces.
The system is accessible to 17 deputy commissioners in specific districts. Among these, 13, including those from Islamabad, Lahore, Faisalabad, Multan, Hyderabad, Sialkot, Bahawalpur, Peshawar, and Quetta, did not log into the system even one time to oversee consumer prices in 29 days.
The deputy commissioners of Gujranwala, Karachi, Rawalpindi and Sialkot logged into the system only once throughout the month.

1,Exporters reap Rs8 premium per dollar,"Exchange companies not selling dollars, except to travellers.","KARACHI: Fear is high for the appreciation of the dollar as the premium for two months of forward selling has reached Rs8 per dollar, and exchange companies in the open market have halted dollar sales, except for travel purposes.
“This is strange; the exchange rate has been stable for more than a couple of months, but forward selling by exporters is attracting a premium of up to Rs8 per dollar for two months,” said Atif Ahmed, a currency dealer in the inter-bank market.
The perception that the current exchange rate is being managed is growing stronger with the increasing premium on forward selling.
Mr Atif noted that exchange companies are not providing dollars for students, health, and other requirements, even though thousands of students studying abroad require dollars from Pakistan. While exchange companies are allowed to provide dollars for such purposes, they are not bound to arrange dollars for students or health needs.

Exchange companies not selling dollars, except to travellers

Banks are not allowed to provide dollars for travel, student, or health purposes. However, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has been encouraging banks to open their own exchange companies, potentially tightening the availability of dollars for the general public. The SBP has already closed B and C categories of exchange companies and suspended licences of several exchange companies across the country.
“Selling the dollar at premium clearly indicates the fear among dollar holders about devaluation of the local currency in coming months,” said Mr Atif.
However, some experts believe that the expected inflows of $1.2 billion from the IMF by the end of this month or beginning of April could improve Pakistan’s weak balance of payment situation and support the exchange rate.
“I have noted a few complaints about the shortage of dollars in the open market, or exchange companies not selling dollars except for travelling, but there is no shortage of liquidity,” said Zafar Paracha, General Secretary of the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan.
However, he said that the additional charges by banks on the withdrawal of dollars could be a reason why exchange companies are not willing to pay. He explained that banks are charging Rs1.30 per dollar at the time of both deposit and withdrawal.
“I withdrew $100,000 from my own accounts two days back, and my bank charged a $330 fee without justifying the action,” he said. Banks do not impose charges when they are in need of dollars.
There was fear among currency dealers that the shortage of dollars for customers, such as students, would compel needy people to turn to the black market for Hundi and remit the amount they need for the students. The same thing may happen for health issues. 
This is an old trend, and the demand for dollars helped the black market emerge as an alternative supplier in 2023, destroying the exchange rate and devaluing the PKR to Rs340 in the open market and Rs307 in the inter-bank market. The crackdown by the government at that time helped control the situation, closing illegal currency businesses and curbing smuggling of dollars.
Currency experts suggest that this is the time to gain control over the artificial shortage, which could again fuel the black market to become a monster.

2,WTO talks end with no major win,"“The WTO needed a good crisis and perhaps this will lead to a realisation that we cannot continue like this,” says senior EU official.","ABU DHABI: A high-level WTO conference ended on Saturday with a temporary extension of an e-commerce moratorium but no deals on agriculture and fisheries, throwing into doubt the effectiveness of the multilateral trade body.
The outcomes of the World Trade Organisation’s 13th ministerial conference in Abu Dhabi highlighted the sharp divisions between the body’s 164 members amid geopolitical tensions and economic headwinds that are threatening global commerce.
“The WTO needed a good crisis and perhaps this will lead to a realisation that we cannot continue like this,” said a senior European Union official participating in the talks.
Speaking at the closing press conference, the Emirati chair of the so-called MC13 gathering, Thani Al Zeyoudi, acknowledged the shortcomings.
“Despite our best efforts, we failed to agree on some texts which are of great importance to many of our members,” said Al Zeyoudi, who also serves as the UAE’s foreign trade minister.
For her part, WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said the talks came up “against an international backdrop marked by greater uncertainty than at any time I can remember”.
“We have achieved some important things and we have not managed to complete others,” she said while insisting that the “glass was half full”.
The WTO, the only international body dealing with the rules of trade between nations, requires full consensus from all members to chalk up deals.
It was hoping the MC13 would replicate the landmark success of its 2022 ministerial in Geneva, which yielded a deal on fisheries and saw members agree to restore a now-defunct dispute settlement system by the end of this year.
But the latest ministerial fell short of that objective.
“The unexpected weakness of the overall (MC13) package should... serve as a wake-up call,” the secretary general of the International Chamber of Commerce, John Denton, said in a statement.
‘Bogged down’ 
After a 2022 deal that banned subsidies contributing to illegal, undeclared and unregulated fishing, the WTO was hoping to conclude a second package focusing on subsidies that result in overcapacity and overfishing.
Negotiations in recent months at the WTO headquarters in Geneva had enabled a draft text to be brought forward for a second fisheries deal, which provided flexibility and advantages for developing countries.
But some — notably India — demanded further concessions, including transition periods that others consider to be too long. At MC13, a revised draft fisheries agreement faced strong objections from New Delhi.
“There was basically just one country that was blocking the deal,” said EU trade commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis, without specifying which member.
Richard Ouellet of Canada’s University of Laval said “consensus, which was once the cement of this organisation, has now become the mud in which it is bogged down”.
Emirati sway 
With farmer protests sweeping Europe and India, agriculture agreements also emerged as a particularly sensitive topic of debate.
Member states were trying to negotiate a text listing the subjects that merit further discussion.
An agriculture package, however, was hampered by a firm demand by India for permanent rules governing public stockholding of food reserves to replace temporary measures adopted by the WTO. India’s insistence on a permanent solution for public stockholding was “impossible to bridge”, Dombrovskis said.
Despite failing on agriculture and fisheries, the WTO managed to temporarily salvage a moratorium on customs duties for digital transmissions that was extended for another two years.
It faced a particularly strong challenge at MC13, with countries led by India and South Africa arguing that it harms customs revenues.
India’s Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal said on Friday that he allowed the extension to pass “out of respect” to the conference’s Emirati chair, whom he called a “good friend”.
However, the moratorium, which has been regularly extended since 1998, is set to definitively expire on March 31, 2026, with no chance of an extension, Iweala said. “I think that the membership has agreed... on very firm dates for its conclusion,” she said.
“I have to abide by what the membership has just decided.” On dispute settlement reform, the final outcome mainly reiterated the commitment made at MC12 to have a fully and well-functioning dispute settlement system in place by 2024.

3,Apple’s new EU steps draw rivals’ complaints,EU law threatens fines of up to 10 per cent of global revenue for non-compliance or 20pc for repeat offenders.,"BRUSSELS: Changes Apple is making to its services in the European Union  “make a mockery” of new antitrust rules in the bloc, 34 digital organisations complained to the European Commission this week.
They include app makers Epic Games and Spotify.
“We are very concerned that Apple’s proposed scheme for compliance with the Digital Markets Act (DMA)...will not meet the law’s requirements, therefore inhibiting our ability to deliver the benefits of the DMA to consumers as soon as possible,” they said in a letter to the EU executive dated Friday.
Apple in January announced it was modifying how its iOS operating system, Safari browser and App Store operate in the 27-nation EU.
It said it was doing so to comply with the DMA, which clamps down on anti-competitive practices online in the bloc.
Apple and other big tech companies deemed  “gatekeepers” — Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and TikTok owner ByteDance — have until March 7 to come into line with the DMA.
The EU law threatens fines of up to 10 per cent of global revenue for non-compliance or 20pc for repeat offenders.
Apple notably announced it was, for the first time, opening its App Store to rival apps and allowing payment services beyond Apple Pay on its iPhones.
But app developers going that route had to agree to a new  “Core Technology Fee” from Apple that would charge them $0.54 per download, for apps getting over a million downloads.
Many app developers — among them Epic Games, maker of the massively popular Fortnite game — say that is a huge cost for them. They say it will simply line Apple’s pockets and cement its gatekeeper status.
In their letter, the digital companies and associations said:  “Apple’s new terms not only disregard both the spirit and letter of the law, but if left unchanged, make a mockery of the DMA and the considerable efforts by the European Commission and EU institutions to make digital markets competitive.”

4,PBC calls for five-year IMF programme,"A larger as well as a longer IMF programme would provide creditors the necessary comfort, says Pakistan Business Council.","KARACHI: As the upcoming government will be seeking a fresh bailout amid growing economic challenges, the Pakistan Business Council (PBC) has called upon the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to allow a five-year funding programme instead of three years.
A longer, five-year programme will allow the IMF to make tranche releases conditional on progress on fundamental reforms of the energy sector and the privatisation or closure of loss-making state enterprises. 
Besides financial burden, inefficiently run state-owned enterprises that operate in the commercial space, provide unfair competition to the private sector, impeding scale and competitiveness, the government should be encouraged to get out of business, the council said.
PBC Chief Executive Ehsan Malik in a letter to IMF’s Resident Representative in Pakistan, Ms Esther Perez Ruiz said that front loading of targets by IMF stems from the relatively short-term programmes that have hitherto been offered to Pakistan.
No doubt, Mr Ehsan said that the IMF will require the mounting debts to be reprofiled to restore confidence in the economy. A larger as well as a longer IMF programme would provide creditors the necessary comfort.
He hoped that the next programme could be more reform-centric than the previous.
While sharing the contours that should differentiate the new programme from the previous, he said that the primary reason why the previous programmes failed to lead to sustainable reforms was the lack of political will and determination of various governments. 
However, the IMF too needs to reflect on the design of its assistance package. The flaws in the economy have worsened over the years and the new programme would need to take account of this.
He said the PBC has been stressing the need for the IMF to move away from purely short-term and quantitative to a mix of medium-term quantitative and qualitative targets.
He said in the absence of the FBR’s capability and capacity to broaden the tax base as well as the weak political will of governments to disturb vote banks, IMF’s front-ended tax collection targets have been met by raising the tax burden on those that are already bearing a disproportionate load. 
The levy of super tax is a case in point. Much of retail, wholesale, services, informal transporters, as well as the undocumented real estate sector, either go untaxed or are under-taxed.
A target such as “tax from new taxpayers” would be one way to ensure that tax revenue is increased equitably and sustainably. Moreover, this would also prompt significant restructuring of the FBR, he suggested.
Secondly, IMF’s tariff-driven measures address the symptoms but fail to cure the fundamental defects in the energy sector. Pakistan suffers from the highest electricity costs in the region. The competitiveness of industry, its capacity to create employment, reduce import reliance and generate exports is impeded by the burden of unutilised generation capacity, inefficiencies in transmission, theft, non-recovery of dues and cross-subsidies to residential consumers. High electricity tariffs incentivise theft and increase the reluctance of domestic users to switch out of less efficient, underpriced but fast-depleting local gas reserves.
To make matters worse, the PBC chief said there is substantial reliance on imported fuel for power generation and the transmission system is inadequate to maximise the use of cheaper renewable and coal power from the South.

6,Political optimism produces another bullish week on PSX,"Market closes at 65,326 points, surging 2,510 points or 4pc week-on-week.","KARACHI: Political stability with the smooth formation of new provincial governments in the four provinces, deceleration of inflation and strong corporate results helped the stock market to turn in another robust weekly performance.
Arif Habib Ltd said the market continued its positive momentum as the benchmark KSE 100-share index witnessed a surge from last week’s closing of 62,816 to above 65,000, reflecting investor optimism amid the ongoing government formation process. 
With the swearing-in of the MNAs-elect and subsequent election of the NA speaker and the impending vote for a new prime minister on Sunday, the market has responded positively to expectations of political stability and government formation. 
The rollover of a $2bn loan by China helped the State Bank of Pakistan to maintain its holdings at a reasonable level. However, the SBP reported its forex reserves decreased by $63m to $7.9bn during the week ended on Feb 23.
Additionally, the Federal Board of Revenue collected Rs681bn in February against the projection of Rs714bn, reflecting a massive shortfall of Rs33bn. During the week the rupee closed at 279.19 against the US dollar, appreciating by Rs0.17 or 0.06pc week-on-week. 
On the economic front, the trade deficit narrowed by 30pc during the first eight months of FY24 and the headline inflation decelerated to 23.1pc in February from 28.34pc in the preceding month. This unexpected massive decline in CPI-based inflation hitting a 20-month low revived hopes of the market for an interest rate cut in the upcoming monetary policy review from the unprecedented 22pc. 
Hence, the market closed at 65,326 points, surging 2,510 points or 4pc week-on-week.
Sector-wise positive contributions came from commercial banks (806 points), fertiliser (777 points), oil & gas exploration (280 points), auto assembler (184 points) and cement (159 points). 
Meanwhile, the sectors which mainly contributed negatively were technology (37 points), pharmaceuticals (28 points), leather & tanneries (24 points), and cable and electrical goods (11 points). Scrip-wise positive contributors were Engro Corporation (279 points), Engro Fertilisers Ltd (211 points), Meezan Bank Ltd (182 points), Millat Tractor Ltd (160 points) and Mari Petroleum Ltd (160 points). On the flip side, negative contributions came from TRG Pakistan (51 points), Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd (37 points), Service Industries Ltd (24 points), Pak Elektron Ltd (11 ponits) and Abbott Laboratories Ltd (11 points).
Foreign buying continued during the outgoing week, clocking in at $10.5m compared to a net buy of $2.9m last week. Major buying was witnessed in commercial banks ($4.0m) and all other sectors ($3.4mn). On the local front, selling was reported by banks/DFIs ($6.4m) followed by insurance companies ($3.7m). Average volume rose 24pc to 419m shares while the average value traded increased 23pc to $56m week-on-week.
Going forward, the market is expected to maintain a positive outlook next week with the election of the new prime minister. 
According to AKD Securities Ltd, successful completion of the second review under the current IMF $3bn Stand-By Arrangement would provide a crucial financial cushion against the upcoming $1bn Eurobond payment scheduled for April 15. Overall, funding requirements for the rest of the months in the current fiscal year seem to remain on track. 
The new government is likely to enter into a fresh Extended Fund Facility by May assuming political noise dies down and a decision on a minister for finance is made.
