0,Zelensky seeks Western air defence systems as Russian attacks kill 10,Ukraine is currently on the back foot as $60bn aid package is held up in the US Congress.,"KYIV: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Saturday urged the West to deliver more air defence systems as a wave of Russian missile, drone and artillery strikes killed at least ten people.
Seven were confirmed dead, including a three-month-old baby and two-year-old child, after an overnight drone strike on the southern port city of Odesa. Separate shelling attacks on the frontline Kharkiv, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions killed another three, Ukrainian officials said.
“Russia continues to hit civilians,” Zelensky said in a post on social media.
“We need more air defences from our partners. We need to strengthen the Ukrainian air shield to add more protection for our people from Russian terror. More air defence systems and more missiles for air defence systems save lives,” he said.

Ukraine is currently on the back foot as $60bn aid package is held up in the US Congress.

Ukraine is currently on the back foot in the two-year war as a crucial $60-billion aid package is held up in the United States congress.
In Odesa,  “a nine-storey building was destroyed as a result of an attack by Russian terrorists,” Interior Minister Igor Klymenko said on Saturday in a post on Telegram.
The attack killed at least seven people, including a three-month-old baby, Klymenko said. Another child, aged two, was also among the dead, Odesa region Governor Oleg Kiper said on state TV.
Around 10 people were still unaccounted for, with almost 100 rescuers set to continue a search and rescue operation overnight. Footage shared from the scene showed several floors of a residential building collapsed and its facade ripped off. Ukraine’s air force said falling debris from Russian drones it had shot down fell onto residential buildings in both Odesa and Kharkiv.
Separate shelling attacks in the frontline regions of Kharkiv in the northeast, and Kherson and Zapo­rizhzhia in the south killed three more, the provincial heads said.
‘Difficult situation’
The attacks came with Russia seeking to press its advantage on the battlefield. Kyiv has admitted it is heavily outgunned and outnumbered, facing ammunition shortages amid aid delays.
Half of all promised Western ammunition arrives in the country late, the defence minister has said, in what he called critical delays that cost lives and territory.
Russian forces have advanced westwards following last month’s capture of Avdiivka, and have seized several small villages in recent days. Visiting frontline military posts on Saturday, Ukraine’s new Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrsky said  “the situation at the front remains difficult, but controlled”.

1,Spanish tourist gang-raped  in India,Police detain three men; woman being treated at local hospital in Dumka.,"MUMBAI: Three men were arrested on Saturday after the gang rape of a Spanish tourist on a motorbike trip through India’s remote east with her husband, local media reports said.
The attack took place on Friday night in the Dumka district of the eastern state of Jharkhand, where the couple had stopped to camp the night in a tent.
The woman was able to reach a police patrol van at around 11pm and was taken to hospital for treatment, police officer Pitamber Singh Kherwar told The Times of India newspaper.
Kherwar said police had detained three people in connection with the attack and were on the hunt for more suspects.
The Spanish woman is being treated at a local hospital in Dumka and an investigation is underway, reports said. An average of nearly 90 rapes were reported in India every day in 2022, according to data by the National Crime Records Bureau.
However, large numbers go unreported due to prevailing stigmas around victims and a lack of faith in police investigations. Convictions remain rare, with cases getting stuck for years in India’s clogged-up criminal justice system.
The notorious gang rape and murder of an Indian student made global headlines in 2012. Jyoti Singh, a 23-year-old physiotherapy student, was raped and assaulted and left for dead by five men and a teenager on a bus in New Delhi in December that year.
The horrific crime shone an international spotlight on India’s high levels of sexual violence and sparked weeks of protests, and eventually a change in the law to introduce the death penalty for rape.

2,Hundreds pay tribute at Navalny’s grave,"MOSCOW: Hundreds of Russians visited the grave of dead Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny on Saturday, risking...","MOSCOW: Hundreds of Russians visited the grave of dead Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny on Saturday, risking arrest to pay tribute to the anti-corruption campaigner for a second day running.
Navalny, President Vladi-
­mir Putin’s fiercest critic for more than a decade, died in an Arctic prison colony last month, where he was serving a 19-year sentence on  “extremism” charges largely seen as political retribution for his opposition to the Kremlin.
A journalist saw mourners, some with tears in their eyes, queueing outside the Borisovo cemetery in southern Moscow on Saturday afternoon, as more walked from the nearby metro station carrying flowers and placards in honour of Navalny.
Despite warnings from the Kremlin that they faced arrest, thousands had come out for the official funeral service on Friday. Authorities have erected airport-style security scanners at the entrance to the cemetery, and police on Saturday were filmed frisking and searching those who had come to pay homage to the Kremlin critic.
Officers ordered mourners to  “keep moving” as they laid stacks of red and white roses and carnations on Navalny’s grave.
Navalny’s mother, Lyudmila Navalnaya, was among those who visited on Saturday, accompanied by Alla Abrosimova, the mother of Navalny’s widow, Yulia Navalnaya.
The circumstances of Navalny’s death remain somewhat unclear. Author­i­ties said he had died of  “natural causes” after losing consciousness following a walk in his Arctic prison colony.
But Navalny’s aides have accused the Russian authorities of ordering him killed, and Western leaders have said Putin carries  “responsibility” for his death.

The unmanned Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (SLIM) touched down in January at a wonky angle that left its solar panels facing the wrong way.
As the sun’s angle shifted, it came back to life for two days and carried out scientific observations of a crater with a high-spec camera. This week, the SLIM probe, which was  “not designed for the harsh lunar nights,” when the temperature plunges to minus 133 degrees, produced another surprise by waking up after two weeks.
“SLIM has gone to sleep again as the sun set after 3am (Japan Time) on March 1,” the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) said on X, formerly Twitter, on Friday, alongside an image of the rocky lunar surface captured by the probe.
“Although the likelihood of failure will increase due to the severe temperature cycles, we will attempt SLIM operation again when the sunlight comes back in late March,” JAXA said.
The announcement comes after the uncrewed American lander Odysseus became the first private spaceship on the Moon. The lander sent its final image on Thursday before its power banks depleted.
SLIM, dubbed the  “Moon Sniper” for its precision landing technology, touched down within its target landing zone on January 20.

4,Chad’s junta chief to contest election,N’DJAMENA: Chad’s junta leader Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno said on Saturday he would stand in the May 6 ...,"N’DJAMENA: Chad’s junta leader Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno said on Saturday he would stand in the May 6 presidential election, just three days after his chief rival was killed in murky circumstances.
Deby Itno took power in 2021 after his father, veteran leader Idriss Deby Itno, died while fighting rebels. The iron-fisted ruler had led the Sahel country for more than three decades.
“I, Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno, am a candidate for the 2024 presidential election under the banner of the For a United Chad coalition,” the military leader said in a speech.
Deby Itno was proclaimed transitional president by the junta in 2021 and promised a return to civilian rule and elections within 18 months. 
But he subsequently extended the transition by two years and protests against the decision were brutally repressed by the security forces in October 2022. The date of the May presidential election was announced on Tuesday, barely two months before the vote.
Deby Itno, 39, is almost certain to win, given that his main challenger has been assassinated and the opposition has been muzzled and repressed. 
He has  “no opponents who can pose a threat in the race for the presidency”, Enrica Picco, project director for Central Africa at Crisis Group, said.

Xóchitl Gálvez

 
MEXICO CITY: Campaign­ing officially began on Friday for elections likely to produce Mexico’s first woman president — a watershed for a nation with a long tradition of macho culture.
Opposition candidate Xochitl Galvez launched her campaign after the stroke of midnight in one of Mexico’s most dangerous states, seeking to tap into voter concerns about the country’s rampant violence. Public opinion polls suggest that she faces a tough battle against ruling party candidate Claudia Sheinbaum, a former Mexico City mayor and close ally of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.
Sheinbaum addressed large crowds of supporters in Mexico City’s main square, vowing to continue the outgoing left-wing populist’s  “transformation” of the Latin American nation, including measures to fight corruption and help the poor.
With three months to go before the June 2 vote, Sheinbaum, a 61-year-old scientist by training, enjoys a significant lead with 63pc support, according to an average of polls compiled by the Oraculus research firm.
Galvez, also 61, has 31pc support, while Jorge Alvarez, 38, of the Citizens’ Movement party is a distant third with just five per cent, polls show. At stake is the future of Latin America’s second-largest economy, a country of 126 million people that is a key trading partner of the United States and a major tourist destination, but which faces huge challenges from illegal migration and drug-related violence.


Claudia Sheinbaum

 
Sheinbaum’s  “biggest challenge is security because we’re experiencing a time of chaos,” said David Jimenez, a 49-year-old office worker at her rally.
‘People are afraid’
Galvez, an outspoken businesswoman with Indigenous roots, sought to put the focus on the country’s insecurity with a night-time rally in the city of Fresnillo in the violence-wracked state of Zacatecas.
She led a candle-lit march through the streets before sharing the stage with a relative of one of Mexico’s more than 100,000 missing persons, holding a minute’s silence for victims of violence.
“Here in Fresnillo, as in all of Mexico, people are afraid,” Galvez said, hitting out at Lopez Obrador’s  “hugs not bullets” strategy to tackle violent crime at its roots by combating poverty and inequality, rather than using military force. “Hugs for criminals are over,” she said.

6,Swift fans make pricey pilgrimage to star’s Singapore concert,SINGAPORE: Filipina Charlyn Suizo is in Singa­pore this week for one reason only: Taylor Swift.,"

SINGAPORE: A fan of singer Taylor Swift poses with her friendship bracelets at the National Stadium on the first night of her Eras Tour concert, on Saturday.—Reuters

 
SINGAPORE: Filipina Charlyn Suizo is in Singa­pore this week for one reason only: Taylor Swift.
The 30-year-old software engineer, who heads a Philippines group of Swifties, as fans of the singer are known, flew in from Manila on Friday with 17 friends.
She is spending at least $6,000 on her flights, concert tickets and accommodation. That is slightly above the average annual household income in her home country.
“This is the biggest amount I have spent for a concert. I never really spent big ... for someone else, just Taylor Swift, said Suizo, who has splashed out on a VIP ticket costing more than $745. She plans to see three of Swifts six performances in Singapore.
Suizo is among thousands of Swifties descending on Singapore this week from all over Southeast Asia to catch the American star’s Eras Tour, giving the sluggish local economy a much-needed boost. Swift is this week playing six sold-out nights in Singapore, her only stop in Southeast Asia.
Chua Hak Bin, an economist at Maybank, estimates that seven in 10 of the 300,000 concertgoers will be coming in from abroad, spending between $260 million to $370 million on hotels, food and entertainment.
By comparison, the F1 Singapore Grand Prix has generated around S$2 billion ($1.5 billion) in tourism receipts since it started in 2008, according to the trade ministry. Meanwhile, analysts at HSBC say hotel rooms in Singapore now cost 30pc more than in pre-pandemic 2019.
Edmund Ong, general manager at Trip.com Singa­pore, said that from 1-9 March, the cost of flights into Singapore nearly tripled while accommodation bookings almost quintupled.

7,"UK, US blamed for ‘glitch’ in Red Sea cables",CAIRO: The Houthi Transport Ministry in Yemen said on Saturday there had been a  “glitch” in undersea...,"CAIRO: The Houthi Transport Ministry in Yemen said on Saturday there had been a  “glitch” in undersea communication cables in the Red Sea as a result of actions by US and British naval vessels.
The actions  “endangered the security and safety of the international communications and the flow of information,” the ministry said in a statement, reported by the Houthi-run Saba news agency, without giving details.
“Any glitch in these cables as a result of the militarisation of the Red Sea by US and British naval vessels represents a serious threat to the information security and economic and social stability for all countries of the world,” the statement read.
The Houthis, who control the most populous parts of Yemen, have launched exploding drones and missiles at commercial vessels since Nov 19 as a protest against Israel’s military operations in Gaza.
The United States and Britain have carried out several strikes against Houthi targets in response.
At least 15 submarine cables pass through the Bab al-Mandab Strait at  the southern end of the Red Sea, a body of water just 26km wide at some  points. Yemen is the Strait’s northern shore.
The first reports of damage to submarine cables off the coast of Yemen began emerged last week with Israeli news outlet Globes claiming that four cables (EIG, AAE-1, Seacom and TGN-EA) had experienced damage. 
Seacom has reportedly confirmed damage to a cable it operates on a stretch between Kenya and Egypt.
“The  location of the cable break is significant due to its geopolitical  sensitivity and ongoing tensions, making it a challenging environment  for maintenance and repair operations,” Seacom said. 
“The team is currently working towards restoration timelines and will communicate these plans with our clients.”

8,"Israel has accepted truce proposal, US says",Washington begins airdropping aid into Gaza amid reports 12 children had died of malnutrition.,"GAZA STRIP: Israel has “more or less accepted” a proposal for a six-week ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, a US official said on Saturday as Palestinian negotiators were expected in Cairo.
Mediators have been scrambling to lock in a truce before Ramazan begins on March 10 or 11.
The US official told reporters that “there’s a framework deal” for a ceasefire which “the Israelis have more or less accepted”.
“Right now, the ball is in the camp of Hamas.” 
A source close to Hamas said a delegation from the group was headed from Qatar to Egypt on Saturday

Washington begins airdropping aid into Gaza amid reports 12 children had died of malnutrition 

Meanwhile, Israel’s top ally the United States began air-dropping aid into Gaza on Saturday, as the territory’s health ministry reported more than a dozen child malnutrition deaths.
The start of the US relief operation came hours after President Joe Biden, who has pushed Israel to allow more aid in, announced the move and spoke of the  “need to do more” after nearly five months of devastating conflict. It also comes as negotiations continue for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip, which has been under siege since Oct 7.
“We conducted a combined humanitarian assistance airdrop into Gaza” involving three US Air Force C-130 transport planes to provide  “relief to civilians affected by the ongoing conflict,” a US military official said.
US Central Command, in a post on social media platform X, said the operation was conducted together with Jordan and saw planes drop  “over 38,000 meals along the coastline of Gaza allowing for civilian access to the critical aid”.
The dire humanitarian situation in Gaza has led to the deaths of at least 13 children from  “malnutrition and dehydration” in recent days, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.
In an incident that has thrown a spotlight on the crisis, dozens of Palestinians were killed before dawn on Thursday in a chaotic rush for aid from a convoy of trucks in Gaza City. The Gaza health ministry said Israeli forces shot them but the Israeli army insisted most died in a stampede or crush.
‘Famine almost inevitable’
The European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the shooting “against civilians trying to access foodstuff is unjustifiable”. He joined calls for an  “impartial international investigation on this tragic event”.
British foreign minister David Cameron said Israel had  “an obligation to ensure that significantly more humanitarian aid reaches” Gazans. 
On Friday a UN team visited some of the wounded from the aid incident, in Gaza City’s Al-Shifa Hospital, and saw a  “large number of gunshot wounds”, UN chief Antonio Guterres’s spokesman said.
The hospital received 70 of the dead, and around 200 wounded were still there during the team’s visit, spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.
Hossam Abu Safiya, director of Gaza City’s Kamal Adwan Hospital, said all the casualties it admitted were hit by  “bullets and shrapnel from occupation forces”.
Gaza has faced dwindling supplies of humanitarian relief across its land borders, which aid groups blame at least in part on Israel — the recipient of billions of dollars in US military aid.
Jens Laerke, spokesman for the UN humanitarian office OCHA, said that  “a famine is almost inevitable” in Gaza unless things change. Laerke cited the near-total closure of commercial food imports, the  “trickle of trucks” coming in with food aid, and the  “massive access constraints” to moving around inside Gaza.
The United Nations has spoken of particular problems accessing northern Gaza, where residents have been reduced to eating animal fodder.
‘Everyone is suffering’
Jordan first announced an aid airdrop in November and has carried out multiple missions since then, some with the cooperation of European countries, including Britain, France and the Netherlands. Egypt and the United Arab Emirates have also begun working together on airdrops.
TV images showed people running and pedalling fast on bicycles past bomb-damaged buildings on a rutted dirt road to reach aid floating down to Gaza City.

9,Michigan set to deliver Trump another win,"GRAND RAPIDS: Donald Trump was dominating early returns in Michigan’s Republican caucuses on Saturday, a...","GRAND RAPIDS: Donald Trump was dominating early returns in Michigan’s Republican caucuses on Saturday, a presidential nominating contest he was set to win amid simmering internal turmoil.
With 10 of 13 districts reporting results, Trump was trouncing Nikki Haley, his last remaining rival for the Republican nomination, drawing roughly 97pc support, according to a tally reported by the state Republican Party.
The state will be a key battleground in November’s general election, a likely rematch between Trump and US President Joe Biden, a Democrat. Nearly 2,000 party insiders had registered to participate in the presidential caucus in the western Michigan city of Grand Rapids, where they will choose delegates for Trump or former UN ambassador Haley, for the party’s national nominating convention in July.
Republicans will also hold caucuses in Missouri and Idaho on Saturday, among the final contests for Haley to alter the course of the race prior to Super Tuesday on March 5, the biggest day in the primaries, when 15 states and one territory will vote.
With victories in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, US Virgin Islands and South Carolina under his belt, Trump is far and away the frontrunner in the race, with Haley hanging on thanks to support from donors keen for an alternative to the former president.
For this election cycle, Michigan Republicans have devised a hybrid nominating system, split between a primary and a caucus. Trump won the primary convincingly on Tuesday, securing 12 of 16 delegates up for grabs. He could take all of Michigan’s remaining 39 delegates at stake on Saturday, given that will be up to the roughly 2,000 precinct delegates who form the base of the party that leans heavily toward Trump.

But looking out over the southernmost continent, scientist Miguel Angel de Pablo laments that humanity seems to be oblivious to the warnings.
“We (scientists) are very worried... because we don’t see how we can solve it ourselves,” the Spanish planetary geologist told AFP on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Antarctic archipelago.
“The more alerts we send out... to make society aware of what is happening, it seems we are not listened to, that we are (perceived as) alarmist” despite the evidence, he said.
The US National Snow & Ice Data Centre (NSIDC) reported on Wednesday that minimum Antarctic sea ice extent came in at under two million square kilometres (772,000 square miles) for a third consecutive February — the height of the southern summer thaw season.
Minimum sea ice cover for all three years were the lowest since records began 46 years ago.

A record figure of 15,200 hopefuls were competing for seats in the 290-member parliament. Another 144 candidates sought a place in the 88-member Assembly of Experts, which is exclusively made up of male Islamic scholars.
The Assembly selects or, if necessary, dismisses Iran’s supreme leader. Many potential candidates for the chamber were disqualified.
Local Fars news agency estimated turnout at  “more than 40 percent”, among 61 million eligible voters.

13,Cargo ship damaged by Houthi strike sinks,British-registered vessel was loaded with combustible fertilisers.,"• British-registered vessel was loaded with combustible fertilisers
• US claims destroying surface-to-air missile in Yemen           
DUBAI: A cargo ship loaded with fertiliser has sunk in the Gulf of Aden less than two weeks after it was damaged by missiles from Yemen’s Houthi rebels, Yemen’s government said on Saturday.
The Houthis claimed the Feb 19 attack against the Rubymar, a cargo ship flying a Belizean flag and operated by a Lebanese firm, which transported combustible fertilisers.
The crew abandoned the ship and evacuated to safety after it was hit by two missiles. The vessel had departed the United Arab Emirates and was bound for the Bulgarian port of Varna.
“The MV Rubymar sank last night, coinciding with weather factors and strong winds at sea,” said a crisis cell of Yemen’s internationally recognised government in charge of the case.
Roy Khoury, chief executive of the ship’s operator Blue Fleet, said he was unaware of the sinking. “We have nobody on board to check if it’s true or not,” he said.
Fuel oil appeared to be leaking from the vessel in satellite images shared by Maxar Technologies. The TankerTrackers website said the sinking would  “cause an environmental catastrophe in the (Yemeni) territorial waters and in the Red Sea”.
“A spill of ammonium nitrate fertiliser in the sea could have several significant impacts on marine ecosystems,” said Julien Jreissati, programme director for Greenpeace in the Middle East and North Africa.
The maritime security agency UKMTO, run by the British navy, said the Rubymar had been 35 nautical miles (65 kilometres) from the Yemeni port of Mokha when its crew was forced to abandon it.
The Rubymar was identified as British-registered by the US military and security firm Ambrey, but Khoury has denied that information.
Since November, the Houthis have been carrying out attacks on ships linked to Israel in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, saying they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.
Surface-to-air missile destroyed
US  forces struck and destroyed a Houthi surface-to-air missile in Yemen after deciding it posed an  “imminent threat” to American  aircraft, the US Central Command in the Middle East announced.
The  Iran-backed Houthis, who control much of war-torn Yemen, have been  attacking shipping in the Red Sea since November in a campaign they say  is in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza amid the Israeli aggression.
The  United States is spearheading a naval coalition to protect vessels in  the vital waterway, and has also conducted air strikes in Houthi  territory, both on its own and alongside Britain.
On Friday, US  “forces conducted a self-defence strike against one  Iranian-backed Houthi surface-to-air missile that was prepared to  launch,” Centcom said in a statement, adding it had  “determined (the  missile) presented an imminent threat to US aircraft in the region.” 
It went on to say that the Houthis launched an anti-ship  missile into the Red Sea, but  “There was no impact or damage to any  vessels.” Last weekend, US and British forces carried out strikes  against 18 Houthi targets across eight locations in Yemen, including  weapons storage facilities, attack drones, air defence systems, radars  and a helicopter, according to a joint statement.
One person was killed and eight wounded in the attacks, the Houthis’ official news agency said on Sunday.
