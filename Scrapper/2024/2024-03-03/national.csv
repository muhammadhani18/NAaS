GILGIT/PESHAWAR/QUETTA: Heavy snowfall and rain have brought life to a standstill in Gilgit-Baltistan, many parts of Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, with Karakoram Highway and other thoroughfares rendered impassable due to landslides and flashfloods.
Adverse weather has led to the cancellation of PIA flights between Islamabad and the cities of Gilgit and Skardu.
Heavy rains and snowfall continue to lash large swathes of KP for a second day on Saturday, resulting in the deaths of at least 22 people and injuries to 25 others.
Similarly, rains also wreaked havoc in Gwadar and Kech districts of Makran, where hundreds of houses have collapsed during the current spell of rains, rendering a large number of families homeless.
Heavy rains also lashed Noshki and Chagai districts, while several districts in Balochistan were completely cut off from other parts of the province due to damaged or flooded roads.
Moreover, thousands of travellers, including families, patients, and children, heading to or from Gilgit-Baltistan are stranded in several areas. Not only Baltistan Road but also Ghizer-Shandur Road have been rendered impassable due to landslides at some points.
According to the GB Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA), heavy rain and snowfall in upper areas of the region started on Friday evening. Landslides triggered by rains have blocked the Karakoram Highway at several points, including at the Kohistan, Gilgit-Diamer, Gilgit-Hunza and Nagar sections.
Disruptions were also reported on Baltistan Road due to rockfalls and Astore Valley Road after heavy snowfall and rain.
Districts including Skardu, Ghizer, Astore, Ghanche, Shigar, Nagar, Kharmang, Hunza and Gilgit are now cut off, leaving residents isolated and halting daily activities.
However, despite the challenges, no casualties or significant damages have been reported thus far from any area of the region.
Officials said the ongoing inclement weather is hindering road restoration efforts. The Gilgit-Baltistan government has issued a weather alert, advising against travel until conditions improve.
Meanwhile, the Pakistan Meteorological Department anticipates further rainfall and snowfall across the region until Sunday.
GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan has instructed the district administrations to speed up road restoration efforts and ensure the welfare of stranded travellers.
Besides, winter vacation for schools in the upper areas of Skardu, Shigar, Kharmang and Ghanche districts has been extended to March 10. These areas received up to six inches of snow and temperatures have dropped to sub-zero levels.

1,Fresh efforts unveiled to prove Aafia Siddiqui’s innocence,Counsel says has proof that evidence presented at Dr Aafia’s American trial was false from start to finish.,"KARACHI: Dr Aafia Siddiqui’s American lawyer, Clive Stafford Smith, said on Saturday he had been working to find further evidence of torture on her in US custody and her innocence for the past 10 days. 
Addressing a press conference along with Dr Aafia’s sister, Dr Fowzia Siddiqui, Mr Smith said he had been working day and night with the very willing assistance of many people in Afghanistan to find further evidence of Dr Aafia’s torture in US custody and her innocence of the charges.
He said numerous witnesses proved that Dr Aafia was held in Bagram for a significant part of the five years she was missing (2003-08), before she was moved to another, even worse prison. “People who say she was at liberty at that time are simply not telling the truth,” he added.
The counsel said that on July 17, 2008, Dr Aafia was sent to Ghazni with the promise that she would get her daughter, Maryam, back. “We can now prove that this was a sham, and a call had been made to the police that she was a suicide bomber,” he said, adding that the only thing that saved her life was a brave Ghazni tailor who worked across from the Khalid Bin Walid Mosque and had been able to speak Urdu with her.
He said the tailor prevented Dr Aafia’s potential shooting by AK-47-wielding Afghan National Police officers by vouching for her innocence and by standing between her and them and telling them that the caller was lying. “We have located several witnesses to corroborate the tailor’s evidence,” Mr Smith added.
The counsel said they had proof that the evidence presented at Dr Aafia’s American trial was false from start to finish.
Dr Fowzia Siddiqui said the world talked warmly about women’s rights, but it suddenly became silent when Dr Aafia Siddiqui’s name was uttered.
She said the nations that keep mum on the safety and security of their mothers and daughters don’t live with pride in this world.
She said that successive governments and politicians had disappointed the nation on the issue of Dr Aafia. “I have no hope that our spineless politicians would do anything for Aafia,” she said, adding that she was, however, confident about the role of courts.

2,Verdict on reserved seats for SIC likely after PM’s election,"PTI warns PM’s election by an incomplete NA will be ""unconstitutional"".","ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) is likely to announce its reserved verdict on the plea of the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) — the new face of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) — for allocation of reserved seats, only after the prime ministerial election on Sunday, official sources told Dawn.
A senior ECP official said the decision would be announced next week, most probably on Monday.
The key election to the coveted office by an incomplete assembly is set to spark a new controversy as questions will be raised over the legality of the entire process.
 
 

The SIC was joined by PTI-backed lawmakers after winning elections sans their poll symbol, and the council had written to the ECP seeking allocation of reserved seats in the national as well as three provincial assemblies, excluding Balochistan.

PTI warns PM’s election by an incomplete NA will be ‘unconstitutional’

The ECP, however, did not consider the plea till applications piled up opposing the allocation of SIC’s quota on the grounds that it was not a parliamentary party and had not submitted a priority list of candidates for the reserved seats. The applications against allocation of reserved seats to SIC were heard for two days before SIC’s applications were clubbed with the lately filed but sooner heard petitions opposing its quota, and notices were issued to some other parliamentary parties.
After hearing arguments from all sides, the commission had reserved its verdict on Wednesday, a day before the maiden session of the National Assembly, allowing the controversy to simmer. Subsequently, the ECP caught flak for delaying the decision as it paved way for an incomplete assembly to meet.
Article 51 (1) of the Constitution reads, “There shall be three hundred and thirty-six seats for members in the National Assembly, including seats reserved for women and non-Muslims”.
Article 51(6) (d) says members to the women reserved seats, which are allocated to a province, shall be elected in accordance with law through proportional representation system of political parties’ lists of candidates on the basis of total number of general seats secured by each political party from the province concerned in the NA.
Article 41(6) (e) says members to the seats reserved for non-Muslims shall be elected in accordance with law through proportional representation system of political parties’ lists of candidates on the basis of total number of general seats won by each political party in the National Assembly.
78 reserved seats
The ECP has so far kept on hold the allocation of 78 out of the total 226 reserved seats for women in the national and provincial assemblies — all of which were to go to SIC, under the formula.
Out of the total 60 reserved seats for women in the NA, the ECP has so far allocated 40 seats to different political parties. These include 20 of the total 32 for Punjab, two out of 10 for KP, all 14 from Sindh and all four from Balochistan. Likewise, it has allocated seven out of 10 seats reserved for minorities in the NA.
Of the total 66 reserved seats for women in the Punjab Assembly, it had allocated 42 seats and five out of eight reserved for minorities. In Sindh Assembly, it had allocated 27 of the total 29 seats reserved for women and eight out of nine reserved for minorities.
It has allocated five out of total 26 reserved seats for women in the KP assembly and one out of four reserved for minorities.
All the 11 reserved seats for women and three for minorities in Balochistan Assembly have already been allocated.
‘Unconstitutional’
Meanwhile, the PTI has warned that PM’s election by an incomplete NA without the allocation of the reserved seats for women and minorities would be unconstitutional.
In a statement, a party spokesperson said that a speaker and deputy speaker elected by “mandate thieves” would not have any constitutional status.
He said that the Constitution was trampled under foot when they elected a speaker in an incomplete National Assembly, and recalled that a total of 23 PTI-backed members were being deprived of their constitutional right of the reserved seats.

3,Balochistan grapples with surge in violence as KP sees decline,"Most of last month’s attacks carried out before general election, notes PICSS report.","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan experienced 97 militant attacks in February, resulting in 87 fatalities and 118 injuries, the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) said.
Statistics released by the Islamabad-based think tank, PICSS, reveal intriguing terrorism trends for February 2024. 
“While there was a marginal increase in militant attacks compared to January’s 93 incidents, the ensuing casualties slightly decreased, with 90 deaths and 135 injuries reported in January,” PICSS said in a report released on Friday.
The report highlights a significant escalation in violence in Balochistan, juxtaposed with a decline in tribal districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) (former Fata) and mainland KP. The surge in Balochistan’s violence can be attributed to terror groups such as banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF), BRAS, etc, targeting the election process and related activities, warning against public participation. 

Most of last month’s attacks carried out before general election, notes PICSS report

“In Balochistan, militant attacks spiked by 72 per cent in February compared to January, totalling 57 attacks resulting in 42 deaths and 72 injuries. January had witnessed 33 attacks, leading to 31 fatalities and 50 injuries. Notably, 30 out of the 57 attacks recorded by PICSS in Balochistan during February were directed at election activities. The National Party of former chief minister Dr Malik and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) were primary targets, along with attacks on PTI, PML-N, JUI, BNP-Mengal and BNP-Awami,” it stated.
A discernible pattern emerged, revealing that 50 out of the 57 attacks in Balochistan occurred from February 1 to 8. Only seven attacks were recorded after the elections, underscoring the militants’ primary focus on disrupting the election process, considering political participation in Pakistan a threat to their cause. 
Of the 57 attacks in Balochistan, 30 targeted election-related activities, with only three election-related attacks reported in the first eight days from other provinces, one each from mainland KP, the former FATA region, and Sindh. Post-election, five attacks targeted politicians, with three in former Fata and two in mainland KP, resulting in casualties.
Overall, 33 attacks targeted election-related activities, leading to 35 deaths and 59 injuries. In post-election attacks against political individuals, five people were killed, and eight were injured.
According to report, in contrast, the security situation improved in the rest of the country, with a 54pc drop in violence in former Fata (merged districts of KP) and a 23pc reduction in mainland KP. In the tribal districts of KP, 11 attacks resulted in seven deaths and 17 injuries, compared to 24 attacks, 36 deaths, and 57 injuries in January. Mainland KP witnessed 23 attacks with 35 deaths and 28 injuries, showing a decrease in attacks but an increase in human losses compared to January.
Sindh experienced five militant attacks in February, resulting in three deaths and one injury, while Punjab reported one low-profile attack with no casualties.

4,PPP to work with other parties to fix Balochistan’s issues,"Bilawal asks for parliamentary committee to address concerns over ""missing persons"".","QUETTA: PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has said the issues and challenges facing Balochistan would be resolved through reconciliation and consultation with other political parties and leaders as one person or a single party alone could not tackle them.  
“The guiding principle for my party’s government in Balochistan is the philosophy of reconciliation as envisioned by former prime minister Benazir Bhutto,” he said while speaking at a press conference at the CM Secretariat after attending the oath-taking ceremony of newly elected Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti here on Saturday.  
Mr Bugti, PPP’s Balochistan president Mir Changez Jamali, Nawab Sanaullah Zehri, Engineer Zamrak Khan Piralizai of the ANP, Sardar Abdul Rehman Khetran of the PML-N and Mir Zia Langove of the BAP were also present at the press conference.  
Mr Bhutto-Zardari affirmed the PPP’s commitment to collaborate with all political parties, both within and outside parliament, to effectively address the challenges faced by Balochistan.  

Bilawal asks for parliamentary committee to address concerns over ‘missing persons’ 

Outlining his party’s priorities for future political activities, he said: “I will spend less time in Islamabad and more time in Quetta and Karachi.” He expressed gratitude to all political parties present in the Balochistan Assembly for their support in the election of his party’s nominee as the chief minister.  
The PPP chairman, while replying to a question, emphasised that the issue of missing persons is a concern for the entire country and called for constituting a parliamentary committee to address the matter.  
“We invite all parties to join the PPP in establishing the committee as our aim is to seek solution through reconciliation and coordination,” he said, adding that the PPP, in consultations with all political parties, will make efforts to solve people’s problems.  
He said the Balochistan government would be run according to the philosophy and ideology of the PPP, emphasising that his mother Benazir Bhutto’s last book was on reconciliation.  
Mr Bhutto-Zardari mentioned that his party had contested the elections based on a 10-point manifesto, adding that had the PPP formed the government at the Centre, it would have implemented stringent measures to provide relief 
to the people.  
“Now that the PPP has formed governments in Sindh and Balochistan, our commitment is to pursue the implementation of the ‘people’s economic agreement’ despite limited resources in the two provinces,” he added.  
The PPP chairman said a “party of martyrs” is now ruling Balochistan, and it would be ensured that its people no longer have to endure further martyrdoms.
He also reiterated that terrorism and extremism would be eliminated through implementation of the National Action Plan.  
“We fought terrorists in Swat and Waziristan,” he said, adding that they would again address the issue of terrorism through a policy involving dialogue, deterrence and development.  
Responding to a question, the PPP chairman said the 18th Constitution Amendment and the NFC Award were actually the demands of Balochistan, which were fulfilled by the previous PPP government.  
He mentioned that Aghaz-i-Haqooq Balochistan was initiated by former president Asif Ali Zardari, adding that had it been implemented, the situation in Balochistan would have been different at that time.  
He the newly elected CM would visit Gwadar, a city severely affected by recent rains, and personally assess the situation there, conduct a thorough review, and make announcements regarding assistance for the affected people.

5,"Fazl arrives in Karachi, likely to skip NA sitting","JUI-F secretary says Fazl to hold ""important meeting"", make a speech regarding election rigging.","KARACHI: JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman has arrived in Karachi to attend the party’s  Sindh chapter’s meeting in Korangi today (Sunday).
This means that he will not be present in Islamabad for the National Assembly session that will elect the next prime minister.
However, PML-N, whose supreme leader Nawaz Sharif had called on the Maulana to woo him just a day earlier, said that the JUI-F chief’s refusal to vote for their candidate won’t sour relations between the two parties.
Speaking to DawnNewsTV, PML-N Senator Irfan Siddiqui has said that even if the Maulana does not vote for Shehbaz Sharif in the prime minister’s election, his party would still want the JUI-F chief to support them in running the government.
Mr Siddiqui also claimed that PML-N’s coalition partner, PPP, would not only stand with them in the parliament but in the cabinet as well.
According to JUI-F Sindh Deputy Secretary Information Maulana Samiul Haq Swati, the Sindh chapter’s general secretary, Rashid Mehmood Soomro, and other leaders welcomed the party emir who has arrived in the metropolis on a three-day visit.
Mr Swati said that the “important” meeting tomorrow will include JUI-F members from all districts of Sindh.

He will also give instructions to the officials of JUI-F Sindh, Mr Swati said, adding that Fazl will also address a press conference.

7,"Shehbaz, Bilawal vow to stand with media",Leaders highlight important role of media in shaping public opinion.,"KARACHI: PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif has pledged to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the All Pakistan Newspapers Society (APNS) and the wider media fraternity, advocating for fair treatment, transparent policies, and increased support to ensure the sustainability of the print media industry.

8,BISP successful in mitigating poverty: WB,"Report says BISP has had significant positive impacts on consumption expenditure, food consumption, mobility of women investments.","ISLAMABAD: A new World Bank report said the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) has been successful in mitigating the negative impact of poverty on households as well as protecting them against shocks, but the benefit level must at least be 15 per cent of the average household consumption for BISP to have any impact on poverty.
The report, ‘Evolution of Benazir Income Support Programme’s Delivery System’ said BISP has had significant positive impacts on consumption expenditure, food consumption, child nutrition security, asset retention, the mobility of women investments in health and education.
Prior to the 2008 global financial crisis, social safety net initiatives in Pakistan were ineffective because of their non-objective targeting and limited coverage, the World Bank report added.
To date, BISP has provided $1 billion in regular and reliable support. Between 2011 and 2019, the percentage of BISP beneficiaries below the poverty line fell from 90pc to 72pc, however, its impact on poverty diminished by 2019, primarily because of eroding value of benefit level, the report said.
It added that investments in building systems over the years were realized when the government was able to rapidly expand BISP, both vertically and horizontally, to respond first to Covid-19 pandemic and then to devastation caused by floods in 2022.
It is essential to continue investing in such programmes “to reduce poverty and inequality”.
It said the BISP benefit level has been increased to improve its adequacy, but it still accounts for only 10pc of average household consumption. 
The value of BISP cash transfer was not increased until 2017, causing a steady reduction in the adequacy of benefits.
Although the benefit level has been increased on an ad hoc basis in recent years, it is still inadequate, especially given the increase in fuel and food prices.
A recent mechanism to review the transfer value resulted in a 25pc increase in the unconditional cash transfer amount, effective January 2023. The current value accounts for almost 10pc of the average consumption; however, for BISP to have any impact on poverty, the benefit level must at least be 15pc of the average household consumption.
