0,Inquiry committee confirms overbilling by power firms,"Also blames PDM govt, slams Nepra for jumping the gun.","ISLAMABAD: A four-member independent inquiry committee on ‘Abject Failure — Illegal Overbilling’ confirmed the power regulator’s overcharging allegations against all the distribution companies (Discos) across the country but absolved them of ‘deliberate and mala fide’ fleecing while shifting some blame on to the then PDM-led coalition government’s decision-making.
All the members of the inquiry committee who have either worked with or still working under the Power Division in different capacities.
In a 37-page report, the committee led by former federal secretary Irfan Ali also blamed the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) for jumping the gun with hasty publication of such ‘extreme allegations’ while simultaneously commending with consensus the regulator’s ‘intent and direction’ saying such questions should have been raised much earlier.
The committee also comprised Dr Fiaz Chaudhry of LUMS’ Energy Institute, Zargham Ishaq of National Engineering Services of Pakistan (Nespak) and Abid Lodhi, a consultant.

Also blames PDM govt, slams Nepra for jumping the gun

The committee interviewed all the stakeholders including key players in all Discos, Nepra and technical resources like Power Information Technology Company (PITC) and Power Planning & Monitoring Company (PPMC) for data collection, examination and collation.
The committee was constituted by the Power Division on the instructions of the Prime Minister’s Office after an investigation by Nepra found massive billing malpractices by all Discos including K-Electric as consumers across the country raised hue and cry over excessive bills in July and August 2023 and turned to streets in protest.
Delayed meter reading
Nepra had concluded that Discos were “charging excessive bills/detection bills to the consumers by adopting illegal and unlawful practices, therefore, prima facie, violated the Nepra Act, Consumer Service Manual (CSM), Terms & Conditions of Tariff and other applicable documents, etc”.
The committee consented with the basic assertion of Nepra that meter reading has to be based on the transparency of reading within a stipulated period and that this accuracy is achieved only when accurate snapshots with reading date are ensured and printed on the electricity bill. “Such is the design of the billing system that any lack of accuracy and delayed reading can and does result in a change of slab or status of the consumers who suffer pecuniary loss,” said the inquiry committee and did not accept the Discos claim that number of affected consumers was not huge. “People are not numbers. All Discos need to address this issue on an immediate basis.”
Without naming the then government, the probe committee said that “an increase in tariff was notified on July 26, 2023 with retrospective effect from July 1” and the majority of consumers had to pay two months’ electricity bill in August 2023. “It resulted in a sudden increase in electricity bills heavily encumbering the common man’s capacity to pay,” it said, adding that trend analysis of the last 32 months for all Discos data showed “a repeating pattern of meter readings going beyond 30 or 31 days. This phenomenon happens almost in all months and is more pronounced in the months when more holidays fall”.
The investigation team did not agree with Nepra’s allegation of deliberate overbilling based on malpractices and mala fide but said clearly it was inefficiency which should be addressed on priority.
All the members of the committee attributed this to extreme weather conditions, general holidays, bifurcation of sub-divisions, shortage of meter reading staff, transportation and up-to-date mobile sets which seemed to have been “ignored” by Nepra.
Financial gains
It asserted that the combined financial gain to all Discos in the said two months was just Rs1.95bn (about 0.22pc) of a Rs902bn billing which meant that the financial imprint of deliberate fraud should have been much larger. It said the reading staff was 31pc short of sanctioned strength as only 10,728 meter readers were working in all the Discos against a sanctioned strength of 15,547, leaving about 4,920 positions vacant.
At the same time, the committee also confirmed that despite an anti-theft and anti-corruption campaign of the power ministry over the past many months throughout the country “electricity theft through sophisticated and unsophisticated means exists in varying quantities in Discos”.
The committee commended only the KE for ensuring maximum transparency in meter readings because of the independent decision-making of its management without any obvious politicisation.
On the question of detection bills and their recovery, the committee again blamed Nepra for generalising failure in recoveries. It said the issue was of serious proportions in Sukkur, Hyderabad and Peshawar-based Discos while the performance of other Discos seemed “satisfactory”.
The report confirmed Nepra’s allegation of delayed meter replacements. The committee said several consumers were subjected to delayed reading and out of those many consumers suffered due to changes in slabs, protected and lifeline categories.
Mepco had the largest group of affected consumers — 40.8pc in July 2023 and 34.7pc in August 2023 of its domestic consumers — thus 53pc contribution came from Mepco followed by 20pc from Gujranwala-Disco.
Interestingly, while exonerating Discos’ managements of mala fide and deliberate overbilling, the committee said the “data at the sub-divisional level does not absolve the sub-divisional tier of certain specific sub-divisions where the variation between the two months are very high”.
It said adequate mechanisms did not exist in the consumer manual to protect domestic consumers in case of reading going beyond 30-31 days and also confirmed that delayed meter replacements created “plausible case of malpractice” and their snap accuracy was suscept to overbilling. Also, the report blamed managements for failing to hire the right number of meter readers and procure adequate mobile sets. On top of that, no Disco had approved modern IT solutions like GIS mapping.
The committee called for performance evaluation of all boards of the Discos as well as managements against key performance indicators relating to loss reduction and consumer satisfaction.

1,SBP arranging $1.8bn to repay China,The central bank has been striving to maintain its foreign exchange reserves above $8bn to ensure exchange rate stability.,"KARACHI: The financial market dealing with foreign exchange is tense on reports about the expected higher dollar outflows.
Sources in the financial sector not willing to be quoted said the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) is currently burdened with arranging $1.8 billion for repayment of a Chinese loan due in March.
“The Ministry of Finance has yet not provided local currency equivalent to $1.8bn to the State Bank for making payment to China,” said the informed sources in the finance ministry.
Despite higher outflows of profits and dividends on foreign investments during the first seven months of the current fiscal year, the stuck-up amount is more than what had been repatriated.
Sources said the local currency against $800 million has been provided but the central bank is reluctant to repatriate this amount.
The SBP has been striving to maintain its foreign exchange reserves above $8bn to ensure exchange rate stability. However, several repayments are in queue for debt servicing, profits outflows and other dues.
Pakistan facing a serious balance of payments crisis successfully managed repayment obligations in the first half of the current fiscal year.
During the first seven months of FY24, the current account deficit was $1bn against $3.8bn in the same period of last year. However, the increasing imports could widen the CAD to a much higher level till the end of this fiscal year on June 30.
The imports are bound to increase by more than 50pc in the remaining months of the FY24 as per the IMF condition.
“The problem is that the IMF likes to see the reserves of the State Bank at $9bn at the end of this fiscal year, but the inflows and outflows have lost the balance,” said a senior analyst.
Financial sector experts said the country has no clue how to raise dollars from anywhere except the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other lending agencies. However, convincing the lenders for more loans would not be easy. For a new coalition government in Islamabad, it would be hard to accept the expected tougher conditions of the IMF. For example, checking the inflation, which is still on average around 28.7pc, the interest rate may not be reduced. The high cost of capital would greatly hit the growth as the economy contracted in FY23 and a meagre projection of 2pc was made for FY24.
Trade and industry have been shouting for a year that they have lost competitiveness with such a high rate of interest along with regular increases in electricity and gas prices.
“The industry has been suffering and would not offer more for exports but the political government will pay heavy cost of negative or low economic growth as it will generate unemployment on a large scale,” said Aamir Aziz, a manufacturer and exporter of textile finished products. Unemployment is one of the biggest problems, particularly for young skilled and unskilled people. About 0.9 million Pakistanis left the country in search of jobs in 2023.
Unconfirmed rollover
Reports that appeared in the media said that China has rolled over the $2bn loan, which Pakistan is required to repay in March, but the Ministry of Finance has not confirmed the development till the filing of this story.

2,India accuses US of stalling WTO,ABU DHABI: A US-led push to reform the World Trade Organisation’s embattled dispute settlement system sparked...,"ABU DHABI: A US-led push to reform the World Trade Organisation’s embattled dispute settlement system sparked divisions at a WTO meeting on Wednesday, with India accusing Washington of bringing the trade body to a “standstill”.
A working session on dispute settlement reform was held on the third day of the WTO’s 13th ministerial meeting (MC13) in Abu Dhabi, where little progress is expected on the issue amid major disagreements.
Washington, under former President Donald Trump, brought the system to a grinding halt in 2019 by blocking the appointment of new judges to the WTO’s appeals court, the organisation’s highest dispute settlement authority.
Dispute settlement reform is a “hard issue” but the dynamic in the negotiating room at MC13 is “constructive, it’s positive, it’s sober,” US Trade Representative Katherine Tai told reporters on Wednesday.
But “there is more work to do,” she added, following the working session.
During the last WTO ministerial in 2022, member states reached a commitment to having a fully and well-functioning dispute settlement system in place by 2024.
The overall outcome of MC13 could only reiterate this commitment, despite demands by some member states, including India, for stronger progress at the Abu Dhabi talks.
Tai said “convergence is happening” on various areas of dispute settlement reform.
But “there is another set of issues that are going to be harder and that are going to take longer to address, including what to do with the appeals mechanism and how to have a mechanism for review that doesn’t repeat the problems of the appellate body that came before it,” she said.
Washington has accused the appellate body of over-interpreting WTO rules, with Tai on Wednesday saying the now-defunct body was formerly more powerful than member states.
It was “extremely activist, extremely powerful, more powerful than even the members, where members could secure new rules through litigation and not have to rely on the very hard work of negotiating with each other,” she said.
‘Sense of urgency’
Washington’s push for reform has angered India, which accused the US on Wednesday of bringing the WTO to a “standstill”.
India threatened to hold off on any new deals before progress is made on the appellate body, which could imperil agreements on fisheries subsidies and agriculture, largely seen as the main agenda items of the ministerial talks.
“It’s important that the first issue we should settle is that there should be an appellate body and some countries are not allowing that to happen,” India’s commerce minister Piyush Goyal told AFP.
“The entire working of WTO currently has come to a little bit of a standstill”.
Responding to his remarks, Tai said: “there is nothing standing still in this ministerial conference.” There is a concern among observers that delays to the restoration of the appellate body could throw it into jeopardy, especially if Trump is re-elected as US president in November.

3,Businesses urge swift reforms to revive economy,"Demand steep cuts in power, gas, and interest rates to boost investor morale.","KARACHI: The anxiety among businessmen is yet to subside after the elections, as they believe that only a significant drop in power, gas, and interest rates can revive economic activities and attract investors, making the working environment less tense and challenging.
CEO of the Pakistan Business Council (PBC), Ehsan Malik, emphasised that a faltering economy demands astute management and cannot be left on autopilot. Uncertainty in the government is detrimental to investor confidence, he added.
Mr Malik stated that businesses recognise the inevitability of the 24th IMF programme, regardless of the ruling party. The country needs larger assistance, around $8-10 billion, over a longer four to five-year period, to undertake fundamental reforms and re-profile debts.
He added that these reforms should cover the broadening of the tax base, stemming losses of state-owned enterprises through privatisation, and arresting the build-up of circular debt in the energy sector.

Demand steep cuts in power, gas, and interest rates to boost investor morale

Simultaneously, the federal government must renegotiate the NFC Award, reduce expenditure, cut fiscal deficit, and trim borrowing to lower inflation and debt servicing costs, he said.
He acknowledged the challenges of implementing these measures, especially by a quasi-coalition government, considering the potential impact on vote banks, including feudal landlords, urban property owners, retailers, service providers, informal transporters, undocumented real estate owners, and state-owned enterprise employees at risk of displacement.
Mr Malik questioned the effectiveness of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) in facilitating a massive transformation for immediate and long-term objectives. Without this, he warned, neither local nor foreign investment will materialise, and inflation will persist.
He urged the PML-N government to prioritise the country over the party and avoid repeating the mistakes of the PDM government.
The PBC suggested that stakeholders collaborate to ease tensions, resolve differences, and find common ground in the country’s interest. The deficit of trust is as significant, if not more, as the twin deficits on external and fiscal accounts.
Senior vice president of the FPCCI, Saquib Fayyaz Magoon, expressed optimism about political and economic uncertainties dissipating after the general elections. He emphasised the necessity of reducing power, gas, and interest rates for both local and foreign investors to take risks.
President of the KCCI, Iftikhar Ahmed Sheikh, highlighted existing political and economic uncertainties.
“We hope that the upcoming government will engage with the business community to address the unbearable gas and power tariffs and formulate long-term policies to reduce the cost of doing business,” he said.
For the last two months, both foreign and local investors have remained reluctant to put up fresh investments, thus operating below their capacity due to high utility charges, he added.
No industry can function at 22pc interest rates, he said, adding that the energy crisis in the last few months has forced many SMEs to close down their units.
Secretary general of the OICCI, M. Abdul Aleem, briefly stated, “The investment climate is far from attractive for foreign investors and nees serious policy decisions by all stakeholders to overcome the current depressed economic and investment environment.”
Auto part maker/exporter Mashood Ali Khan emphasised the importance of leveraging administrative experience as the new government takes office. He urged effective resource allocation, emphasising development and industrialisation in the upcoming budget. Prudent fiscal management, cutting unnecessary expenses, and prioritising investments are crucial for progress.
He said the new government needs to build trust among domestic investors, ensuring a conducive climate, followed by clarity and consistency in industrialisation policies.
Mr Khan highlighted the need for immediate action on energy prices, reducing interest rates, and lowering electricity and gas costs to alleviate burdens on businesses and stimulate economic activity.
