0,SC asked to rectify ‘miscarriage of justice’ in Zulfikar Ali Bhutto case,"Ex-SC judge terms it ""a murder of trial, not a trial of murder""; apex court hints at concluding proceedings on Monday.","ISLAMABAD: Continuing his arguments as amicus curiae for a second day on Wednesday, retired Supreme Court judge Manzoor Malik described the presidential reference seeking an opinion on revisiting the death penalty awarded to former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto as “historical question”, saying it’s for the top court to rectify the miscarriage of justice or simply brush it aside on technical grounds.
Justice Malik, an expert in criminal law, cited an application of the PPP founder before the Lahore High Court seized with the murder trial, uttering the historical words: “It was not a trial of murder but a murder of trial.”
 
 

Though the reference has been sent by the president under the court’s advisory jurisdiction, the Supreme Court has the authority to do complete justice by invoking Article 187 of the Constitution, contended Justice Malik.
A nine-judge SC bench, headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa, had recently taken up the reference filed in April 2011 on behalf of then president Asif Ali Zardari. The court hinted at concluding the proceedings on Monday next week.

Ex-SC judge terms it ‘a murder of trial, not a trial of murder’; apex court hints at concluding proceedings on Monday

In March 1979, nearly two years after the Bhutto government’s ouster by military dictator Gen Ziaul Haq, a seven-judge SC bench, in a split four-three verdict, upheld the LHC verdict awarding death sentence to ex-PM Bhutto.
At the conclusion of arguments by Justice Malik, complainant Ahmed Raza Qasuri came to the rostrum and wondered whether the court had crossed the bridge of maintainability as Justice Malik appeared to be more of a defence counsel than the friend of the court (amicus).
Justice Malik explained that he did not want to go into political repercussion of the murder trial of the former prime minister, but it was a question of history, arguing that the injustice committed to Mr Bhutto was still alive in the minds of the people of interior Sindh.
Dissecting the confession of former director general (DG) of the Federal Security Force (FSF) Masood Mehmood who later turned approver, the ex-judge explained that his confession was not confidence-inspiring since his claims seemed not plausible in every aspect of the matter. No prudent mind will ever fathom what the approver was claiming in his statement, he said.
 
 

During the hearing, CJP Isa asked Attorney General for Pakistan Mansoor Usman Awan to find out from the government record how did and under what circumstances the approver left for the US where he died eventually — whether under some deal offered to him or witness protection programme or he just chose to move to America.
Justice Malik contended that the FSF director general’s statement was not natural and after reading the same, it emerged as if he was the man of integrity and his personality even was appreciated by then PM Bhutto that suggested that he had a clean slate.
And from his statement it appeared as if Mr Bhutto was a person who would never tolerate any dissent and even go to the extent of taking life of political opponents; besides the intention of raising the FSF was to kill the ex-PM’s political opponents and that Mr Bhutto was looking for a suitable person for the task, he added.
The CJP wondered whether it was possible that Masood Mehmood himself was the perpetrator since he might have animosity with the complainant and then he put it on the shoulders of Mr Bhutto.
Zahid F. Ebrahim, another amicus on behalf of Fatima Bhutto and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto junior, contended that it was never too late to right a wrong, adding that “we will always be a prisoner to our crimes if we do not correct what we now know as plain miscarriage of justice”.
He said there was no doubt that an elected prime minister was overthrown in a military coup and a farcical judicial trial was orchestrated for no other reason but to murder Mr Bhutto and perpetuate a dictatorship.
Farooq H. Naek, appearing on behalf of PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari emphasised that one right of appeal to the ex-PM was denied when the high court acted as the trial court and thus violated the requirement of due process.
Aitzaz Ahsan, another amicus, contended that the judgement in Bhutto case has suffered because of the environment where judges were made oppressive because of the martial law.

1,"Amid protest, Punjab Assembly okays Rs358bn budget for a month","Opposition leaders say budget details not shared with MPAs, finance minister not nominated.","LAHORE: Amid protest by the opposition, the Punjab Assembly approved here on Wednesday Rs358 billion budget to meet current expenses of the provincial government for the month of March.
As Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz is yet to form her cabinet, a motion for presenting the one-month budget was tabled by Marriyum Aurangzeb under Rule 125 of the rules of business of the provincial assembly.
Ms Aurangzeb argued that since the cabinet was yet to be formed, the house should approve the one-month budgetary measures for running day-to-day affairs of the province, including payment of salaries to government employees, provision of medicines to hospitals, and meeting expenses of other departments.
 
 

Rana Aftab Ahmed Khan of the opposition Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) objected that neither details of the budget had been shared with the MPAs nor the government had yet nominated any finance minister to present the budget.

Opposition leaders say budget details not shared with MPAs, finance minister not nominated

But Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmed Khan, who was chairing the sitting, ruled that the house was empowered under Rule 125 to approve government expenses in a situation at present being faced in the province.
The opposition members tore down copies of the agenda as amid their protest the treasury benches passed the budget.
Earlier, proceedings of the second session of the 18th house started with a delay of over three hours from its scheduled time.
Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz also participated in the sitting, while opposition members joined the proceedings wearing black armbands.
In a goodwill gesture to the opposition and to reduce the prevailing political tensions, Ms Nawaz went to the opposition benches and greeted SIC leader Rana Aftab at the start of the proceedings.
The opposition benches complained to the speaker that some of their elected members were not being allowed to attend the session by members of law-enforcement agencies.
The speaker asked them to nominate such notified members and he would ensure their presence by issuing production orders for them.
Assembly Secretary Amer Habib announced the Panel of Chairman. They included Rana Manwar, Syed Ali Haider Gilani, Ghulam Raza and Rahila Khadim.
Later, the speaker prorogued the house for an indefinite period.

2,"Nation has rejected ‘May 9 narrative’, says Yasmin","Ms Rashid alleges that the daughter of a three-time prime minister was elected to the assembly by rigging the election, claiming those who lost in Form 45, won in Form 47.","LAHORE: PTI’s Pun­jab president Dr Yasmin Rashid on Wednesday said the nation had rejected the “May 9 narrative” by voting the party-backed candidates in the Feb 8 general election.
The mandate of people was stolen on Feb 9, the next day of elections, Ms Rashid said while talking to reporters in an antiterrorism court, where she and other PTI leaders were taken from jail for the hearing of May 9 violence cases against them.
Criticising Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, the PTI leader said the Ramazan package announced by the former was not enough for poor people of the province.
She said Ms Nawaz had discussed the health card scheme at length in her maiden speech on the floor of the assembly, but ignored the poverty of citizens who were unable to feed their children.
“The princess has no knowledge of people’s miseries,” she taunted Ms Nawaz. “I know what poverty is as I have served in a government hospital for 35 years.”
Ms Rashid alleged that the daughter of a three-time prime minister was elected to the assembly by rigging the election, claiming those who lost in Form 45, won in Form 47.
Earlier, the court adjou­r­­ned the hearing of three ca­­ses against the PTI leaders and activists till March 7.
Imprisoned Senator Ejaz Chaudhry, former go­­vernor Omar Sarfraz Chee­­­ma and former provincial minister Mian Mahmoodur Rasheed were also produced before the court.

3,Lal Shahbaz Qalandar Urs celebrations begin in Sehwan,"Authorities claim to have finalised security, healthcare and other arrangements for the devotees."," 

SEHWAN: Devotees light earthen lamps and pray outside the shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar, on Wednesday.—Umair Ali

DADU: All is set for the 772nd Urs of Sufi saint Hazrat Lal Shahbaz Qalandar, beginning on Thursday, as devotees have started arriving at Sehwan from across the country to participate in the three-day celebrations.
Authorities claimed to have finalised security, healthcare and other arrangements for the devotees.
Thousands of police personnel have been deployed as part of security measures. Besides, dozens of medical camps have been established in surrounding towns and along the Indus Highway. More than 50 ambulances have been provided in case of an emergency.
In a suicide bombing at the shrine in February 2017, at least 70 people were killed and more than 150 injured.
 
 

Police claimed extraordinary security arrangements will be in place at all levels under solid and integrated linkages with other security agencies.
The police chief issued instructions to ensure deployment of bomb disposal teams to clear the premises of the shrine and the areas around it as well as all the routes leading to the entrance.
The police chief also issued order to enhance patrolling, picketing and snap-checking on the main highways and roads.
Jamshoro police said Sehwan city has been divided into eight security zones in which around 5,000 police personnel, including DSPs, are performing duties.
Along with removal of encroachment from roads leading to the shrine, officials have been directed to ensure parking arrangements at a reasonable distance from the shrine.
In case of any suspicious activity, bag, parcel, vehicle near the shrine, citizens have been request to immediately inform police helpline 15.
On the other hand, director of Syed Abdullah Shah Institute of Medical and Health Sciences Dr Moeenuddin Siddiqi said 350 beds and more than 50 ambulances have been allocated to provide health facilities to devotees.
He said 10 medical camps have been set up in areas between Jamshoro and Bhan Syedabad, besides over a dozen medical camps established along the Indus Highway.
During a visit, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah reviewed the arrangements and took briefing from Hyderabad commissioner and regional police head.
He was informed that a control room had been set up for monitoring the festivities with the help of CCTV cameras.
Mr Shah instructed the officials concerned to ensure water, washrooms and other facilities for the convenience of pilgrims.
Meanwhile, a dispute emerged between the Mela committee (organisers) and Sindh Tourism Development Corporation over a rest house, as the latter refused to hand it over to the Mela committee.
“The rest house has already been rented out,” the tourism official said. However, he added, the issue could be sorted out if the committee agreed to pay rent.
On the other hand, the committee chairman said as per past practice, rest houses were handed over to the district administration and organisers during the Urs celebrations.

4,"Heavy rain, flood wreak havoc in Gwadar, other parts of Balochistan",Port city receives 180mm rainfall in two days; 280 people rescued.,"GWADAR: Heavy rains wreaked havoc in Gwadar, Makran and northern and central parts of Balochistan on Wednesday, suspending the normal life and traffic.
The 30-hour-long rains triggered flash floods, submerging most of the areas. Paramilitary forces, called in by the local administration, reached the flood-affected areas and launched rescue and relief operations there. The Gwadar district administration declared a state of emergency in the rain-hit areas.
 
 

Officials said Gwadar district received around 180 millimetres of rainfall over the past two days, disrupting the normal life and rendering hundreds of people homeless. Several dozens of human settlements and commercial establishments collapsed as floodwater entered houses, while roads were badly affected.
Traffic could not be restored between Karachi and Gwadar due to damage caused to the coastal highway.

Port city receives 180mm rainfall in two days; 280 people rescued

Floodwater entered houses, forcing families to flee to safer places. “We have lost our precious households in the floodwater and our houses were not in position to live in,” Hayatullah Baloch, a resident of Gwadar, told Dawn over telephone.
The sewerage system of the port city choked as the floodwater entered it and sewage water was flowing on roads and streets. There is no water drainage system available in Gwadar and only a few pumps were working for dewatering the flooded areas. The water supply system was also badly affected and people were facing shortage of drinking water. Gwadar-Peshkan road and several dykes in Surbandan, Jewany, Palery and other areas have been washed away.
The officials said that around 280 people, including women and children whose houses collapsed, had been rescued and shifted to the GDA Rest Houses and China School. The boundary walls of over 100 houses were washed away.
They said army, navy, Gwadar Development Authority, Gwadar Port Authority and municipal committee were helping the flood-affected people.
Meanwhile, Quetta and many other towns also received rain and snowfall that flooded the human settlements and roads. The overnight rain affected the power and gas supplies in Quetta, Ziarat, Kalat, Mastung and Pishin areas.
Saleem Shahid in Quetta also contributed to this report

5,Journalists petition SC against FIA’s ‘roving inquiries’,"Urge top court to nullify PECA rule that facilitates involvement of intelligence, other govt bodies in JIT.","ISLAMABAD: The journalistic community took up their grievances with the Supreme Court on Wednesday, contesting “roving inquiries” conducted by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and the issuance of summons by a joint investigation team (JIT) on “vague” allegations of conducting a malicious campaign against the superior judiciary.
The Press Association of the Supreme Court (PAS) and the Islamabad High Court Journalists Association (IHCJA), represented by senior counsel Salahuddin Ahmed, filed a petition arguing that such inquiries by the JIT had sent a chilling effect and unreasonably restricted the right of free speech and information guaranteed under Article 19 and 19-A of the Constitution.
 
 

The petitioners also called upon the apex court to strike down Rule 17 of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Investigation Rules, 2018, which facilitates the involvement of intelligence and other government bodies in JIT operations.
The petition sought a declaration from the Supreme Court that the FIA lacks the jurisdiction to investigate so-called “explicit and malicious campaign against judges and declare the same to be in violation of Article 19, 19-A, 175 and 204 of the Constitution and ultra vires PECA 2016 and consequently strike down the interior ministry’s Feb 16, 2020, notification and any notices issued by the FIA under Section 160 of the CrPC”.

Urge top court to nullify PECA rule that facilitates involvement of intelligence, other govt bodies in JIT

The petition argued that the power to punish for scandalising a judge or the judiciary — so cautiously and sparingly exercised by the Supreme Court itself — could not be handed over to the FIA for using it when it deems fit since it would allow the executive to destroy the freedom of speech.
This would violate the doctrine of separation of powers, the petition argued, adding that a lack of appropriate self-regulation by the media in some cases should not be compensated by a sweeping use of criminal proceedings against journalists to intimidate or blackmail the media.
Nor could a lack of implementation and enforcement of tort liabilities under defamation or other media-related laws by our subordinate judiciary or concerned statutory bodies be compensated through criminal prosecution of journalists, the petition emphasised.
It said that when the FIA took over the duties of enforcing contempt laws by misusing PECA, journalists were often deprived of fair hearing or bail by trial courts, which might be influenced on the grounds that the matter pertained to the apex court.
The petition said it was more appropriate that any matter of contempt of the Supreme Court should be tackled by the top court itself. Defamatory or contemptuous material on social media was not attributable to recognised journalists, but even to state-sponsored sources, the petition said, adding that the Supreme Court’s Jan 13, 2024, decision in the bat symbol case was a matter of great public interest and had very significant political implications.
Therefore, the judgment was subjected to public comment and criticism in print, electronic and social media — some expressed in scathing terms and some of which was unjustified.
The petition argued that it was for the Supreme Court to determine whether any such comment or criticism constituted contempt of court and, if so, whether any further action was warranted.
 
 

Last month, the Ministry of Interior formed a JIT under Section 30 of PECA 2016 to investigate the ongoing malicious campaign on social media against Supreme Court judges and submit a preliminary report within 15 days. The team was headed by the FIA’s additional director general of the cybercrime wing and also comprised representatives of IB, ISI, DIG ICT Police, PTA, etc.
The journalists’ petition argued that the interior ministry had confused the role of JIT with an inquiry commission.
It said that the intent behind setting up a JIT involving representatives of intelligence agencies with such broad and all-encompassing reach was clearly to send a message to all that any person who criticised the Supreme Court on social media would be liable to arrest and serious punishment.
It said that a total of 65 notices had been issued to various people, including more than 30 journalists, pursuant to no less than 115 inquiries registered in the 15 cybercrime reporting centres of the FIA, located in Karachi, Hyderabad, Sukkur, Multan, Faisalabad, Lahore, Gujranwala, Rawalpindi, Gilgit, Islamabad, Peshawar, Abbottabad, Dera Ismail Khan, Quetta and Gwadar.
