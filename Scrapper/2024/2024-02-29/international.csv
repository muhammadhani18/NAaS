DEARBORN: Joe Biden’s campaign and top Democratic officials vowed to double down on efforts to win back former supporters after being hit by a much stronger-than-anticipated protest vote in the Michigan primary over the president’s support of Israel.
About 13.2 per cent of Michigan Democrats cast a ballot for  “uncommitted” in the nominating contest, following a weeks-long push by activists, an Edison Research tally showed after 9am on Wednesday. With about 85pc of all votes counted, the uncommitted vote was already over 101,000 votes, far higher than expected. Turnout for the Democratic primary was also high, at some 900,000 voters overall. About 81pc of those votes backed Biden.
As the results were being tallied, a senior Biden campaign official said the team will continue to  “make our case in the state — to both uncommitted voters and the entire Michigan constituency. The president will continue to work for peace in the Middle East.”
Biden’s staunch support for Israel during its five-month war with Hamas, which has decimated Gaza, has sparked outrage and a well-organised backlash among progressive Democrats and Arab Americans, with Michigan as their epicentre.

They asked Biden to push for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, condition aid to Israel and for sympathetic Democrats to vote  “uncommitted” in the primary to signal that Biden could lose their support in November’s general election, aiming for 10,000 votes, a low figure historically.
About 20,000 uncommitted votes were cast in Michigan’s 2012 Democratic primary, the last time a Democratic president was up for reelection in the Midwestern state.
Biden won Michigan by a less than 3pc margin in 2020, and some polls show likely Republican candidate Donald Trump ahead in a head-to-head matchup this time.Michigan Democratic officials vowed to do more to win over voters. “Tomorrow is the first day of this general election, Michigan Lieutenant Governor Garlin Gilchrist II told volunteers working on behalf of Biden as results rolled in on Tuesday night.
“We are not afraid of people participating in democracy. We are not afraid of voters. We are not afraid of people who are ready to speak out in good faith, in good conscience because they have good intentions,” he said.
Biden Michigan campaign manager Mike Frosolone told party organisers their efforts would pivot to the general election effort in the state, with door knocking, phone banking and the opening of several offices statewide.
“We know when voters see President Biden and Donald Trump’s record side by side, they’re going to choose President Biden,” he said. He said Biden would lay out this case in his State of the Union address on March 7.
Biden, 81, faces low general approval ratings and concern about his age, as does former President Trump, 77. Trump was formally ordered to pay about $450 million for fraudulently manipulating his net worth by a New York judge this month and faces four unrelated criminal prosecutions, in which he has pleaded not guilty.
Some 35pc of Republicans backed former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley in the Michigan primary, a potential sign of weakness for Trump as well. Some of her voters have said they won’t back Trump in a general election.

1,Moldovan region asks Russia for ‘protection’,Russia responded that one of its “priorities” was to protect the thin sliver of land.,"MOSCOW: Pro-Russian rebel officials in Moldova’s breakaway region of Transnistria appealed to Russia for  “protection” on Wednesday, amid fears the territory could become a new flashpoint in Moscow’s conflict with neighbouring Ukraine.
Russia responded that one of its  “priorities” was to protect the thin sliver of land, which has been de facto controlled by pro-Russian forces since the collapse of the Soviet Union but is internationally recognised as part of Moldova.
And Moldova’s government rejected  “propaganda statements” from pro-Russian separatists, adding that the region  “benefits from the policies of peace, security and economic integration with the European Union”.
At a special congress in the region — only the seventh in its history — lawmakers passed a resolution asking Russia’s parliament to  “protect” Transnistria from mounting Moldovan pressure. They said the Moldovan government in Chisinau had unleashed an  “economic war” against Transnistria, blocking vital imports in the aim of turning it into a  “ghetto”.
“The decisions of the current congress cannot be ignored by the international community,” the breakaway republic’s foreign policy chief Vitaly Ignatiev told the meeting.
“We are talking about an appeal for diplomatic support,” he later told Russian state television. The resolution comes just a day before President Vladimir Putin was set to make an annual address before Russian lawmakers and as Ukraine suffers setbacks on the battlefield.
The separatist territory last held a congress in 2006, when deputies anno­unced a referendum on integrating with Russia. The vote resulted in an overwhelming majority in favour.
The call for help from Moscow has fuelled comparisons with February 2022, when Russian-backed militants in eastern Ukraine called for protection against what they said was relentless attacks and shelling by Kyiv’s forces.

2,UN ‘appalled’ by public executions in Afghanistan,Afghanistan’s Taliban government publicly executed three convicted murderers in the past week on death warrants signed by Supreme Leader Hiba­tullah Akhundzada.,"GENEVA: The United Nations on Wednesday condemned recent public executions in Afghanistan, urging the Taliban authorities to cease the use of capital punishment.
Afghanistan’s Taliban government publicly executed three convicted murderers in the past week on death warrants signed by Supreme Leader Hiba­tullah Akhundzada.
All three men were shot multiple times in front of large crowds that included the families of their victims.
“We are appalled by the public executions of three people at sports stadiums in Afghanistan in the past week,” said Jeremy Laurence, spokesman for the UN Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner in a statement. “Public executions are a form of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,” the statement added.
“Such executions are also arbitrary in nature and contrary to the right to life protected under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Afghanistan is a State party.” The United States, the only Western democracy that still practises capital punishment, also condemned the public executions.
“It’s another sign of the brutality that the Afghan government shows to its own people,” State Depar­tment spokesman Matthew Miller said. During the Taliban’s first rule from 1996 to 2001, public executions were common.
Since their return to power in August 2021, a handful of executions have been conducted in accordance with their government’s austere vision of Islam.

3,German navy ‘almost shot down’ US drone,"According to a German news outlet, the frigate fired two missiles at the drone, but both crashed into the sea because of “a technical defect”.","FRANKFURT: A German naval frigate sent to protect commercial ships in the Red Sea ‘almost shot down’ a US drone by mistake earlier this week.
The German defence ministry confirmed media reports that a drone incident involving an allied nation occurred on Monday, without naming the country.
The Hesse frigate opened fire after efforts to identify an unknown drone “were unsuccessful”, Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said during a visit to the German town of Oberviechtach, adding that the target was “not hit”.
The drone later turned out to be a “reconnaissance drone”, he said.
According to Der Spiegel weekly, the frigate fired two missiles at the drone, but both crashed into the sea because of “a technical defect”.
The weekly, without citing its sources, said the drone that was nearly downed was a US Reaper.
It might have been operating in the region “as part of an American anti-terror mission” unrelated to the Red Sea mission, Spiegel added.
The Frankfurter Allgem-eine newspaper said it was  “common knowledge that American combat drones are used in the region that have nothing to do with the operation in the Red Sea”. The German defence ministry said the frigate only launched an attack after none of its allies reported a drone in the area.
According to Spiegel, military officials believed the friendly fire incident showed that coordination between allies involved in various missions in the region around Yemen “needs to be improved”.
The Hesse arrived in the region at the weekend as part of an EU mission to help secure shipping in the Red Sea from attacks by Yemen’s Houthis.

4,Italian general suspended for book slammed as racist,"Roberto Vannacci, 55, had already been ousted last year from the management of the Military Geographical Institute.","ROME: Italy’s defence ministry has suspended a general and cut his pay for breaching army neutrality with a book that critics said insulted sexual and ethnic minorities, his lawyer said on Wednesday.
Roberto Vannacci, 55, had already been ousted last year from the management of the Military Geographical Institute, and moved to an essentially administrative role as chief of staff of the operational land forces command.
He has now been suspended from that position for 11 months, with the resulting  “halving of his salary”, his lawyer Giorgio Carta said. The announcement comes as Vannacci is mulling standing for European Parliament elections in June under the banner of the far-right League party of Italy’s deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini.
Salvini has defended the general, who served in Afghanistan and Iraq, saying the investigations and actions against him were  “ridiculous”.
“How scared are they of the general? Long live freedom of thought and speech, long live the armed forces and the police,” he wrote on X on Wednesday.

5,"Northern Ireland amnesty law breaches HR convention, says UK court","Following the ruling, it is now up to the UK parliament to decide whether to amend the controversial Troubles law or ignore it.","BELFAST: A UK law granting immunity to combatants involved in the decades of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland known as  “the Troubles” breaches the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), a Belfast court ruled on Wednesday.
Victims of the violence challenged the law, which received royal assent in September despite widespread opposition from political parties, victims’ organisations, the Irish government and the Council of Europe.
Following the ruling, it is now up to the UK parliament to decide whether to amend the controversial Troubles law or ignore it, which could prompt further legal action.
The law calls for the creation of a truth and recovery commission offering amnesty to British security personnel and paramilitaries if they cooperate with its enquiries.
More than 3,500 people were killed during three decades of sectarian conflict that began in the 1960s over British rule in Northern Ireland. Around 1,200 deaths remain under investigation by police in the province, according to the UK government.
In its ruling, the Belfast High Court said there is no evidence that the immunity provision in the new law will in any way contribute to reconciliation in the UK territory.
Judge Adrian Colton found the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Act, as it is formally known, breaches at least two ECHR articles.
However, he also said the new body set up to probe Troubles killings — the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR) — could proceed with human rights-compliant investigations.
“The court is satisfied that the provisions of the Act leave sufficient scope for ICRIR to conduct an effective investigation as required under Articles 2 and 3 of ECHR,” he added. But Colton noted  “should it fall short” of these obligations, he expected further court scrutiny.
‘Complex’
Reacting in parliament, Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris said the government  “remains committed” to implementing the law but needed more time to consider the court decision. “It is a very complex case, I am told the judgment runs to over 200 pages and I am yet to see it,” he told MPs. “It will take some time to consider,” Heaton-Harris adding, vowing to do so  “very carefully”.
His ministry has previously insisted the new commission would have  “necessary powers to conduct criminal investigations… ensuring compliance with the government’s international obligations under the ECHR”. But Hilary Benn, the main Labour opposition’s Northern Ireland spokesman, questioned how it could now become operational  “when one of its central powers has just been struck down”.
The Council of Europe, the continent’s leading human rights watchdog, last June said it had  “serious concern” about the law, then still in draft stage. It had urged the UK to reconsider the immunity scheme, highlighting  “the importance of gaining the confidence of victims, families and potential witnesses”.
The bill has drawn ire from the families of victims, both sides of Northern Ireland’s political divide and leaders in the Republic of Ireland. Ireland’s minister for further education Simon Harris said on Wednesday the court ruling appeared  “positive from the perspective of the Irish government wanting to work to ensure that all families get justice”.

6,"After Taiwan’s striking lantern festival, school kids help clean up the mess","PINGXI: Every year on the cusp of spring, hundreds of lanterns float into the skies around a small town in northern..."," 

New Taipei City: A recycling worker takes away lanterns collected by volunteers in the mountains.—Reuters

PINGXI: Every year on the cusp of spring, hundreds of lanterns float into the skies around a small town in northern Taiwan, a spectacular light show that is one of the island’s top tourist draws.
When the flames go out though, the spent lanterns fall back to earth littering the countryside around Pingxi, in the mountains outside of Taipei.
Now a group of volunteers is leading school children to scour the countryside to gather the debris and take it to be disposed of safely. Chu Tai-shu said he hopes to inspire the next generation to spread the word about what he thinks is a destructive practice. “This is the effect we want to achieve, this is why we chose to take the children,” he said.
Lanterns are launched into the skies, powered by small wads of burning paper soaked in oil as a way of seeking good fortune and wishes for the year ahead, traditionally at the end of the Lunar New Year which marks the start of spring.
In Pingxi, they are released year-round. The region’s damp climate — it receives one of the highest amounts of annual rainfall in Taiwan — mitigates the risk the lanterns will set off forest fires when they come back down to earth. But for many years, environmental groups have criticised the lantern festival as negatively impacting the fields and forests around Pingxi when leaving behind the wire frames that give them their structure.
Revellers commonly write the date of their wishes on the lanterns and Chu said he sometimes finds lanterns more than five years old on his garbage collection hikes.
