0,New Zealand set to scrap world-first tobacco ban,"The new coalition government confirmed the repeal will happen as a matter of urgency, enabling it to scrap the law without seeking public comment.","WELLINGTON: New Zealand will repeal on Tuesday a world-first law banning tobacco sales for future generations, the government said, even while researchers and campaigners warned of the risk that people could die as a result.
Set to take effect from July, the toughest anti-tobacco rules in the world would have banned sales to those born after Jan 1, 2009, cut nicotine content in smoked tobacco products and reduced the number of tobacco retailers by more than 90pc.
The new coalition government elected in October confirmed the repeal will happen on Tuesday as a matter of urgency, enabling it to scrap the law without seeking public comment, in line with previously announced plans.
Associate Health Minister Casey Costello said the coalition government was committed to reducing smoking, but was taking a different regulatory approach to discourage the habit and reduce the harm it caused.
“I will soon be taking a package of measures to cabinet to increase the tools available to help people quit smoking,” Costello said, adding that regulations on vaping would also be tightened to deter young people.
The decision, heavily criticised over its likely impact on health outcomes in New Zealand, has also drawn flak because of fears it could have a greater impact on Maori and Pasifika populations, groups with higher smoking rates.
Repeal flies in the face of robust research evidence, ignores measures strongly supported by Maori leaders and will preserve health inequities, said Otago University researcher Janet Hoek.
“Large-scale clinical trials and modelling studies show the legislation would have rapidly increased the rates of quitting among smokers and made it much harder for young people to take up smoking,” said Hoek, co-director of a group studying ways to reduce smoking.

1,US won’t send troops to ‘fight  in Ukraine’,The statement came after the French president suggested that Western troops could be sent to Ukraine.,"WASHINGTON: The White House said on Tuesday that the United States would not send troops to fight in Ukraine.
President Joe Biden “has been clear that the US will not send troops to fight in Ukraine”, National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said in a statement. The statement came after the French president suggested that Western troops could be sent to Ukraine.
State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller, asked whether the United States could send troops for other purposes such as training, said the Biden administration opposed any deployment to Ukraine.
“We’re not sending boots on the ground in Ukraine. The president’s been very clear,” Miller told reporters.
Meanwhile, President Biden warned top congressional leaders of the dire cost of failing to help Ukraine, as high-stakes talks at the White House ended without a deal.
Biden called the rare Oval Office meeting to persuade Republican House speaker Mike Johnson to unblock vital aid for Kyiv, and avoid a government shutdown at home. The leaders said they were optimistic they could keep the government’s lights on, but on Ukraine they remained deadlocked, with Johnson insisting on the need for more border reforms first.
“On Ukraine, I think the need is urgent,” said Biden, who was accompanied by Vice President Kamala Harris for the meeting in front of a crackling fire in the historic office. He added that the “consequence of inaction every day in Ukraine is dire”.
President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned that Ukraine desperately needs more Western support to defeat Russia, and voiced hope the United States would approve the stalled package that includes $60 billion of weapons and other aid.
But Johnson, a Donald Trump ally who leads a razor-thin Republican majority in the House of Representatives, has refused to even allow a vote on a so-called supplemental funding bill containing the Ukraine aid.

2,Macron breaks taboo on Western troops in Ukraine,Zelensky in Saudi Arabia to discuss prisoner swaps.,"PARIS/KYIV: French President Emmanuel Macron has smashed a major taboo by floating the possibility of sending Western troops to Ukraine, raising the stakes in a showdown with a nuclear-armed Russia.
Hosting a conference of Euro­pean leaders on Monday night, the French leader refused to rule out the dispatch of Western troops to Ukraine as Russia’s invasion stretches into its third year and Kyiv’s military campaign appears to be faltering.
“We will do whatever it takes to ensure that Russia cannot win this war,” Macron added. A European military source, who asked not to be named, said that European allies had been studying the plan for several weeks and the United States supported the idea.
While Macron did not provide any details, the French foreign ministry said the idea did not foresee French troops directly fighting against Russian forces in Ukraine. Speaking to reporters, Lithuanian Defence Minister Arvydas Anusauskas said:  “We are talking about training missions, training components. Training.” When pressed whether it would be limited to instructors only, the minister said that he could not reveal the details because  “this is still being discussed between the countries”.

Zelensky in Saudi Arabia to discuss prisoner swaps

Former senior Nato official Camille Grand said Macron’s statements were a  “major political signal.”  “The message is threefold: to the Ukrainians, we are saying that we are prepared to take risks alongside them. To Russia, this war is very important to us,” Grand said. “To the public, the stakes are so high that we can’t rule out this possibility.”
POW deal
Ukrainian  President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday said that he  had arrived in  Saudi Arabia to promote his peace plan and discuss  potential prisoners  of war exchanges.
Saudi Arabia maintains ties  with both Moscow and  Kyiv and has mediated between the two warring  sides before, including a  deal in September 2022 that freed over 200  captive Ukrainians.
“The  kingdom’s leadership has already  contributed to the release of our  people. I am confident this meeting  will also yield results,” Zelensky  said on X, formerly Twitter.
 






“We  will also discuss promising areas  of economic cooperation and Saudi  Arabia’s involvement in Ukraine’s  reconstruction,” Zelen­sky added. He  said the two sides would also  hold dialogue on Ukraine’s  “Peace  Formula”, which calls for the full  withdrawal of Russian troops from  Ukrainian territory.
Saudi  Arabia hosted talks on the Ukraine war last year in a bid to flex its  diplomatic muscle, bringing together  representatives from nearly 40  countries, but not Russia.
‘Poker game’
Monday’s announcement appe­ared to represent a turnaround for Macron, who has for many years sought to position himself as a top mediator between Russia and Ukraine.
Less than five years ago he hosted Putin at his Mediterranean residence and flew into Moscow in February 2022 in a last-minute bid to halt the dispatch of Russian troops across the border.

3,Body of Australian TV presenter found,Police believe the pair were shot at a home in central Sydney before being loaded into surfboard bags and transported to a rural property.,"SYDNEY: Australian police found the bodies of a TV presenter and his flight attendant boyfriend in a rural area outside Sydney on Tuesday, acting on information from a police officer charged with their murder. The discovery ends an almost week-long high-profile search for the remains of entertainment journalist Jesse Baird, 26, and Qantas flight attendant Luke Davies, 29.
A 28-year-old serving police constable who had previously been in a relationship with Baird has been charged with two counts of murder.
“We are very confident we have located Luke and Jesse,” said the head of New South Wales police Karen Webb, noting the families of the two victims had received the news with relief and sadness. “This information did come with the assistance of the accused,” Webb added.
Police believe the pair were shot at a home in central Sydney before being loaded into surfboard bags and transported to a rural property about two hours’ drive from the city.
Ballistics tests showed a projectile found at the apartment matched that of a police-issue firearm. 
The weapon was later found inside a police station safe.

4,Japanese fugitive dies after deathbed confession,"Satoshi Kirishima, a former member of a Japanese radical leftist group behind deadly bomb attacks in the 1970s, was wanted for nearly 50 years.","TOKYO: DNA analysis has confirmed that a 70-year-old man who confessed on his hospital deathbed last month to being one of Japan’s most-wanted fugitives was indeed the suspect, police said on Tuesday.
Satoshi Kirishima, a former member of a Japanese radical leftist group behind deadly bomb attacks in the 1970s, was wanted for nearly 50 years, with his bespectacled, smiling mugshots almost omnipresent outside police stations across Japan.
The saga took a sudden twist last month when a terminally ill man hospitalised near Tokyo declared on his deathbed that he was Kirishima — prompting hospital staff to alert police — only to die a few days later.
Through subsequent DNA analysis,  “the person who died at the hospital on January 29 was confirmed to be Satoshi Kirishima himself”, a Tokyo police spokesman said.
With his identity now verified,  “we sent five case files (involving him) to the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office today”, the spokesman said.

5,Odysseus moon mission to be cut short after lander’s sideways touchdown,"According to estimates, the spacecraft would have otherwise operated on the moon for seven to 10 days.","Los Angeles: Flight control engineers expect to lose contact with the private US moon lander Odysseus on Tuesday, cutting short the mission five days after its sideways touchdown, the company behind the spacecraft, Intuitive Machines , said on Monday.
It remained to be seen how much scientific data might be lost as a result of the shortened life of Odysseus, which according to previous estimates from the company and its biggest customer, Nasa, would have otherwise operated on the moon for seven to 10 days.
The company’s forecast for a premature end to the mission came as new details emerged about testing shortcuts and human error that led to an in-flight failure of the spacecraft’s laser-guided range finders ahead of its landing last Thursday.
An Intuitive Machines official said the loss of the range finders stemmed from the company’s decision to forego a pre-launch test-firing of the laser system to save time and money during pre-flight checks of Odysseus at Nasa’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
“There were certainly things we could’ve done to test it and actually fire it. They would’ve been very time-consuming and very costly,” Mike Hansen, the company’s head of navigation systems, said in an interview on Saturday.  “So that was a risk as a company that we acknowledged and took that risk.”
On Friday Intuitive Machines had disclosed that the laser range finders — designed to feed altitude and forward-velocity readings to Odysseus’ autonomous navigation system — were inoperable because company engineers neglected to unlock the lasers’ safety switch before launch on Feb 15. The safety lock, akin to a firearm’s safety switch, can only be disabled by hand.
The range-finder glitch, detected just hours before the final descent, forced flight controllers to improvise an experimental work-around to avoid what could have been a catastrophic crash-landing.
Solar power limited
Hansen, the engineer who crafted the software  “patch” that solved the problem, said the company had yet to determine whether the improvised navigational solution, which employed an experimental Nasa-supplied system on the lander, might have been a factor in the spacecraft’s sideways landing.
The company said during its first post-landing news briefing on Friday that Odysseus caught the bottom of one of its six landing legs on the uneven lunar surface on final descent and tipped over, coming to rest horizontally, apparently propped up on a rock.
Intuitive Machines executives speculated that the forward speed of the spacecraft on landing, about twice as fast as expected, may have been a factor in stumbling. But it remained uncertain whether use of the original laser range finders might have made a difference.
In any case, Odysseus’ sideways posture substantially limited how much its solar panels were exposed to sunlight, necessary for recharging its batteries. Moreover, two of its antennae were pointed toward the ground, impeding communications with the lander, the company said on Friday.
Intuitive Machines executives said then that its engineering teams would need more time to assess how the overall mission would be affected. In an update posted online on Monday, the Houston-based company said:  “Flight controllers intend to collect data until the lander’s solar panels are no longer exposed to light.

6,Plastic pellets blight Belgian town as EU weighs action,"CAUSSINNES D’ENGHIEN: Buried in the soil, dotting riverbanks and bobbing along streams: a small Belgian town has...","CAUSSINNES D’ENGHIEN: Buried in the soil, dotting riverbanks and bobbing along streams: a small Belgian town has waged a years-long fight against creeping pollution from plastic pellets — which the EU now has in its sights.
A spectacular spill of microplastics on Spain’s Galician coast cast a spotlight on the problem late last year, after a container filled with  “nurdles” fell from a cargo ship and its contents washed ashore.
The images of locals sifting through the sand to weed out the tiny polluting pellets felt all too familiar in Ecaussinnes. The small countryside town is home to Belgium’s second largest petrochemical complex, and microplastic pollution has been a problem here for decades.
“We find them around industrial sites, in the waterways as far as eight kilometres (five miles) downstream,” explained Arnaud Guerard, a local government official in charge of environmental matters.
“They burrow into riverbanks, and depending on rainfall they end up on agricultural land.” About the size of a lentil and made from fossil fuels, nurdles — or pre-production plastic pellets — are a little-known building block used to manufacture nearly all plastic products.
According to European Commission data, up to 184,000 tonnes of pellets per year — the equivalent of 20 truckloads each day — are dispersed into the environment across the 27-nation EU.
At the local level, Guerard blames pollution in Ecaussinnes on  “dysfunction” in the industrial zone where the French giant TotalEnergies produces more than a million tonnes of the pellets per year.

7,Thousands of artists ask  Venice Biennale to exclude Israel,"The Venice Biennale has previously banned South Africa over its apartheid policy, and excluded Russia after its 2022 invasion of Ukraine.","ROME: Almost 9,000 people, including artists, curators and museum directors, have signed an online appeal calling for Israel to be excluded from this year’s Venice Biennale art fair and accusing the country of  genocide in Gaza.
Israel has been facing mounting international criticism, including in the arts world, over its military offensive in the Palestinian enclave.“Any official representation of Israel on the international cultural stage is an endorsement of its policies and of the genocide in Gaza,” said the online statement by the Art Not Genocide Alliance (ANGA) collective.
ANGA said the Venice Biennale had previously banned South Africa over its apartheid policy of white minority rule, and excluded Russia after its 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
Italian Culture Minister Gennaro Sangiuliano said the appeal was an  “unacceptable, as well as shameful … diktat of those who believe they are the custodians of truth, and with arrogance and hatred, think they can threaten freedom of thought and creative expression.”
He said in a statement that Israel  “not only has the right to express its art, but also the duty to bear witness to its people”.
The Venice Biennale press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Signatories of the appeal include Palestine Museum US director Faisal Saleh, activist US photographer Nan Goldin and British visual artist Jesse Darling, who won last year’s Turner Prize.
Dubbed the  “Olympics of the art world”, the Biennale is one of the main events in the international arts calendar. This year’s edition,  “Foreigners Everywhere”, is due to host pavilions from 90 countries between April 20 and Nov 24.

8,Houthis say they can reassess Red Sea attacks if ‘aggression’ stops,LONDON: Yemen’s Houthis said on Tuesday they could only reconsider their missile and drone attacks on ...,"LONDON: Yemen’s Houthis said on Tuesday they could only reconsider their missile and drone attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea once Israel ends its  “aggression” in the Gaza Strip.
Asked if they would halt the attacks if a ceasefire deal is reached, Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam said the situation would be reassessed if the siege of Gaza ended and humanitarian aid was free to enter.
“There will be no halt to any operations that help Palestinian people except when the Israeli aggression on Gaza and the siege stop,” he said.
Shipping risks have escalated due to repeated Houthi strikes in the Red Sea and Bab al-Mandab Strait since November in what they describe as acts of solidarity with Palestinians against Israel in Gaza.
US and British forces have responded with several strikes on Houthi facilities but have so far failed to halt the attacks.
Top global container line Maersk on Tuesday told its clients in a statement that they should prepare for disruptions in the Red Sea to last into the  second half of the year  and to build longer transit times into their supply chain planning.
Seafarers remain in the firing line and have signed  agreements  to receive double pay when entering the high-risk zones and have the right to refuse to sail on ships passing through the Red Sea.
Galaxy Maritime Ltd, the UK-registered owner of car carrier Galaxy Leader which was hijacked by the Houthis on Nov 19 with its 25 crew members, said on Tuesday that the mariners from Bulgaria, Ukraine, Mexico, Romania and the Philippines had  “nothing whatsoever to do with the conflict in the Middle East”.
“From the few permitted phone calls they are allowed, crew members are becoming increasingly concerned about their loved ones at home,” Galaxy Maritime said in a update.
“Families of those being detained are now calling on the international community to take action to secure the immediate release of the crew.”  Arsenio Dominguez, Secretary General of the UN’s International Maritime Organisation (IMO), called for collective action to fortify the safety of those at sea and for the release of the Galaxy Leader. Attacking international shipping is first and foremost attacking seafarers, he said at an IMO meeting.

9,"Hezbollah, Israel trade  fire as UN force calls  for end to violence",Lebanese group says it will halt fire if Hamas okays truce,"BEIRUT: Hezbollah and Israel exchanged fire on Tuesday following deadly Israeli strikes on east Lebanon a day earlier, while a United Nations official called for an end to the  “dangerous cycle of violence”.Israeli raids near east Lebanon’s Baalbek on Monday were the first in the area since hostilities began, and hit far beyond the usual border regions. The Israeli army said the strikes targeted Hezbollah air defences after the group downed an Israeli drone.
The UN special coordinator for Lebanon, Joanna Wronecka, in a statement urged  “an immediate halt to this dangerous cycle of violence and return to a cessation of hostilities”.
Hezbollah said it targeted the  “Meron air control base... with a large salvo of rockets from several launchers”, in response to the Baalbek strikes. Israeli military spokesman Avichay Adraee said the rockets caused no casualties or damage to the base, while Israeli fighter jets raided and destroyed  “a military site” and  “military infrastructure” belonging to Hezbollah in retaliation.
One of the strikes targeted Baisariyeh, almost 30 kilometres from the nearest Israeli boundary. Later, Hezbollah said it had targeted the same base again, as well as several other Israeli positions, one for the first time since hostilities started.

Lebanese group says it will halt fire if Hamas okays truce

Two Hezbollah fighters were killed in the east Lebanon strikes on Monday. Later that day, the Iran-backed group fired 60 rockets at an Israeli base in the annexed Golan Heights.
The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) warned of a  “concerning shift in the exchanges of fire” in recent days and  “an expansion and intensification of strikes”.
“Recent events have the potential to put at risk a political solution to this conflict,” the force said in a statement, urging  “all parties involved to halt hostilities... and leave space to a political and diplomatic solution”.
A temporary  truce between Hamas and Israel to allow for prisoner  releases led to a week of calm across the Lebanese-Israeli border in  late November. Hamas is now weighing a new proposal, agreed by  Israel at talks with mediators in Paris last week, for a deal that would  suspend fighting for 40 days, which would be the first extended pause  of the five-month-old war.
Gaza truce
Lebanon’s  Hezbollah will halt fire on Israel if its Palestinian ally Hamas agrees  to a proposal for a truce with Israel in Gaza — unless Israeli forces  keep shelling Lebanon, two sources familiar with Hezbollah’s thinking said on Tuesday.
“The moment Hamas announces its  approval of the truce, and the moment the truce is declared, Hezbollah  will adhere to the truce and will stop operations in the south  immediately, as happened the previous time,” one of the two sources  close to the heavily group said.
But if Israel continued shelling Lebanon, Hezbollah would not hesitate to carry on fighting, both sources said.
In Lebanon, Israeli air and missile  strikes have killed nearly 200 Hezbollah fighters and almost 50  civilians. Attacks from Lebanon into Israel have killed a dozen Israeli soldiers and half as many civilians. Tens of thousands of people have been displaced on both sides of the frontier.
Foreign envoys have sought to secure a diplomatic resolution to the fighting, reflecting worry about further escalation. Earlier  this month, France delivered a written proposal to Beirut aimed at  ending hostilities. It included negotiations to settle the disputed  Lebanon-Israel frontier and a withdrawal of Hezbollah’s elite unit 10 km from the border.
Hezbollah, which exercises significant  sway over the Lebanese state, has insisted it will discuss no  arrangements for southern Lebanon until a permanent ceasefire has been  agreed for Gaza. 
Israeli Defence  Minister Yoav Gallant indicated that Israel planned to increase attacks  on Hezbollah in the event of a possible ceasefire in the Gaza conflict.  He said the goal was to secure a Hezbollah withdrawal from the border  region, either through a diplomatic agreement or by force.

10,Hamas holds up US airman as ‘immortal’ after Gaza protest,"Says it was ""an expression of the growing state of anger among the American people"".","JERUSALEM: Hamas on Tuesday said a US airman who died after setting himself on fire outside the Israeli embassy in Washington would  “remain immortal” for his shocking anti-war protest.
Footage of the self-immolation was widely shared online, and the group said it was  “an expression of the growing state of anger among the American people” over the Israeli aggression in Gaza. The airman  “will remain immortal in the memory of our Palestinian people and the free people of the world, and a symbol of the spirit of global human solidarity with our people and their just cause,” Hamas said in a statement issued in English.
In the footage of Sunday’s protest, the military fatigues-wearing man declares he will  “not be complicit in genocide” before dousing himself in liquid, lighting himself on fire and yelling  “Free Palestine!” until he collapses. His death was announced on Monday.
Some members of US President Joe Biden’s Democratic Party are attempting to press him on his support for Israel, with Arab American voters in Michigan pledging to vote  “uncommitted” or write in  “Free Palestine” on their ballots in the state’s primary on Tuesday.
The White House has tried to assuage Arab and Muslim voters’ concerns in part by portraying the president as frustrated with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government.

Klette, 65, a member of the so-called third generation of the militant group, has long been sought alongside two other members of the group, Burkhard Garweg and Ernst-Volker Staub, for a series of robberies and at least one attempted murder.
“Late yesterday evening, police succeeded in detaining Daniela Klette in a Berlin apartment,” said Friedo de Vries, head of the criminal investigation department in Lower Saxony at a news briefing on Tuesday.  “She offered no resistance.” 
At the very end of the briefing, de Vries said he had just received news that a second arrest had been made in Berlin, but said the detainee’s identity had not yet been confirmed.
Police stepped up their efforts to detain the fugitives after receiving a tip from the public in November. That led to an appeal on a popular TV crime show two weeks ago, which brought in 250 further tips that police are still processing.
“Terrorism will be fought with all legal means,” said Lower Saxony’s interior minister Daniela Behrens.  “Terrorists can never feel safe, not even after 30 years.”  Police seized a pistol, two magazines and cartridges in the apartment block in Berlin’s central Kreuzberg district where Klette was found alone, prosecutors said. She was later taken by helicopter to a jail in the northern city of Bremen.
Founded by Andreas Baader and Ulrike Meinhof among others, the far-left RAF’s first generation emerged from German student protests against the Vietnam War. The group took hostages and murdered at least 33 people, including public officials, police officers, business leaders and US soldiers, during the height of its activity in the 1970s.

The seven were convicted of  “creating and financing terrorist organisations and entities”, the official Saudi Press Agency said, citing the Gulf kingdom’s interior ministry.
Saudi Arabia, one of the world’s most prolific users of capital punishment, has now executed 29 people this year according to a tally of official announcements, after putting 170 to death in 2023.The nationalities of the seven executed on Tuesday were not revealed, but their names and titles indicated they were Saudi.
They were convicted of  “adopting a terrorist approach that calls for bloodshed, establishing and financing terrorist organisations and entities, and communicating and dealing with them with the aim of disrupting the security and stability of society” and endangering national security, the official news agency said.
The vice president of the European Saudi Organisation for Human Rights, Adel al-Saeed, condemned what he called  “the vague and loose charges” behind the executions.
The statement by the authorities did not name the  “terrorist organisation” the executed were accused of being members of,  “what exactly the crimes it committed” were or  “the role of the victims in these crimes”, Saeed said.

“This is not an exhibition”, reads the sign at the entrance to the Palestinian Museum in Birzeit, near Ramallah, showcasing art and heritage from the Gaza Strip.
Alongside contemporary pieces, the works include old, traditional paintings and costumes, as well as archeological artefacts, said board member Ehab Bessaiso, a former culture minister.
He said that the museum had launched the initiative to  “preserve Palestinian heritage work in Gaza, which has faced destruction due to the war”. 
Israeli aggression has devastated the small Hamas-ruled coastal territory, with its cultural heritage just one of the many casualties of war. Bessaiso said the museum had received  “the works of hundreds of artists” from Gaza that had been held in West Bank universities and cultural centres and by individuals.
The display presents  “the Gazan artistic scene in a new way” which helps  “to face the challenges and difficulties which artists and culture are confronting in Gaza amid the destruction and siege”, he said.
In a January report, the Palestinian culture ministry said 24 cultural centres in Gaza had been destroyed  “in whole or in part” since the start of the war.
They include the Arab Orthodox Cultural and Social Centre, the Rashad Shawa Cultural Centre — which includes a theatre, library and printing presses — and the Al-Sun­unu for Culture and Arts Association in Gaza City.
Historical buildings such as mosques, churches, the old Phoenician port and the Al-Qarara Cultural Museum have also been destroyed.
‘Whole lives stolen’
“It’s a beautiful thing to see the work of artists from Gaza here in the West Bank, especially because Gaza no longer has a place to show them after all the destruction there,” said Alma Abdulghani, a visitor in her 30s.Bessaiso said the museum display is  “a journey through Gazan Palestinian art, especially following the killing of dozens of artists, writers, poets and journalists”.
“This journey affirms the oneness of the Palestinian people, which the (Israeli) occupation is trying to destroy.” The names of 115 artists are on display at the main entrance, with black marks around the names of those killed in the war, among them visual artist Heba Zagout and painter Mohammed Sami Qariqa.
“Those who have had their homes, dreams, memories, loved ones and their whole lives stolen by the genocidal war,” read the words inscribed above their names.
The museum administration described the display, which opened in mid-February, as  “an alternative space to the one that once existed in Gaza before the war’s fires destroyed it”.
