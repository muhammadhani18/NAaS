0,"‘Controversial’ polls, ‘weak’ coalition govt to pose economic challenges: Moody’s","Maintains Caa3 rating with high risks of liquidity, external vulnerability.","ISLAMABAD: Moody’s Investors Service on Tuesday kept Pakistan’s ratings unchanged at ‘Caa3’ with a stable outlook but highlighted that significantly high risks of liquidity and external vulnerability challenges following highly controversial elections, severely constrained decision-making capacity of the coalition government-in-waiting.
The international rating agency — one of the top three global rating firms — said it had completed last week review of Pakistan rating assessments but neither it was announcing a credit rating action, nor an indication of whether or not a credit rating action is likely in the near future.
“Pakistan’s ratings, including its Caa3 long-term issuer rating, with stable outlook remain unchanged,” it said. The agency had downgraded the country’s rating to Caa3 from Caa1 in February last year, owing to challenges with the IMF programme and the resultant depletion of foreign exchange reserves.
“Political risks are high, following a highly controversial general elections held on Feb 8, 2024,” observed the agency, adding that a coalition government looked set to be formed primarily by PML-N and PPP, but there was high uncertainty around the newly elected government’s willingness and ability to quickly negotiate a new IMF programme soon after the current one expires in April.
“The forthcoming coalition government’s electoral mandate may not be sufficiently strong to pursue difficult reforms that will likely be required by a successor programme. Until a new programme is agreed to, Pakistan’s ability to secure loans from other bilateral and multilateral partners will be severely constrained.”

Maintains Caa3 rating with high risks of liquidity, external vulnerability

It said the country’s credit profile reflected the government’s “very high liquidity and external vulnerability risks” as the very low levels of foreign exchange reserves remain well below what is required to meet its very high external financing needs over the near to medium term. “The country’s very weak fiscal strength and elevated political risks also constrain its credit profile,” it said.
At the same time, Pakistan’s credit profile takes into account its large economy and moderate growth potential, which contribute to its moderate economic strength. It noted that the caretaker government had maintained economic stability and pushed through some reforms over the past few months, unlocking financing from the IMF and other multilateral and bilateral partners and resulting in a modest accumulation of foreign exchange reserves.
While Pakistan is likely to meet its external debt obligations for the fiscal year ending June 2024, there is “limited visibility” regarding the sovereign’s sources of financing to meet its “very high external financing needs” after the current IMF Stand-By Arrangement ends in April.
Pakistan’s “baa3” economic strength balances the country’s large economy and moderate GDP growth potential against its low per capita income. The score also incorporates Pakistan’s high exposure to extreme weather events, such as heatwaves and floods, which can create negative economic and social costs. Pakistan’s institutions and governance strength score is at “b3”, reflecting the country’s weak governance and low monetary and fiscal policy effectiveness. The “ca” fiscal strength reflects the country’s large debt burden and very weak debt affordability. The high debt-servicing requirements associated with the large stock of debt will reduce the fiscal flexibility to undertake key expenditures on infrastructure and social initiatives. Pakistan’s susceptibility to event risk is at “caa”, driven by very high government liquidity and external vulnerability risks.
The stable outlook reflects Moody’s assessment that the pressures that Pakistan faces are consistent with a Caa3 rating level, with broadly balanced risks. Continued IMF engagement, including beyond the current programme, would help support additional financing from other multilateral and bilateral partners, which could reduce default risk if this is achieved urgently and without further raising social pressures.

1,KGTL now ready to engage FPCCI on hike in charges,Will offer to constitute a high-level committee with FPCCI nominees to look into the grievances and complaints of traders,"KARACHI: The business community’s outburst over a three-fold increase in container terminal charges has compelled the Karachi Gateway Terminal Limited (KGTL) to offer to constitute a high-level committee with FPCCI nominees to look into the grievances and complaints of traders from the apex platform. 
“The Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry is the right place to engage with the trading community,” KGTL Chief Executive Officer Khurram Aziz Khan said while addressing the FPCCI members at the Federation House. 
Highlighting the KGTL’s expansion plans for infrastructure development of the container terminal, he said: “We are going to spend $75 million over the next two years alone and another $100m in five years to bring world-class, cutting-edge and efficient infrastructure, machinery and technologies to Karachi Port.” 
The KGTL has signed an agreement with the Karachi Port Trust (KPT), which comes under the maritime affairs ministry and, therefore, the KGTL works under the legal jurisdiction of Pakistan, Mr Khurram said. 
FPCCI Senior Vice President Saquib Fayyaz Magoon apprised CEO Khurram that the business community is in a state of shock and disbelief at the three-fold increase in container terminal charges since the KGTL has taken over the management of container terminal at Karachi Port’s East Wharf. 
The charges were raised to Rs480 from Rs150 per tonne. 
Mr Magoon urged the KGTL CEO to immediately rationalise the charges and said any future increase should be announced two to three months in advance. Additionally, the KGTL should not operate in a vacuum in a consultation-less manner, he insisted. 
He stressed that shipping lines and container terminals need to be brought under a strong and effective regulatory authority to put an end to exploitation of importers and exporters at their hands. 
FPCCI Vice President Asif Sakhi maintained that apex chamber is keeping all options and forums at its disposal to resolve traders’ issues and more than willing to facilitate talks between the KGTL and the business community.

2,Energy minister takes credit for ‘painful’ gas price hikes,The minister said the caretaker government had formulated a power tariff rationalisation plan to allow reduced rates for industry through lower cross-subsidy.,"ISLAMABAD: Outgoing caretaker Minister for Power and Petroleum Muhammad Ali on Tuesday identified recent “painful” gas pricing reforms among the best achievements despite difficulties to the consumers and conceded inability to negotiate debt relief from foreign independent power producers (IPPs) chiefly from China during over six-month stint.
Speaking to journalists before leaving the office, he said the biggest challenge to energy prices emanated from the exchange rate and unless Pakistan stabilised it, the pricing of both gas and electricity would remain unaffordable to consumers, particularly the industrial sector.
He conceded that the caretaker government could not provide relief to the consumers in terms of lower prices but its policy actions to tap gas supply from unconventional fields and improved cash flows of exploration and production companies and gas utilities would reduce import dependence and foreign exchange losses.
The minister said the caretaker government had formulated a power tariff rationalisation plan to allow reduced rates for industry through lower cross-subsidy. At present, the overall cross-subsidy stood at Rs473bn, which would come down to Rs273bn through this plan because unless the industry was able to operate, exports would not grow and foreign exchange inflows would remain stagnant and thus exchange rate would be under pressure. The power would be provided directly through the competitive trading model because the only thing for the electricity rates not to go further up was the currency rate to remain stable.
The minister conceded that one of the major issues relating to expensive electricity — renegotiations with Chinese IPPs for extension in debt tenor — could not be taken up by the caretaker government. He said total payables to Chinese power producers currently stood at Rs511bn. He said the painful gas pricing reforms in two phases had stopped the flow to the circular debt, although circular debt stock of about Rs2.3 trillion was a major challenge for the upcoming government to address. Besides Rs2.3tr gas sector debt, another Rs2.4tr debt stock also exists in the power sector.
Mr Ali said the interim government had been able to induct about 152 million cubic feet of additional gas per day (mmcfd) into the system that had been hampered for years by different issues while another 280mmcfd would also come in during the current calendar year.

3,Exports to Europe fall 8pc despite GSP+ status,Decline indicates challenges faced by Pakistani exporters despite having preferential access to 27-member EU countries.,"ISLAMABAD: Pakis­tan’s exports to European countries dipped year-on-year by 7.54 per cent in the first seven months of the current fiscal year, mainly due to reduced demand for Pakistani goods in western, southern and northern Europe.
The export proceeds from these countries fell to $4.866 billion in July-January FY24, a drop from the $5.263bn recorded in the corresponding months of the previous year, according to figures compiled by the State Bank of Pakistan.
This decline in export proceeds indicated the challenges faced by Pakistani exporters in these economically uncertain times despite having preferential access to 27-member EU countries.
In FY23, exports to the EU dropped 4.41pc to $8.188bn from $8.566bn in the preceding fiscal year. However, the decline in exports was seen despite the Generalised System of Preferences Plus (GSP+) scheme.
In October 2023, the European Parliament unanimously voted to extend the GSP+ status for another four years until 2027 for developing countries, including Pakistan, to enjoy duty-free or minimum duty on exports to the European market.
Western Europe, which includes countries such as Germany, the Nether­lands, France, Italy and Belgium, accounts for the largest portion of Pak­istan’s exports to the EU.
However, there has been a significant decrease of 13.85pc in exports to this region. The export value stood at $2.393bn in the first seven months of FY24, down from $2.778bn during the same period last year.
While exports to western, southern and northern Europe have seen a decline, there is a silver lining in the form of an uptick in exports to eastern Europe. Exports to southern Europe saw a paltry decline of 0.22pc to $1.743bn in 7MFY24 from $1.747bn over the corresponding period of last year.
In this region, exports to Spain saw a growth of 5.67pc to $856.423 m in 7MFY24 from $810.461m over the last year. Exports to Italy stood at $649.433m in 7MFY24 against $661.932m over the last year, indicating a decline of 1.88pc.
However, exports to northern Europe have not done well, recording a 7.59pc decline. The export value to this region stood at $0.365bn this year, down from $0.395bn over the corresponding months of the previous year.

4,KCCI rejects over Rs7.05 hike in power tariff,Says Nepra's decision would affect budgeting of most households and raise costs for all types of manufacturing units.,"KARACHI: Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) President Iftikhar Ahm­ed Sheikh has rejected the Rs7.0562 per unit increase in power tariff under the fuel cost adjustment (FCA) for January, saying it would intensify hardships for the common man and industries.
Slamming the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), he said it was highly unfair to allow this massive and unprecedented increase in FCA for all categories with an excuse of variation in fuel charges.
In a statement, he said the Nepra’s decision would not only affect the budgeting of almost all the households but also terribly raise the costs for March for all types of manufacturing units across the country.
The business community, he added, had already been battling hard for survival due to the high cost of doing business, making Pakis­tani goods uncompetitive in the international market and unaffordable for the common man.
While urging the government to take notice of all the wrongdoings at Nepra, he said the regulator has been fearlessly and mercilessly giving the go-ahead to raise tariffs regardless of thinking of the repercussions on the economy, trade, industry and the lives of poor masses who were finding it impossible to pay their electricity bills.

5,Bank profits surge 83pc in 2023,Banking is the only attractive sector which earned profits despite a negative growth rate in FY23.,"KARACHI: Commer­cial banks posted an impressive 83 per cent earnings growth during 2023, with almost all banks recording their historic profits during the year, according to a research report on Tuesday.
Unprecedented interest rates yielded higher profits for banks but overburdened the economy with costly borrowing by the government.
“In CY23, the banking sector in the listed space witnessed significant profits (83pc) driven mainly by policy rate hikes of 600bps coupled with volumetric growth in deposits (24pc), supported by 21pc lower provisioning and 16pc higher non-interest income during the year,” said the report of Arif Habib Research.
Banking is the only attractive sector which earned profits despite a negative growth rate in FY23. The new fiscal year FY24 did not show much improvement as the estimated 2pc growth rate is still doubtful. However, the banks’ profits would continue to rise since the government is unable to function without borrowing from banks despite record revenue generation.
Relentless borrowing of the government from the banking sector helped the banks witness unexpected growth. The current financial year will also help the banks book more profits than CY23. The government already borrowed Rs4.2 trillion from banks during the first half (July-December) of FY24.
Most analysts were hoping for a decline in the interest rate in February, but the State Bank of Pakistan kept it unchanged at 22pc.
Bankers and analysts believe that the next monetary policy in March could see a change provided the IMF assures Pakistan of the next tranche of $1.2bn under the Stand-By Arrange­ment.
However, the bullish inflation has kept the State Bank from changing the interest rate.

6,Stocks falter as instability fears return,"The lack of clarity about IMF conditions for a new bailout package also contributed to the market's bearish close, one analyst says.","KARACHI: The rejection of the summary for convening a National Assem­bly session by Presi­dent Arif Alvi ended the overnight political optimism for the smooth formation of the PML-N-PPP coalition government in the Centre, as a result the benchmark KSE 100-share index closed the topsy-turvy session in the red on Tuesday.
Ahsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said stocks remained under pressure amid growing uncertainty over the political outcome of the president’s refusal, which triggered profit-taking by a section of investors.
He said lack of clarity about IMF conditions for a new bailout package, concerns over high inflation and hike in gas prices for industries also contributed to the market’s bearish close.

The decline in the index was influenced by Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd, Service Industries Ltd, United Bank Ltd, Pakistan Petroleum Ltd, and PSO, contributing 207 points to the index performance. Conversely, TRG Pakis­tan, Mari Petroleum Ltd and Kot Addu Power added 113 points cumulatively.
As a result, the KSE-100 index closed at 63,219.10 points after losing 86.84 points or 0.14 per cent from the preceding session.
The overall trading volume dipped by 9.47pc to 409.96 million shares. The traded value also fell by 11.01pc to Rs14.67bn on a day-on-day basis.

7,Repatriation of profits rises,Informed sources in the financial sector said the IMF has objected to restrictions and asked the government to allow 100pc profit outflows.,"KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has eased up the repatriation of profits and dividends on foreign investments, as a result the outflow in January rose to $127 million.
For over a year, the SBP has been under serious criticism in and outside the country for imposing restrictions on the outward remittance of profits on foreign investment, which fell sharply during FY23.
The SBP data on Tuesday showed that the repatriation of profits and dividends swelled to $694.3 million during the first seven months (July-January) of FY24 compared to just $220.5 in the same period last year.
Informed sources in the financial sector said the IMF has objected to restrictions and asked the government to allow 100pc profit outflows. 
They believe the improvement in profit outflows is a sign of the acceptability of the IMF’s condition. 
In the next few months, the government would have to approach the IMF for the release of the last tranche of $1.2bn under the current Stand-By Arrangement and start negotiations for a new bailout package.
The higher outflows were from manufacturing with $185.8m and $196.8m for wholesale and retail during the July-January period. The financial and insurance noted an outflow of $84.4m, transport $78.1m and electricity $92m.
