0,$2bn rollover by China shields forex reserves,"SBP holdings fall below $8bn, sparking concerns amid dried-up inflows and lagging remittances.","KARACHI: Extending a yet another major relief to cash-strapped Islamabad, the Chinese government has rolled over its $2 billion loan, which was due in March, for one year.
The finance ministry on Thursday confirmed that China has accepted Pakistan’s request for the rollover, considering the country’s current inability to repay the loan.
Most of the foreign exchange reserves of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) consist of loans from friendly countries. The central bank, which used to provide dollars for debt servicing, is now practically unable to repay foreign loans.
The caretaker government, which managed to develop relations with the IMF under tough conditions and received $1.8bn under the Stand-By Arrangement, failed to improve foreign exchange reserves or devise a strategy for their increase.

SBP holdings fall below $8bn, sparking concerns amid dried-up inflows and lagging remittances

In mid-June 2023, China provided a $1bn loan to Pakistan. In fact, Pakistan repaid the amount, and China returned it upon the country’s request.
The rolled over of $2bn will help Pakistan maintain a reasonable figure for foreign exchange reserves. However, the latest report from the SBP on Thursday showed that the reserves of the fell below $8bn. This must be a serious concern for the government, as inflows have dried up, remittances are still behind last year’s figures, exports of the core textile sector are falling, and talks with the IMF for new loans have yet to initiate.
Media reports suggest that the government plans to initiate talks with the IMF for $6bn in loans. The new political government will face this challenging task, as emphasised by the caretaker Finance Minister Dr Shamshad Akhtar, who reiterated several times that the country needs to remain in the IMF programme for economic sustainability.
According to the SBP, reserves decreased by $63 million to $7.949bn during the week ending on 23 Feb due to debt repayments. Financial market concerns arise as this trend could impact the exchange rate, which has been stable for over two months, providing positive signals for investors. Foreign investors have significantly increased investments in equities and treasury bills during this period.
Since Dec 2023, the SBP has maintained $8bn in foreign exchange reserves. Although reserves fluctuated during this period, they did not fall below $8bn. However, this week’s outflow brought the reserves below $8bn, while the IMF aims to see reserves at $9 billion by the end of June 2024.
Informed sources in the Ministry of Finance are confident that the country will receive the third tranche of $1.2bn by the end of March or April this year. This will increase the reserves of the SBP, but simultaneously, more foreign debt servicing will require dollars. During FY24, the country needs to pay about $25bn for debt servicing. The government is attempting to roll over bilateral debts, pay the minimum, and negotiate further delays for payments.
“The most daunting situation is that the country will need another $25bn or more in the next fiscal year, FY25,” said a senior analyst.

1,"Go for quick IMF bailout, advises outgoing finance minister","Unsustainable debt, unprecedented interest rates, weak revenue collection remain key challenges for new govt.","ISLAMABAD: With inflation at about 29 per cent, Caretaker Finance Minister Dr Shamshad Akhtar, in her departure note, is leaving behind a piece of advice to the incoming government to stay the course, be prudent and reach immediately an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a new medium-term programme to anchor difficult reforms.
Claiming a series of gains over the six-month tenure of the caretaker administration, the outgoing minister said these required to be sustained with the completion of the last IMF review by the new government. “Perhaps more important is that the new government reach an early agreement with the IMF staff on a new medium-term facility, providing an anchor to carry out the difficult reforms”, she wrote in a rare note as part of the Monthly Economic Update & Outlook for (February 2024) of the Ministry of Finance.
“To achieve this, the new government must take forward critical reforms on the FBR restructuring, privatisation of the loss-making SOEs including PIA, and the implementation of the SOE policy for improved governance and financial performance”, she added.
Dr Akhtar said the economic instability had faded as a result of measures adopted over the past six months, restored market confidence and picked up economic activity and the expectations from the new government were that “a vibrant strategy and vision would help revive the economy and build on the hard-earned gains”. Last few months measures have restored market confidence and led to a pick-up in economic activity.

Unsustainable debt, unprecedented interest rates, weak revenue collection remain key challenges for new govt

She emphasised that at the heart of the economic challenges facing Pakistan today was the unsustainable public debt position and the country had been in breach of the Fiscal Responsibility & Debt Limitation Act (FRDL) since 2013. The government’s ability to service the public debt liabilities is hampered by weak tax collection, rising losses of SOEs and the highest interest rates since 1972.
The minister said that GDP growth had accelerated to 2.1pc in the first quarter of FY24, after two consecutive quarters of negative growth. The growth was broadbased with the agriculture sector posting 5pc growth and manufacturing activity registering 2.5pc growth. In particular, the removal of the import ban and other import restrictions has eased supply constraints, leading to a pick-up in economic activity.
Giving a stock of steps over the past six months to tackle challenges, she said the unproductive expenditures had been reduced coupled with a boost to tax and non-tax income, thus running a primary surplus of Rs1.5 trillion (1.4pc of GDP) in the first half of the fiscal year against IMF target of 0.5pc of GDP. “Difficult and unpopular measures including a reduction in the subsidy bill on power and gas through timely implementation of quarterly tariffs helped improve primary account”, she said and added that no supplementary grants were issued and PSDP projects of provincial domain were transferred to provincial annual development plans (ADPs).
On the revenue side, the FBR Tax collection grew by 30pc in the first seven months as domestic taxes increased by 40pc on the back of a “rebound in economic activity and rise in profitability of companies including Banks, Oil & Gas, and the manufacturing industry”. The improvement in fiscal position helped reduce accumulation of public debt and net domestic borrowing dropped 67pc to Rs1.9tr, from Rs5.8tr in the preceding period.

2,Analysis: Who will be handed the keys to national kitty?,"Dr Shamshad Akhtar enjoys a good rapport with the IMF, but others close to the Sharif family – particularly Ishaq Dar – are also in the field.","WITH the process of government formation well and truly under way, the question on everyone’s lips now is: who will become custodian of the country’s kitty?
Speculations abound, yet it is clear that the PML-N — which is actively lobbying to have its own man in the coveted slot — wants to revive the political capital that was eroded by its 16-month stint at the helm of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) government.
Background interviews and discussions with key PML-N leaders, caretaker ministers and sources privy to the cabinet formation by the incoming government yield conflicting views, but there seems to be a consensus on one point: PML-N Supremo Nawaz Sharif will have the final say on who gets the job of finance minister.
The performance of the finance ministry under the caretaker technocrat, Dr Shamshad Akhtar, also has an impact on these discussions.

Dr Shamshad Akhtar enjoys a good rapport with the IMF, but others close to the Sharif family — particularly Ishaq Dar — are also in the field

Although she took a number of unpopular decisions — such as massive hikes in gas rates — and didn’t manage to tame inflation, Dr Akhtar did manage to implement the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) terms and stabilised currency rates.
This poses a dilemma for the incoming regime; should they continue these unpopular moves that may put the economy back on track and allow the country to negotiate a fresh deal with the IMF, or try to rebuild political capital and take populist measures.
According to one senior member of the caretaker cabinet, rebuilding IMF’s confidence is her biggest achievement, a relationship that would come in handy when the country enters a new deal with the Fund in the near future.
New choices
Another technocrat who is being named as a potential candidate is Salman Ahmed, who recently resigned as a senior partner from McKinsey & Co and is available for a position in the new structure, according to an official source. However, it is still unclear if he will be given a leadership role in the ministry or an ancillary one, such as chairman of the Board of Investment.
Former federal minister for revenue Haroon Akhtar Khan, a perennial Sharif ally, is another favourite for the economic team. Mr Akhtar also briefed Nawaz Sharif on economic reforms and their implementation upon the latter’s return from London.
Internally, the party has limited options following the departure of Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and Miftah Ismail. Mr Abbasi’s departure also leaves a gaping hole in the energy ministry, which is a tough nut to crack. Observers feel that the PML-N supremo is likely to hand it to a technocrat or close confidant.
Caretaker commerce minister Gohar Ejaz is also a popular pick for the commerce portfolio, thanks to a recovery in the country’s exports. Mr Gohar is thought to have deep ties in the power corridors, as well as a good relationship with president-in-waiting, Asif Ali Zardari.
After an Islamabad High Court verdict barred unelected persons from performing executive functions, i.e. leading a ministry, any technocrat will need to be elected as a senator or MNA to hold portfolio.
Dar-onomics
If the signs are to be believed, Ishaq Dar may well return as the country’s finance minister for yet another term, a PML-N leader told Dawn. However, he said that Mr Dar faces substantial resistance from within the party, and the PPP has already expressed its disapproval.
There is also an impression that, this time, Mr Dar is bereft of support from the establishment over his failure to keep the promises he made before returning to Pakistan from self-exile.
But being the wily and influential figure that he is, Mr Dar cannot be sidelined and may well refuse to accept any other position, such as foreign minister. There were also proposals to nominate him as the Senate chairman or deputy prime minister, but these are no longer being considered.
The main issue is his confrontational attitude with the IMF, which has led to a trust deficit between him and the lender in the past. While Dr Akhtar enjoys a better rapport, many believe Nawaz Sharif will not consider her for the job of finance minister due to Mr Dar’s opposition. A similar fate may befall Gohar Ejaz as well.
Other PML-N leaders disagree with Mr Dar’s practice of appointing of loyal individuals as special assistants in the finance division. Instead, they suggest that people be brought in from the private sector, and bureaucrats like Ahad Cheema and Fawad Hassan Fawad are also expected to get positions in the new government’s economic team.
The final variable in the search for a leader at the finance ministry is Nawaz Sharif’s own ‘micromanaging’ of the portfolio. He has reportedly received several briefings from economists, technocrats and senior party leaders, sources said, while FBR officials also gave him a detailed briefing last week.
In a recent address, he expressed the realisation that the economy would be the biggest challenge facing the incoming government, which is why many believe he may act as a “shadow finance minister” and implement reforms similar to those carried out in the 1990s.
In such a situation, Nawaz will want Dar, a close confidant, at the helm of his younger brother’s cabinet, according to a party source. Mr Dar also becomes indispensable because he would be expected to help out Maryam Nawaz Sharif’s fledgling regime in Punjab.

3,Revenue collection falls short by Rs33bn in Feb,The lower-than-targeted collection in February comes after a Rs9bn shortfall in January.,"ISLAMABAD: Tax collection by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) fell short of the target by almost Rs33 billion in February, mainly due to lower collection of domestic taxes and customs duty, provisional figures showed on Thursday.
The revenue collection in February stood at Rs681bn against a projected target of Rs714bn. However, it increased by over 30 per cent compared to Rs519bn collected in the same month last year.
These figures would further improve slightly after book adjustments have been taken into account.
The lower-than-targeted collection in February comes after a Rs9bn shortfall in January. The failures in the two consecutive months will cause problems for the FBR’s overall annual revenue collection target for the current fiscal year.
During the first eight months (July-February) of 2023-24, the FBR collected Rs5.831 trillion, exceeding the Rs5.829tr target by Rs2bn. As a result, the shortfall witnessed in February and January was covered owing to higher collection in December.
The government has projected a revenue collection target of Rs9.415tr for this fiscal year, almost 30pc higher than the previous year’s revised collection figures of Rs7.2tr.
During this time, tax refunds increased by more than 28pc.
An official report of the FBR said the increase in import taxes had slowed due to a variety of reasons, including downward revisions in import duties over time and, more recently, restrictions on import licences imposed by the State Bank of Pakistan to contain the balance of payments position in the aftermath of foreign exchange shortages.
The revenue collection from import dues, however, takes into account the impact of improvements in import value, which resulted in Rs151bn in collections, as well as the anti-smuggling drive, which increased by about 69pc this fiscal year compared to last year.
There is potential to improve anti-smuggling efforts by boosting the customs force in Balochistan, which currently has just 378 anti-smuggling workers, which undermines enforcement efforts.
The revenue generation from domestic taxes is a good change. Domestic tax collection now accounts for over 64pc of all revenues collected in the current fiscal year, owing mostly to inflation rates of roughly 30pc. Concurrently, the share of import tariffs has fallen to 36pc from more than 50pc just three years earlier.
The primary driver of impressive growth in income tax collection is because of high collections from banks, petroleum products, textiles, power, food goods, and services.

4,SRO removal hampering  jewellery exports,There was neither prior notification nor any explanation provided for the removal of the relevant SRO from the system.,"KARACHI: Traders claimed on Thursday that gold jewellery exports came to a standstill since last week due to the abrupt removal of SRO760 from the WeBOC system of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).
Pakistan Gems Jewel­le­ry Traders and Expor­ters Association (PGJTEA) Chair­man Habib-ur-Rah­man in a letter informed the FBR that the SRO facilitates various exemptions including sales tax but its removal from the WeBOC system has led to the incorrect display of sales tax as payable.
There was neither prior notification nor any explanation provided for the removal of the relevant SRO from the system. As a result, all exports of gold jewellery have been halted, causing distress among the exporters, he claimed.
