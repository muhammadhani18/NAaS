0,GB seeks water user charges  and hydel profit from Centre,"Committee reviews progress on Diamer Bhasha, Mohmand dams land disputes.","GILGIT: The Gilgit-Baltistan government has decided to demand its share of water user charges and net hydel profit of the Diamer Bhasha dam from the federal government.
While chairing a high-level meeting on Thursday in Islamabad, GB Chief Minister Haji Gulber Khan constituted a committee to prepare recommendations which will be submitted to the federal government.
It has been decided in light of these recommendations that the government of Gilgit-Baltistan will submit its recommendations regarding the determination of net hydel profit and water user charges of Diamer Bhasha dam share between GB and the federal government.
The meeting was attended by GB Law Minister Sohail Abbas, Interior Minister Shams Lone, Agriculture Minister Engineer Anwar, GB Investment Board Chairman and Assembly Member Fathullah Khan and Special Assistant to Chief Minister Maulana Sarwar Shah.

Committee reviews progress on Diamer Bhasha, Mohmand dams land disputes

The special committee comprises GB’s ministers for power, law, agriculture and power secretary.
It will visit Azad Kashmir and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa within 10 days to study their sharing formula with the federation and prepare recommendations.
Speaking on the occasion, CM Khan said the Diamer Bhasha Dam project will result in development and prosperity and that the people of GB, especially Diamer, have made great sacrifices for its construction.
He added that a committee was formed at the federal level in 2017 to resolve the boundary dispute between the Kohistan area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Diamer and to determine the net hydel profit share.
However, the committee only focused on the boundary dispute, the CM added
The GB government wants the share of net hydel profit to be decided so that the project is not affected due to the reservations of locals, said CM Khan.
The net hydel profit is paid by the centre to provinces where dams and reservoirs are located, as per Article 161(2) of the Constitution, which states, “The net profits earned by the federal government, or any undertaking established or administered by the federal government from the bulk generation of power at a hydro-electric station shall be paid to the province in which the hydro-electric station is situated.”
Committee reviews projects
Separately, the Implementa­tion Committee on Diamer Bhasha and Mohmand Dams (ICDBMD), constituted by the Supreme Court, met on Thursday to review the status of land acquisition and resettlement of displaced people.
The meeting was convened at the request of the ICDBMD sub-committee on land acquisition and resettlement.
Wapda Chairman retired Lt Gen Sajjad Ghani chaired the meeting, which was also attended by the GB chief secretary, senior member Board of Revenue Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Finance Division joint secretary, KP additional chief secretary (Development), Hazara Division commissioner, Diamer deputy commissioner and other officials.
The Wapda chairman acknowledged the progress made by the sub-committee and expressed hope that the GB government will soon finalise a strategy to proceed on the issue.
The Diamer-Astore Division commissioner briefed the meeting about the status of household and missing chulha (household) cases as well as terms of reference for the grievances and redressal committee formed to solve the issue.
Later, Wapda member finance, Diamer Bhasha Dam CEO, Mohmand Dam GM, Mohmand deputy commissioner and Wapda and director legal updated the participants about the compliance of decisions made by ICDBMD in its meeting held in December 2023.
The committee was formed by former Supreme Court chief justice Saqib Nisar while hearing a case on the construction of Diamer Bhasha and Mohmand dams.
Wapda is constructing Diamer Bhasha Dam on the Indus River to store 8.1 million acre-feet (MAF) of water and generate 4,500 MW of hydel electricity. It is scheduled for completion in 2028.
Mohmand Dam is being built on Swat River to store 1.2 MAF of water and generate 800 MW of electricity. It is scheduled to be completed in 2026.

1,PPP wants ECP to hold early election to 11 Senate seats,Senator Taj Haider said the upper house of the bicameral parliament is incomplete because its 11 seats are lying vacant.,"LAHORE: The Pakis­tan Peoples Party has demanded that the Election Commission of Pakistan hold early elections to the 11 Senate seats presently lying vacant.
In a letter written to the chief election commissioner on Thursday, PPP Central Election Cell in-charge Senator Taj Haider asked the former to hold elections to the 11 vacant seats of the Senate as soon as possible.
Senator Haider said the upper house of the bicameral parliament is incomplete because its 11 seats, or about 10 per cent of the total strength, are lying vacant. 
He said Section 127 of the Elections Act deals with by-elections to vacant seats in the Senate, while Section 107 prescribes the procedure for all elections to the Senate under which not more than one day is given to complete each stage of the schedule.
“It is requested that elections be held for the vacant seats in the Senate as soon as possible,” he said, giving names of the senators who have vacated the seats.
These senators are Yousuf Raza Gilani, Jam Mehtab, Nisar Khuhro, Ghafoor Haideri, Sarfraz Bugti, Nuzhat Sadiq, Sadiq Sanjrani, Prince Omar, late Rana Maqbool, Shaukat Tareen, and caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar.

2,US lawmakers urge Biden not to recognise new Pakistan govt,Call for a transparent and credible investigation before recognising a new Pakistani government.,"WASHINGTON: US lawmakers are urging President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken to refrain from recognising a new government in Pakistan until allegations of election rigging are thoroughly investigated.
The lawmakers, all Democrats like President Biden, in their joint letter, expressed concerns about pre- and post-poll rigging in Pakistan’s recent parliamentary elections. They have called for a transparent and credible investigation before recognising a new Pakistani government, citing evidence of violations and disruptions on election day.
 






All 33 signatories are pivotal progressive Democrats essential for  securing President Biden’s second term. In the recent Michigan primary,  he faced a formidable “uncommitted” campaign led by activists  dissatisfied with his Gaza war stance, surpassing Trump’s 2016 margin by  over 10,000 votes. This development is causing considerable concern for  the Biden camp, especially as influential Muslim lawmakers in Michigan have also endorsed the pro-PTI letter.
Muslim members with influence in Michigan, and who signed the letter, are Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, and Andre Carson.
Pramila  Jayapal, the chai­r­person of the Prog­r­e­ssive Caucus and who often  advocates for the Kashmir cause, has endorsed the letter. Additionally,  Chair Em­­eritus Barbara Lee and Whip Greg Casar have also added their signatures. Ilhan Omar, serving as the deputy chair of the Caucus, is  among the signatories as well.
In addition to urging caution in recognition, the lawmakers called for State Department officials to gather information about detained political activists and media personnel in Pakistan and advocate for their release.
They emphasised the significance of conveying to Pakistani authorities that US law mandates accountability for acts violating human rights, undermining democracy, or fostering corruption.
The lawmakers brought attention to concerns about post-poll rigging, citing delays in reporting results, video evidence of abuses, and discrepancies in vote totals. They referenced re­­ports by nonpartisan obser­vers, which highlighted the necessity of a transparent and credible audit process before acknowledging a new Pakistani government.
The dispute centers arou­­nd discrepancies between polling centre results issu­­ed to candidates and the final constituency-wide tally. The lawmakers noted that respected election monitors, human rights organisations, and Dawn, the nation’s newspaper of record, echoed these findings.
The lawmakers argued that safeguarding democracy in Pakistan and ensuring that election results genuinely reflect the interests of the people, rather than the elite and military, aligns with US interests.
They stressed the importance of a comprehensive in­­­vestigation and adheren­ce to democratic principles.

3,"IHC to proceed with Imran’s pleas, even if prosecutor not appointed",March 5 fixed for hearing of appeal in cipher case; Qureshi seeks suspension of sentence.,"• March 5 fixed for hearing of appeal in cipher case; Qureshi seeks suspension of sentence
• PTI says CJP cannot be ‘fair’ in Imran-related cases
ISLAMABAD: Perturbed by the prosecution agencies’ response to ex-prime minister Imran Khan’s appeals against his conviction in cipher and Toshakhana cases, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Thursday directed the federal government to appoint prosecutors before the next date of hearing.
The IHC division bench comprising Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb resumed hearing on the appeals against the conviction of Mr Khan and ex-foreign minister Shah Mah­mood Qureshi in the cipher case.
Barrister Salman Safdar, counsel for the former premier, informed the court that Mr Qureshi had filed an application seeking suspension of his sentence.
The directive to the government came when Deputy Attorney General Azmat Tarar apprised the court that the appointment of two special prosecutors of Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) had not been finalised as the process was still ongoing.
Justice Aurangzeb expressed displeasure and remarked that the court wouldn’t be bothered if the prosecutors were not appointed by March 5, the next date of hearing.
Justice Aurangzeb told Mr Tarar, “You are representing the state. You should take notes and share with the prosecution as the court continues the hearing.”
Barrister Safdar invited the court’s attention to Mr Khan’s ‘speedy’ trial, saying that prosecution had produced 25 witnesses before the judge in one single day while trial court recorded their testimonies till midnight.
He pointed out that the judge moved the court to a “secret” location where the “prosecution and the judge played a match together”.
CJ Farooq remarked that since the hearing on the appeals had already been fixed, the counsel may advance his arguments at length on the same date and the court would examine the matter accordingly.
While dictating the order of the day, Justice Farooq said: “The conduct of state/respondent is not prompt and is not appreciated.”
The court directed the state to complete the process for the appointment of prosecutor before the next date of hearing.
The bench then took up the appeals of Mr Khan and his spouse, Bushra Bibi, against their conviction in the Toshakhana reference.
Barrister Syed Ali Zafar, counsel for the couple, argued that this matter was even graver as the judge had closed the right of cross-examination in this case.
NAB Deputy Prosecutor General Azhar Maqbool Shah informed the court that Special Prosecutor Amjad Sohail was not available owing to the death of his a relative.
He suggested the hearing may be adjourned till March 11.
Justice Farooq reminded him that it is the bench that schedules and regulates the hearing.
Barrister Safdar stated that Mr Khan, his spouse and Mr Qureshi had also filed petitions seeking suspension of their sentence and conviction.
Justice Aurangzeb remarked that IHC had already ruled in the matter related to suspension of conviction and the matter was pending before the Supreme Court.
“We have already fixed the appeals for a short date, if you want us to take up the petitions seeking suspension of conviction, then we would adjourn the hearing sine die,” remarked the judge.
Barrister Zafar, however, reques­ted the court to hear the appeals.
Subsequently, the case was adjourned to March 5.
Iddat case
District and Sessions Judge Shah­rukh Arjumand took up Mr Khan and Bushra Bibi’s appeals against their conviction in the Iddat case.
The judge issued notices to complainant Khawar Farid Maneka and adjourned the hearing to March 11.
Salman Akram Raja, counsel for the PTI’s founder, argued that Mr Khan married Bushra Bibi 70 days after the latter got divorce from Mr Maneka. He said that filing of complaint by Mr Maneka after a gap of six years was an afterthought.
He further said that the trial court had overlooked legal provisions and religious principles while convicting them in this case.
Complaint against CJP
Talking to media persons outside Adiala Jail, PTI leader Shoaib Shaheen recalled that a five-member bench of the Supreme Court had in 2021 pointed out that Justice Qazi Faez Isa was prejudiced against the former premier and, therefore, held that he should not hear the cases involving Mr Khan.
Mr Shaheen said the PTI’s leadership was of the opinion that Justice Isa could not be fair now and should recuse himself from matters related to Mr Khan.

4,Toor goes on hunger strike in FIA custody: lawyer,Imaan Mazari says family worried about vlogger’s poor health.,"ISLAMABAD: Social media analyst and vlogger Asad Toor, who is in the Federal Investigation Agency’s (FIA) custody, has gone on a hunger strike, and his health condition is deteriorating, his counsel warned on Thursday.
In a post on social media platform X, Advocate Imaan Zainab Mazari said: “Asad’s mother, his lawyers and his friends are extremely worried about his deteriorating health on hunger strike.
 






“When we asked Asad the reason for his hunger strike, he said, I am voice of the voiceless so now they are muzzling my voice. I protest this action.”
Earlier, a local court of Islamabad remanded the vlogger in FIA’s custody for five days in connection with a case related to an alleged online campaign against the judiciary and state institutions.
According to the FIR, Mr Toor has been booked under Sections 9, 10 and 24 of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca).

Imaan Mazari says family worried about vlogger’s poor health

The sections deal with the offences of glorification of an offence, cyber terrorism and cyberstalking.
According to the FIR, Mr Toor “built a false narrative” and publically launched a “malicious/obnoxious and explicit campaign” against “civil servants/government officials and state institutions”.
Meanwhile, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) expressed concern over the vlogger’s arrest and demanded his immediate release.
The National Commission for Human Rights (NCHR) also expressed concern over the arrest in a post on X.
“NCHR is deeply concerned by the arrest of journalist Asad Toor. The PECA law is a problematic law that needs thorough review. Freedom of speech and information is a fundamental right which must be upheld at all costs,” said the post.
 






Earlier this week, Mr Toor was arrested by the FIA when he arrived at the agency’s Cyber Crime Reporting Centre in Islamabad to answer a summons notice issued to him, according to his counsel.
In January, the car­e­taker government had formed a five-member joint investigation team to probe a social media campaign against the judiciary in the aftermath of the Supreme Court’s decision to deprive PTI of its iconic ‘bat’ symbol.
