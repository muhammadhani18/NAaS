IT SEEMS that majority of our intellectuals, writers and poets are somewhat unhappy with the abundance of Urdu conferences and literary festivals that we have been experiencing for quite some time now. From time to time, objections are raised on literary conferences and while intellectuals generally appreciate holding of literary gatherings on larger scales, they complain of some irritants, too.
Dr Syed Aamir Sohail is the most recent dissenting voice and he says holding of lit fests has become so fashionable that government, semi-government and private organisations are busy glamorising these events and — in some cases — as he puts it, are cashing in on them. While he admits there are some positive aspects of literary or cultural conferences and symposia, Sohail says that genuine writers and intellectuals are being ignored and literary elite has monopolised such festivals. Aamir Sohail, a senior writer, editor and academic, is wary of these literary ‘melas’, or festivals, because intellectuals from remote and rural areas of the country are almost totally ignored as ‘face value’ created through screens, PR, lobbying and literary grouping has become more important in such gatherings rather than creativity or scholarship, so he says.
Some other writers, too, such as Mubeen Mirza, have been showing their concern as organisers now prefer familiar and famous faces and invite anchor persons, singers, musicians, dancers, actors and political activists as speakers to literary gatherings to appeal the masses, albeit many of them may not have any literary standing.
To second Aamir Sohail’s views, one can cite some literary festivals where everything under the sun except for literature was discussed since the foreign entities had funded those fests and their representatives were also prominent among the audience during different sessions, perhaps to supervise if the things were going according to their agenda or not. In such exclusive fests, usually organised at a place where common people won’t be able to reach, some specific academics from some specific universities are invited with their students participating in every event.
Aamir Sohail has expressed his views in an editorial of his literary magazine Angaare that he has been editing and publishing form Multan since long. The latest issue, published in February 2024 is the 110th, quite an amazing feat considering that market for printed word is slackening by the day.
One may add here that the trend simply reflects the preferences that our society now has: TV personalities, actors, singers and cricketers command more respect and have more following than critics, scholars, creative writers and poets! So it is simply marketing gimmick to invite famous albeit irrelevant personalities to lit fests.



 
The latest issue of Angaare includes some quite interesting pieces, such as pen sketches and a travelogue, but it also proffers some serious matter, such as an article on hermeneutics. Indeed it is one of the very few articles written on the topic in Urdu and tries to explain what hermeneutics is and how it helps understand some critical theories.
Another new arrival is Makhzan, a literary magazine published by Lahore’s Quaid-i-Azam Library and edited by Dr Tehseen Firaqi. Since the original Makhzan was launched by Sir Abdul Qadir from Lahore in 1901, this relaunched Makhzan has an epithet ‘Daur-i-Jadeed’, or New Era. The July-December 2023 issue, the 44th, has just been published and offers some good reads.
An article in the issue by Dr Rafaqat Ali Shahid introduces Jamil Jalibi Library that has been set up at Karachi University. Sharing his observations that he recorded during his visit to the library recently, Dr Shahid has some pieces of advice for the management of the library. A senior researcher and academic, Shahid was disappointed with certain practices and publications of this otherwise wonderful library.
Another article, written by Ziauddin Islahi, introduces a manuscript on Taj Mahal, the famous historical building at Agra, tomb of Mumtaz Mahal, the beloved wife of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan. The manuscript describes some historical events, historical buildings and details of Taj Mahal’s architects and artisans, its cost and stones used. But the author’s name is not known and Syed Sulaiman Nadvi had expressed his doubts about the authenticity of the manuscript and the information recorded. The issue also includes a rare article written by Sa’adat Hasan Manto.
Commenting on the situation in Gaza, Dr Firaqi in his editorial has rightly pointed out that in the past the writers and intellectuals used to present and adopt resolutions on war crimes committed by Israel against the Palestinians, but after the recent round of callous response from the world on Gaza killings literati is not bothered with even such resolutions. Social media, says Firaqi, have created an atmosphere where apathy has got the better of us and it seems we couldn’t care less.

1,PTI continues to ‘repent’ alliance with seatless SIC,"Walid says any other party would’ve been ‘wiser"" choice; Hamid says recriminations ""will hurt Imran more than anyone"".","KARACHI: The coalition of convenience between PTI and the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) remains strained due to conflicting statements from leaders of both parties.
While more PTI leaders, in retrospect, are calling the alliance a mistake, the SIC head has warned that such statements would damage Imran Khan’s party.
Now, PTI leader Walid Iqbal has also joined the likes of Sher Afzal Marwat in criticising the decision to join the SIC in a bid to secure reserved seats.
Speaking to DawnNewsTV, Mr Iqbal said it would have been “wiser” to join a party that had submitted its list of candidates for reserved seats.
This would have reduced PTI’s legal and constitutional challenges, he added.
As the party ranks grapple with the confusion, PTI spokesperson Raoof Hasan said the miscommunication was caused by PTI leaders’ inability to meet Mr Khan in Adiala Jail.

Walid says any other party would’ve been ‘wiser’ choice; Hamid says recriminations ‘will hurt Imran more than anyone’

While speaking to Geo News on Sunday, he said there was “absolute clarity” in the PTI founder’s thinking regarding party policies.
“We have raised these complaints in front of the courts which have given orders [to allow PTI leaders to meet Imran], but the jail administration does not follow those orders,” he claimed.
“I am not the one to go for conspiracy theories,” he said, adding that restrictions for party leaders in meeting Mr Khan have created “a vacuum” which has been “exploited to spread confusion”.
Hamid warns against criticism
Meanwhile, SIC chief Sahibzada Hamid Raza has warned PTI leaders that their criticism of the alliance will make Imran Khan “suffer more than anyone”.
Speaking to DawnNewsTV, Mr Raza said censuring the PTI-SIC alliance in public would benefit the current government.
“Party discipline will also be compromised, and our attention will be diverted from Imran Khan’s cases,” he said.
Mr Raza added that PTI’s decision to join SIC was made by the former prime minister and conveyed to him via the party’s top leaders, including Gohar Khan, Omar Ayub Khan and Raoof Hasan.
“The purpose of joining SIC was to bring PTI candidates under one umbrella, so the plans of other parties to pressurise candidates would not be successful,” he said, adding that the target was achieved as their votes in most elections in the parliament remained secure.
Regarding Ali Zafar’s criticism of the decision, Mr Raza said it was possible that he was not present at the meeting with Mr Khan Imran when the decision was finalised, as “three different teams met Imran”.
When asked about PTI potentially wanting to get back its candidates, Raza said, “I have no issues.”
“Our settlement [with the PTI] was temporary,” the SIC chief further said.
‘PTI lost its identity’
Cashing in on the confusion within PTI, its adversaries have also chimed in, with Defence Minister Khawaja Asif saying that the party has “lost its identity”.
“Today, we don’t know if it’s PTI, Sunni Ittehad Council or the Majlis Wahadat-i-Muslimeen,” he said, while speaking to the media. “They are still trying to search for their party’s name.”
The PML-N leader pointed out that no one knew whose name the party was registered under and who is calling the shots.

2,"Plan afoot to improve security, healthcare in KP: Gandapur",DERA ISMAIL KHAN: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur on Sunday revealed a comprehensive...,"DERA ISMAIL KHAN: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur on Sunday revealed a comprehensive initiative which would be put into motion soon, aimed at restoring law and order in the province, with additional measures to ensure the safety of police and other law enforcement officials.
Talking to the media during his first visit to his home district, Dera Ismail Khan, following his election, Mr Gandapur also touched upon improvements in the healthcare sector, vowing that public hospitals would now match the services offered by private institutions.
Referring to his political opponents, the KP chief minister said he feared those “incompetent people” would take the country to a point of no return. He likened the ruling PML-N and their allies in the Centre and other provinces to a “cancer” for the country.
Mr Gandapur’s remarks come days after his ice-breaking meeting with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in which he assured the premier of working together “with a positive intention to resolve problems of the people”.
Mr Gandapur insisted that his teams were serving the people of Dera Ismail Khan even though he had to go underground for nearly two years.
“I have been elected from only one constituency. Where are the MNAs and MPAs of other constituencies of Dera Ismail Khan who were claiming to serve the people?” he wondered.
Commenting on the current wave of inflation, he said the provincial government would give Rs10,000 each to 850,000 deserving families of the province under the Ramazan package. The amount would be handed over to them on their doorstep respectfully, he mentioned.
He said shelter homes had been reopened by ensuring all facilities for the needy people. However, the government would also take steps for providing business opportunities to people rather than only giving them charity or stipend, he added.
He said women would be provided jobs at their homes and youth would be provided with skill training, for which consultation was also underway with other countries.
The provincial government would construct small dams, he said, adding that work on the Tank Zam dam would be started soon. Besides, work on the Lift Canal project in Dera Ismail Khan will also begin soon.
Mr Gandapur said that he had positive talks with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in which the premier assured extending support of federal government for resolving KP’s issues, including the payment of pending dues of the province.
He said the provincial government would also cooperate with the federal government in this regard, keeping in view the country’s economic situation.

3,"Maryam announces remission, release of prisoners",Also inaugurates a 20-bed hospital for the rehabilitation of drug addicts and a video call facility for the prisoners.,"LAHORE: Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif has announced three-month remission for those imprisoned in Punjab jails and release of 155 of them on payment of diyat (blood money) on their behalf by some philanthropists.

4,Drap directs pharma firm to recall ‘substandard’ syrup,"Company to challenge decision, claims product tested before dispatch.","ISLAMABAD: The Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap) has directed a pharmaceutical company to recall a syrup, which is given to children to treat fever, from the market and has advised the health professionals not to prescribe it.
The direction has been giving after getting a report from the federal government analyst Central Drugs Laboratory (CDL), Karachi, that the medicine — Barpon 100mg/5ml — has been found substandard.
However, representative of the manufacturing company, JASM Pharmaceutical (Pvt) Ltd, Risalpur, has announced the decision to challenge the Drap move, claiming that the syrup could not be declared substandard as company also got it tested before dispatching it to market.
The Drap document, seen by Dawn, said the batch (No. 202), having manufacturing date of July 2023 and expiry date of June 2025, has been found substandard. It stated that Barpon infusion contains ibup­rofen, a medicine used to treat mild to moderate pain and fever (high temperature).

Company to challenge decision, claims product tested before dispatch

The administration of substandard products may lead to complications, as well as an increased risk of failure of therapy. The age-profile of patients is important and young patients especially are at risk, according to the document.
“The manufacturer has been directed to immediately recall the defective batch of product from the market. All pharmacists and chemists working at distributions and pharmacies are hereby advised to immediately check their stocks and stop supplying this batch of product. The remaining stock should be quarantined and returned to the supplier/company,” it stated.
However, JASM’s Director Mohammad Khalid told Dawn that the company was ISO-9001 certified (for having quality management system) and it tests raw material and also finished products.
“We give medicines of our company to our own children. We will challenge Drap’s decision as we tested both the raw material and finished product from a lab,” Mr Khalid said.

5,"Voting trends indicate generational desire for change, says US diplomat","Elizabeth Horst highlights ""transformative shift"" evidenced by the 2024 elections in Pakistan."," 

MICHAEL Kugelman

UNITED NATIONS: Voting trends in the February 8 elections demonstrated that there is a strong desire for change among the Pakistani youth, according to a senior US diplomat.
The remarks by Elizabeth Horst, a senior US diplomat overseeing Pakistan affairs at the State Depart­ment, came during a seminar held on the sidelines of an ongoing UN debate on the nexus between gender equality and human development.
Organised by the Muslim American Leadership Alliance, the discussion held last week saw active participation from the Pakistani-American community, with a number of speakers and attendees raising questions about the prevailing political scenario in the country.
Exhibiting diplomatic finesse, the State Department official refrained from making overtly political statements, instead underscoring the existing engagement of the Pakistani diaspora in addressing social issues in their homeland, while urging further efforts to empower women.

Kugelman says Washington’s ‘perceived indifference’ towards democracy in Pakistan could harden negative attitudes among diaspora

She highlighted the transformative shift evidenced by the 2024 elections, saying: “A generational change has happened. I say generational change because the most recent election in Pakistan has demonstrated that there is a youth right now that’s hungry for change.”
She argued that this demographic would soon constitute a majority in Pakistan, and that would be an opportunity to see a different way of doing things. “So, encourage everyone who is engaged with Pakistan to leverage that as well,” she added.
 

ELIZABETH Horst

Ms Horst’s remarks encouraged a PTI supporter in the audience to ask: “How can we discuss equality when our right to choose our leadership is denied? We cast our votes for Imran [Khan], yet we’re being pressured to accept the same old corrupt leaders,” he asked.
“I am not going to touch any political part of this, but I think there should be no excuses for working towards gender equality. There’s just everybody in this room and everybody around the world who can simply try to lift up women and girls,” Ms Horst responded.
Her comments seem to endorse the suggestion that instead of clinging to election-related disputes, Pakistan should move ahead and fix other pressing issues as well, such as its ailing economy.
Another speaker, Dawood Ghaznavi, proposed enhancing the connection between the diaspora and Pakistan by enabling them to participate in elections.
“Pakistani expatriates represent one of the most politically engaged diasporas globally. Allowing them to vote will further incentivize their involvement in contributing to the development of their homeland,” he asserted.
Michael Kugelman, a leading expert in South Asian affairs associated with the Wilson Centre, provided his insights on the political situation in Pakistan during the post-seminar media session.
He emphasised that the recent election did not restore political stability, instead resulted in rise of polarisation in the country. He noted that a significant portion of the public questioned the legitimacy of the election results, as well as the new government.
Mr Kugelman also pointed out the popularity of the opposition, particularly Imran Khan and the PTI, despite what he called efforts by the state to marginalise them.
He pointed out that this would pose challenges for the new government, which aims to stabilise the economy amidst a tense political climate.
He suggested that reconciliation between the opposition and the ruling coalition could provide a way forward, but doubted this was feasible in the current scenario, with heightened polarisation.
He proposed focusing on economic stabilisation as the most practical option for restoring stability, advocating for measures to lower inflation and provide relief to the common man.
The Wilson Centre scholar also noted that the Biden administration had modest expectations for the election and emphasised the importance of a multi-party presence, despite a disconnect between public expectations in Pakistan and US government objectives.
Mr Kugelman acknowledged the significance of perceptions, expressing concern that the perceived indifference of the US government towards democracy in their country could harden negative attitudes among many Pakistanis.

8,Hundreds of trees burnt as fire breaks out in Barkhan forest,"Officials said that the fire, which started on Saturday, has spread to 200 square kilometers.","QUETTA: Hundreds of trees and precious herbs were burnt to ashes on Sunday after a fire broke out in the forest of Koh-i-Jandaran, in Barkhan district of Balochistan. 
Officials said on Sunday that the fire, which started on Saturday, has spread to 200 square kilometers. The local people, after receiving information about the outbreak of fire in the forest, rushed to the mountain and started efforts to control it. 
“The fire damaged flora, trees and affected wildlife in the mountain Jandaran,” an official of the forest department said, adding that authorities have moved the nearby population to safer places.
There were conflicting claims about the area of the forest affected by the fire. 
Barkhan Assistant Commissioner Ramzan Ishtiaq said that flames have spread to an area exceeding 100 acres, while District Forest Officer Zubair Kakar said it has spread to over 200 acres. 
Locals, district administration and Frontier Corps (FC) personnel were engaged in efforts to bring the fire under control.
A team of Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) also reached the area to help contain the fire. 
“Extinguishing the fire is a challenging task as it is on the mountain peak. People living in the area near the fire have been taken to safer places,” Mr Ishtiaq, assistant commissioner of Barkhan, said. 
He said that apart from trees, there are vast quantities of dry shrubs which helped in rapid spread of the fire. The cause of the fire is yet to be determined, he said. 
Officials, late in the evening, claimed that fire has been brought under control by the PDMA, FC personnel of and local people to a great extent. However, efforts were under way to extinguish it completely on the Jandaran mountain.
The fire initially broke out on the other side of the mountain in uninhabited areas but spread to a large area due to heavy winds. 
People of the area said efforts of the government to extinguish the fire started very late and that resulted in damage to a large area of the forest.
Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti took notice of the situation and directed the district administration, the PDMA and other relevant authorities to assist in relief efforts. 
PDMA Director General Jahanzeb Khan said that a team from PDMA has reached Barkhan with firefighting equipment and it has started helping local administration in fire extinguishing efforts.
The chief minister expressed satisfaction over timely joint efforts of officials of all departments and the district administration and directed them to establish a base at Barkhan district headquarters.
