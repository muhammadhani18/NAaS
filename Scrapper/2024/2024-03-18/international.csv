Saturday afternoon’s meeting was organised by the far-right Junge Tat group, known for its anti-immigration and anti-Islamic views. The group is also a proponent of the far right white nationalist Great Replacement conspiracy theory espoused by Sellner’s identitarian movement.
“To ensure public safety and prevent clashes with people from the opposing side, the speaker at the event was stopped and removed,” the regional police said in the statement, confirming Sellner was the speaker. The police added that they had also been able to  “prevent the arrival of political opponents” to avoid any possible confrontation.
Sellner, who advocates mass expulsions of people of foreign origin, had come to Tegerfelden to present his book on the subject. The meeting was scheduled to take place in a hall in the small village of Tegerfel­den, some forty kilometres northwest of Zurich near the German border.

1,Blinken arrives  in S. Korea to attend democracy summit,"The summit will bring together government officials, NGOs and civil society members.","SEOUL: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived on Sunday in South Korea on the first stop of a brief Asia tour also including the Philippines, as Washington moves to reinforce ties with two key regional allies.
Blinken landed on Sunday afternoon ahead of the third Summit for Democracy on Monday, an initiative of US President Joe Biden, which Seoul is hosting this week.
The summit, which runs from March 18-20 will bring together government officials, NGOs and civil society members. Seoul is one of Washington’s key regional allies, and the United States has stationed about 27,000 American soldiers in the South, to help protect it against the nuclear-armed North.
Seoul’s conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol has boosted ties with Washington and sought to bury the historical hatchet with former colonial power Japan to better guard against Pyongyang’s threats.
Blinken will meet South Korean Foreign Minister Cho tae-yul, the ministry said, for discussions that will cover how to boost the alliance, as Washington and Seoul explore how to improve their so-called  “extended deterrence” against North Korea.
The democracy summit has attracted some criticism due to its selective invitation list, which excludes countries that consider themselves democratic, such as Thailand and Turkiye.
After Seoul, Blinken heads to Manila, a trip that will reaffirm “our unwavering commitment to the Philippine ally”, according to State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller.
He will talk with local officials including President Ferdinand Marcos, with issues with China including over the South China Sea likely to top the agenda. The US is redoubling efforts to improve longstanding ties with regional allies such as Manila, in an effort to counterbalance China.

2,Volcano erupts again on Iceland peninsula,REYKJAVIK: Icelandic police declared a state of emergency as lava spewed from a new volcanic fissure on the ...,"REYKJAVIK: Icelandic police declared a state of emergency as lava spewed from a new volcanic fissure on the Reykjanes peninsula, the fourth eruption to hit the area since December.
A  “volcanic eruption has started between stora Skogfell and Hagafell on the Reykjanes Peninsula,” said a statement from the Icelandic Met Office (IMO).
Live video images showed glowing lava and billowing smoke. Iceland’s Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management announced it had sent a helicopter to narrow down the exact location of the new fissure. The authority also said the police had declared a state of emergency due to the eruption.
According to the IMO, it occurred close to the same location as a previous eruption on Feb 8. Lava appeared to flow south towards the dykes built to protect the fishing village Grindavik, it said.
Just after 2200 GMT,  “the southern lava front was just 200 metres from the barriers on the eastern side of Grindavik and moving at a rate of about one km per hour,” it added. “From initial assess­­ments of web camera imagery and aerial photographs from the helicopter flight, the eruption is thought to be the largest (in terms of magma discharge) of the three previous fissure eruptions from the Sundhnukur crater row,” IMO said, stressing the assessment was based on the first hour of  
“eruptive activity.” Minu­tes before the eruption, the agency had issued a statement saying that seismic activity indicated that there was an increased chance of an eruption.

3,Acclaimed primatologist Frans de Waal dies,"WASHINGTON: Primatologist Frans de Waal, whose study of chimpanzees and apes helped reveal the reconciliatory and...","WASHINGTON: Primatologist Frans de Waal, whose study of chimpanzees and apes helped reveal the reconciliatory and empathic nature of primates — including humans — has died at age 75, said the university where he worked for decades.
De Waal, who won multiple awards over his long career, wrote several popular books and in 2007 made Time magazine’s list of the world’s 100 most influential people, succumbed to stomach cancer on March 14, Emory University said in a statement and tribute on its website.
The Netherlands-born scientist spent decades studying chimpanzees and apes, and his biological research eventually helped debunk the theory that primates including humans were naturally  “nasty” and aggressive competitors.
“De Waal shattered long-held ideas about what it means to be an animal and a human,” Emory, based in Atlanta in the US state of Georgia, said in its statement.
“He demonstrated the roots of human nature in our closest living relatives through his studies of conflict resolution, reconciliation, cooperation, empathy, fairness, morality, social learning and culture in chimpanzees, bonobos and capuchin monkeys.” 
Lynne Nygaard, chair of Emory’s Department of Psychology, remembered de Waal as  “an extraordinarily deep thinker” who could offer  “insights that cut across disciplines.”  “It’s difficult to sum up the enormity of Frans de Waal’s impact, both globally and here at Emory,” she said in the statement.

4,Wave of drones target Russia on final day of voting,Several flock to Navalny’s grave to cast their vote’,"MOSCOW/BERLIN: Russia said it was targeted by a wave of Ukrainian drones on Sunday, as thousands headed to the polls for a final day of elections set to extend President Vladimir Putin’s rule.
Queues of people were also seen forming outside polling stations in Moscow and Saint Petersburg at noon, when Russia’s opposition called for people to collectively spoil their ballots or vote against Putin.
The three-day vote had already been marred by a surge in fatal Ukrainian bombardment, incursions into Russian territory by pro-Kyiv sabotage groups and vandalism at polling stations.
Ukrainian drones attacked at least eight Russian regions overnight and on Sunday morning, with some reaching as far as the Moscow region, the defence ministry said.
Three airports serving the capital briefly suspended operations following the barrage, while a drone attack in the south sparked a fire at an oil refinery.

Several flock to Navalny’s grave to cast their vote’

In the Russian-controlled part of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region, where voting is also taking place,  “kamikaze drones” set a polling station ablaze, according to Moscow-installed authorities. The defence ministry said it had  “intercepted and destroyed 35 unmanned aerial vehicles” across the country.
Visit to Navalny’s grave
Dozens   of Russians flocked to Alexei Navalny’s grave in Moscow to   symbolically cast their vote for the late opposition politician on the   last day of Russia’s presidential election, TV footage showed.
Navalny,   President Vladimir Putin’s fiercest domestic critic, died last month  in  an Arctic prison. His allies accuse Putin of having him murdered,   something the Kremlin denies. Navalny   was buried at the Borisovo cemetery in southern Moscow on March 1, two   weeks before the start of a presidential election.
On Sunday, video   footage posted on social media by the Novaya Gazeta Europe news outlet   and other media, showed dozens of Navalny supporters at his grave on   which they had placed various tributes.
“We choose you,” said one   tribute. Official voting slips which had been amended to include   Navalny’s name on the list of candidates with a tick next to it were   also visible. Supporters were shown placing flowers on Navalny’s  grave, which was already piled high with flowers.
Protest outside Russian embassies
Russians  formed long queues outside Moscow’s embassies in European capitals on  Sunday to cast their votes on the final day of elections. Several polling stations attracted anti-Putin rallies organised in memory of the late opposition leader Alexei Navalny.
Yulia  Navalnaya, his widow, received flowers from supporters and chatted with  fellow voters in the long line outside the Russian embassy in Berlin. Navalny supporters had called for people to go to polling stations in a  “Midday Against Putin” protest and spoil their ballots.
‘Pointless war’
In Tallinn,  Anastasia Korobova, a 44-year old Kazakh-born Russian activist, said:   “So many people don’t want war, don’t want their relatives to die in a  pointless war or to kill people.”
In Vilnius, where an estimated 500 people were gathered, some held up posters of Navalny saying  “Putin killed Navalny”. “We  understand that this is a symbolic rally, but we also know that many  dictatorships fell after similar events,” Ivan Zhdanov, who manages  Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, said.

5,Biden jokes about Trump’s mental fitness at Washington dinner,"48-year-old Utah governor jokes he will announce his candidacy for presidency in 2052,  ‘when I will still be younger","WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden took jabs on Saturday at former president Donald Trump with jokes about the mental fitness of his election opponent during a speech at the Gridiron Club dinner, a Washington tradition that began in the 1880s.
Biden’s appearance at the dinner, in which politicians and journalists trade humorous barbs in a white-tie formal affair, was the first time a president has attended in person since former president Donald Trump in 2018.
Biden, 81, recently clinched the Democratic Party’s nomination for this year’s presidential election and will face off against Trump, 77, in a rematch in November. Biden is trying to court voters, boost his low approval ratings and allay concerns that he is too old to run again.
“One candidate is too old and mentally unfit to be president. The other one is me,” Biden said on Saturday, in front of more than 650 guests who included the Taoiseach of Ireland Leo Varadkar, Amazon founder and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos, and TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, whose US business could be banned by Biden.

48-year-old Utah governor jokes he will announce his candidacy for presidency in 2052,  ‘when I will still be younger than Biden and Trump’

Trump’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Trump has also questioned Biden’s mental capacity to be president. Biden reinforced the importance of the press, which he said is not  “the enemy of the people,” in stark contrast to previous remarks by Trump about the news media.
He also spoke about the war in Ukraine with Prime Minister of Estonia Kaja Kallas, who attended Saturday’s dinner.  “We will not bow down, they (Ukrainians) will not bow down and I will not bow down,” Biden said.
After his speech, Biden descended to the floor and took selfies with reporters and called one guest’s mother. Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, representing the Democratic Party at the event, also spoke, as well as Utah Governor Spencer Cox, representing the Republican Party.
Cox, 48, joked that he was announcing his candidacy for the presidency  “in 2052, when I still will be younger than both President Biden and President Trump.”  Turning more serious, he said there is a hunger among Americans for something more positive in politics.
The club’s 65 members, all representatives from news organisations, performed satirical songs and skits. One song poked fun at Biden’s and Trump’s ages to the tune of  “When I’m Sixty-Four” by The Beatles.
At last year’s dinner, Mike Pence, who served as vice president under Trump, offered a forceful rebuke of his one-time boss, saying history would hold Trump accountable for his role in the Jan 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.
Unlike its sister event, the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner in April, the Gridiron dinner is not televised and tries to retain its yesteryear vibe with men in white tie and tails and women in long dresses.
No photos are allowed during the dinner and participants are asked not to post on social media until after it has concluded.

6,Spanish farmers stage fresh protests in Madrid,MADRID: Hundreds of farmers paraded through the Spanish capital on foot and by tractor on Sunday in the latest...,"MADRID: Hundreds of farmers paraded through the Spanish capital on foot and by tractor on Sunday in the latest protest over the crisis facing the agricultural sector.
The farmers marched from the Ministry of Ecological Transition to the Ministry of Agriculture after the European Union proposed legislative changes to drastically ease the environmental rules of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).
Rallied by their trade union, farmers carried banners proclaiming  “We are not delinquents” to the sound of horns and whistles. One decorated his tractor with a mock guillotine. “It is as if they want to cut off our necks,” said Marcos Baldominos explaining his guillotine.
“We are being suffocated by European rules,” the farmer from Pozo de Guadalajara, 50 kilometres east of Madrid, added. Friday’s concessions in Brussels aimed to loosen compliance with some environment rules, EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said.
While the move was welcomed by Spain’s left-wing government, some environmental NGOs criticised the measures. “We are faced with a pile of bureaucratic rules that make us feel more like we are at an office than on a farm,” the trade union behind Sunday’s march, Union de Uniones, said with reference to requirements  “that many small and medium-sized farms” cannot  “cope with”.
Sunday marked the fourth demonstration in Madrid since the start of the wider European farm protest movement in mid-January.

7,"Nobody should fear having a religion,  say UN experts",The experts stressed that physical attacks motivated by the perceived religious affiliation of the victims were an unacceptable failure of the state.,"UNITED NATIONS: Nobody should fear having a religion, declared UN observers as the world body observed a day of solidarity with Muslims on the International Day to Combat Islamophobia this week.
The observation led to three days of discussions at UN headquarters in New York and Geneva and the adoption of a resolution that calls for the appointment of a Special UN Envoy for combating Islamophobia.
A declaration by independent UN experts, however, focused on the targeting of religious minorities across the globe, underlining the need to ensure the security of every religious group.
It noted that acts of harassment, intimidation, violence, and incitement based on religion or belief had risen to “alarming levels” across the world, including against Muslims.
The experts stressed that physical attacks — including killings, harassment, verbal attacks, and death threats — motivated by the perceived religious affiliation of the victims were an unacceptable failure of the state to protect all its citizens in line with its obligations.
They noted that in too many countries in the lead-up to elections, state and non-state actors feed religious tensions and promote discriminatory laws and policies against minorities to gain political advantage.
The declaration noted an increase in attacks on mosques, cultural centres, schools, and even private property belonging to Muslims and cited recent tensions in relation to the Babri Masjid — now Ram Mandir — in India as an example to show how minorities were targeted by hostile majorities.
“We stand in solidarity with those who have suffered intolerance, discrimination, violations, and violence, purely on account of being Muslims,” they declared.
“Nobody should suffer fear for having or manifesting their religion or belief. Everyone should feel safe and benefit from the equal protection of their human rights, which must be guaranteed by all states.”
The experts reiterated that state and faith-based actors in every country were responsible for protecting human rights and urged them to come forward to counter such violations.

8,Blast near merchant ship off Yemen,"DUBAI: A vessel sailing off southern Yemen reported an explosion nearby on Sunday, a British maritime security ...","DUBAI: A vessel sailing off southern Yemen reported an explosion nearby on Sunday, a British maritime security agency said, the latest incident as Houthi rebels have attacked shipping on the vital Red Sea route.
United Kingdom Marine Trade Operations said a commercial ship  “has reported an explosion in close proximity to the vessel”, causing no casualties or damage.
The blast hit as the ship was sailing  “85 nautical miles east of Aden” in Yemen, and the vessel was  “proceeding to its next port of call”, said UKMTO, which is run by the Royal Navy. It did not identify the vessel.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the reported attack, which comes after Houthis have threatened to expand the harassment campaign which has disrupted global trade.
The rebels have launched dozens of missile and drone strikes on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden over the past four months, actions they say are in solidarity with Palestinians.
The Houthis say they are targeting Israel-linked shipping as part of an  “axis of resistance” of Iran allies in protest at Israel’s war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
The United States, which leads an international coalition meant to protect Red Sea shipping, has since mid-January struck Houthi targets in Yemen.
The US Central Command said on Saturday its forces had  “destroyed five unmanned surface vessels and one” drone in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.
CENTCOM earlier said it had shot down a drone fired by the Houthis towards the Red Sea.
Such exchanges have become frequent in the area, sending shipping insurance costs soaring and prompting many firms to detour around the southern tip of Africa.
On Thursday rebel leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi said the group would expand their attacks to ships taking the longer route around Africa’s Cape of Good Hope.
US destroys Houthi dronesThe  United States shot down a drone fired by Houthi rebels toward  the Red Sea and destroyed more of their weaponry on Saturday, its  military said.
US Central Command (CENTCOM) said in a post on X,  formerly Twitter, that on Saturday morning the Houthis launched two  drones towards the Red Sea, a commercially vital seaway that the  Iranian-backed rebels have targeted dozens of times in the past four  months.
CENTCOM forces  “successfully engaged and destroyed one”  drone while the other is presumed to have crashed into the Red Sea, the  statement said, adding that there were no reports of damage or injuries  from ships in the area.
The statement came after the Houthis had  earlier claimed a drone attack on a US destroyer in the Red Sea, adding  that the strike  “achieved its goals.” Later on Saturday night, CENTCOM   “destroyed five unmanned surface vessels and one” drone in  Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen in  “self-defence,” the statement  continued.

9,Aid reaches northern Gaza with famine looming in the enclave,‘Popular Committees’ to distribute fresh supplies in areas of Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun.,"CAIRO: Trucks of flour have reached northern Gaza for distribution to areas that have had no aid in four months, Palestinian media reported on Sunday, with famine looming in the enclave.
A convoy of 12 trucks arrived in the north — six in Gaza City and six in the Jabalia refugee camp — carrying supplies to also be distributed to the northernmost areas of Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun, the media and residents said.
The Hamas-linked Home Front media outlet reported that the aid was distributed by the  “Popular Committees”, a group that includes leaders of powerful clans in Gaza. A Hamas source said the route was secured by Hamas security personnel.
Aid agencies have warned that pockets of Gaza already face famine, with hospitals in the north reporting children dying of malnutrition and dehydration.

The hunger crisis has piled international pressure on Israel more than five months into its ground and air campaign in Gaza.Israel’s Western allies have warned it against attacking Rafah, however, unless it is able to protect civilians. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said on Friday he had approved plans for an assault.Hamas presented a new ceasefire proposal last week including an exchange of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners. Israel’s security cabinet is to meet to discuss it before the delegation leaves.
Netanyahu has already said the proposal was based on  “unrealistic demands”, but a Palestinian official familiar with mediation efforts said chances for a deal looked better with Hamas having given more details on the proposed prisoner swap.
“The mediators felt positive about Hamas’ new proposal. Some in Israel felt the group made some improvement on its previous position and it is now in the hands of Netanyahu alone to say whether an agreement is imminent,” said the official.

10,India’s ‘lottery king’ emerges as top political  donor in opaque system,Election commission data shows Bharatiya Janata Party was the biggest overall  recipient of donations.,"NEW DELHI: India’s  “lottery king”, accused by the authorities of fraud and money laundering, has emerged with his company as the nation’s top political donor under an opaque funding system that has just been partially opened to scrutiny.
Santiago Martin’s Future Gaming and Hotel Services spent 13.68 billion Indian rupees ($165 million) between 2019 and 2024 — 40 per cent more than the next-highest donor — under the now-scrapped funding system, which allowed anonymous and unlimited donations to political parties, data showed on Thursday.
The information, published by the election commission on the orders of India’s Supreme Court, shows Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party was the biggest overall recipient but does not detail which party any donor gave to.
Future Gaming did not respond to request for comment on its donations. Although the court found the  “electoral bonds” system unconstitutional, there was no suggestion that donations were improper.

Election commission data shows Bharatiya Janata Party was the biggest overall  recipient of donations

The data on the defunct funding system draws attention to the chequered history of Martin, 59, who built a lottery-to-real estate empire up from selling lottery tickets as a teenager.
A flashy, smooth-talking figure who has made friends across the political spectrum, Martin has splurged on politicians, handing out expensive gifts as his business empire grew, according to local press accounts.
Over the years, tax authorities, police and investigative agencies have searched his business premises and seized properties in connection with cases against him. His appeals against property seizures by the Enforcement Directorate, India’s financial crime agency, were dismissed last year.
The directorate filed a prosecution complaint in court in September against Future Gaming and 15 other Martin-affiliated companies under the money-laundering statute.
“They have allegedly cheated the lottery issuing state governments by not depositing the entire sale proceeds generated from the sale of lotteries,” and violated the lottery law by illegally retaining and claiming prizes on unsold tickets, and manipulating data, the agency said.
Martin and his firm have denied wrongdoing. His conglomerate, Martin Group, said in October the group and its firms obey the law and that Martin was India’s highest taxpayer in the financial year to March 2003.
Labourer to hobnobber
After working as a teenage labourer in Myanmar to support his family, Martin returned to India in the late 1980s and began his business career in the southern city of Coimbatore, according to his nonprofit Martin Charitable Trust.
The two-digit lottery he ran gained popularity in the region as poor people dreamed of becoming rich overnight. Martin expanded to other states and eventually to neighbouring Bhutan and Nepal, where he had a monopoly on distributing the tickets, according to his website.
He produced a 200-million-rupee ($2.4-million) film — written by the chief minister of Tamil Nadu state and based on Russian writer Maxim Gorky’s novel  “Mother” — that was released in 2011.
That year the state’s ruling party lost elections and Martin’s fortunes turned.
He and his affiliates faced fraud allegations in 32 lottery scandal cases registered by India’s federal police, including for allegedly defrauding the northeastern state of Sikkim of more than 45 billion rupees in unpaid lottery ticket proceeds.
He was jailed with several politicians for eight months in connection with 14 cases, including charges of land-grabbing, cheating and illegal lottery sales. He has not been convicted in any of the cases, some of which are still pending, and was released on bail in 2012.

11,"EU and Cairo sign €7.4bn deal focussed on energy, migration","Egypt currently hosts around nine million refugees, including 4m Sudanese and 1.5m Syrians.","CAIRO: The European Union and Egypt on Sunday signed a 7.4-billion-euro financial package to support the indebted north African country, boost energy sales to Europe and stem irregular migrant flows.
European Commission Presi­dent Ursula von der Leyen was joined in Cairo by the leaders of Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Greece and Italy for the signing ceremony with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.
The strategic partnership deal includes billions in credit over coming years and stepping up gas and other energy flows to help Europe  “move further away from Russian gas”, said a senior European Commission official.
Von der Leyen said that  “today we elevate the relationship between the EU and Egypt to a Strategic and Comprehensive Partnership and we agree on a package ranging from trade and investment to low carbon energy, managing migration, and education, culture and youth”.

Egypt currently hosts around nine million refugees, including 4m Sudanese and 1.5m Syrians

The agreement includes five billion euros in loans over four years, 1.8 billion euros in investment and hundreds of millions for bilateral projects including on migration, said the European official.
Egypt, mired in a painful economic crisis, borders war-battered Libya and the centres of two ongoing conflicts — the Israeli aggression in Gaza Strip and Sudan’s war between the regular armed forces and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces.
“Egypt is a critical country for Europe today and for the days to come,” the commission official said. Egypt already hosts around nine million migrants and refugees, including four million Sudanese and 1.5 million Syrians, the UN’s International Organisation for Migration says.
The EU official said the deal includes steps to cooperate on  “security, counter-terrorism cooperation and protection of borders, in particular the southern one” with Sudan. The Gaza Strip “will not be the main focus but will be part of the discussion” in Cairo, the official added.
‘Eliminating irregular migration’
The delegation included three Mediterranean leaders — Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, her Greek counterpart Kyriakos Mitso­takis and Cyprus President Nikos Christodoulides.
They were joined by Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer and Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo, whose country currently holds the EU’s presidency.
“We need to be partners in eliminating irregular migration,” said De Croo, adding that this could be done by  “creating perspectives and jobs for the young generation to eliminate the root causes”.
The agreement follows several controversial deals the EU has sealed with Libya, Tunisia and Mauritania to stem the flow of irregular migrants across the Mediterranean Sea. The EU’s border agency Frontex recorded last year nearly 158,000 migrant arrivals in Europe via the dangerous sea route, up by 50 per cent on the previous year. The trend has sparked rising anti-immigrant rhetoric in Europe and gains for right-wing populist parties in several EU nations. Human rights groups have strongly condemned the deals with authoritarian governments.
US-based Human Rights Watch said it had documented  “arbitrary arrests and mistreatment of migrants, asylum seekers and refugees by Egyptian authorities”.
HRW criticised what it labelled  “the EU’s cash-for-migration-control approach”, saying it  “strengthens authoritarian rulers while betraying human rights defenders, journalists, lawyers and activists whose work involves great personal risk”. Egypt stresses that migrant boats have not sailed from its coast since 2016, although Egyptians still arrive in Europe by sea, mostly via Libya or Tunisia to Italy.
Dire economic crisis
Egypt, the Arab world’s most populous nation, is in dire need of financial help as it weathers a severe economic crisis marked by rapid inflation. The International Monetary Fund this month agreed an $8 billion loan package after Cairo implemented reforms including a flexible exchange rate and raised interest rates.
Egypt’s economy, dominated by military-linked enter­prises and recently focused on infrastructure mega-projects, has been hit hard by a series of economic shocks.
They include attacks by Houthi rebels on Red Sea shipping that have slashed Suez Canal revenues which are among the main sources of foreign currency for Egypt.
The country’s external debt has ballooned to nearly $165 billion, and the cost of servicing it is expected to reach $42 billion this year.
