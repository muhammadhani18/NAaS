• Zardari, Gen Munir attend funeral of martyred officers
• President says ‘nation and army are united’ in fight against terrorism
LAKKI MARWAT/ PESHAWAR/MOH­MAND: Police continued to brave attacks from militants in multiple districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa over the weekend, even as President Asif Ali Zardari vowed to eliminate terrorism from the country, saying the blood of martyrs will not go in vain.
After seven troops, including two officers, were martyred in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali area on Saturday, militants targeted a police checkpost with hand grenades in Ambar Dub Chowk, a tehsil of Mohmand district.
District Police Officer Muhammad Ayaz Khan said that the attack took place at 11:20pm when unknown assailants attac­ked the police post with two hand grenades followed by indiscriminate firing.
Resultantly, Shoaib and Muhammadullah sustained injuries and were referred to Lady Reading Hospital (LRH) in Peshawar after preliminary treatment. Police have registered an FIR against militants.
In Bannu, a team of police and security forces were attacked in the jurisdiction of Otmanzai police station, on Sunday. The law enforcers were busy in a search and strike operation in the area when they came under fire.
However, the assailants fled the scene after an intense exchange of fire. An official told Dawn that only a police mobile was damaged in the attack and that a search operation by the police to sniff out the attackers was launched in the area.
Likewise, the Counter-Terrorism Department was approached by the Motorway Police with a complaint that their patro­lling team was attacked near Kund, Nowshera on Saturday night.
Sub-Inspector Iqbal, who sent a note to the CTD, said the vehicle came under attack in Kund. Fortunately, no one was hurt in the incident. “It was around 11:30pm when the vehicle was attacked. We have sent a note to the CTD to probe the incident,” SI Iqbal told Dawn. In Lakki Marwat which has borne the brunt of recent militant attacks, the newly-posted district police officer and the deputy superintendent of police separately visited different police stations in the city and reviewed security arrangements.
DPO Tariq Habib asked the police to remain vigilant during duty hours and wear helmets and flak jackets. Similarly, DSP Gul Muhammad Khan directed the police to conduct night patrols in the city and said he would monitor these night patrols himself.
Zardari vows retaliation
At the funeral of Lt Col Syed Kashif Ali and Capt Muhammad Ahmed Badar on Saturday night, President Asif Ali Zardari asserted that the blood of the martyrs would not go in vain and the country would avenge the deaths. The president said Pakistan would not hesitate to strike back if attacked by anyone at borders or inside its territory. He added that the army and the people were united to fight against terrorism.
“This noble sacrifice stands as another glorious testament to the unflinching resolve of our gallant sons, who have never hesitated to offer the ultimate sacrifice for the defence of our motherland. The entire nation stands in solidarity with our armed forces,” APP quoted the president as saying.
Besides President Zardari, the foreign and interior ministers, the chairman joint chiefs of staff committee, the chief of army staff, relatives of martyrs and locals of the area attended the funeral, APP added.
Khawaja Asif in Sialkot
Separately, addressing a press conference at his residence in Sialkot Cantonment, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said unity was necessary in the fight against terrorism. “Our security forces have made countless sacrifices against terrorism and the defence of this country has been kept strong by the blood of our martyrs,” APP reported.
The minister said that once again terrorism had been rising and only a united government could fight this war. He claimed if there was a division then “this war could spread to every street and neighbourhood”.
 






He said the PML-N “had successfully broken the nexus of terrorists, militants, and insurgents in the country and it would eliminate the terrorists again and would not hesitate from any sacrifice to do this”.

1,Caretakers’ candidature for Senate ‘unconstitutional’: PTI,PTI's Ali Mohammad says Article 224(1B) bars them from polls; Tarar says provision only applies to 1st election after their tenure.,"KARACHI: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has cast fresh doubts on the participation of individuals who were members of the caretaker set-up in the upcoming Senate polls, saying that the Constitution does not allow it.
However, the government maintains that the constitutional provision in question only applied to the general elections and not the Senate polls scheduled for April 2.
Those who have submitted nomination papers to contest the Senate elections included ex-caretaker PM Anwaarul Haq Kakar, former caretaker Punjab CM and incumbent Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and ex-adviser to prime minister Ahad Cheema.
In a post on social media platform X, PTI-backed MNA Ali Mohammad Khan claimed that a minister, chief minister or prime minister of the interim caretaker set-up cannot contest elections which they supervised, Dawn.com reported. Mr Khan cited Article 224(1B) of the Constitution in support of his claim.
 







Ali Mohammad Khan says Article 224(1B) bars them from contesting polls; Tarar says provision only applies to first election after their tenure

According to Article 224(1B), “Members of the caretaker Cabinets including the caretaker Prime Minister and the care-taker Chief Minister and their immediate family members shall not be eligible to contest the immediately following elections to such Assemblies”.
 






“If they can’t even contest elections how can they even think of joining the cabinet of the incumbent government? Strange things are happening in Pakistan!” Mr Khan concluded.
Meanwhile, former PTI leader and ex-cabinet minister Shireen Mazari also termed the upcoming Senate polls an “electoral circus”, citing the candidature of Mr Kakar and Mr Naqvi.
In a post on X, she said, “So now we have Kakar and Mohsin Naqvi both being sneaked into Senate. For the parties putting up these two, clearly the Constitution is of no relevancy.
 






“There is also Aimal Wali changing his domicile to sneak into the Senate. Earlier, we saw caretaker minister [Sarfraz] Bugti resign and be cleared for elections,” she recalled.
However, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar rejected the PTI leaders’ contentions.
When contacted, Mr Tarar told Dawn that Article 224(1B) did not apply to the caretakers contesting the upcoming Senate elections as the article bars them from becoming a member of the first assembly to be elected after the interim set-up.
He quoted the example of PTI leader Ali Zafar, saying he had been elected to the Senate soon after he served as caretaker law minister in 2018. “In fact, the PTI leader has wrongly interpreted Article 224 as his claim has no relevance with the said article,” the minister added.

2,Gwadar cut off amid ‘missing persons’ protests,Relatives have blocked coastal highway for last 2 days as they demand recovery of Zakir Abdul Razzaq and Lala Rafique.,"GWADAR: The road link of Gwadar and other parts of Makran division with Karachi and other areas has been cut off for over 48 hours due to protests against the alleged enforced disappearance of two youth.
Locals and victims’ relatives have blocked the coastal highway and the M-8 motorway for the last two days and have demanded the recovery of Zakir Abdul Razzaq and Lala Rafique.
The coastal highway has been blocked at Zero Point of the Turbat-Gwadar-Nalent link road, leaving hundreds of vehicles stranded on both sides of the highway.
Passengers travelling in coaches and buses have been facing severe difficulties as they have been waiting for the highway to be reopened for the last 48 hours.
The closure of roads has severed the land communication between Gwadar, Karachi, Pasni, Ormara and Iran.
Additionally, a shortage of essential commodities has emerged in Turbat and Gwadar.
Traders and business community leaders have expressed apprehension that the shortage would worsen if the roads were not opened.
District administration’s negotiations with the protesters have so far remained fruitless as the missing persons’ heirs have refused to open the highway till the recovery of their loved ones.
The protestors have camped at the highway and announced the indefinite closure of both roads till their demands are met.
The protesters, including women and children from all over Gwadar and other areas, are sitting in the camp carrying placards and banners.
The relatives have claimed that the two men were forcefully taken away by security forces three months ago, and their whereabouts were still unknown.
They added that officials reassured them that the two men would be released after ten days, but it hasn’t happened.
If the two men have committed any crime, they should be presented in court and punished through legal means, the protesters demanded. Haq Do Tehreek Chairman Hussain Wadila and Balochistan National Party-Awami Central Secretary General Saeed Faiz have also visited the protest site and expressed solidarity with the families.

3,"PML-N, PTI trade barbs over ‘smear campaign’ against martyrs","Qaiser hits back at ministers, says his party has always acknowledged the sacrifices made by soldiers defending the country’s borders.","LAHORE: The ruling PML-N on Sunday accused the PTI of running a smear campaign against the country’s martyrs, an allegation swiftly rejected by the opposition party.
Information Minister Attaullah Tarar warned the party of action over its alleged campaign against martyrs of the Mir Ali checkpost attack, while Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif regretted that the PTI’s ‘love of power’ had become so intense that “you make fun of those who sacrificed their lives for Pakistan”.
In a rejoinder, senior PTI leader Asad Qaiser censured both Mr Asif and Mr Tarar for criticising his party over its alleged involvement in an “insulting campaign” against the martyrs of Pakistan Army and security forces personnel, saying they were running “misleading propaganda” against PTI.
Seven troops, including two officers, embraced martyrdom when militants targeted a paramilitary camp in the Mir Ali area of North Waziristan on Saturday. The security forces later killed six militants in a clearance operation.
“The smear campaign against martyrs is not acceptable as it has not only hurt the sentiments of families of martyrs but also the entire nation,” Mr Tarar told a press conference in Lahore.
He said those behind the “vile campaign” were being identified and stern action would be taken against them.
He said the social media accounts involved in the malicious campaign had been reported to relevant platforms, but regretted that no action was taken by the authorities concerned as the accounts were still operational.
“The PTI is involved in disrespecting martyrs,” he said, citing the examples of the Lasbela helicopter crash in 2022 and May 9, when state institutions came under attack, martyrs’ memorials were vandalised.
Answering a question, he said many accounts involved in the vile campaign were being operated from outside the country, but some followers of these accounts were in the country. He said many accounts were also being operated from Pakistan, adding that legal action would be taken against them.
The minister said some political elements wanted to harm the national economy for their vested interests through negative tactics like writing letters to the IMF.
He said PTI should have openly condemned those who had demonstrated outside IMF offices in the US and sent petitions to the European Union to revoke Pakistan’s GSP+ status.
In Sialkot, Defence Minister Asif condemned the nefarious campaign against martyrs on social media, APP reported. “Our martyrs are our pride, but there is no doubt that those who gave wrong remarks against them are in touch with terrorists,” he told a presser.
He added that the army personnel, who embraced martyrdom while defending the motherland against the scourge of terrorism in Mir Ali, were ridiculed by a political party on social media.
Targeting PTI, he said that loss of power and the love of power had become so intense that “you are making fun of those who sacrificed their lives for Pakistan. I think there can be no greater enmity with Pakistan”.
Mr Asif said dragging martyrs into differences over elections is a very shameful act and the party which is doing this, has actually lost its identity and today it is a nameless party. The minister said no one knows who is running the PTI today.
He pointed out that these people through letters to the IMF and US Congress members said that Pakistan should not be given loans. He said writing a letter to IMF is equivalent to anti-nationalism.
PTI rejects accusation
However, PTI leader Qaiser hit back at the two ministers, saying his party always acknowledged the sacrifices made by the soldiers defending the country’s borders, Geo News reported.
“Those using soldiers’ martyrdom for their political gains are not the well-wishers of the nation,” he said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.
 






The former National Assembly speaker further said that “nation is proud of each and every soldier protecting the country”.
PTI leader Barrister Saif also assailed the PML-N, saying the ruling party was dragging the martyrs into politics for political gains.
He said PTI is a patriotic party and denied its involvement in any campaign maligning the martyrs.

4,Analysis: The pursuit of prosperity or a perpetual pain?,"A pattern of reliance on IMF bailouts, coupled with a lack of substantial reforms, has led to a scenario where Pakistan is on the brink and masses are reeling from economic pain.","AN IMF mission is here to hold discussions on the second and final review of its short-term $3 billion rescue package that has helped Pakistan shore up its foreign excha­nge reserves and avert a sovereign default.
The review will most likely be successfully completed, leading to a staff-level agreement that would facilitate the disbursement of a $1.2bn tranche in the coming weeks, a vital injection for Pakistan’s economy.
Meanwhile, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has already hinted at starting discussions with the lender about a bigger and longer successor bailout.
“We would at least kick-start the process and get this going. Let us see how they respond,” he said last week in his first formal media interaction after assuming the charge of the finance ministry. “Further negotiations on the fresh programme will be taken forward on the sidelines of the spring meetings of the IMF and the World Bank in April in Washington.”

A pattern of reliance on IMF bailouts, coupled with a lack of substantial reforms, has led to a scenario where Pakistan is on the brink and masses are reeling from economic pain

While the government has not officially stated the size or duration of the funding it plans to seek from the Fund, the lender has said it will formulate a medium-term programme if Islamabad applies for one.
“We look forward to engaging with the new government to complete the second review under the current stand-by arrangement and, should the government request, support the formulation of a new medium-term economic programme,” an IMF spokesperson told Reuters earlier this month.
If approved, the loan programme would be Pakistan’s 24th engagement with the global lender. The country has already earned the unenviable distinction of being the most frequent and the fourth largest customer of the IMF.
The question is: has Pakistan learnt any lessons from its previous 23 arrangements with the IMF? Apart from one, all the programmes were terminated midway due to tough conditions. Never has Pakistan met the goals of any package.
This pattern of reliance on IMF bailouts, coupled with a lack of substantial structural, governance, financial and economic reforms, has precipitated a scenario where Pakistan teeters on the edge of fiscal instability, with the masses groaning under huge economic pain.
Another IMF programme is most likely to increase this pain. Yet, most experts argue that Pakistan’s current situation leaves little room for alternative strategies, with other multilateral and bilateral creditors keenly watching the outcome of these negotiations.
‘Designed for stabilisation, not growth’
“It’s given that a sizable, extended IMF programme is imperative for Pakistan. We have to appreciate, however, that the IMF prescriptions are [always] designed for macroeconomic stabilisation, not for growth. Therefore, there will be economic pain and anaemic growth in the medium term,” argues Zafar Masud, president and CEO of the Bank of Punjab.
Many economic analysts believe that the IMF’s financial support should be sought only to overcome crises like the short-term balance of payment troubles caused by exogenous or endogenous shocks and to create breathing space to implement policies that would restore economic stability and growth.
In Pakistan’s case, it has always been the opposite. Years of fiscal profligacy and the ruler’s obsession with creating import-intensive, consumption-led growth without correcting deep-seated structural economic and governance flaws take the country to the IMF every few years.
Many have predicted that like previous IMF programmes, the stabilisation goals of the new package would also compel the government to take tough steps that would lead to higher inflation, more unemployment and currency devaluation, slowing down growth, at least in the short run.
“Unfortunately, we have come at a crossroads where it is not a question of pain or no pain; it’s just when and how we decide [or are forced] to take it. There are no easy paths but choices that are less distressing for the public. Nevertheless, our ultimate objective should be to achieve sustainable economic growth, which is the only proven route towards progress and poverty alleviation,” Mr Masud insists.
Others, like former state minister for finance Aisha Ghaus Pasha, agree. “Our problems are enormous. We have been tweaking the economy here and there when under pressure to tackle these problems temporarily, but do not fix its structural defects,” she says.
“The IMF programmes do provide some valuable support by providing short-term space to stop further economic slide, but lasting solutions can only come out of homegrown economic strategies and deep reforms,” Ms Pasha observes.
‘Commitment to implementation’
The new IMF facility for Pakistan is not likely to be much different from the ones before. Nor the conditions are expected to be different. Hence, people like Mr Masud want the authorities to “devise a homegrown economic revival plan that must go beyond the IMF’s conventional [one-size-fits-all] recipe”.
He adds, “It’s essential to address our chronic issues and achieve sustainable economic growth. A strong political will is a prerequisite to undertake politically unwanted, but inescapable corrective actions.”
The new finance minister has laid out his agenda almost on the same lines as he plans to focus on implementation of the much-needed reforms. “No debates, no waste of time; just a steadfast commitment to implementation,” he was quoted to have said after he was sworn in as the minister.
Pakistan’s core problem, according to Mr Masud, is fragile fiscal position and short-term profile of domestic and external debt.
“This is where the focus of real reforms is inevitable. Our dilemma is that our public debt is swelling, and so is our private wealth, which means that, effectively, the rich are getting wealthier at the expense of the government, which is ostensibly borrowing to make the rich even richer,” Mr Masud argues.
Like others, he also advocates that the tax net needs to be enhanced and made equitable and judicious across sectors, with concrete efforts to migrate the informal economy towards digitisation and documentation.
But Mr Masud says politico-economic wheels have to move in tandem — including federal and provincial governments, private sector, and monetary and fiscal policies — for the common objective.
‘Perception matters’
Ahmed Kamal, one of the top textile and clothing exporters, is quite bullish on the economy since elections.
“The government has selected a very competent finance minister, who, in my opinion, will not take political pressure when making tough and unpopular decisions,” he says. “Aurangzeb’s appointment has sent a clear message to the world: Pakistan means business this time around and it is ready to carry out the necessary reforms.”
“You know, perception matters a lot. Once we are able to send a clear message to the world about our commitment to reform ourselves, we will start receiving foreign investment. And growth will follow,” he adds. “Pakistan has a lot of potential. We just haven’t marketed our country properly. Our poor country image has been the reason for our issues. We need perception for the industry to build.”
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who once described Pakistan’s economic challenge as unimaginable, recently said that “we have to carry out a surgical operation, as antibiotics will not work at all. There will be a deep surgery so that the roots of this country can deepen. Whenever there is a will, there is a way, and it is never too late.”
Ms Pasha says Pakistan’s story of boom-and-bust cycles will not end and the country cannot be put on a path of sustainable growth without reforms, no matter how many IMF programmes we take.
She believes the present government is well placed to carry out structural reforms beyond the IMF-mandated policies. “This government is in an ideal position; it is elected for five years and enjoys the full backing and support (from the powers that be) needed to take tough measures. If not now, when will they implement reforms?” she wonders.
