0,An unambitious growth path,"As seen with Argentina, Egypt, and Ethiopia, an arrangement with the IMF is not insurance against economic failure.","


 
Over the past three decades, Pakistan’s economic focus, particularly in its dealings with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), has centred on addressing twin deficits — current account and fiscal. Despite concerted efforts, these issues have persisted, signalling the need for a fundamental shift in approach.
While managing deficits remains crucial, this writer believes sustainable economic growth, driven by increased foreign direct investment, must become the linchpin of Pakistan’s policy agenda. Only through a comprehensive realignment of all policies towards this goal can Pakistan navigate its way out of the vicious cycle of debt, low growth, inflation, and poverty.
The root causes of Pakistan’s low investment and savings rates are deeply entrenched in structural issues, requiring significant political, economic, and social reforms. The recent arrival of an IMF mission for a review underscores the urgency of addressing these challenges.
While the government’s focus on seeking an Extended Fund Facility after the current standby arrangement expires is understandable, it must recognise that the IMF conditions alone are insufficient for achieving sustained growth and transformation.

As seen with Argentina, Egypt, and Ethiopia, an arrangement with the IMF is not insurance against economic failure

The current IMF conditions linked to raising taxes, abolishing subsidies, maintaining market-determined exchange rates and privatisation are remarkably similar to those in the previous programmes and are unlikely to change.
While Pakistan has been forced to take the IMF conditions more seriously this time, the history of Pakistan’s 23 prior arrangements with the IMF, as well as those in Argentina, Egypt, and Ethiopia, suggest they will not be sufficient to achieve stable growth and economic transformation needed for a country with one of the highest population growth rates in the world.
Historically, successive governments have pledged to enhance tax collection but have fallen short, adversely affecting the investment climate in the process. While digitising the tax system is a positive step, it must be complemented by broader reforms to stimulate economic activity.
Recognising the pivotal role of investment, efforts have been made to attract FDI through initiatives such as the Special Investment Facilitation Council. However, a coherent economic revival plan is imperative for long-term stability and prosperity. Foreign private investors should be the primary focus of this plan.
A comparative analysis with neighbouring India and Bangladesh highlights Pakistan’s lag in key economic indicators, such as revenue-to-GDP ratio, savings rate, and investment-to-GDP ratio. These disparities underscore the need for a paradigm shift in policy priorities and sequencing of reforms.
It may surprise some that while Pakistan’s revenue to GDP lagged behind India’s by an average of 7 percentage points, it stayed above Bangladesh’s by an average of 4 percentage points.
Low Savings Rate
Another critical indicator is the domestic savings to GDP ratio. Historically, Asian countries with some of the highest saving rates outperformed the rest of the developing world by a wide margin.

Pakistan’s low savings rate can’t be due to a large informal economy as Bangladesh and India also have large informal sectors but higher savings

Pakistan’s savings rate is strikingly low compared to Bangladesh and India. It cannot be attributed to just a large informal economy as both of these countries have large informal sectors as well.
In 2022, India’s savings rate was 29.1 per cent, Bangladesh’s 25.2pc and that of Pakistan barely 4pc. From 2003 to 2022, India’s average was 31.1pc, Bangladesh’s 22.9pc and Pakistan’s a lowly 8.6pc.
Low Investment Rate
Why has Pakistan’s growth faltered so much compared to its South Asian neighbours? Let’s look at the investment-to-GDP ratio of the three countries.
In 2023, Bangladesh’s tax-to-GDP ratio was under 10pc but investment-to-GDP was 31pc compared to Pakistan’s 13.6pc. India’s tax-to-GDP ratio was 11.2pc but the investment-to-GDP ratio was 34pc.
While IMF engagement is necessary, Pakistan must develop a well-prepared plan that extends beyond meeting its conditions. It should encompass radical liberalisation and deregulation measures, drawing lessons from the experiences of successful economies like India and South Korea.
The cautionary tale of Ethiopia’s state-led growth model serves as a reminder that unsustainable borrowing for large-scale projects can exacerbate economic vulnerabilities.
China accounted for nearly 50pc of Ethiopia’s $28 billion external debt in 2023. The state-led model saw Ethiopia’s exports fall from 13.7pc of GDP in 2012 to an average of 7.7pc in 2019-2022.
Last December, Ethiopia became the third African country to formally default on its debt in as many years after missing the deadline to make a $33 million interest payment on its only international bond. This default places the East African country among a growing number of emerging economies that have defaulted on their debt in the aftermath of the pandemic.
According to the World Bank, there have been 18 sovereign defaults in 10 developing countries in the past three years, a number greater than any recorded in the previous two decades.
The different growth models and lessons therein merit carefully reviewing our priorities and goal-setting process. As we have seen in Argentina, Egypt, and Ethiopia, an arrangement with the IMF is not insurance against economic failure or even default.
Pakistan should focus on fostering investments and technology transfer to drive growth sustainably. While collaboration with the IMF may be necessary (as South Korea and India did in the 1990s), it should not be viewed as the ultimate objective.
Rather, Pakistan must chart a course tailored to its unique circumstances, judiciously mobilising international support, particularly that of foreign private investors, to realise its economic potential.

1,Stalled energy solution,Plans to establish coal to gas and liquid conversion plants for energy and urea production are on hold despite private sector interest due to federal inertia.,"The initial brouhaha notwithstanding, the Sindh government’s plan to produce gas and liquid fuels for urea production, electricity generation, and transport doesn’t seem to be getting anywhere even after the passage of several years and despite investor interest.
Sindh Coal Authority officials blame the federal government’s failure to devise a policy to “support investment as a main impediment to any tangible progress on the plans” to explore the possibility of conversion of coal to gas and liquid.
When asked what was stopping Sindh from moving ahead with its plan and signing investment deals with interested local and foreign companies, a senior Sindh Energy Department official argued, “Constitutionally, the provinces are owners of their ground hydrocarbon energy resources but the powers to regulate international and interprovincial movement of energy, determine prices of different fuels and energy goods, impose taxes and fees, and decide use for power generation, urea production or transportation are with the federal government in the interest of the country’s economic development and energy security.
“The province, therefore, cannot implement its coal-to-gas or coal-to-liquid project or involve private investors in it unless the federal government finalises a policy to regulate this sector.”

Plans to establish coal to gas and liquid conversion plants for energy and urea production are on hold despite private sector interest due to federal inertia

Converting coal to gas and liquids (diesel) using vast reserves of lignite in Thar was one of the options initially proposed by the Sindh government to deal with the energy crisis and mitigate climate change concerns due to the growing use of indigenous and imported coal for power generation and other purposes.
The Sindh government started work on a proposal to tackle the projected shortfall of 2.6 million tons per annum (mtpa) of urea in the country by 2027. Utilising lignite through a surface gasification procedure in urea production is significant in mitigating this predicted deficit.
The scheme had been on the table for a long time, but it gained momentum after former prime minister Imran Khan committed to banning coal generation at the Climate Ambition Summit in December 2020 as part of Pakistan’s efforts to reduce its carbon footprint. Mr Khan also announced his intentions to convert domestic coal reserves to produce energy via coal-to-gas and coal-to-liquid processes.
The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government had also done some initial work to formulate a policy to execute the proposal in collaboration with Oracle Power PLC — a natural resource and power project developer — and its Chinese partner, China National Coal Development Company (CNCDC).
The two companies submitted policies and proposals for the federal energy ministry at the beginning of 2021. The proposals outlined a draft commercial framework through which the development of coal to gas and liquid at Thar Block VI could be fast-tracked to address the country’s crippling gas shortage and reliance on imported liquid fuels.
Oracle’s Thar Block VI was even included in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) portfolio to develop coal-to-gas and coal-to-liquids to assist Pakistan. Three urea producers — Engro, Fatima and Fauji — had also shown considerable interest in the project to augment their production capacities.
“The need for alternative sources of economically viable gas in Pakistan is clearly evident, and the government has sanctioned the conversion of coal-to-gas with this in mind. With the ongoing support of our consortium partners, including our technical partner and clean coal pioneer, CNCDC, we expect to be the front-runner in this burgeoning industry,” Oracle Pakistan Chief Executive Officer, Naheed Memon, was reported to have said at that time. “It is estimated that through the application of coal gasification, our Thar Block VI Project could produce and supply approximately 1,000m standard cubic feet per day.”
The then special assistant to the prime minister on CPEC, Khalid Mansoor, was also quite upbeat about the scheme. “The policy’s initial aim is to scale up Thar coal production for conversion to gas and oil, set up a petrochemical complex for a chain of industrial products, and eventually move on to other areas for fertiliser, fuel, and agriculture security.
“A policy draft has been shared with all the stakeholders so that the policy can be finalised and included in the coming budget,” he had told the media weeks before the ouster of the PTI government in April 2022.
On project viability, he maintained that there was no doubt about the technicalities. “I have seen several petrochemical complexes up and running in China. However, the main challenge would be concluding policy and securing financing to move towards the execution phase and have plants in place by 2028. If coal-to-gas is successful, a large fertiliser plant can be set at the mine-mouth of Thar coal.”
Among other proposals, Oracle had suggested fiscal incentives, including a waiver of customs duty on all plants and equipment not manufactured locally for coal-to-gas and coal-to-liquid technologies, to encourage their deployment. The items manufactured locally must be charged a duty of five per cent, besides a complete waiver of withholding tax and sales tax on all imported equipment used in these plants.
Moreover, the policy proposals demanded a lucrative 10-year income tax waiver from commercial operations, for which prior timelines would have to be committed and met. The policy was also supposed to provide an offtake/purchase plan for gas and liquids proposed to be produced from Thar coal and determine the prices.
Despite federal inertia, the Sindh Coal Authority continues to work on the scheme. Last year, it received confirmation from a South African laboratory that lignite coal found in the Thar Desert can be converted into gas, liquid and urea through surface gasification. The analysis, conducted as part of a ‘Pre Investment study — Coal to Gas, Coal to Liquid and Urea’, said that Thar coal has high tar yields of 20pc (air-dried basis) and high CO2 reactivity, which are typical of lignite coal and suitable for gasification.
“Everything except the policy is in place for the project to take off,” a Sindh Coal Authority official, who has remained part of the project since the beginning, told Dawn. “Without a policy providing clarity on tax and other incentives and concessions on investments, gas and oil pricing, and purchase agreement with gas companies and PSO, no private investor is prepared to put their capital.
“We have approached fertiliser firms, but they are reluctant to spend a significant sum of money on feasibility studies unless they have a clear idea of the coal-to-gas policy. So I don’t see any progress until the federal petroleum ministry finalises the policy document.”
He pointed out that India has recently launched a major coal gasification programme to install a coal gasification capacity of 100mtpa by 2030, involving an investment of $65 billion. The country has announced tax and other incentives totalling more than $100bn as the government targets to gasify 100m tonnes of coal by 2030.
Younis Dagha, a retired bureaucrat who had conceived and finalised the joint venture on Thar coal mining between the Sindh government and private sector companies to open up Thar coalfield for power generation, says gas transportation from Thar to the existing fertiliser plants would be a challenge. However, if the production facilities are shifted to the mine-mouth, urea manufacturing from synthetic gas would become cost-effective.
He lamented that bureaucratic hurdles were impeding the use of Thar coal to ensure the country’s energy and food security. “Without a robust policy, you cannot expect investors to bring their capital and invest in such projects,” he concluded.

2,A Guyanese case study on oil,Energy-deficient Pakistan could learn from Guyana in successfully exploiting its energy assets via active global player participation.,"Guyana is the newest kid on the global energy bloc. The country’s growing oil assets, regarded by some as the find of the decade, are increasingly under the spotlight, giving rise to a new tug of war. As is always the case, attempts to grab the assets are on, both at the geopolitical and corporate levels.
Guyana’s offshore oil sector is booming, with over 11 billion barrels of oil equivalent resources discovered so far. Production is expected to reach roughly 620,000 barrels per day (bpd) once its Payara field reaches maximum capacity, and it could exceed 1.2 million bpd by 2028.
So far, 30 discoveries have been made, and many more are expected. With production anticipated to begin in Yellowtail in 2025 and Uaru in 2026, the country’s output could touch the 8m barrels equivalent per day, according to recent Standard & Poor’s Global estimates. However, the emerging resources are not without a curse.
Neighbouring Venezuela, boasting a large army with 337,000 personnel, is asserting ownership of the resource-rich Essequibo region of Guyana. Once supermajor Exxon made a swathe of high-quality oil discoveries in the waters off the Essequibo region, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s sabre-rattling intensified.

Energy-deficient Pakistan could learn from Guyana in successfully exploiting its energy assets via active global player participation

Venezuela is now claiming its rights to a 61,000 square mile area of Guyana, comprising roughly two-thirds of the sovereign territory. A heated debate between the two countries has begun. Caracas is accusing Georgetown of awarding Exxon illegal drilling licenses. It says Guyana has no right to award such licenses. Venezuela has also objected to Exxon’s drilling campaign, claiming the supermajor was engaging in corrupt conduct with key opposition figure, Maria Corina Machado, to move ahead on the project.
Matthew Smith reported in his piece in Oilprice.com, “Recent evidence suggests heightened military activity along Guyana’s border, raising fears of a potential invasion. By the end of 2023, there were fears Venezuela would use its military to annex the contested region.” To many, this is reminiscent of the invasion of Kuwait by the forces of Saddam Hussain in 1990.
Later, however, the presidents of Venezuela and Guyana agreed to resolve the dispute peacefully. Yet despite the agreement, “evidence of heightened Venezuelan military activity along Guyana’s border has [re]emerged, sparking fears Caracas is preparing to seize the [resource-rich] Essequibo by force.”
In the meantime, a corporate battle is also ongoing. Currently, Exxon controls all production in Guyana, holding a 45 per cent share in a consortium that includes the Hess Corporation and the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) as minority partners. Last October, Chevron Corp agreed to acquire Hess Corp for $53bn.
Analysts point out that Chevron’s bid to purchase Hess in October was primarily aimed at securing its 30pc stake in the Stabroek block off the coast of Guyana, currently one of the world’s fastest-growing oil developments and the biggest crude discovery in a decade.
Exxon is now claiming it has a right to first refusal of any sale of the Stabroek block off the coast of Guyana, containing at least 11bn barrels of oil. Late in February, ExxonMobil said it may pre-empt Chevron Corp’s acquisition of a 30pc stake in the giant Guyanese oil block. Many say the possible move by Exxon to pre-empt the Chevron-Hess deal could result in the breakup of Chevron’s $53bn deal to buy into the field.
Chevron stands adamant there’s “no possible scenario” where Exxon or CNOOC could buy the stake, adding that it remains fully committed to the Hess deal. Exxon and CNOOC’s right of first refusal is “not applicable” to its merger with Hess, Chevron said in an emailed statement sent to the media. “As described in the S-4, there is no possible scenario in which Exxon or CNOOC could acquire Hess’ interest in Guyana as a result of the Chevron-Hess transaction.”
However, Exxon is insisting that it has a duty to its shareholders to explore the right of first refusal over the change of ownership of the Hess stake.
In recent months, oil majors have struck a flurry of mega-deals to secure stakes in proven reserves without building new projects that would increase global supplies. Capitalising upon the sentiment, Guyana has been trying to attract more large oil producers to dilute Exxon’s dominance of the country’s energy output.
It recently held an offshore block auction that drew bids from TotalEnergies, Petronas and Qatar Energy. A battle royale between the oil giants is thus underway in Guyana.
The ongoing corporate dispute over Guyana’s Stabroek Block and the possibility of invasion of Guyana by Venezuela underscores “how important the emerging basin is to global crude markets”, Bloomberg underlined in a piece.
The evolving battleground of Guyana once again underlines oil and geopolitics are virtually inseparable.
For energy-deficient countries like Pakistan, Guyana presents a case study. The country has been successful in exploiting its energy assets through the active participation of global oil majors. Such projects require considerable investments and technological knowhow — oil majors’ posses both.
However, for oil majors to get involved in any such projects, political and economic stability in host countries remains a must. Consistency in policies is required and on a long-term basis.
Pakistan is not meeting these prerequisites. Despite having the potential, it has been unable to exploit and grow its domestic energy asset base in recent decades. To some, it has been a lost decade in many senses.
Oil majors and multinationals are slowly opting out of Pakistan. To achieve a semblance of success in the energy sector, we need to reverse this trend. Pakistan, and especially the Ministry of Petroleum, has a lot to relearn.

3,Revisiting taxation strategies,The PPP-backed PML-N government largely represent the feudal/big business class so it may be tempted to tax the retailers without first taxing agricultural incomes and the real estate sector.,"Pakistan is keen on securing a larger and longer International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout package — the only thing the country can do when it cannot service all its external debts on time.
There is no option of skipping the IMF and seeking more considerable, longer-term funds from friendly countries that have already rolled over billions of dollars worth of such funds offered earlier. Foreign exchange inflows from exports, remittances, and foreign investment hardly match imports and outward remittances, leaving little or nothing for foreign debt servicing. And foreign exchange reserves are not enough to fully cover even two months of imports.
Given the weak external economy, achieving even modest economic growth requires accelerating domestic demand through the optimal use of production resources. At the same time, it is necessary to ensure that the accelerated domestic demand and the consequent growth in production are judiciously taxed along with fuller taxation of hitherto untaxed or undertaxed segments of income. This isn’t an easy job.
Amidst the ongoing gas and electricity tariff hikes, industries and businesses find it difficult to produce more at affordable costs. The wholesale and retail sectors also find it challenging to supply the produced goods and services through a not-so-organised supply chain to the end consumer.

The PPP-backed PML-N government largely represent the feudal/big business class so it may be tempted to tax the retailers without first taxing agricultural incomes and the real estate sector

At this critical point, any move to bring an additional 3.2 million retailers into the tax net must be made carefully, considering every aspect, including the principles of simplicity and equity. There are 3.5m potential taxpayers in the retail sector, but only 0.3m are currently paying taxes. Taxing these retailers may generate an additional revenue of Rs500 billion and widen the tax base.
The PPP-backed PML-N government largely represent the feudal/big business class. So, it may be tempted to tax the retailers without first taxing agricultural incomes and exploiting the full potential of the real estate sector.
According to the World Bank, full taxation of agriculture and properties (taxing the income from these two sectors and closing all tax exemptions available to them) may yield more than Rs3 trillion in taxes or roughly one-third of the current level of tax revenue.
Taxing retailers without taxing agriculture and the real estate sectors may upset the retailers, already braving dwindling demand amidst high inflation and low economic growth, rise in energy prices and multiplicity of taxes, and growing street crimes in Karachi — the hub of trading.
Besides, the bulk of retailing activity, both via brick-and-mortar shops and e-commerce, takes place in big cities, whereas most of the agricultural income primarily lands in rural areas.
Growing social, economic and political divides have increased geographical sensitivities in recent years. Sparing the agricultural chain of activity (whose primary beneficiaries represent the socio-political interests of rural Pakistan) from full taxation will be counter-productive.
Engineering a tax scheme to collect more property taxes from the middle-class urban population and less from the rural population and urban elite will also not work.
The caretaker government prepared the draft of a simplified retailers’ tax scheme titled Tajir Dost (or Trader-Friendly). The PPP-backed PML-N government is expected to finalise and introduce the same scheme with a few amendments. The IMF will be interested in knowing when exactly the scheme will be launched during its current review of its ongoing $3bn lending programme, which ends next month.
Moreover, it would be naive to think that the Fund will not also be interested in knowing the specifics of the proposed tax schemes for agriculture and real estate before even considering a larger, longer-term loan under an Extended Fund Facility. The Fund would likely demand specific timelines for such schemes, and sticking to those timelines would be crucial.
Pakistan’s new Finance Minister, Aurangzeb Khan, pledged in his maiden press conference last week to rapidly implement comprehensive digitalisation of the tax system to enhance transparency. Will the banker-turned-minister be able to fulfil his promise? That’s a million-dollar question. Much depends on whether he gets a free hand to pursue the right policies and how serious the IMF gets in its demand for transparent taxation.
If retailers are successfully brought into the tax net through a digitalised and simplified Tajir Dost scheme and the projected revenue of Rs500bn is realised, that would be no mean feat. The additional revenue may not be significant in Pakistan’s context — roughly five per cent or even less of next year’s estimated tax revenue. However, the registration of 3.2m new taxpayers would enlarge the tax base, which would be crucial for the country’s economy in the medium to long term.
But, to ensure that taxing retailers doesn’t become a political headache, the government will have to implement the principle of equity and continue taxing agricultural and property incomes with the same zeal. Besides, it will have to cut down its lavish expenses, without which no move to broaden the tax base would be successful. Taxpayers pay honestly only when they see their tax money is not being splurged.
The government will also have to come up with innovative policies to enliven domestic demand and promote domestic trade to avoid slippages in tax collection even after the targeted broadening of the tax base. Expanding the taxpayers’ list cannot automatically lead to higher tax collection. Additional tax collection is possible only when the economy is growing.
The agriculture and services sectors are doing a little better than a year ago, but a solid manufacturing recovery may take more time. What matters a lot in sustaining the growth momentum of agriculture and services and in pushing for manufacturing growth is the restoration of political stability — and a new $8bn-$9bn IMF loan.

4,AI for agriculture,"By harnessing tech for predictive analytics and precision agriculture, farmers can enhance crop yields and optimise resource utilisation.","Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into agricultural practices holds immense potential to revolutionise productivity in Pakistan. By leveraging AI-powered solutions tailored to the needs of the agricultural sector, farmers can streamline operations, optimise resource usage, and make data-driven decisions.
However, it is crucial to emphasise that the success of AI integration hinges upon its alignment with the unique challenges and requirements of agriculture. When implemented thoughtfully and ethically, AI technologies can unlock unprecedented levels of productivity and sustainability in the farming sector.
In Pakistan, agriculture is pivotal for economic growth, contributing 21 per cent to the GDP and employing over 42pc of the workforce. The sector’s agro-based products also generate 80pc of the country’s total export earnings. So, it plays a vital role in the economy and livelihoods of millions, hence, the integration of AI is crucial.
It facilitates the prediction of weather patterns, soil quality, groundwater levels, crop cycles, and the detection of plant diseases, all of which are vital decision-changing considerations. Monitoring crop health is enabled by soil and plant sensors, as well as multispectral imagery captured by satellites or drones.

By harnessing tech for predictive analytics and precision agriculture, farmers can enhance crop yields and optimise resource utilisation

Leveraging these insights and innovations can address longstanding challenges such as unpredictable weather patterns, rising temperatures, variability of monsoons, melting of glaciers, water scarcity, and fluctuating market conditions.
By harnessing AI for predictive analytics, crop monitoring, and precision agriculture, Pakistani farmers can enhance crop yields, optimise resource utilisation, and mitigate risks, ultimately bolstering food security and economic stability.
There exists a gap in collaboration between academia and industry, leading to a discrepancy between academic research and its practical applicability in the market. Local universities, including NED University of Engineering and Technology, Institute of Business Administration Karachi, Lahore University of Management Sciences, National University of Sciences & Technology, and FAST National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences, have initiated AI degree programmes, planned specialisations, or established centres for tool and service development.
Agricultural universities such as the University of Agriculture Faisalabad and the University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences are actively exploring AI applications for crop monitoring, disease detection, and solution optimisation. These applications must be aligned with the local scenario and practices.
Pakistan currently holds the highest proportion of young people, as 64pc of the total population of Pakistan is below the age of 30. They possess the potential to evolve into an enormous, well-trained cohort of AI professionals.
Smart farming is a pioneering urban agricultural initiative to establish a hydroponics-based test environment integrated with the Internet of Things (IoT) and AI systems. This integration ensures a controlled and self-sufficient setting for plant cultivation.
Smart farming represents the integration of Web 5.0 technologies into agriculture, exemplified by hydroponics, a soil-less plant cultivation method utilising nutrient-rich water. This endeavor aims to address agricultural challenges in Pakistan by merging physical and digital technologies for optimal sustainability and adaptability.
With a fully monitored hydroponic farming system, IoT interface is also integrated to measure total dissolved solids (TDS), pH, humidity, and temperature. This allows for automated operations, ensuring optimal crop health.
The incorporation of AI into agricultural operations is revolutionising as technology is seamlessly integrated into various aspects of agriculture to enhance efficiency and productivity across the sector.
Specific AI technologies utilised include machine learning algorithms, predictive analytics, and computer vision systems. These technologies enable farmers to make data-driven decisions, optimise resource utilisation, and automate repetitive tasks. For example, machine learning algorithms analyse vast amounts of agricultural data to predict crop yields, identify pest outbreaks, and optimise irrigation schedules.
Computer vision systems, on the other hand, help in crop monitoring and disease detection through image recognition.
The impact of AI-driven solutions on crop yield, resource optimisation, and sustainability practices in Pakistani agriculture is profound. AI algorithms optimise crop production by identifying the most suitable planting times, crop varieties, and fertilisation schedules, leading to increased yields.
AI-powered precision farming techniques minimise resource wastage by precisely targeting inputs such as water, fertilisers, and pesticides, all of which promote sustainable agricultural practices.
Ensuring accessibility and affordability of AI-powered agricultural solutions for small-scale farmers in Pakistan is crucial. Efforts can be made to bridge the technological literacy gap by providing user-friendly interfaces and training programs tailored to farmers’ needs.
Initiatives can be undertaken to make AI technologies financially viable for small-scale farmers through subsidies, grants, and collaborative partnerships with governmental and non-governmental organisations.

5,Irsa amendment row simmers,"""Caretakers are not mandated/empowered to make such decisions on contentious issues"".","Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif had to withdraw the notification for the appointment of Zafar Mahmood, a retired BS-22 bureaucrat and pro-Kalabagh Dam expert, as a non-member chairman of the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) following a strong reaction from Sindh given its major stakes in water distribution.
Post-1947, irrigation water was allocated in the country through ad hoc arrangements. Following several commissions/committees, the four provinces sat together and agreed to apportion the waters of the Indus River system under the Water Apportionment Accord 1991 (WAA). The provinces’ consent also led to the establishment of the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) under the Irsa Act 1992.
Recently, the incumbent Irsa Chairman, Akhtar Hameed Mengal, sent a draft amendment of the Act to the Ministry of Water Resources, which the caretaker federal cabinet approved. However, the outgoing president, Dr Arif Alvi, didn’t sign the ordinance, which was returned to the government unsigned. This writer tried to reach Dr Alvi to find out whether he gave observations on the ordinance, but he didn’t respond.
The federal government is said to have presented the ordinance to the president, and after 10 days, it was deemed to have become law. The course adopted by the Irsa chairman — who represents Balochistan in the Irsa — was unjustified as the provinces, Council of Common Interests (CCI), and parliament had been bypassed in the decision making.

‘Caretakers are not mandated/empowered to make such decisions on contentious issues’

According to former advocate general Sindh, Zamir Ghumrothe, WAA is the parent of the Irsa Act because the provinces had authorised the federal government to create a structure to regulate interprovincial water distribution — that’s how the Irsa was established under the WAA. So, any amendment to this Act can only be made once provinces are taken on board and the CCI approves with consensus.
“What the caretaker federal government has done to amend the Act unilaterally is patently illegal. Caretakers are not mandated/empowered to make such decisions on contentious issues,” Mr Ghumro says.
As a federal body, the Irsa has been functioning as a water regulator with limited scope, regulating interprovincial water distribution as mandated by the WAA. Besides provincial members, a federal government representative is also a member of the Irsa. Under the Irsa Act 1992, the post of chairman is rotated among provinces annually.
But a simple reading of the ordinance shows it has attempted to alter the structure of the Irsa. It created a new post of vice chairman for the provinces as it delegated authority to the federal government to appoint a non-member (a serving or retired federal government BS-22 employee) as chairman of the Irsa with authority to exercise all sorts of autonomy through an expert committee.
The chairman is supposed to decide on any question on water whereas, under the Irsa Act 1992, a reference could be filed before the CCI by provinces if aggrieved by a decision. The CCI is constitutionally mandated to decide water issues with consensus.
What necessitated the caretaker government to amend the 1992 Act and undermine existing countrywide water management is anybody’s guess. When this amendment was planned, Sindh caretaker irrigation minister, Ishwar Lal, wrote a letter to the then-premier on Feb 2, informing him that after the 18th amendment, “water is neither a federal nor a provincial subject as it falls under the domain of the CCI which is the highest constitutional body to prevent, manage, or resolve intra-federal conflicts and issues on the basis of consensus rule”. He had urged him to drop this proposal till an elected government was in office, but in vain.
As a lower riparian area, Sindh has a significant share of around 23 per cent of Pakistan’s agricultural sector. Yet, it remains at a disadvantage regarding water distribution quite often — especially during the Kharif period when much-needed water is unavailable.
Due to questionable water distribution by the Irsa, the water shortages in Kharif are not equally shared. Sindh and Punjab bear the burden alone, without Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, which the Irsa exempts. The Kotri barrage regularly receives a 60pc to 70pc shortage of agricultural water supplies in almost every Kharif season.
“Shortage in Kharif is not only a direct economic loss for Sindh but also for Pakistan. Weather conditions help the sowing of cotton in Sindh by early March. Water unavailability, however, affects it as dams remain empty in this period. Cotton, being a major cash crop, has the potential to earn foreign exchange. Regarding overall shortage, Sindh has over and above average shortages in the river,” remarks Zahid Junejo, Sindh’s outgoing representative in the Irsa.
According to Zarif Iqbal Khero, a former secretary of irrigation and Sindh’s expert on interprovincial water distribution, even the Irsa has a limited scope within the provisions of the WAA. It can’t function at its whims to allocate water for new canal commands, propose amendments in the Act, or devise formulas other than those mentioned in Chapter II of the Accord and the 10-daily basis operating strategies approved by the CCI.
Interprovincial water distribution, historically, has been a bone of contention between Punjab and Sindh, with Sindh pressing for water distribution under the WAA; the Irsa has been ensuring the distribution of a three-tier formula since 2003. This issue has been pending before the CCI since 2018.
Former attorney general Anwar Mansoor, who led the committee formed by then-premier Imran Khan to look into the matter, had backed the “stance of Sindh on the three-tier formula” in its report before the CCI. But the matter was referred to another committee led by then-attorney general Khalid Jawaid, who subscribed to the Mansoor-led committee’s view. No headway has been seen since then.
In this formula, the Irsa ensures storage, deducts losses, and then distributes water among provinces but exempts Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa from bearing shortages, informs Mr Khero. “This formula doesn’t affect Punjab. It is already getting more than its share. Sindh ends up having a net shortage of six million acre feet — equal to Tarbela’s storage”, he explains.
Punjab’s position on the three-tier formula, says Irsa spokesman Khalid Idris Rana, is that the formula is guided by three different provisions of the WAA, ie points two, four and 14-B. Therefore, it has sanctity, whereas Sindh stands for point two-based water distribution. “The CCI now has to come up with a decision on it,” he informs.
To address Sindh’s water-related concerns, Gen Pervez Musharraf, through an executive order, made it mandatory that the Irsa’s federal member always be a person with “Sindh domicile”. This ensured two votes for Sindh — one of Sindh’s own members and one of the federal members— when voting on any matter relating to water distribution.
The arrangement worked for some time, and Sindh-based officials like Fazalur Rehman and Bashir Dahar served as federal members. Later, the matter landed in the Sindh High Court (SHC), which was moved by Ghulam Abbasi Leghari regarding the issue of his nomination as a federal member. The Sindh High Court (SHC) ruled in his favour, but the federal government questioned it in the Supreme Court. Since then, the matter of the federal nominee is also pending.

9,CORPORATE WINDOW: Patience wearing thin,The government’s wellbeing depends on prioritising and protecting its people grappling with falling family incomes and rising living costs.,"Pakistanis deserve better. It is imperative for an elected government to strive to enable people to live lives free from want, fear and indignity. Securing the next International Monetary Fund (IMF) tranche and striving for another longer, larger programme is important. 
However, history unequivocally demonstrates that a government’s success hinges on recognising its citizens as the purpose and agents of development. Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif’s government and his economic team, led by Finance Minister Aurangzeb Khan, need to clarify the vision of the ruling coalition in this regard.
The targets of a five-year economic revival plan — currently in development — encompass reducing poverty, creating jobs and improving revenue generation. However, the precise strategy for achieving these objectives remains to be seen, particularly for a resource-starved coalition government pursuing stabilisation policies under the close watch of the IMF. 
Historically, stabilisation policies have entailed economic hardships, which the people of Pakistan have repeatedly borne with the promise of future gains. Unfortunately, they have not always been able to partake equitably in the benefits of subsequent economic growth spurts. This dynamic partially explains the unpopularity and abrupt exit of past regimes despite the higher average growth rates recorded during their tenures.

The government’s wellbeing depends on prioritising and protecting its people grappling with falling family incomes and rising living costs

During his first week in office, Finance Minister Aurangzeb Khan shared his insights and economic priorities through interviews and media interactions covering various issues. Expressing confidence in the prime minister’s leadership, he pledged to continue the ‘commendable’ work initiated by caretaker finance minister Dr Shamshad Akhtar. 
Mr Khan highlighted the improvement in key economic indicators during the first quarter of the current fiscal year, attributing it to Dr Akhtar’s strict adherence to stabilisation policies. He emphasised that these measures have bolstered Pakistan’s position, enabling successful engagement with the IMF to conclude the review and secure the release of the last $1.1 billion tranche of the nine-month Stand By Arrangement.
He was hopeful that the successful completion of the current programme would pave the way for negotiations for a larger, longer programme during the IMF and World Bank’s meetings in Washington in April. Emphasising the importance of stabilisation policies, he referred to them as the ‘Pakistan programme’ for which he vowed to seek the IMF’s backing.
He mentioned plans for the digitisation of the Federal Board of Revenue to curb leakages, expand the tax base by roping in untaxed and undertaxed segments, committed to curtailing public expenditure by scaling back Public Sector Development Plan (PSDP), and propose involving the private sector in public works through adoption of the successful public-private partnership model used in Sindh. 
Rather than seeking loans from friendly nations, he aimed to persuade them to invest directly in the country. He commended the efforts of the Special Investment Facilitation Council and envisioned its pivotal role in mobilising local and foreign investment.
Mr Khan anticipates opening avenues for commercial borrowing from Gulf Cooperation Council banks once Pakistan enters a longer-term IMF Programme. With the economy consolidating, he foresaw an improvement in Pakistan’s credit rating, which would enhance its standing in the global credit market. He also discussed the possibility of issuing Panda bonds and expressed a desire to tap into the Chinese bond market.
He shared his intension to expedite the second phase of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor, which focuses on cooperation in the industrial, agricultural and technological sectors. Specifically, he showed keen interest in advancing operationalisation of special industrial zones.
He stressed the importance of export-led growth for sustainability and committed to providing competitive energy rates, particularly for the textile sector. He foresees substantial gains from freelance information technology (IT) work, with projected IT exports exceeding $3.5 billion in 2024. Additionally, he anticipates rice exports to fetch $2bn this year. 
The government remains steadfast in its support for agriculture and mining, projecting a five per cent economic growth rate over time if plans proceed smoothly. 
Privatisation is a priority, with plans underway to privatise Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and, eventually, power distribution companies. The finance minister also hinted at forthcoming reductions in both foreign exchange and policy rates. 
Notably absent from the discussion were the concerns of workers and salaried classes facing immense economic strain, grappling with dwindling family incomes and depreciating asset values. His stance appeared to lean towards the overly simplistic trickle-down theory, perhaps assuming that all members of society, regardless of class, gender, region or profession, would inevitably reap the benefits as the economy stabilises and grows.
Such unfounded assumptions have failed to materialise in the past, and clinging to them now could pose significant risks for a fragile government and a nation already teetering on the brink of an economic crisis. 
“It’s absurd for Shahbaz Sharif’s government to test peoples’ patience at this time. While direct cash transfers to the poorest are essential given Pakistan’s lack of a social security net, the working masses in the middle of the social spectrum are feeling the squeeze with falling family incomes and rising living costs. The government must provide policy support to them, along with caring for risk-averse bankers, barons and brokers,” remarked an analyst.
Speaking on the resilience of the Pakistani people, he noted, “Whether it’s rooted in faith, strong family ties or other factors, Pakistanis consistently demonstrate their ability to rebound from adversity. Despite enduring dictatorships, natural disasters, war fallout, the pandemic, terrorist strikes and governmental betrayals, they exhibit remarkable resilience. Not only do they persevere to survive, but they also actively engage in the political process. 
“Imposing higher fuel and power rates on citizens would be not only unjust but also risky. I firmly believe that the future of both the government and the country hinges on recognising the primacy of citizens and prioritising their wellbeing. Policies must give due consideration to their aspirations for sustainable, inclusive development.”

10,The resolve to reform is needed,Past attempts to spur growth without deep-rooted stabilisation ended in an external sector crisis.,"Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb says his singular agenda is to focus on the implementation of much-needed reforms and to negotiate a new larger deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to pull the economy out of the crisis.
“No debates, no waste of time — just a steadfast commitment to implementation,” the former Habib Bank chief told Dawn soon after being sworn in as the federal finance minister. In essence, it was a strong message that he would accord top priority to structural reforms.
Referring to the need for effective taxation of agriculture, real estate, and the wholesale sector, he said extensive work has been done regarding the implementation stage, and the designer and partners have already been finalised.
His first priority would be to plug leakages in the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) through end-to-end digitalisation to provide fiscal space for the government.

Past attempts to spur growth without deep-rooted stabilisation ended in an external sector crisis

Almost the entire 30 per cent jump in FBR tax revenue, so far, this fiscal year is attributed by analysts to high rate of inflation. The tax-to-GDP ratio is less than 9.5pc and Rs1.7tr is stuck in the legal process.
Praising the Special Investment Facilitation Council, the finance minister expressed confidence that it would aid in implementing economic policies.
The finance minister observed that GDP growth is directly linked to macroeconomic stability. Past attempts to spur growth without deep-rooted stabilisation ended in an external sector crisis.
The Economic Affairs Division (EAD) says that prudent external debt management coupled with strong institutional arrangements is necessary for the management of external debt and repayment capacity of the country.

For a longer IMF programme to be smoothly implemented, a gradual easing of its stiff terms is required to create fiscal space

Borrowings can be productive for the economic growth of developing countries as long as the economic returns are higher than the cost of borrowing funds, the EAD stressed.
Pakistan has not used development assistance prudently and effectively, with long delays in the execution of projects and cost overruns, making them financially unviable.
Analyst Shahbaz Khan says that with Pakistan’s debts now reaching approximately 91pc of the GDP and the economy declining rapidly, very little progress has been made towards economic independence.
Certain IMF experts have found during their research that development aid has a robust effect on growth. Simultaneously, non-development is mostly growth-neutral and occasionally negatively associated with economic growth. Much of Pakistan’s borrowings are for repayments of old debts or balance of payments support.
To avoid unsustainable debt, the government has reportedly decided that foreign funding will be secured only for priority sectors. Proposals for restricting lawmakers’ funds are under consideration of authorities and the centre aims to drastically reduce federal-funded provincial projects.
Pakistan has to come out of the mindset of doing patchwork to deep-rooted economic problems. Macroeconomic stability needs permanency, and for that, a larger and longer duration IMF programme is required. The GDP growth path is through macroeconomic stability, explains Mr Aurangzeb.
Economic literature demonstrates that it is normal for imbalances to occur in the process of economic growth and development. These imbalances need to be addressed promptly without allowing the issue to linger and become a serious crisis.
Durable stability cannot be achieved without production-oriented economic growth by maximising the use of indigenous resources to meet domestic demand and needs of the people through balanced and harmonised development of all sectors and regions and the removal of unacceptable levels of household income disparities.
For a longer IMF programme to be smoothly implemented, a gradual easing of its stiff terms is required to create fiscal space to spur economic growth, provide decent jobs and reduce poverty, ie to achieve growth with stability in a much shorter time. This is necessary to create a congenial political environment to avoid political risks/spanners.
It is also worth noting that Pakistan’s United Nations (UN) envoy, Ambassador Munir Akram, recently urged the UN to strengthen its commitment to supporting developing nations in tackling debt sustainability challenges. However, more significant is his observation that support should come through “innovative financing mechanisms.”
It cannot be denied that at least some of the IMF’s decades-old prescriptions have become outdated in these turbulent times.
As a professional banker, one hopes that the finance minister will be able to use his technocratic skills to quickly clinch a new and better deal with the IMF — secure more space in the Fund’s programme for sustainable and inclusive growth while avoiding the risk of foreign debt default.
The country’s challenges can be better addressed by persuading the IMF to adopt innovative financing mechanisms to suit the changing times.
Then, in case of unavoidable slippages owing to external or domestic shocks, or any genuine reason, the finance minister should be able to secure the IMF waivers to avert hiccups in the execution of the agreed programme.

Generation Z entered the workplace when there wasn’t even one to go to. Those years, marked by a global health crisis and social unrest, helped shape their views about life as well as work. Many of them were home as their parents’ workplaces closed, so they got a ground-floor view of what jobs really looked like, and they didn’t like what they saw: a work-life balance that left little time for life, management that seemed to not care about the mental health of their employees and an organisational structure that didn’t give workers much of a voice. Now, they have an opportunity to shape the workplace as they begin to enter the ranks of management themselves. While members of Gen Z — generally defined as people born sometime between 1997 and 2012 — now account for only 16.8pc of the total workforce, according to data analysed by ADP Research Institute, they are ascending rapidly: Employers promoted Gen Z workers into management 1.2 times faster in 2023 than in 2019.

Adani probe
US prosecutors have widened their probe of India’s Adani Group to focus on whether the company may have engaged in bribery as well as the conduct of the company’s billionaire founder, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. Investigators are digging into whether an Adani entity, or people linked to the company including Gautam Adani, were involved in paying officials in India for favourable treatment on an energy project, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing the confidential effort. The probe, which is also looking at Indian renewable energy company Azure Power Global, is being handled by the US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York and the Justice Department’s fraud unit in Washington, said people familiar with the matter. “We are not aware of any investigation against our chairman,” Adani Group said in an emailed statement.

Automated cars as offices
As automated driving gets closer to reality, car designers and technology companies are giving more thought to what people might actually do in their cars when they no longer have to drive them —including how they may use them to work. Prototype designers are experimenting with interiors that break all the rules. Once a car no longer needs a human driver, the room inside can be designed as a lounge or an office with a desk. Nearly one in five automobile buyers who participated in a 2022 survey conducted for consulting firm McKinsey said if they didn’t have to drive themselves, they wanted their car to be designed as a fully functioning office. The annual McKinsey consumer survey was conducted in December 2022 and polled 27,036 people worldwide.

Working from office
More and more workplaces are calling employees back to the office. If you started your career remotely, this may be a big shift for you. How can you manage it? 1) Reimagine your routine. Figure out what time you need to be at your desk, and then rework your schedule to make sure you’ll be there on time. This may involve waking up earlier to run a few errands and calculating your commute. 2) Get the right gear. For instance, you may need a backpack to carry your laptop to and from the office, or noise-canceling headphones to help you avoid distractions. 3) Pay attention to office culture. Observe how people act in meetings, how often your colleagues take breaks, and what appropriate work clothes look like. 5) Embrace the opportunity. Take advantage by interacting with your peers, your boss, and your coworkers regularly.

17,EVs — toys for  the rich?,"Complete EV transition is inefficient and unviable, except for a wealthy few","February saw some activity in Pakistan’s automobile sector, as four new vehicles, three of them electric, were introduced into the market. 
Pakistan’s automobile industry has always been highly criticised. High-priced, low-quality vehicles, delayed deliveries, black market premiums, lack of features, high import dependence despite decades of localisation fantasy, and protectionist policies, among many other issues, have persisted for decades. However, at this time, all has not been downhill. 
Instead, the nexus of the ‘big three’(Pak Suzuki Motor Company, Honda Atlas Cars Pakistan, and Indus Motor Company Limited) has been dented by the entry of almost ten new automobile assemblers and manufacturers. Consumer options have improved as competition in the sedan segment increased, while the market has also been flooded with compact sports utility vehicles (SUVs). 
Despite introducing more vehicles, automobile production remains stagnant, and restrictions on automobile and parts imports increased as economic governance worsened. 

Complete EV transition is inefficient and unviable, except for a wealthy few

The global automobile industry, meanwhile, has made leaps forward towards achieving the target of replacing over three-fourths of automobiles with electric vehicles (EV) by 2030. Many brands and countries have either already or are about to cease production of internal combustion engines (ICE) and move entirely towards EVs. 
Pakistan also launched its first-ever National Electric Vehicle policy in 2019 as part of its commitment to work towards Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11, which aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. Managing air quality in urban areas is a key factor in achieving SDG 11, and the efforts to shift towards EVs are expected to play a pivotal role.
However, it is important to acknowledge the ground realities. As per the latest Pakistan Social & Living Standard Measurement Survey, only six per cent of households own a vehicle in Pakistan while the country’s peak demand for new automobiles is only around 0.25 million annually. This shows that automobiles are not affordable for a vast majority, and with the continuous increase in prices of new cars, the demand for them continues to shrink.
In such an economy, dreaming of a complete or major EV transition in the automobile industry is not only far-fetched but impossible. EVs are not only financially unattainable for the public — apart from a select few — but also unviable. 
A major question pertaining to the EV transition is, much like the chicken and the egg problem, what comes first: the charging infrastructure or the EVs?
Commercial charging infrastructure will not be a profitable business unless demand increases through increased EV ownership. However, EVs will not be a practical option if commercial charging infrastructure is unavailable.
The lack of fast chargers, especially on intercity highways, makes EVs unusable for intercity travel. Meanwhile, long charging times at home and continuous electricity disruptions make charging a massive headache for daily intracity users. Similarly, even commercial chargers are faced with the continuous threat of electricity disruptions due to the inadequacies of the energy sector itself. 
In such a scenario, purchasing an EV seems like a realistic decision to use as a second vehicle for intracity mobility only. 
Consequently, EVs are an attraction for only the handful of households that have the capacity to spend at least Rs10m for a second vehicle.
Automobile companies in Pakistan have recently introduced hybrid electric vehicles (HEV), which have pulled automobile consumers towards them. With constantly increasing fuel prices, hybrid vehicles are a practical option for Pakistani consumers, reducing fuel expenditures. 
In past years, imported and even plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) have been preferred by consumers along with 660cc engine vehicles. This represents a clear preference for low-fuel-consuming vehicles in the country if options are made available. 
Some believe that Pakistan’s shift to EVs will begin with two-wheel and three-wheel vehicles. This view has some grounding, as over 60pc households in Pakistan own a two-wheel vehicle while 2.7pc households own a three-wheel vehicle used primarily for commercial or public transport purposes. Subsequently, the target population for two- and three-wheel EVs is much greater, but that too comes with its constraints.
Firstly, EV bikes cost at least more than twice the cheapest motorcycles available. Secondly, ICE bikes have significantly lower fuel consumption and, thus, are not a major expenditure burden for most. Meanwhile, EVs are not only more expensive but also have a low range per charge and require long charging times, mostly overnight. This makes commercial or public transport use of two and three-wheelers unviable.
EVs in Pakistan currently seem to be lacking in financial benefit to the user as well as any practical benefit for the shift. Instead, they restrict the possible commute and mobility options due to their constraints.
