0,Online land record services for expats to start next month,Facilities to be offered through foreign missions abroad.,"• Technical, operational details finalised
• Facilities to be offered through foreign missions abroad
• Set to start from Saudi Arabia, followed by other states
ISLAMABAD: The government has finalised technical and operational details for providing online digital land record services to overseas Pakistanis through its foreign missions abroad and is set to formally launch the programme next month, starting from Saudi Arabia, to attract foreign inflows.
This initiative will expand to other countries with large Pakistani diasporas such as the UAE, US, and UK within the next couple of months, followed by Spain, Italy, Canada, and so forth.
The scheme, initially to be launched jointly by the Ministry of Overseas Pak­istanis (MOP) and Punjab Land Revenue Authority (PLRA), with the cooperation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, will be inaugurated by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to attract investments and remittances from Pakistanis abroad.
“In order to facilitate overseas Pakistanis using information technology, it is proposed that the following land record services may be offered through the offices of community welfare attaches in foreign missions of Pakistan in countries with substantially large Pakistani diaspora (e.g. USA, UK, UAE & Saudi Arabia),” said a working paper shared with the Prime Minister’s Office.
The services included issuance of copies of record of rights (commonly known as Fard including for transactional purposes), e-Girdawari, e-registered deed, and mutation entry, as well as attestation of mutation and registration of deeds through the e-registration system.
The technical and financial details — process flows, related gadgets, fee and tax structure, etc — were finalised over the weekend at a meeting of stakeholders presided over by Secretary Overseas Pakistanis Dr Arshad Mehmood and partially participated in by the Ministry for Overseas Pakistanis, represented by Chaudhry Salik Hussain. Mr Hussain insisted that Spain, Italy, US, Canada, and England should be included in the initial phase following the launch from Saudi Arabia.
Under the agreement reached between the MOP and PLRA, 70 per cent of the service charges would go to the PLRA, which would provide most of the technical arrangements, including those in foreign missions, while the remaining 30pc would be the MOP’s share. Under the agreement, besides the existing government fees and taxes, copies of Fard, mutation, deed, or Girdawari would be provided to overseas Pakistanis at foreign missions for an additional fee of Rs10,000 each. Similarly, the entry and attestation of mutations and registration of deeds would be charged at the rate of Rs20,000 each.
The meeting gave final touches to the service-level agreement (SLA) among the stakeholders, covering all aspects of the transactions including geographic, operational, legal, financial settlement, and related issues, and expressed satisfaction over the preparedness of relevant agencies.
It was noted that PLRA had already been in this business for quite some time, thus legally and technically well-tested, but the only challenge would be to extend the node of the embassy in the value chain. PLRA is providing land record services through 151 Arazi record centres, 59 Qanoon-i-Arazi record centres, and 20 mobile Arazi record centres across Punjab. These services are also available to citizens at Dehi Marakaz Maals, in addition to limited services through Nadra centres, E-Khidmat Marakaz, and banks through the Centralised Land Record Management Information System (CLRMIS).
For operational purposes, the CLRMIS facility would be extended to Pakistani missions abroad, and copies of registered deeds would also be electronically available through the PULSE portal for registered deeds, as already available in Punjab.
The working paper noted that overseas Pakistanis currently face numerous problems, including fraud, impersonation, and adverse possession, in matters relating to land management, such as the sale and purchase of land. They bear a significant financial cost and the hassle of travelling to Pakistan to undertake land-related transactions. Alternatives to physical visits (i.e., power of attorney) are also risky and often lead to fraud, causing immense losses and additional psychological and financial burden for overseas Pakistanis.
The services would cover various scenarios, such as when both the buyer and seller are overseas, or one of them is abroad, or there are multiple buyers or sellers, with one or more of them being overseas.

1,Iran signs deals to boost oil production,The oil ministry and Iranian businesses signed deals worth $13 billion to increase daily oil production in six major fields.,"TEHRAN: Iran on Sunday sealed contracts worth billions of dollars with domestic companies to boost its oil production in the face of Western sanctions.
In a ceremony broadcast on state TV, the oil ministry and Iranian businesses signed deals worth $13 billion to increase daily oil production in six major fields.
Shana, the official news agency for the oil industry, labelled the deals as Iran’s biggest oil contracts in the past decade and said they aimed to add 350,000 barrels per day to the country’s daily production.
In October, Iranian Oil Minister Javad Owji promised the country’s oil production would reach 3.6 million barrels per day by the end of the Persian year on March 19.
In the new year under the Persian calendar, “production will reach four million barrels per day”, he added.
Iran’s oil sector suffered a blow in 2018 when Western sanctions were re-imposed, forcing foreign companies to leave the country, after the United States withdrew from a landmark deal designed to curb Tehran’s nuclear programme.
According to the oil ministry, Iran will be relying on domestic expertise to help boost the production in its western and southwestern fields, including Azadegan in Khuzestan province, on the border with Iraq.
Development contracts for Iran’s oldest oil field, Masjed Soleyman in Khuzestan, were also signed. First drilled in 1908, well No. 1 in Masjed Soleyman is the oldest in the Middle East.
The oil ministry signed the contracts two days before the 73rd anniversary of the nationalisation of the Iranian oil industry, then run by the British-controlled Anglo-Iranian Oil Company.
Last week, Iran said it has given $20 billion in contracts to domestic firms to ramp up production from the offshore South Pars gas field in the Gulf, which is shared with Qatar.
According to United States Energy Information Administration (EIA), Iran was the world’s seventh-largest crude oil producer in 2022. It also holds the world’s third-largest proven oil reserves, behind Vene­zuela and Saudi Arabia, according to the EIA.

2,Indian mob attacks foreign students over namaz,Stones hurled at 75 students in Gujarat University.,"NEW DELHI: Students from different countries were assaulted on Gujarat University campus on Saturday evening, allegedly by a group that did not want them to offer namaz at the hostel, The Wire said on Sunday.
It said some injured students have been admitted to SVP Hospital in Ahmedabad.
“Around 300 foreign students from Africa, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, and other countries study here at the Gujarat University,” Ahmedabad Police Commissioner G.S. Malik said, according to The Hindu.
“In Block A, around 75 foreign students, who live there, were offering prayers at their hostel yesterday around 10:30pm.

Stones hurled at 75 students in Gujarat University

“Some 20-25 people entered the hostel premises and objected to the international students offering namaz there, asking them to do so in a mosque. They argued over the issue, assaulted them and hurled stones.”
However, the police commissioner claimed, the situation was under control. An FIR was registered against 20-25 suspects and they would be arrested soon, the officer said.
According to Vibes of India, the violence was created by the mob yelling ‘Jai Shri Ram’ slogans.
“Videos showing vandalism and stone pelting have gone viral on social media. The clips also showed damaged bikes, broken laptops and ravaged rooms. In some of the visuals, people are seen throwing stones at the hostel and hurling abuses at the overseas students. In the visuals, the international students are heard saying that they are ‘scared’ and that ‘this is unacceptable’,” the portal reported.
Since there is no mosque on campus, the students had reportedly gathered in a hostel earmarked for foreign students to offer namaz at night during the month of Ramazan. The mob then stormed their rooms and broke their belongings.
However, Gujarat University vice chancellor Neerja Arun Gupta said violence erupted due to a “clash” between two groups. The police and government were taking the matter very seriously, she remarked.
The Ministry of External Affairs said it had taken cognisance of the matter and was in touch with the state government.

4,"Trump sees bloodbath, end of US democracy if he loses election",WASHINGTON: Donald Trump said on Saturday if he does not win November’s presidential election it will mean the...,"

REPUBLICAN presidential candidate Donald Trump gestures as he arrives for the Buckeye Values PAC rally in Ohio.—AFP

 
WASHINGTON: Donald Trump said on Saturday if he does not win November’s presidential election it will mean the likely end of American democracy.
The Republican presidential candidate, speaking to supporters in Ohio, made the claim after repeating his baseless assertion that his 2020 election defeat to Democratic President Joe Biden was the result of election fraud.
During an outdoor speech that was whipped by strong winds and punctuated by some profane language, Trump predicted that if he does not win the Nov 5 general election, American democracy will come to an end. “If we don’t win this election, I don’t think you’re going to have another election in this country,” he said.
Trump, who is under criminal indictment in Georgia for trying to overturn the result of the 2020 election there, this week won enough delegates to mathematically clinch the Republican nomination.
A general election rematch with Biden is likely to be extremely close. Earlier, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found the two candidates in a statistical tie with registered voters.
Salutes ‘patriots’ in jail
Trump opened his remarks in Dayton with a tribute to his supporters who are currently in jail for rioting at the US Capitol on Jan 6, 2021, as they sought to block certification of Biden’s 2020 election win.
Trump saluted and called them “patriots” and “hostages”.
Days after securing his position as the presumptive Republican nominee, the former president also warned of a “bloodbath” if he is not elected — though it was not clear what he was referring to, with the remark coming in the middle of comments about threats to the US auto industry.
He told a rally in Ohio that the Nov 5 presidential election would be the “most important date” in US history, painting his campaign for the White House as a turning point for the country.
“The date — remember this, November 5 — I believe it’s going to be the most important date in the history of our country,” the 77-year-old told rally-goers in Vandalia, Ohio, repeating well-worn criticisms that his rival, President Joe Biden, is the “worst” president.
Bloodbath
Criticising what he said were Chinese plans to build cars in Mexico and sell them to Americans, he stated: “They’re not going to be able to sell those cars if I get elected. Now if I don’t get elected it’s going to be a bloodbath for the whole, that’s going to be the least of it, it’s going to be a bloodbath for the country. That’ll be the least of it. But they’re not going to sell those cars.”
As Trump’s comment gained traction on social media, Biden’s campaign released a statement calling the Republican a “loser” at the ballot box in 2020 who then “doubles down on his threats of political violence.”
“He wants another January 6 but the American people are going to give him another electoral defeat this November because they continue to reject his extremism, his affection for violence, and his thirst for revenge,” the campaign said, referring to the deadly attack on the US Capitol by Trump supporters in 2021.
Among the issues, Trump is campaigning on is sweeping reform of what he calls Biden’s “horror show” immigration policies, despite successfully pressuring Republicans to block a bill in Congress that included the toughest border security measures in decades.
The rally came a day after Trump’s former vice president, Mike Pence, said he would not endorse his old boss for a second White House term.

5,Afghanistan highway crash leaves 21 dead,LASHKAR GAH: At least 21 people were killed and 38 injured in the early hours of Sunday morning when a bus collided...,"LASHKAR GAH: At least 21 people were killed and 38 injured in the early hours of Sunday morning when a bus collided with a fuel tanker truck and burst into flames in southern Afghanistan.
“Twenty-one people were killed... in a traffic accident between a passenger bus, a tanker and a motorbike” on the main highway through Grishk district in southern Helmand province, said Mohammad Qasim Riyaz, a spokesman for the provincial governor.
Of the 38 people injured, 11 were seriously hurt, according to the provincial information department.
The accident occurred in the early hours of the morning on a key highway that sees traffic between the western city of Herat through southern provinces to the capital Kabul, provincial officials said.
The passenger bus was travelling from Herat to Kabul when it first collided with a motorbike carrying two people, killing both riders, Helmand traffic management officials said, according to the information department.
The bus driver lost control and crashed with a tanker truck travelling in the opposite direction, sparking a fire.
The accident killed three people on the tanker and 16 bus passengers.
“When the bus hit the tanker, it pierced the tank, which burst into flames,” said one of the survivors, Ghulam Sarwar, admitted at a hospital in the provincial capital Lashkar Gah.
Images shared by the information department showed charred, twisted metal scattered across the highway and the crushed cabin of the tanker.

6,"Israeli strikes on Gaza push death toll to 31,645","German chancellor says planned Israeli assault on Rafah would make regional peace ""very difficult"".","GAZA STRIP: At least 61 Palestinians were killed in overnight Israeli bombardment taking the death toll up to 31,645 people, the health ministry in Gaza said on Sunday, as Israel was preparing to send negotiators to new truce talks in Qatar.
Israel’s security cabinet and the smaller war cabinet were to meet to “decide on the mandate of the delegation in charge of the negotiations before its departure for Doha”, the Israeli prime minister’s office said.
Its statement did not specify when the delegation would leave for the latest round of talks which comes after Hamas submitted a new proposal for a pause in fighting and release of prisoners.
More than five months of war and an Israeli siege have led to dire humanitarian conditions in the Gaza Strip, where the United Nations has repeatedly warned of looming famine for the coastal territory’s 2.4 million people.

German chancellor says planned Israeli assault on Rafah would make regional peace ‘very difficult’

As the flow of aid trucks into Gaza has slowed, a second ship was due to depart from Cyprus along a new maritime corridor to bring food and relief goods, Cypriot officials said.
On Saturday the US charity World Central Kitchen said its team had finished unloading supplies from a barge towed by Spanish aid vessel Open Arms which had pioneered the sea route.
The United Nations has reported particular difficulty in accessing north Gaza, where residents say they have resorted to eating animal fodder, and where some have stormed the few aid trucks that have made it through.
The head of the UN World Health Organisation, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, appealed to Israel “in the name of humanity” not to launch an assault on Rafah.
An evacuation planned by the Israeli army ahead of launching its assault was not a practical solution, Tedros argued, noting that Palestinians there do not “have anywhere safe to move to”.
“This humanitarian catastrophe must not be allowed to worsen,” he said on social media platform X.
 






Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has faced domestic pressure to secure the release of captives captured by Hamas since the start of the war, with protesters in Tel Aviv on Saturday carrying banners urging a “hostage deal now”.
“The civilians… need to demand from their leaders to do the right thing,” said demonstrator Omer Keidar, 27.
The Hamas proposal calls for an Israeli withdrawal from “all cities and populated areas” in Gaza during a six-week truce and more humanitarian aid, according to an official from the Palestinian group.
With the situation on the ground increasingly dire, aid donors have turned to deliveries by air or sea.
But air and sea missions are no alternative to land deliveries, UN agencies say. Humanitarian groups have cited Israeli restrictions as among the obstacles they face.
The United States, which provides Israel with billions of dollars in military assistance, has also grown increasingly critical of Netanyahu over his handling of the war.
Washington has said it cannot support Israel’s long-threatened operation against Hamas in Rafah without a “credible, achievable, executable plan” to protect Palestinian civilians.
The crisis has only grown worse in Rafah, said medical staff at a clinic run by Palestinian volunteers that offers treatment for displaced Gazans.
“We’re facing shortages of medications, especially paediatric medicines,” said Dr Samar Gregea, herself displaced from Gaza City in the north.
“There are a lot of patients in the camp, with all children suffering from malnutrition,” she told AFP, also reporting the “widespread presence of hepatitis A”.
Children require foods high in sugars, like dates, which are currently unavailable, she said.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that Israeli troops would pursue a planned ground offensive in southern Gaza’s Rafah that has spurred fears of mass civilian casualties.
“No amount of international pressure will stop us from realising all the goals of the war: eliminating Hamas, releasing all our hostages and ensuring that Gaza will no longer pose a threat against Israel,” Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting in a video released by his office.
Scholz opposes Rafah attack plan
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Sunday after talks with Jordanian King Abdullah that a large number of civilian casualties that would result from an Israeli assault on Rafah would make regional peace “very difficult”.
This is one of the main arguments he will bring to talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Neta­nyahu later on Sunday during his whirlwind trip to the region, he said.
The hastily arranged talks come after Israel on Friday approved a plan to attack the city on the southern edge of the shattered Palestinian enclave where more than half of its 2.3 million residents are sheltering after five months of war.
“Right now, it is about ensuring we come to a long-lasting ceasefire,” Scholz said after talks with Abdullah at his residence in the Jordanian Red Sea port of Aqaba.
“That would enable us to prevent such a ground offensive from taking place.”
Asked if he was prepared to exert pressure on Netanyahu to stop such an assault, Scholz said it was “very clear we must do everything so the situation does not get worse than it already is”.
“Israel has every right to protect itself… At the same time, it cannot be that those in Gaza who fled to Rafah are directly threatened by whatever military actions and operations are undertaken there,” he said.
Scholz did not directly answer a question about whether Germany would react to a large-scale Rafah offensive, for example by restricting German weapons exports to Israel. Germany has been one of Israel’s staunchest allies alongside the United States, consistently supporting it.
