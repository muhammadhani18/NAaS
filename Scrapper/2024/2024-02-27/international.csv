0,European farmers’ protests press ministers to act,They demanded action on cheap supermarket prices and what they say is unfair competition from abroad.,"BRUSSELS: Farmers on Monday blocked a border crossing between Poland and Germany, threw bottles at police in Brussels and gathered in Madrid to demand action on cheap supermarket prices and what they say is unfair competition from abroad.
Agricultural ministers from across the European Union pledged to do more to cut red tape and help farmers as they convened in Brussels to discuss the crisis in the sector after weeks of angry protests.
The 27-nation EU has already weakened some parts of its flagship Green Deal environmental policies, removing a goal to cut farming emissions from its 2040 climate roadmap. But farmers are demanding more.
“We’re here again in Brussels today as farmers because the European Union is not listening to our demands. Our demands are for fair revenue,” said Morgan Ody, general coordinator of farming organisation La Via Campesina.
“We produce the food and we don’t make a living. Why is that? Because of free trade agreements. Because of deregulation. Because the prices are below the cost of production. So we demand the EU to move on this.”  On the margins of the Brussels rally, riot police fired water cannon at protesters throwing bottles and eggs, while about 900 tractors jammed parts of the Belgian capital, not far from the cordoned-off area where ministers were meeting.
At a protest in Madrid, farmers from across Spain blew whistles, rang cowbells and beat drums, urging the EU to loosen regulations and drop some changes to its Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) of subsidies and other programmes.

1,Taliban execute convicted murderer by gunfire,The man was executed in northern Sheberghan city on a death warrant signed by Taliban chief Hibatullah Akhundzada.,"KABUL: Taliban authorities publicly executed a convicted murderer by gunfire in a sports stadium on Monday, officials said, the third death penalty carried out in Afghanistan in a matter of days.
The man — found guilty of a January 2022 knife murder — was executed in northern Sheberghan city on a death warrant signed by Taliban chief Hibatullah Akhundzada, a Supreme Court statement said.
The statement identified the condemned man as Nazar Muhammad and said his case  “was examined very thoroughly and repeatedly”.
He was shot five times in front of the family of his victim — including women and children — as well as thousands of onlookers in the stadium, a local provincial official said.
Since the Taliban’s return to power in August 2021, a handful of executions have been conducted in accordance with their government’s policy.
Akhundzada ordered judges in 2022 to fully implement all aspects of Islamic law — including  “eye for an eye” punishments known as  “qisas”.
Last week two other men were executed by multiple gunshots to the back in eastern Ghazni city on death warrants also signed by Akhundzada. According to a tally, there have now been five death penalties carried out since the Taliban returned.
Corporal punishments — mainly flogging — have been common, however, and employed for crimes including theft, adultery and alcohol consumption.

2,Sweden clears last hurdle as Hungary okays Nato accession,Ratification ends long military non-alignment of the Nordic country.,"BUDAPEST/STOCKHOLM: Hungary’s parliament approved Sweden’s Nato accession on Monday, clearing the last hurdle before the historic step by the Nordic country whose neutrality lasted through two world wars and the simmering conflict of the Cold War.
Hungary’s vote ended months of delays to complete Sweden’s security policy shift and followed a visit by Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson on Friday during which the two countries signed an arms deal.
“Today is a historic day,” Kristersson said on X.  “Sweden stands ready to shoulder its responsibility for Euro-Atlantic security.”  Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s government has faced pressure from Nato allies to fall in line and seal Sweden’s accession to the alliance.
 






Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg immediately welcomed Hungary’s move.  “Sweden’s membership will make us all stronger and safer,” he said on X. Stockholm abandoned its non-alignment policy for greater safety within the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Ratification ends long military non-alignment of the Nordic country

With Sweden following Finland into Nato, President Vladimir Putin has effectively achieved the very thing he sought to avert when he launched his war in Ukraine — an expansion of the alliance, Western leaders have said.
The accession of Sweden, which has not been at war since 1814, and Finland is the most significant expansion of the alliance since its move into Eastern Europe in the 1990s.
While Sweden has ramped up cooperation with the alliance in recent decades, contributing to operations in places such as Afghanistan, its membership is set to simplify defence planning and cooperation on Nato’s northern flank.
“Nato gains a member that is serious and capable and it removes a factor of uncertainty in Northern Europe,” said Robert Dalsjo, senior analyst at the Swedish Defence Research Agency, a government think tank.
“Sweden gains security in a crowd … supported by American nuclear deterrence.”  Sweden also brings resources such as cutting-edge submarines tailored to Baltic Sea conditions and a sizable fleet of domestically produced Gripen fighter jets into the alliance. It is hiking military spending and should reach Nato’s threshold of 2 per cent of GDP this year.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sparked a surge in support in Sweden for joining Nato, especially as neigbouring Finland, with which it shares strong historic ties, quickly moved to join.
“It’s been a long journey,” Josefine Wallbom, 23, a political science student, said in Stockholm.  “Me and everyone else was maybe a bit sceptical in the beginning, but now I feel like it’s the right decision.”

3,"English rivers in ‘desperate’ state, says report","LONDON: English rivers are in a  “desperate condition”, campaigners warned on Monday in a report highlighting ...","LONDON: English rivers are in a  “desperate condition”, campaigners warned on Monday in a report highlighting the growing impact of pollution on nation’s waterways.
The report by the Rivers Trust, based on official data, found that no stretches of river in England were classed as being in a good or high overall condition.
Nearly a quarter — 23 per cent — were classed as being in a poor or bad overall condition in 2022, it found, adding that the study  “doesn’t paint a very positive picture”.
“Very little has changed — let along improved — since the last data from 2019,” it said. Of 3,553 river stretches for which data was available, only 151 had improved and the number of stretches tested had fallen.
Leading causes of poor water quality were pollution from fertiliser or landstock and the discharge of sewage, the study found.
Rivers Trust chief executive Mark Lloyd said the report’s findings were  “dispiritingly similar” to the first study it released for England in 2021 using the 2019 data. Data is published every three years.
“For all the announcements, initiatives, press releases, changes of ministers and everything, we haven’t seen any shifting of the needle on the dial on a measure of health, which is showing our rivers are in a desperate condition,” he said. He called for more investment in monitoring to find the sources of pollution and stronger regulation to hold polluters to account.
“There’s a lot of money being spent around water and the environment but it’s being spent incredibly badly,” he added.
One anti-pollution charity, River Action, took the government’s Environ­ment Agency to court this month over the condition of one of Britain’s most important waterways, the River Wye. The charity claims the agency is allowing the agriculture sector to release highly damaging levels of nutrients from chicken manure into the river.
Large amounts of manure are spread over farmland surrounding the Wye to help crop growth but an overabundance can lead to an increase of phosphorus and nitrogen in the soil.

4,Indian runaway train takes 70-km journey,"Around 50 carriages set off solo from Jammu and Kashmir to Punjab, before being brought to a halt by wooden blocks placed on the tracks.","NEW DELHI: Indian Railways said on Monday it had ordered an investigation after a runaway freight train loaded with gravel travelled 70 kilometres (43 miles) without a driver.
Around 50 carriages set off solo, careering from the northern state of Jammu and Kashmir to Punjab, before being brought to a halt by wooden blocks placed on the tracks on Sunday.
“We have ordered an inquiry,” Northern Railways spokesman Deepak Kumar said, adding that no one was hurt in the incident.
The train, running at 100 kilometres per hour, was captured in a video that went viral on social media.
The incident happened after the train stopped at a railway station in Jammu for a crew change, local media reports said. But it began moving down a slope after the driver and his assistant got off. All road crossings on the route were closed to prevent accidents.
The incident is the latest to hit India’s creaking rail network, which carries millions of passengers each day.
However, India has invested huge sums of money to upgrade the network with modern stations and electronic signalling systems.

5,Navalny team says prisoner swap was close before his death,"Rights campaigner calls Russia ""fascist"" in court.","WARSAW: Allies of late Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny said on Monday that a deal to free him as part of a prisoner swap had nearly been reached when he died in prison.
The 47-year-old Kremlin critic died on Feb 16 in an Arctic prison after spending more than three years behind bars, prompting outrage and condemnation from Western leaders and his supporters.
Russian President Vladimir Putin  “was offered to exchange FSB officer and killer Vadim Krasikov, who is serving time for murder in Berlin, for two American citizens and Alexei Navalny,” ally Maria Pevchikh said.
“I have received confirmation that negotiations were underway and were at the final stage” after two years of talks between Moscow, Washington and Berlin, she added.

Rights campaigner calls Russia ‘fascist’ in court

“Navalny was supposed to be released in the coming days,” she added. Asked about the claims during a regular briefing, the German government spokeswoman declined to comment, as did the German foreign minister.
Krasikov is serving a life sentence in Germany for the 2019 killing of former separatist commander Zelimkhan Khangoshvili in a Berlin park, which German authorities say was ordered by Russian intelligence services.
Washington has accused Moscow of arresting American citizens on baseless charges to use them as bargaining chips to secure the release of Russians convicted abroad.
Among US citizens detained in Russia are former marine Paul Whelan and Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, both accused of espionage.
‘Russian regime’
News of a purported prisoner swap came as questions continued to swirl over the circumstances of Navalny’s death, which Western countries have blamed on the Kremlin. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the  “Russian regime” was responsible.
“His death is the consequence of a dictatorship in which people who rebel against the president and the government have to fear for their freedom and their lives,” he said on social media.
Leaders of the G7 nations called on Russia to  “fully clarify” how the Kremlin critic, who suffered increasingly deteriorating conditions in his confinement, came to die.
Navalny’s body was finally handed to his mother Lyudmila Navalnaya, more than a week after he died in a remote Arctic prison colony. His team said previously the Kremlin was trying to block a public funeral, which could turn into a show of support for Navalny’s movement and his opposition to Putin.
The Russian leader, who famously never said Navalny’s name in public, has not commented on the death of his most vocal critic.
Rights campaigner
Veteran  human rights activist Oleg Orlov decried what he called the   “strangulation of freedom” in Russia at a court hearing on Monday as  prosecutors sought to have him jailed for nearly three years for  discrediting the armed forces.
Orlov, 70, has served for more than  two decades as one of the leaders of the Memorial human rights  organisation, which won a share of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2022 a year after being banned and dissolved in Russia.

6,S. Korean government urges doctors to resume work,"SEOUL: South Korea called on Monday for trainee doctors to return to work, saying they would be spared punitive...","SEOUL: South Korea called on Monday for trainee doctors to return to work, saying they would be spared punitive actions if they went back to the hospitals, as protests over medical reforms entered a second week.
Thousands of junior doctors have resigned and stopped showing up to work as part of a spiralling action against government plans to sharply increase medical school admissions in the face of shortages plus a rapidly ageing society.
The mass work stoppage has resulted in cancellations and postponements of surgeries for cancer patients and C-sections for pregnant women, with the government raising its public health alert to the highest level over the fallout. Doctors are considered essential workers in South Korea and are restricted by law from striking.
The government has repeatedly claimed the mass resignation is unlawful, and has threatened to take legal action against those involved, or cancel their medical licences, Yonhap news agency has reported.
The government made a  “final appeal” for the doctors to return to work this week, interior minister Lee Sang-min said during an crisis management meeting. “If you return to the hospital by Feb 29, you will not be held accountable for what happened in the past,” he said.
Lee said the prolonged collective action posed  “threats to the lives and health of patients”. “The hospital was the space where your dream of treating sick patients was realised every day,” he said to striking doctors, adding:  “I hope you will return to the workplaces... and engage in dialogue for better medical environment.”

7,Jordan air-drops aid into Gaza,Jordan has conducted a total of 16 air-drop operations since the Israeli aggression in Gaza.,"AMMAN: The Jorda­nian army on Monday said it had carried out a series of humanitarian aid drops of food and other supplies into the besieged Gaza Strip, one of them by a French army plane.
Jordanian forces made  “four air drops carrying aid for the people of Gaza”, under the directive of Jordanian King Abdullah II, a statement said.
The operation came on the same day that two human rights groups accused Israel of further limiting humanitarian aid into Gaza — where the UN has warned of famine — despite an order from the UN’s top court.
Jordan has conducted a total of 16 air-drop operations since the Israeli aggression in Gaza. Previously announced air drops, including a joint operation with the Netherlands, sent medical and other aid to the Jordanian field hospital in northern Gaza.
Monday’s operation “aimed at delivering aid to the population directly and drop it along the coast of the Gaza Strip from north to south,” the Jordanian army statement said.
It comprised  “relief and food supplies, including ready-made meals of high nutritional value, to alleviate the suffering of the people of the Gaza Strip”, the statement added.

8,Palestinian premier resigns as pressure grows over Gaza plan,Shtayyeh wishes ‘extension of authority’s rule over the entire land of Palestine’,"RAMALLAH: Palestinian prime minister Mohammad Shtayyeh announced on Monday the resignation of his government, which rules parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, citing the need for change after the Gaza crisis.
Shtayyeh submitted the resignation to the leader of the Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority, President Mahmud Abbas, 88, whose office later said he accepted it.
The United States and other powers have called for a reformed Palestinian Authority to take charge of all Palestinian territories after the end of the Israeli aggression. Shtayyeh cited  “developments related to the aggression against the Gaza Strip and the escalation in the West Bank and Jerusalem”, which have also been torn by deadly violence during the war. He said he had first offered Abbas the resignation on Tuesday, but was formally submitting it  “in writing” on Monday.
Shtayyeh, 66, said in brief comments that  “the next stage and its challenges require new governmental and political measures that take into account the new reality in the Gaza Strip”.

Shtayyeh wishes ‘extension of authority’s rule over the entire land of Palestine’

He called for intra-Palestinian consensus and the  “extension of the Authority’s rule over the entire land of Palestine”. Abbas issued a decree accepting the resignation and assigned Shtayyeh’s government to continue  “temporarily until a new government is formed,” a statement from the presidency said.
Israel has ruled out any future political role for Hamas in Gaza, but has suggested that local Palestinian officials could play a role. Abbas, 88 is widely unpopular in the West Bank and has faced mounting anger since the Gaza unrest. Many criticise him for failing to more severely condemn the Israeli offensive there as well as the rising violence in the West Bank.
‘One man show’
Khalil Shikaki from the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research, a think tank, said Abbas had failed to protect his own people. “Now he wants to be present for the day after, but he didn’t do anything during the war,” Shikaki said.
“Most Palestinians are harsher than I am. Abbas is going to have a government that is loyal to him. He is a one man show.” On the streets of Ramallah, Palestinians sounded doubtful about the government change.
Basil Farraj said the Palestinian Authority  “did not achieve real results due to corruption, lack of security, and suppression of freedom and suppression of resistance.” Whether the government changes or not,  “it is appointed by American and occupation decisions,” another resident, Rula Abu Daho, said in a reference to Israel. Since 2007, the Palestinian leadership has been divided between the Palestinian Authority of Abbas, which exercises limited power in the West Bank, and Hamas which rules the coastal Gaza Strip.
Palestinian media reports suggested Abbas might name Mohammed Mustafa, an executive committee member of the Palestine Liberation Organisation — dominated by the ruling Fatah movement — to head the new cabinet.
‘New phase’
Mustafa has previously served as deputy prime minister and as a senior adviser to Abbas on economic affairs. International mediators are in talks for a ceasefire in Gaza, with Israel’s top ally Washington also discussing how a post-war Gaza could be ruled.
Palestinian analyst Ghassan Khatib, a former cabinet minister, said the resignation was Abbas’s way of showing he is flexible and ready for a government of technocrats  “functioning in both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip after the war”.
“If Abbas and Hamas are able to reach an agreement, it would be a new phase in our internal political scene and a significant one,” Khatib said. Shtayyeh defended his record and said his government had managed to do its work despite major challenges.
“The government was able to achieve a balance between meeting the needs of our people and providing services like infrastructure,” said Shtayyeh, whose cabinet took office in 2019. “We will continue to struggle to establish a state on the lands of Palestine,” he said.

9,Israel strikes deep into Lebanon,Hezbollah responds by firing 60 rockets at Israeli army headquarters in Golan Heights.,"BEIRUT: Israeli warplanes struck Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley on Monday, killing at least two Hezbollah members in its deepest attack into Lebanese territory since hostilities erupted with the Iran-backed group last October, sources in Lebanon said.
Underlining the risks of escalation, Hezbollah responded by firing 60 rockets at an Israeli army headquarters in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, the group’s al-Manar television reported. An Israeli army spokesperson said dozens of rockets were fired towards the Golan Heights from Lebanon.
The attacks marked an intensification of the worst violence between the heavily armed Hezbollah and Israel since their 2006 war, fuelling concern of the potential for further escalation and regional spillover of the Gaza unrest.
The Israeli army said its fighter jets had struck Hezbollah air defences in the Bekaa Valley in response to the downing of an Israeli drone, which Hezbollah said it had shot down with a surface-to-air missile earlier on Monday.

Hezbollah responds by firing 60 rockets at Israeli army headquarters in Golan Heights

The airstrikes hit part of the Bekaa Valley region near the Syrian border which is a political stronghold of  Hezbollah. The targeted area was some 18 km from the city of Baalbek, which is known for its ancient ruins.
The sources said Israel had carried out simultaneous strikes in the area. A Lebanese security source and a source familiar with the matter said two Hezbollah members had been killed.
Lebanese television station Al-Jadeed broadcast images of plumes of smoke rising from the area.
In a separate attack, an Israeli airstrike hit a car in the town of Mjadel in southern Lebanon, killing a Hezbollah field commander, three security sources in Lebanon said.
Israel’s military posted a video of the strike and said the target was Hassan Hossein Salami, who it said had been responsible for activities including missile launches directed at Israel.
Hezbollah politician Hassan Fadlallah said Israel had widened its strikes by hitting Baalbek and other areas, and was seeking to  “compensate” for the downing of its drone.
“Its aggression on Baalbek or any other areas will not remain without response,” he said in televised remarks delivered at the funeral of a Hezbollah fighter killed in recent days.

10,23 get jail terms in Uzbekistan over Indian cough syrup deaths,"The defendants, including one Indian national, faced jail terms ranging from two to 20 years.","TASHKENT: A court in Uzbekistan sentenced 23 people to prison terms on Monday over the deaths of 68 children linked to contaminated cough syrups produced by India’s Marion Biotech, following a six-month-long trial.
The Central Asian nation had previously reported 65 deaths linked to the medicines, but last month the prosecutors at the Tashkent city court updated the death toll and said two more people had been charged during the hearings.
The defendants, including one Indian national, faced jail terms ranging from two to 20 years. They were found guilty of tax evasion, sale of substandard or counterfeit medicines, abuse of office, negligence, forgery, and bribery.
Singh Raghvendra Pratar, an executive director of Quramax Medical, a company that sold medicines produced by India’s Marion Biotech in Uzbekistan, was handed the longest 20-year-prison term.
Former senior officials who were in charge of licensing imported medicines were also sentenced to lengthy terms.
The court decided that compensation amounting to $80,000 (1 billion Uzbek sums) would be paid to each of the families of 68 children who died from consumption of the syrup, as well as to four other children who became disabled.
Parents of eight other children affected by the drug will get from $16,000 to $40,000. The compensation money will be collected from seven of the convicts, the courts decision said, according to the Supreme Court statement.

11,"Iran’s uranium stock enriched to 60pc shrinks, but problems persist: IAEA",The stock has been brought below the theoretical threshold at which Iran could produce three atom bombs.,"VIENNA: Iran’s stock of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade has shrunk, bringing it below the theoretical threshold at which it could produce three atom bombs, but problems with inspectors persist, reports by the UN nuclear watchdog said on Monday.
Although the International Atomic Energy Agency has said Iran’s enrichment of uranium to up to 60 per cent continues apace, Iran diluted more than it produced in the past three months, one of the two confidential quarterly reports to member states said.
The IAEA reports did not give a reason for the so-called downblending of 31.8 kg of material enriched to up to 60pc, after which the stock fell by an estimated 6.8 kg since the last such quarterly reports to 121.5 kg.
“At the beginning of the year they decided to do a downblending … A couple of weeks later they did another downblending, this time with a smaller amount,” a senior diplomat said, adding that it was not clear why Iran had done it.
“Maybe they don’t want to increase tensions (with the West). Maybe they have an agreement with somebody. We don’t know.”  At the end of last year Iran had enough uranium enriched to up to 60pc purity — close to the roughly 90pc of weapons-grade — to potentially, if enriched further, produce three nuclear bombs, according to the IAEA’s theoretical definition.
It also has stocks of uranium enriched to lower levels with which it could, if it wanted to, produce enough fuel for more bombs. Iran denies having any such intention. Western powers say there is no civilian justification for such high enrichment.
Iran slowed its enrichment of uranium to up to 60pc purity last year in what diplomats said was probably the result of secret talks between Washington and Tehran that led to the release of US citizens held in Iran.
In November, however, Iran ended that slowdown and returned to its pre-slowdown production rate of around 9 kg a month from the slowdown rate of 3 kg, an IAEA report in December showed.
IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said last week the rate had slowed slightly since the end of last year to around 7 kg a month. The senior diplomat said, however, that Grossi was using an average over months and the current rate was 9 kg a month.
The secret talks have ended and there is little hope of reviving them with the Israel-Gaza conflict raging, diplomats have said. There is also little sign the United States and its allies are prepared to take action like pushing for a resolution against Iran at the IAEA’s Board of Governors meeting next week.
The reports said Iran has failed to provide the necessary cooperation on various pressing issues, such as the so-called de-designation of some inspectors that has drastically reduced the expertise on uranium enrichment the IAEA can deploy in Iran.
“The Director General (Grossi) deeply regrets that Iran has yet to reverse its decision to withdraw the designations for these inspectors. This is essential to fully allow the Agency to conduct its verification activities in Iran effectively,” one of the reports said.
