0,Power firms’ performance remains subpar: regulator,Cumulative financial bleeding hits Rs1tr as T&D losses rampant.,"• Cumulative financial bleeding hits Rs1tr as T&D losses rampant
• 160 fatalities were reported in 2022-23 led by 33 in KE system
• New connections denied
ISLAMABAD: All the power distribution companies (Discos) including K-Electric showed poor performance during 2022-23 against set targets, resulting in cumulative financial losses of about Rs1 trillion a year and adding more than Rs350 billion to the circular debt.
Based on performance evaluation reports (PERs) of the Discos including KE, the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Monday called for drastic structural changes in the power sector on an urgent basis to protect the industry from closure and consumers from affordable charges. “It is evident that the performance of Discos throughout this period remained subpar, and the expected power sector reforms were not achieved”, said the regulator in its PER 2022-23.
The performance reviews were based on data provided by the Discos themselves in the areas of technical losses, recoveries, load-shedding, safety measures, installation of new connections, complaint redressals and other technical standards like frequency and load fluctuations etc. None of the companies could achieve the parameters relating to the frequency and duration of power failures and complaint resolutions. In terms of safety, more than 160 fatalities were reported in 2022-23 led by 33 in the KE system. Of the total, fatalities included 52 employees and 109 other citizens.
“Given this ongoing poor performance, it is apparent that, under the existing circumstances, the current Disco setup is unlikely to be able to deliver the desired results”, concluded the regulator while noting that in light of these challenges, significant structural changes on a large scale were needed.
These changes could include the division of large Discos into smaller units and entities, the provincialisation of Discos, privatisation or corporatisation of Discos on public-private partnership mode, reduction in the influence of unions within the power sector, discontinuation of AT&C (aggregate technical and commercial) losses policy by using modern technology, outsourcing of high loss feeders, demand side management, and customer-oriented business approach.
There were some good performances here and there in some companies as well against evaluated targets but none of the Discos including KE could get close to all the targets. On average, the regulator noted that actual average transmission and distribution (T&D) losses across the power sector in 2022-23 stood at 16.38pc. Out of 16.4pc actual losses, 12.21pc were billed to the consumers and the remaining 4.2pc went to the circular debt. Another 13.74pc loss accrued on account of lower recoveries against billing. The direct combined financial loss of 30.12pc alone is estimated to have gone beyond Rs900bn.
“Unfortunately, the majority of Discos” could not meet targets in T&D losses, except those in Faisalabad (Fesco), Gujranwala (Gepco), and KE who have managed to keep their losses below the levels or equal to target. However, others exceeded these limits, which “contributed to a substantial loss of approximately Rs166bn to the national exchequer”.
Notably, those in Peshawar (Pesco), Hyderabad (Hesco), Sukkur (Sepco) and Quetta (Qesco) exhibited below-par performance. This was despite heavy investments allowed to address system constraints, reduce feeder lengths, automated metering etc. “It is disappointing that many Discos have been reluctant to undertake such projects…essential for reducing T&D losses and ensuring the efficiency of the power distribution system”.
Worst still, it was observed that the overall recovery went down in 2022-23; it remained 86.26pc as compared to 90.51pc during 2021-22, i.e., almost 4pc less than the previous financial year, the regulator said.
New connections
The regulator said it was “alarming that power demand is not being generated despite the availability of ample generation in the country”. Non-provision of new connections to the eligible consumers within the prescribed time frame was one of the factors contributing to this less power demand.
About 279,000 connections were not given to the eligible consumers even though they made payments due to which more than 1,100MW demand/load could not be served, which is a serious matter of concern as the ample generation capacity is available“, the regulator said.
The standards and targets required that more than 95pc of the applied connections must be given within the time frame but the performance of Gepco, Fesco and Qesco remained poor as they failed to meet targets by a “huge margin”.
Loadshedding
The regulator said it was an undeniable fact that Discos were deliberately drawing less power than their demand, despite being provided with an adequate quota on account of load shedding based on Aggregate Technical & Commercial (AT&C) losses policy, “which is in direct contradiction with the Nepra Act” and other laws and rules and the regulator has started legal proceedings against Pesco, Qesco, Hesco, Sepco and KE for this “blatant violation of Nepra laws”.
This violation has gone on in almost all Discos since 2013 and improvement in AT&C could not be achieved between 2018-2023. “The good-paying consumers connected on the same feeder also badly suffer and it is highly unjustifiable that they face collective punishment due to some non-paying consumers”.

1,UAE to help boost date palm production,Memorandum of understanding signed in Dubai.,"ISLAMABAD: The United Arab Emirates will provide technological support to Pakistan to help increase date palm cultivation in the country as Pakistan’s rich topography possesses immense potential in this sector.
For this purpose, a memorandum of understanding was signed in Dubai on Monday.
Pakistan’s Ambassador to UAE, Faisal Niaz Tirmizi, and General-Secretary of Khalifa International Award for Date Palm and Agricultural Innovation, Dr Abdelouahab Zaid, signed the MoU.
The ceremony was witnessed by UAE Minister for Tolerance and Co-existence, Shaikh Nahyan Mubarak Al Nahyan.
The Arab region contains the majority of the global area under date palm production — some 1.35 million hectares and contributes over 75 per cent of the world’s production of dates. In recent years, production has increased at an average annual rate of four per cent, primarily due to growth in area planted.

Memorandum of understanding signed in Dubai

The UAE is considered as a pioneer in the date palm cultivation, and it has agreed to help in promoting joint cooperation and sharing expertise between the two countries.
It will also provide an opportunity to Pakistani farmers to increase cultivation of date palm including through innovative ideas.
As part of the agreement, Pakistan will host the first International Date Palm Festival this year.
The memorandum is aimed at boosting up agricultural innovation and research related to development and promotion of various aspects of the date palm cultivation and related industry, Pakistan Embassy in Dubai announced in a press release on Monday.
The UAE is already assisting Pakistan in dates processing, and the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development has provided $6.36 million for setting up a dates processing plant at Panjgur.
The project area is 5,710 square meters and produces over 32,000 tons of dates per day.

2,"Solution sought  to rising debts, food insecurity",Commerce Minister Gohar Ejaz pointed to climate change and escalating geopolitical conflicts as some of the key factors deepening global inequalities.,"ISLAMABAD: Commerce Minister Gohar Ejaz at the 13th World Trade Organisation Ministerial Conference (MC13) underscored the relentless onslaught of crises that have beleaguered member nations over the past years.
Mr Ejaz’s remarks were delivered shortly after the inauguration of the MC13 in Abu Dhabi on Monday. The conference was presided over by Dr Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, the UAE’s Minister of State for Foreign Trade.
Commerce Minister Gohar Ejaz pointed to climate change, escalating geopolitical conflicts, devastating natural disasters, unmanageable debt burdens, and a surge in food insecurity as key factors that have deepened global inequalities and hindered progress.
These challenges, he noted, have been particularly detrimental to developing members such as Pakistan, further impeding their path toward development.
Mr Ejaz said there is a need for a fit-for-purpose WTO that delivers tangible solutions to address these crises, especially for developing countries including least developed countries. The situation calls for renewed discussions and appropriate decisions for tackling the challenges of development, widening income gaps and ensuring inclusive and sustainable growth for all members, he said.
The minister said the food security package under negotiation presents a vital opportunity to address this dire situation through a permanent solution on public stockholding among other tools. “We must deliver on food security at this critical juncture for the most vulnerable”, he said.
“I am encouraged by the constructive engagement of Members in Phase 2 of the Fisheries Negotiations,” he remarked. Delivering on the SDG 14.6 mandate at MC13 is crucial to ensure the long-term sustainability of our oceans and the livelihoods of millions who depend on them, he added.
Pakistan’s commerce minister said developments in digital technology are rapidly changing the face of global trade. The developing countries must fashion their economies underpinned by knowledge and technology with all the policy tools at their disposal to avoid falling further behind, he suggested.
However, since 1998, the moratorium on customs duties on electronic transmissions has denied the developing countries of an important policy tool to develop a digital economy and increase revenues, the minister said.
He said lifting the moratorium, with carefully calibrated custom duties, would create an environment that incentivizes technology transfer, attracts investments, and fuels digital industrialisation. “This is not about protectionism — it’s about empowerment and creating a level playing field where developing countries can thrive in the digital age”, the minister clarified.
The minister hoped for the conclusion of the discussion in the current year to have a well-functioning two-tiered dispute settlement system available to all members.

3,"WTO pushes for reform, warns multilateralism ‘under attack’",ABU DHABI: The World Trade Organisation pushed for reform at a high-level ministerial meeting in Abu Dhabi on ...,"ABU DHABI: The World Trade Organisation pushed for reform at a high-level ministerial meeting in Abu Dhabi on Monday, warning that economic headwinds and geopolitical tensions are threatening global commerce and multilateral trading systems.
The WTO’s 13th ministerial conference (MC13), scheduled to run until Thursday in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, is the first in two years.
The WTO is hoping for progress, particularly on fishing, agriculture and electronic commerce.
But big deals are unlikely as the body’s rules require full consensus among all 164 member states — a tall order in the current climate.
Speaking on the first day of MC13, WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said that  “multilateralism is under attack”, highlighting a need to  “reform the multilateral trading system” and boost international cooperation.
“Looking around, uncertainty and instability are everywhere,” the WTO chief said, adding that the world is in an  “even tougher place today” compared to two years ago when WTO trade ministers last met.
Okonjo-Iweala did not name countries, but tensions have risen between the West on one side and Russia and China on the other in recent years.
The war in Gaza and related attacks by Yemeni rebels on ships in the Red Sea have added to the challenges.
Reiterating warnings that signs of  “fragmentation” are appearing in the global economy, Okonjo-Iweala said trade volumes for 2023 likely fell below the WTO’s October forecast. Trade volumes may also not reach WTO’s growth estimates for this year, she added.
“If we fragment, it will be very costly to the world, both developed and developing countries,” Okonjo-Iweala said.
“Cooperation and trade are vital. If we didn’t have it, it would be very difficult for parts of the world to adjust.” 
‘Need to evolve’ 
The WTO chief’s push for reform was echoed by UAE Minister of State for Foreign Trade, Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, who said he hoped MC13 would serve as a  “launch pad” for necessary reforms.
“The world has changed. And institutions like the WTO need to evolve too,” European Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis said on Monday, adding that  “geopolitical tensions are on the rise. We are faced with crises wherever we look.” During the WTO’s last ministerial meeting, held at its Geneva headquarters in June 2022, trade ministers nailed down a historic deal banning fisheries subsidies harmful to marine life and agreed to a temporary patent waiver for Covid-19 vaccines.
They also committed themselves to re-establishing a dispute settlement system that Washington had brought to a grinding halt in 2019 after years of blocking the appointment of new judges to the WTO’s appeals court.
“Our challenge this week is to... demonstrate that MC12 wasn’t a one-off miracle,” Okonjo-Iweala said.
“I have seen the US engage more and I have to say they have been quite constructive,” she told a press conference, dismissing claims of an American leadership vacuum.
The WTO faces pressure to eke out progress on reform in Abu Dhabi ahead of the possible re-election later this year of Donald Trump as US president.
During his four years in office from 2017 to 2021, Trump threatened to pull the United States out of the trade body and disrupted its ability to settle disputes.
“There will be the US elections in November... so this is the last chance,” a diplomatic source in Geneva told AFP on condition of anonymity.
