0,Three remanded in custody over Lahore’s Ichhra Bazaar incident,Investigating officer requests custody of suspects to complete probe and identify accomplices.,"LAHORE: An anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Monday remanded three suspects in police custody over their involvement in the harassment of a woman in Ichhra Bazaar for wearing a shirt with Arabic print.
The Ichhra police presented the suspects — Muhammad Nadeem, Adil Sarwar and Altimash Saqlain — before the court and sought their 14-day physical remand.
The investigating officer told the court that the suspects had harassed the woman and incited people to kill her. He said the custody of the suspects was required to complete the investigation and identify their accomplices.
 
 

Judge Arshad Javed allowed three-day physical remand of the suspects and directed the police to produce them again on March 20.
The police had registered the FIR a week after the incident wherein dozens of religiously charged people had accused a woman of blasphemy in Ichhra Bazaar as she was wearing a shirt having Arabic calligraphy print. The mob threatened to kill the woman. However, a police team, led by ASP Sheharbano Naqvi, had rescued the woman and shifted her to a police station.
REMAND: A judicial magistrate sent a suspect on remand over his alleged involvement in the murder of Ameer Balaj Tipu, the son of the late Arif Ameer alias Tipu Truckanwala.
The Crime Investigation Agency (CIA) produced the suspect, Ahsan Shah, before the court.
Magistrate Sadaf Batool granted physical remand of the suspect to the police for five days with a direction to present him again on March 23.
Shah, who is believed to be a close friend of Balaj, allegedly provided information to prime suspects, including Teefi Butt, about Balaj’s presence at a wedding party in Chuhng where he was murdered by a hitman, Muzaffar Hussain, on Feb 19.
The alleged killer was also killed on the spot by the gunmen of Balaj.
YASMIN: PTI-Punjab President Dr Yasmin Rashid on Monday said the “season” of May 9-like arrests has begun again.
Talking to reporters during her appearance in the anti-terrorism court, she said the PTI workers were being arrested nine months after the events of May 9. “What are they (the government) afraid of?” she asked.
She alleged that the PDM parties formed the government by rigging elections, and baseless terrorism cases were being filed against the PTI workers.
She said PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, PML-N and Maulana Fazlur Rehman staged marches during the PTI government, but no one was arrested, adding that peaceful protest was the right of all political parties. She said the chief election commissioner should be punished for “stealing the PTI’s mandate”.
She said Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz spent a few months in jail, while PTI’s women were behind the bars for 11 months “without any trial or conviction”.
OMAR SARFRAZ: Former governor Omar Sarfraz Cheema has said his both arms had been frozen for the past five months, but the government was denying him medical checkup despite court order.
Cheema said he contracted a disease of gallbladder after eating substandard food in jail.
He said the court had issued orders for his surgery six months ago, but no action had been taken in this regard so far.
Earlier, the ATC adjourned the hearing of different cases against the PTI leaders and workers till April 1.

The PTI has also decided not to enter into any dialogue with the incumbent government until and unless real public mandate is returned to the party.
“No dialogue, no move on until the stolen mandate will be returned,” said PTI leader Shaukat Basra while speaking to media persons outside Punjab Assembly on Monday.
He said the PTI was in consultation with other parties and contesting these cases in state institutions, though without any hope, to get back the public mandate.
He said the president, prime minister and Punjab chief minister had robbed the nation of their mandate and ‘are ruling at gunpoint’. He asserted that the Form-45 elected representatives would soon oust the ‘fake’ rulers. He said Nawaz Sharif was defeated by Dr Yasmin Rashid and similarly Shehbaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz were defeated.
Mr Basra said the rulers were afraid of PTI founder chairman Imran Khan as he had shunned all efforts to convince him for a deal.

3,Money laundering case: Non-bailable warrants for Moonis’ wife,LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Monday issued non-bailable arrest warrants for the wife of absconding former ...,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Monday issued non-bailable arrest warrants for the wife of absconding former federal minister Moonis Elahi for not attending the hearing of a prosecution appeal seeking cancellation of their pre-arrest bail in a money laundering case.
Last month, a two-judge bench headed by Justice Shehram Sarwar Chaudhry had issued bailable warrants for the arrest of Tehreem Elahi, the wife of Moonis.
Ms Tehreem also failed to appear before the bench on Monday.
At this, the bench issued her non-bailable arrest warrants for a date to be fixed after Eidul Fitr holidays.
The prosecution filed the appeal seeking cancellation of bail of PTI President Parvez Elahi’s wife Qaisera Elahi, son Rasikh Elahi, daughter-in-law Zara Elahi and others.
A trial court had confirmed the pre-arrest bail of the Elahi’s family members in the money laundering case lodged by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA).
The FIA alleged that the sons and the daughters-in-law of former chief minister Elahi committed money laundering through a low cadre employee of the Punjab Assembly.
It said the suspects used bank accounts of Qaiser Iqbal Bhatti, a peon of the assembly, to launder money.
The agency said unexplained transactions of millions of rupees had been traced in the accounts of the peon and the children of Elahi. It alleged that the assets of the peon had been found beyond his known sources of income.
The FIA said the inquiry in question had no relation with any previous probe as it had been initiated against a government servant, the assembly`s peon.
Moonis has been declared a proclaimed offender in the case.
Omar Ayub: An anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Monday granted pre-arrest bail to the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Secretary General Omar Ayub Khan till April 20 in five cases related to May 9 riots.
The PTI leader, who earlier secured protective bail from the Peshawar High Court, appeared before the ATC along with his counsel Babar Awan.
Judge Arshad Javed allowed the pre-arrest bail to the petitioner subject to furnishing surety bonds worth Rs50,000 in each case.
Speaking to the media outside the court, Omar Ayub, who is also opposition leader in the National Assembly, said working relations with the government depend on the behaviour of the ruling coalition.
He said the PTI would see how its founder Imran Khan, his wife Bushra Bibi, former foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and other arrested leaders were treated by the government before taking any decision in this regard.
“Until our arrested leaders are not released, there can be no negotiations with the government,” he announced.
The opposition leader said the government was clueless about the country’s economy, therefore, there was no point in discussing the economic issues with it.
Mr Ayub said the ruling coalition had pushed the country towards bankruptcy earlier and now they were doing the same thing again.

It also wants to make efforts to change the image of the organisation by improving service delivery, completing the digitization of records, and ensuring a paperless working environment in a bid to serve the public at large in a friendly manner.
“I don’t want LDA to be known as an organisation making roads or bridges alone in Lahore. I want this organisation to be recognised as making Lahore a sustainable, green, clean, environment-friendly, and livable city under a 10-year plan I envision,” LDA Director General Tahir Farooq said while listing his priorities to take the organisation towards a most-needed objective/goal.
“Though roads and bridges are also the need of this city, my focus would be on improving the environment of the city,” he added while talking to Dawn on Thursday.
Mr Farooq said his focus would also ensure introducing a cycling culture, dedicated tracks, footpaths for pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists with the availability of green areas on both sides of the roads. According to him, encroachments, the display of signboards, and publicity material on roads, shops, public spots, green belts, and other places are not only damaging the city’s aesthetics but also causing several environment-related issues.
“Lahore should have clean drinking water for all, as it is essential for the health of the people. For this, the LDA can play a vital role,” he said. It may be mentioned that the primary contributors to air pollution in Lahore include vehicle and industrial emissions, smoke from brick kilns, burning of crop residue and general waste, and dust from construction sites. Deforestation for infrastructure development, such as new roads and buildings, also plays a significant role.
To a question, the DG said besides the removal of encroachments, signboards etc, the LDA would ensure effective traffic engineering to control traffic congestion in busy areas of Lahore.
“We have assigned Traffic Engineering and Transport Planning Agency (Tepa) — a subsidiary of LDA — to leave no stone unturned in this regard,” he maintained.
To another question about mega transport infrastructure projects, Blue Line and Purple Line, he said he would get a briefing on these projects soon and find out ways to execute these mega schemes.
“I know these are very important projects in terms of state-of-the-art transport facilities for the people of Lahore,” he said, adding that the shifting of the record related to LDA-owned housing schemes and other departments is also among one of his priorities. On the other hand, the Tepa on Thursday launched a city-wide operation against illegally displayed signboards in the Punjab capital.
According to official sources, the teams removed a number of signboards in various markets, roads, and prominent places. In the first phase, Tepa teams removed illegal signboards from several spots of Jail Road, MM Alam Road, Hali Road, Noor Jahan Road, Liberty Market Roundabout, and Mahmood Kasuri Road.
On the other hand, the LDA management held an important meeting the Town Planning Wing. In the meeting, chief town planners 1 and 2 gave detailed briefings about the working of the wing.
“The IT-based reforms in the Town Planning Wing are inevitable. In this way, a new era of information technology will be introduced in LDA,” DG Farooq said while presiding over the meeting. He sought installation of the signboards on all under-construction approved buildings so that all should know about details related to the approval of the building plan. He was of the view that there should be no debris on the under construction properties in LDA controlled area.
“All under-construction properties should be geo-tagged. Moreover, we must devise an action plan based on concrete measures to prevent illegal commercialization and illegal construction,” he sought. He said that all directors of town planning should also improve revenue generation by achieving their targets before the end of the financial year.

They say many wild animals enter Pakistani territory after crossing the border through rivers in areas such as Sailkot, RahimYar Khan, Narowal, Sheikhupura and Kala Khataaie, regretting that most of them are killed or hurt by locals.
Such animals need immediate rescue and care from the wildlife department, they say, recommending establishment of the proposed rescue centres near these border areas.
They cite cases where leopards entering Pakistani territory were timely rescued by wildlife staff as villagers were going to kill these beasts.
The officials says that because of development of housing societies at places away of from the cities, presence of reptiles like snakes and monitor lizards is also reported there. Therefore, they says, the establishment of wildlife rescue centres will be of great significance.
Wildlife experts believe that to successfully run the proposed rescue centres, the wildlife department will also require trained staff and equipment.

Reports said till date the data from 273 villages have already been digitized under PULSE while the project would to cover a total of 531 Mauzas.
Mr Haq mentioned the issues such as the lack of legal cover for mass-level partition, the necessity for special legislation for urban land partition and challenges related to exchange/Ishterak, right of ways in hereditary land to all new owners and resolving disputes under existing PLRA ACT laws.
He recommended additional human resources, provision of laptops/tablets for field revenue staff, sensitization of revenue staff regarding project targets, skill development of revenue staff over GIS systems, immediate reimbursement of expenses and some financial incentives for revenue staff to engage in hectic work, logistic and traveling support for revenue staff and involvement of civil society and media campaigns at the grassroots level.
Mr Ikram said where the landowners were not ready, the DC must be given the legal right to take suo motu of the land partition. Furthermore, he gave proposal to develop the partition software linked with the CLRMIS to streamline the process.

At a press conference along with LCCI President Kashif Anwar and seed breeders, Pakistan Hi-Tech Hybrid Seed Association Chairman Shahzad Ali Malik demanded here on Monday that the seed breeders assembled under the umbrella of PHHSA and genuinely involved in research and development of local varieties should be given representation in the recently established federal seed authority as a major stakeholder.
Referring to the measures for the agriculture sector Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in his first speech in the National Assembly, he said they supported the government resolve to control seed mafia fleecing the farmers by selling them poor quality products and said only hardly 150 out of 700 plus seed companies registered with the federal authorities were genuinely doing research work for developing their own varieties of various crops.
He said only rice and maize crops were performing well by meeting local needs as well as producing export plus thanks to the hybrid seed technology introduced by the private sector and three other major crops – wheat, cotton and sugarcane – also required hybrid seed to become profitable for the growers.
Mr Malik, who has pioneered hybrid seed technology with Chinese scientists’ help, said that rice exports registered a 600 percent increase from $462 million to $3 billion in 20 years through the transfer of hybrid technology and development of local seed varieties with better productivity.
Shafiqur Rehman, another hybrid seed breeder, said maize output almost doubled from six million tonnes to over 10mt when hybrid technology was introduced in 2019.
Mr Anwar demanded that the government should also include local investors in the initiatives being taken by the SIFC instead of reserving them just for foreign companies.
He also called for giving attention to climate change both by the government and the private sector so that farmers may be protected from ill impacts of erratic weather, unusually heavy rains and floods.
