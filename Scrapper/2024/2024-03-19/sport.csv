The win ends a title drought for the world number two that stretched back to last summer’s Wimbledon and makes him the first man to defend a championship in the California desert since Novak Djokovic won three straight between 2014-2016.
Alcaraz showed no ill effects from the ankle injury that forced him to withdraw from last month’s Rio Open but said it was on his mind coming into the event.
“Winning this tournament means a lot to me because the week before it began I had a lot of doubts about my ankle,” Alcaraz said.
“But once I stepped on the court for the first round it started to feel better and as I said after every match, I was feeling better and better. Really, really happy to be able to win this tournament again.”
In a rematch of last year’s final, Alcaraz started slow, spraying errors around the court to fall 3-0 down but raised his level to get back on serve and eventually force a tiebreak.
In the closely fought breaker, Alcaraz pounded a forehand that his Russian opponent could not redirect safely in bounds to hand Alcaraz the first set.
The Spaniard romped through the second set, raising his arms in the air and letting out a roar when Medvedev missed another forehand wide on match point.
Second seed Alcaraz smacked 25 winners to Medvedev’s 11 and was especially effective against his opponent’s second serves.
Medvedev, who briefly lost his temper with some fans in the Alcaraz-friendly crowd in the second set, was gracious in defeat.

“I’d like to congratulate Carlos,” Medvedev said during the trophy ceremony.
“It’s definitely your court, you like it here. Congrats to you and your team. You are doing a great job so continue this way and hopefully one day you can let me play a little bit better here,” he said. 
Meanwhile, the rematch of the 2022 championship showdown produced an almost  identical outcome, as four-time Grand Slam champion Swiatek dominated  the second set to seize her 19th career title and her second of 2024.
Sakkari,  ranked ninth in the world, battled gamely through the opening set,  erasing a break and saving two break points in the final game before  Swiatek delivered a blistering forehand winner to pocket the set after  44 minutes.
It would take just 24 more minutes for the Polish star to wrap things up.
She broke Sakkari at love for a 2-0 lead and rolled to the finish.
Swiatek,  who continued her strong comeback from a third-round exit at the  Australian Open in January, said her 12 days in the California desert  weren’t as easy as her scorelines might suggest.
She lost just 21 games and didn’t drop a set.
“I’m  really proud of myself,” she said.  “Even though this tournament looked  like, the scores, maybe I had everything under control, it wasn’t from  the beginning to the end so easy. So I’m happy I could improve  during the tournament.”
Swiatek became the 10th woman to win the Indian Wells title twice,  joining Serena Williams and Kim Clijsters as the only players to notch  two titles before turning 23.
On the other hand, Sakkari had managed to make the first set competitive but said that hanging with Swiatek in the rallies just wasn’t enough.
“You have to be ultra-aggressive playing her,” she said. “You  also have to take every opportunity,” she added.  “When you play Iga,  (Aryna) Sabalenka, (Elena) Rybakina, all the players ... you have like  two, three chances in the match and you have to take them. If you don’t take them, then it’s ‘ciao-ciao’ as I say.”

1,Barca outclass Atletico to climb second,"MADRID: Barcelona cruised to an emphatic 3-0 win at Atletico Madrid on Sunday with goals from Joao Felix, Robert...","MADRID: Barcelona cruised to an emphatic 3-0 win at Atletico Madrid on Sunday with goals from Joao Felix, Robert Lewandowski and Fermin Lopez, to move second in the La Liga standings. 
The hosts dominated the early exchanges, but Barcelona grabbed the lead in the 38th minute following a fine passing move with Lewandowski teeing up Felix for an easy close-range finish. 
Lewandowski extended the advantage two minutes into the second half as Raphinha stole the ball from Atletico’s Rodrigo de Paul to set up the Pole for his 13th league goal of the season. 
The visitors seemed untroubled by coach Xavi Hernandez being sent off in the first half and Lopez sealed the rout in the 65th minute with a towering header off Lewandowski’s second assist of the night. 
“It was probably the most complete game. It was a match similar to the one against Napoli,” said Xavi referring to their midweek win in the Champions League. “It’s an ideal match for our methodology and philosophy of play. We are Barca, nobody relaxes here. We are going to try to improve and compete for the two most important titles. 
“I am passionate and I want my team to win. For me the sending off was unnecessary and unfair but we have to accept it.” 
Barcelona moved above Girona, who were beaten 1-0 by Getafe on Saturday, in the table with 64 points, eight behind leaders Real Madrid. 
Atletico, who were reduced to 10 men in stoppage time following Nahuel Molina’s red card, suffered their first home loss of the season to leave them fifth with 55 points, one adrift of Athletic Bilbao in the last Champions League qualifying berth. 
“They were better. The second goal took us straight out of the game. Congratulations to them because they played a good game,” Atletico manager Diego Simeone said. “Nothing to complain about my players. They gave their all. Let’s stay calm and push for fourth place. It will be complicated and difficult.” 
Earlier Almeria ended a miserable streak by earning their first La Liga win of the season, edging Las Palmas 1-0. 
The Andalusian side went 31 league games without victory stretching back to May last season, but Leo Baptistao’s 14th-minute goal snapped their terrible run in coach Pepe Mel’s first match in charge. 
Despite winning on the road, Mel’s side are still 20th and 14 points from safety with nine matches remaining. 
Almeria’s 31-match run is the longest winless streak in the division’s history, but they are now level with Sporting Gijon’s lowest ever points tally from 1997-98. 
Victory ensured Almeria will not tally fewer points than Derby County’s 11 in the Premier League in 2007-08, which is the lowest total across Europe’s top leagues since teams started earning three points for a win.

2,Inter’s winning streak halted with Napoli draw,MILAN: Runaway leaders Inter Milan drew 1-1 with visitors Napoli in Serie A on Sunday after Matteo Darmian’s...,"MILAN: Runaway leaders Inter Milan drew 1-1 with visitors Napoli in Serie A on Sunday after Matteo Darmian’s first-half goal for the hosts was cancelled out by a late header from Juan Jesus. 
The result ended Inter’s run of 10 consecutive Serie A victories and moved them to 76 points at the top of the table, 14 ahead of AC Milan in second place after 29 matches. Napoli are seventh with 45 points. 
Leaders Inter still need 14 more points from their remaining nine fixtures to claim the Scudetto after their huge advantage on AC Milan was cut with their local rivals winning 3-1 at Verona. 
It was another disappointing result for Simone Inzaghi’s Inter following a painful exit from the Champions League at the hands of Atletico Madrid on Wednesday, as their league winning streak ended at 10 matches. 
“We’re disappointed how the match went... We were really good in the first half and at the start of the second and after that we dozed for the goal which cost us the win,” said Inzaghi to DAZN. “Napoli had more of the ball but [goalkeeper Yann] Sommer had basically nothing to do.” 
Inter broke the deadlock two minutes before the break when Alessandro Bastoni delivered a cross into the box and an unmarked Darmian finished first time. 
While Inter controlled most of the match, their usually watertight defence slipped up in the 81st minute as a Napoli corner was deflected to an unmarked Jesus who headed in the equaliser to grab a share of the spoils. 
Goals shortly before and after half-time by Theo Hernandez and Christian Pulisic put Milan two ahead at Verona before Samuel Chukwueze volleyed the away side out of sight with 11 minutes remaining. 
Sunday’s win moved Milan three points ahead of third-placed Juventus, who were held to a goalless draw by Genoa, in the race for Champions League football. 
Stefano Pioli’s side sit 11 points above fifth-placed AS Roma who without injured talisman Paulo Dybala beat Sassuolo 1-0 thanks to Lorenzo Pellegrini’s strike four minutes after half-time. 
And with Italy favourites for an extra place in the Champions League next term the seven-time European champions have a big cushion with nine fixtures remaining. 
“We played very well as a team and we created a huge amount. It was a really positive performance,” said Pioli to DAZN after his team’s fifth straight win in all competitions. 
Juve meanwhile continued their poor run of recent form with a largely uninteresting draw with Genoa in Turin. 
Massimiliano Allegri’s side were league title contenders in January but one win in their last eight matches has left them 17 points behind Inter. 
Juve were frustrated by their stubborn opponents and were booed off by home fans at both half-time and the final whistle, with striker Dusan Vlahovic sent off in added time. 
Atalanta’s match against Fiorentina was postponed on Sunday after Fiorentina director Joe Barone collapsed as the team were departing the hotel. The fixture will be rescheduled for a later date. 
Fiorentina said that Barone’s condition remains critical but stable.

3,History-making Laura Kenny retires,"LONDON: Britain’s Laura Kenny, the most successful female cyclist in Olympic history, anno­unced on Monday it was...","LONDON: Britain’s Laura Kenny, the most successful female cyclist in Olympic history, anno­unced on Monday it was time to  “hang that bike up”, giving up on her dream of competing at the Paris Games.
The five-time Olympic track gold medallist, who gave birth to a second child in July, had been targeting a fourth Olympic Games later this year.
“I always knew deep down I would know when the right time was,” the 31-year-old told the BBC.  “I have had an absolute blast but now is the time for me to hang that bike up.”
Kenny, who is married to Britain’s most successful Olympic cyclist, Jason Kenny, won gold medals at the London 2012 Games in omnium and team pursuit, defending her titles in Rio de Janeiro.
In 2021, at the Tokyo Olympics, she became the first winner of the women’s madison, with Katie Archibald, and also won a silver in team pursuit.
Kenny, who is a seven-time world champion and 14-time European champion, said she was struggling to balance family and sporting commitments.
“It’s been in my head a little while,” she said.  “The sacrifices of leaving the children and your family at home is really quite big and it really is a big decision to make.
“More and more, I was struggling to do that. More people asking me what races was I doing, what training camps was I going on — I didn’t want to go ultimately and that’s what it came down to.
“I knew the minute I was getting those feelings. Once I said to Jase, ‘I don’t think I want to ride a bike anymore’, I started to feel relief.” Kenny gave birth to her first son, Albie, in 2017, after which she returned successfully to the sport.

4,Leverkusen beat Freiburg to edge closer to maiden league title,FREIBURG: Bayer Leverkusen beat hosts Freiburg 3-2 on Sunday to stay 10 points clear at the top of the league...,"FREIBURG: Bayer Leverkusen beat hosts Freiburg 3-2 on Sunday to stay 10 points clear at the top of the league standings and edge closer to a first ever Bundesliga title.
Fresh from qualifying for the Europa League quarter-final in mid-week, Leverkusen showed no signs of fatigue as they earned a club record 22nd win in a Bundesliga season.
Xabi Alonso’s team, who also set a club record with their sixth straight away win, are on 70 points, 10 ahead of second-placed Bayern Munich with eight league games left to play.
VfB Stuttgart are third on 56, with Borussia Dortmund in fourth on 50 following their 3-1 win over Eintracht Frankfurt on Sunday. 
“It is always difficult to play against Freiburg,” said Leverkusen coach Alonso. “Their second goal injected some more emotions late in the game. We could not score a fourth but it was a deserved win with a good performance.” 
His team face West Ham in the Europa League quarter-finals next month and are also through to the German Cup last four where they host Fortuna Dusseldorf on April 3. 
Florian Wirtz put the visitors, who are unbeaten across all competitions this season, in front after two minutes with a scintillating solo run before Ritsu Doan’s clever shot in the 10th drew Freiburg level. 
Leverkusen put their noses back in front before half-time though, with Adam Hlozek tapping into an empty net after a mistake by Freiburg goalkeeper Noah Atubolu. 
Patrik Schick put the gloss on another convincing victory for Alonso’s team, with a sensational flick to a scintillating Leverkusen counter-attack. 
Yannik Keitel pulled one back for Freiburg but the damage was already done, leaving the hosts in ninth and with European qualification slipping away. 
Dortmund, who beat PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League last week to set up a quarter-final showdown against Atletico Madrid, fell behind to a breakaway Frankfurt goal by former hero Mario Goetze in front of the Yellow Wall. 
But the hosts struck back through Karim Adeyemi before the break. 
Mats Hummels’ diving header from Julian Brandt’s free-kick put Dortmund ahead for the first time in the 81st minute, with Emre Can’s stoppage-time penalty adding the gloss as they stayed a point ahead of RB Leipzig in the race for fourth spot.

The pilot phase was expanded to feature 24 national teams, who will play across three continents, FIFA said in a statement.
The Egypt edition — which will take place from March 22-26 — will also include Croatia, Tunisia and New Zealand.
Egypt will host New Zealand in the opening game on Friday, which will also mark the inauguration of a new 92,000-capacity stadium that the country has built in a new administrative capital, 45km (28 miles) east of Cairo.
Named Egypt Stadium, the venue is the second biggest in Africa, behind South Africa’s 94,000-seater Soccer City.
Tunisia will face Croatia in the other game, with the winners playing each other in the second match.
Although there are no trophies or prize money, the series is designed to benefit national teams that do not have the opportunity to play teams from other confederations, with FIFA set to cover travel costs.
Algeria, Azerbaijan, Saudi Arabia and Sri Lanka will simultaneously host other editions this month, although formats will differ.

6,Mbappe bags hat-trick as PSG hit Montpellier for six,"PSG, with 59 points from 26 matches, extend their lead at the top over Brest to 12 points.","MONTPELLIER: Kylian Mbappe scored his second hat-trick in Ligue 1 this season as leaders Paris St Germain won 6-2 at Montpellier on Sunday, securing their first league win in four matches.
PSG, with 59 points from 26 matches, extended their lead at the top over Brest to 12 points while Montpellier, with 26 points, remain one point above the relegation playoff spot.
Brest were earlier held 1-1 at home by Lille and are a point above third-placed AS Monaco, who were held to a 2-2 draw at home by Lorient. Lille are fourth with 43 points as they seek a Champions League spot, four points behind Brest.
 
 

Vitinha put PSG ahead at the Stade de la Mosson and Mbappe doubled their advantage midway through the first half, only for an Arnaud Nordin header and a Teji Savanier penalty to bring Montpellier back level at the interval.
However, a marvellous Mbappe goal restored PSG’s lead shortly after the break and Lee Kang-in made it 4-2 before the France captain completed his hat-trick.
Nuno Mendes put the seal on the victory late on, as Luis Enrique’s side ended a run of three successive draws in Ligue 1 and extended an unbeaten domestic record stretching back to September.
“I’m a lucky guy,” manager Luis Enrique told Prime Video. “Because I have unbelievable players with enormous quality and the spirit… to fight for every single game. We want to win the championship as quickly as possible.”
The defeat for Montpellier leaves them just a point above third-bottom Nantes, who are in the relegation play-off place and on Sunday sacked coach Jocelyn Gourvennec.
Jonathan David gave Lille the lead midway through the second half in Brittany with his 15th league goal of the season. However, that goal was not enough to win the game, as Uruguayan striker Martin Satriano poked in a late equaliser for Brest.
Struggling Lorient came away from Monaco with a precious point after Tiemoue Bakayoko headed in a 95th-minute equaliser.
Stade Rennais boosted their hopes of qualifying for Europe with a 2-0 win at home to Olympique de Marseille, as Martin Terrier put the hosts ahead in the first half and Benjamin Bourigeaud added a late penalty. Both sides are now three points adrift of the final European qualifying spot.
Japan star Junya Ito fired in a superb 79th-minute strike to give Reims a 2-1 win over Metz which keeps his club in the European picture.
Bottom side Clermont kept their outside survival hopes alive by beating Le Havre 2-1 with a brace from Muhammed Cham.

7,Paris Olympics area secured after attack on police station,"“Around 50 people attacked the police station in La Courneuve, mostly with mortar fireworks,” says police chief.","PARIS: Nine people have been arrested over a firework attack on a police station near major venues for this summer’s Paris Olympics, the French capital’s top police official said on Monday.
The Sunday evening attack in the northern suburb of La Courneuve came days after a teenager riding a moped was killed in a car chase with police, echoing a June killing that triggered days-long riots.
“Around 50 people attacked the police station in La Courneuve, mostly with mortar fireworks,” Paris police chief Laurent Nunez told broadcaster TF1.
Videos posted on social media showed groups of people firing a barrage of fireworks at the building’s facade. Police said the attackers also threw stones and Molotov cocktails.
Police responded with sting-ball grenades and flash-ball projectiles, used by riot police as an alternative to firearms. The standoff lasted for about 30 minutes, Nunez said.
The police station suffered no damage.
La Courneuve is located in Paris’ northern suburbs, in the Seine-Saint-Denis department that hosts Olympic venues including the flagship Stade de France stadium.
“We can tie this attack to the death of the 18-year-old killed on Wednesday, named only as Wanys R.,” Nunez said. “The young people clearly came from the neighbourhood where Wanys lived,” he added.
“We did this to demand justice for Wanys,” one young man told AFP on Monday. He declined to give his name, as did several other residents who came forward.
Nunz said the arrested suspects included seven adults aged 18-21 and two minors.
Two police officers were “slightly hurt”, he added.
Nunez said police reinforcements would be deployed in the area around midday on Monday, although further attacks were unlikely.
“The reinforcements will stay there for as long as necessary,” he said.
Wanys R. was being chased by police on Wednesday after refusing to stop for a check.
A video widely shared online showed how his scooter was struck by a police car, killing him and injuring his passenger.
The lawyer representing Wanys’ family on Friday accused the police of hitting him on purpose, while the officers’ own representative insisted it was an accident.
Also on Monday, authorities in Paris strengthened the police presence in La Courneuve near the Paris 2024 Olympics Village following an attack on a police station.
Asked about the danger of riots in northern Paris suburbs during the Olympics, Nunez said there was little risk of that.
“Police have a strong presence there today and that will be even more the case during the Olympics, when we will have a massive presence everywhere in the Paris region, and I have no fear on that level,” Nunez told reporters.
La Courneuve is just a few kilometres from the Olympics Village in the northern suburbs of Seine-Saint-Denis, an underprivileged department north of Paris, which hopes to get a boost from Olympics infrastructure investment.
Security is of paramount importance for French authorities with the Paris Olympics due to start on July 26.
Some Paris Olympics sites were vandalised during rioting in the summer of 2023 which was triggered by the fatal shooting of a teenager of north African descent by police.

8,"Tanzid, Rishad power Bangladesh to series victory against Sri Lanka","Sri Lanka won the toss and elected to bat first, only to lose both openers inside four overs.","CHITTAGONG: Rishad Hossain played an attacking innings of 48 after substitute Tanzid Hasan Tamim hit 84 off 81 balls on Monday, steering Bangladesh to a four-wicket win and a 2-1 ODI series victory over Sri Lanka here at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium.
Set a modest target after Janith Liyanage’s unbeaten 101 guided Sri Lanka to 235 all out in 50 overs, Bangladesh raced to 237-6 in 40.2 overs.
Rishad remained unbeaten on 48 off just 18 balls.
The hosts were in danger when Wanindu Hasaranga forced Mehdiy Hasan Miraz, the last recognised batsman, to give a catch to Pramod Madushan for 25, with Bangladesh still 58 runs away from victory.
 
 

But Rishad dispatched the first ball he faced over midwicket for six and did not look back.
He hit four sixes and five fours in his whirlwind innings before Mushfiqur Rahim, 37 not out, finished the game with a boundary off Maheesh Theekshana.
Tanzid led the initial charge, replacing Soumya Sarkar in the second innings as a concussion sub, despite Lahiru Kumara wreaking havoc with 4-48.
“Tanzid batted really well at the start. The way Mushi [Mushfiqur] batted, I think it helped Rishad’s innings,” Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto said.
“On a wicket like this, the bowlers showed a lot of character.”
Liyanage earlier staged a lone battle en route to his maiden century after Bangladesh made regular strikes, with Taskin Ahmed leading the way for the home side with 3-42.
Skipper Kusal Mendis (29) and Charith Asalanka (37) made a good start but lost their wickets before they could build bigger innings.
“I think we were 40-50 runs short but we bowled well in few overs,” Mendis said.
“Janith [Liyanage] batted really well, a couple of wickets fell in the middle overs, and he then batted very well.” Sri Lanka won the toss and elected to bat first, only to lose both openers inside four overs.
Taskin struck early, trapping in-form opener Pathum Nissanka leg-before for one, then dismissing the other opener Avishka Fernando for four in his next over.
Mustafizur Rahman, playing his first match in the series, removed Sadeera Samarawickrama off his first ball for 14 to leave Sri Lanka reeling at 41-3.
Leg-spinner Rishad made Mendis his first ODI wicket, also off his first ball of the game.
Mustafizur ended Asalanka’s counter-attacking innings before Mehidy claimed two back-to-back wickets to expose the tail.
But Liyanage held one end firm to ensure Sri Lanka batted out 50 overs, hitting Taskin over the cover for a four in the final over to reach his century off 101 balls.
Mustafizur and Mehidy claimed 2-39 and 2-38, respectively.
Bangladesh won the opener by six wickets, with Sri Lanka taking the second by three wickets on Friday.
The two teams will now play a two-match Test series, beginning on Friday in Sylhet.

9,Lang Park to host Brisbane 2032 ceremonies after review rejected,SYDNEY: The existing Lang Park stadium will host the opening and closing ceremonies at the 2032 Olympics after the...,"SYDNEY: The existing Lang Park stadium will host the opening and closing ceremonies at the 2032 Olympics after the Queensland government on Monday rejected the recommendation of a review that a new A$3.4 billion ($2.23 billion) arena be built in the city.
The Quirk Review was commissioned by the government to look into a plan to rebuild the city’s Gabba cricket ground to host the ceremonies and athletics at the Games as part of a A$2.7 billion redevelopment of the Woolloongabba suburb.
It reported on Monday, making 30 recommendations including the construction of a 55,000-seat stadium in Victoria Park, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported.
“I don’t agree with that recommendation,” Queensland Premier Steven Miles told reporters in Brisbane.
“When Queenslanders are struggling with housing costs I cannot justify to them, spending A$3.4 billion on a new stadium.
“I know that I said I’d do what the Quirk review recommended, but I cannot support the option they have landed on.
“(Lang Park) will become our Olympic stadium. This option will allow us to upgrade (it) to a standard to host a fantastic opening and closing ceremony.”  Lang Park currently holds 52,500 fans and hosts both rugby codes as well as concerts.
Brisbane was granted the right to stage the Olympics in 2021 under the International Olympic Committee’s New Norm process, a more targeted procedure aimed at saving hundreds of millions of dollars for host cities and increasing long-term sustainability.
Some 80% of the venues for the 2032 Games are already in place with the main stadium redevelopment and a federal government-funded A$2.5 billion arena to host the swimming the only two major construction projects planned.

Rana, who has taken 63 wickets from 15 first-class matches, joined fellow uncapped pace bowler Mushfik Hasan, who was called up in the squad previously but did not play a game.
Batsman Liton Das also returned to the Test side after missing the last Test series against New Zealand.
“We feel that the squad picked for the first Test has a very nice balance, our Test side is a fairly settled one with Nahid Rana being the only newcomer,” said selector Abdur Razzak.

11,United hope thrilling Cup win over Liverpool will turn season around,MANCHESTER: Manc­hester United’s stunning 4-3 comeback victory over Liverpool in extra time in the FA Cup...,"MANCHESTER: Manc­hester United’s stunning 4-3 comeback victory over Liverpool in extra time in the FA Cup quarter-finals on Sunday kept their trophy dreams alive and manager Erik ten Hag hopes it will also be the catalyst to turn around their Premier League fortunes. 
United’s final chance at silverware this season appeared to be slipping away at Old Trafford on Sunday as twice the home side needed to come from behind late on to end Liverpool’s chances of a quadruple in Jurgen Klopp’s final season. 
Amad Diallo practically blew the roof off Old Trafford when he netted the winner in the 121st minute after Marcus Rashford equalised eight minutes earlier and the 12-times FA Cup winners booked a semi-final spot against second-tier Coventry City. 
Ten Hag had been under rising pressure as his side sit sixth in the Premier League, nine points adrift of even a place in the top four and exited both the Champions League and League Cup early. 
But the former Ajax boss believes his side are on an upward trajectory having lost just twice in 12 games in 2024. 
“This could be that [pivotal] moment where the team can really believe, and the energy too, that they can do amazing things,” delighted Dutchman Ten Hag said. “And I think when you can beat Liverpool in the way we did, that you can beat any opponent, so it’s up to us to prove the point. I said this also on Friday [in the pre-game press conference] — and today we did.” 
United has been a dreary place on many nights this season, but Sunday’s battle will go down as a classic. 
“When it’s Manchester Untied against Liverpool, it’s one of the world’s best football matches. It is historical,” Ten Hag said. “I thought the first 35 minutes were the best I have seen from my team this season.” 
United’s young guns came to the fore as Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo shone before Diallo came off the bench to score just his second ever goal for the club. 
“The first 35 minutes we show again that the future of this team is very bright. There is huge potential. We have to get it out and get consistency.” 
United sped out of the blocks and were rewarded when Scott McTominay tapped home his ninth goal of the season after Garnacho was denied by Caoimhin Kelleher. 
Defeat was just Liverpool’s fifth in all competitions this season, two of which came with weakened sides in the group stages of the Europa League. 
Klopp admitted his side showed the first signs of fatigue from a draining schedule, but they did not go down without a fight. 
Two goals in three minutes towards the end of the first half turned the tie in the visitors’ favour as Alexis Mac Allister blasted past Andre Onana before Mohamed Salah struck for the 13th time in 14 games against United. 
United’s challenge was petering out meekly until Antony came off the bench to score at Old Trafford for the first time in over a year when he found the far corner three minutes from time. 
Antony’s equaliser set the fuse for a frantic finale as Liverpool hit the post through Harvey Elliott before Rashford missed a glorious chance even before extra-time. 
Elliott’s deflected effort put Liverpool back in front in the 105th minute, but Rashford made amends by drilling home to level at 3-3. 
And just as Liverpool sensed the chance to win it from a corner at the death, Garnacho broke clear and teed up Diallo to score his first United goal in three years. 
“The game got a little bit spicy, a little more special because it’s an FA Cup game and if you lose, you’re out,” United captain Bruno Fernandes said. “We know the rivalry between fans, we know how United fans wanted us to win the game to give us something to celebrate because it’s not been great for us.” 
Meanwhile, Elliott believes Liverpool’s challenge to win the Premier League and Europa League will benefit from the extra rest afforded by their FA Cup exit. 
Klopp admitted it was the first time he had seen his players struggle physically as they played their 46th game of a hectic season. 
And Reds midfielder Elliott said: “Now we can focus on other things, it frees up a few weeks for us. Not as many games any more so the lads can be fresh and we can recover properly and focus on the rest of the season.” 
The defeat was only Liverpool’s third in domestic competitions this season and Elliott doesn’t expect it to wreck the League Cup winners’ treble bid. “Our confidence is always there, it isn’t going to affect us at all,” he said.
