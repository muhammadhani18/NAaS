0,Supreme Court seeks ex-forest IGs assistance on F-9 tree cutting,"Court bars CDA from felling trees till next hearing; 7,000 trees so far removed.","ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court has sought the assistance of two retired inspector general of forest (IGF) to determine whether the Capital Development Authority’s (CDA) removal of trees and vegetation from the F-9 Fatima Jinnah Park in accordance with good practices and how best to proceed it with in the future.
Headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa, a three-judge Supreme Court bench through a written order issued here Monday directed the court office to dispatch the copies of its orders to former IGFs namely Mahmood Nasir and Syed Ghulam Qadir Shah. The court also ordered that until the next hearing no further trees would be cut nor the CDA would undertake further deforestation.
 
 

“We are greatly concerned with the manner in which the land has been cleared of all vegetation, not just paper mulberry trees,” the order observed, adding it would be appropriate to seek the assistance of the two IGFs in this regard.
The Supreme Court had taken up a notice under Article 184(3) of the Constitution on a suo motu after the Registrar of the Supreme Court put up a note before the three-judge committee constituted under section 2 of the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023 to consider whether proceedings may be commenced since reportedly a larger number of trees have been cut and there was systematic deforestation taking place at the Fatima Jinnah Park, F-9.

Court bars CDA from felling trees till next hearing; 7,000 trees so far removed

Besides, the citizens were complaining that the trees had been cut on the order of the CDA. They said the Supreme Court should intervene to prevent this valuable resource of the citizens from being destroyed.
The order stated that pursuant to Feb 27 directions in respect of the tree-cutting/deforestation taking place in the Fatima Jinnah Park, commissioners appointed by the Supreme Court had submitted their joint report and video recordings.
In case the CDA has any objection to the report the same be filed before the next date of hearing, the order said, adding the CDA has also filed a report in response to the questions raised and informed the court that it did massive plantation in the 1970s of paper mulberry trees (Broussonetia papyrifera), but later discovered that it causes pollen allergy.
Therefore, it was decided to remove all such trees from Islamabad, including from the park which has their largest concentration. Thus an ‘open auction notice’ was published by the CDA director environment inviting bids from contractors to undertake the removal of paper mulberry trees and other invasive species.
7,000 paper mulberry trees removed
As a result, Shah Nazar was selected as the contractor since he offered the highest amount for the timber to be removed, which was Rs5.2 million at the rate of 66.94 per cubic foot.
As per the CDA, approximately 7,000 paper mulberry trees were removed from different patches and packets of 55 acres of the park.
However, photographs and recording shows that the area has been denuded of all trees and vegetation, the report said adding when the court enquired whether the paper mulberry trees were marked, it transpired that the work was undertaken by the contractor himself.
It would be in the interest of the contractor to remove other trees too whose timber value is greater, the order said, adding that the CDA employed about 4,500 gardeners but they could not have undertaken this work because, as the court was told, the “CDA does not have the requisite tools to uproot the trees”.
The court also questioned the modalities of the contract, saying the “appears to have worked unsupervised”. All trees and vegetation seem to have been cut, despite the fact that they take years to grow and play a useful role, the court regretted.

This year, only two Sasta bazaars were established in the garrison city. 
When Shehbaz Sharif was the chief minister, the district administration used to set up 16 Sasta bazaars in the district with eight of them in the garrison city.
These bazaars were established at Haideri Chowk, Shamsabad, Committee Chowk, Khyaban-i-Sir Syed, Gulzar-i-Quaid, Chur Chowk, Adiala Road. But this year, only one such bazaar has been established at Chur Chowk and another at Shamsabad. 
A senior official of the district administration told Dawn that there was a plan to establish another Sasta bazaar in the city. 
He said that the divisional administration was yet to decide where the bazaar will be established. 
“There is a proposal to establish the wholesale market at Rawal Road but it is yet to be confirmed,” he said. 
On the other hand, the residents said mostly people had completed their Ramazan shopping of dry food items like wheat flour, sugar, tea, cooking oil at higher prices and now they buy fruits and vegetables on daily basis.
“The Sasta bazaar is established at Chur Chowk from where people living in and around the area will benefit. Residents of other areas have to purchase fruits and vegetables from markets at higher rates,” said Mohammad Majid, a resident of Mohanpura. 
He said people who work in Islamabad and other parts of the city had no time for shopping in Sasta bazaars located away from their houses.
Naseer Malik, a resident of Teli Mohallah, said that it was wastage of time to go to the Sasta bazaar at a far-away place to get some fruits and vegetables. Moreover, he said, the quality of food items in the Sasta bazaar was not maintained.
Meanwhile, Commissioner Aamir Khattak visited Ramazan Sasta Bazaar at Shamsabad and reviewed the sale of food items. 
Deputy Commissioner Dr Hassan Waqar Cheema and other concerned officials were also present. 
The commissioner inquired about the availability of food items from the buyers and directed the officials to further improve the facilities on the suggestions of consumers.
He also directed them to ensure the display of rate list at prominent places at the bazaar. 
Also, the officials and officers on duty should ensure that common man is being facilitated fully at the bazaar. 
He said the wholesale bazaar was an initiative to provide essential food items to the consumers at controlled rates in the holy month. 
He claimed that food items were not only available in the bazaar in abundance but were 20 to 25 per cent cheaper than the market. 
He said their quality was also being ensured.
The commissioner directed that representatives of all concerned departments should be present in the bazaar to help and guide the public. 
He said the performance of the price magistrates was also being monitored by Special Branch and the Urban Unit.

The construction work on the bicycle lane was launched on Fazl-i-Haq Road in Blue Area.
“The official inauguration ceremony of the Bicycle Lane Project (BLP) is scheduled to take place in the coming days with Prime Minister of Pakistan Mian Muhammad Shahbaz Sharif gracing the occasion as the chief guest,” said a press release issued by the civic agency.
It said the event underscores the CDA’s commitment to prioritising the health and well-being of Islamabad’s residents while safeguarding the environment for future generations.
It said the civic agency will oversee the construction of an extensive network of bicycle lanes spanning approximately 374 kilometres across various sectors and areas of Islamabad within the next 18 months. With an allocated budget of Rs2.4 billion, this project represents a significant investment in promoting eco-friendly transportation alternatives and reducing environmental pollution, it claimed.
BLP will see the integration of cycling tracks along highways, including those linked to the Purple Line Metro Bus project such as Khayaban-i- Iqbal, G-6, G-7, G-8, Green Double Lane, Jinnah Avenue and Red Double Lane. 
These dedicated lanes will not only facilitate commuters but will also encourage a healthier lifestyle among citizens.
“In addition to constructing cycling tracks, the project will include the establishment of 150 parking stands strategically located throughout the city. 
“These stands will offer citizens convenient access to affordable bike rental services with each stand accommodating more than 40 electronic bikes. As part of the initiative, the gradual phasing out of petrol-powered bikes will be implemented to further promote sustainability.”
Furthermore, the press release claimed that stringent measures will be implemented to ensure the safety and security of cyclists, including the installation of proper lighting arrangements and enhanced security protocols along the designated lanes.

3,"Azad Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan to get Daanish schools","Boarding schools to cater to thousands of ""bright students""; PC-I of Islamabad school ""to be approved soon"".","ISLAMABAD: As the prime minister directed the authorities to set up Daanish schools in Islamabad, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Azad Jammu and Kashmir, the federal education ministry on Monday expedited efforts to materialise this initiative at the earliest.
As per the PM orders, three schools each will be set up in Azad Kashmir and GB and one school will be constructed in Islamabad. According to a statement issued by the PM’s office, “These boarding schools will accommodate 1,000 bright students each from marginalised segments of society, boasting state-of-the-art infrastructure and equipment.”
 
 

It said that the focus will be on providing the best faculty to impart 21st-century skills, particularly in STEM and computer sciences, with admissions based on merit. The PM has instructed the fast-tracking of project designs for approval by the relevant authorities, with a preference for the construction on the state land.
In this regard, Education Special Secretary Mohyuddin Ahmad Wani contacted the chief secretary of Gilgit-Baltistan for PC-I of the project. “The AJK, GB and federal government are in close coordination for starting these schools as soon as possible,” he said. Speaking to Dawn, Mr Wani said that the PC-I of Daanish School in Islamabad has been prepared, which will be taken up in the Central Development Working Party’s meeting soon.

Boarding schools to cater to thousands of ‘bright students’; PC-I of Islamabad school ‘to be approved soon’

Asked about the timeline for the Islamabad project, he said: “Land had already been earmarked for this project in the Kuri area of Islamabad and the PC-I will also get approval in a few days. As per PC-1, the project should be fully completed by March 2026, he said, adding that the ministry would try its best to get it completed before the deadline.
According to the secretary, the federal secretary of education had been personally supervising the paperwork for the PC-I which would be approved in the next few days before hiring a consultant/contractor etc.
 
 

Meanwhile, GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan in a statement appreciated Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for deciding to set up Daanish schools in GB. He termed this project highly beneficial for underprivileged students of areas of GB, particularly those living in far-flung areas.
Last week, the Capital Development Authority (CDA) approved a summary to set up this school in the Kuri area of the capital.
Daanish schools provide free quality education for underprivileged children in Punjab and this project was started by then chief minister Shehbaz Sharif in 2010. These schools offer boarding facilities to students. According to sources, this project is close to the heart of PM Shehbaz and he wanted to bring this education facility to Islamabad as well.
Punjab, which is also ruled by the PML-N, is also interested in establishing this school in the federal territory, apparently to help the “underprivileged and talented students” of the capital.
As of yet, there is no decision on how the school will be run. Sources said the decision about whether a new authority would be established for this school or it would be run by the Punjab Daanish schools authority has yet to be taken.
In January last year, the federal government announced the establishment of a Daanish School and Center of Excellence Authority in Balochistan to materialise Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s vision of imparting free-of-charge education to poor children of the province.

11,High court reserves judgement on ‘bogus’ FIRs against family,Petition was filed by CDA officer after judicial magistrate absolved Sialkot-based family of charges,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) reserved its decision on a petition related to registration of bogus First Information Reports (FIRs) against a family by a director of Capital Development Authority (CDA).
IHC Justice Babar Sattar was hearing the petition filed by CDA’s Director Iftikhar Ali Haideri against the order of a judicial magistrate absolving the Sialkot-based family without handing over their custody to police on physical remand. 
During the hearing last week, the court took notice of a report filed by the superintendent of police (SP) Special Investigation Unit (SIU) Rukhsar Mehdi which accused Mr Haideri of using his influence to register bogus FIRs against the family to settle a personal score.
As per the report, the FIRs were registered in three police stations in Islamabad after a brawl between Haideri’s brother and the family in Sialkot. A woman had approached the police against the registration of the FIRs against her husband, son, grandson and a daughter in the Sumbal, Banigala and Industrial Area police stations of Islamabad and Sialkot. SP Mehdi initiated the probe and in his report termed the registration of criminal cases against the family a “mockery of the justice system.”

Petition was filed by CDA officer after judicial magistrate absolved Sialkot-based family of charges

The report added, “There is one government officer Iftikhar Ali Haideri [who] has played havoc with the entire justice system.” 
As per the report, Mr Haideri’s brother Qamar Abbas had a brawl with the applicant’s family in Sialkot and since then the officer “was trying to settle his score by twisting the long arm of law.”
The report stated, “This entire plot hatched by this government officer is shameless but the height of the shame is when an innocent young lady got arrested by the Gujrat police and later on by the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) police in false and criminal cases on the day she was to wed.”
The report recommended that the “officer Mr Iftikhar Ali Haideri must answer for whatever dirty games he played”.
The investigation found that “the FIRs of Sumbal and Banigala police stations are false whereas the implication of the victims in Industrial Area police station is a lie.” The report recommended that “the said government officer must face the law for violating it so ruthlessly.”
Mr Mehdi appeared before the court and stated that he was assigned the inquiry into the matter by the higher authorities.
He said that during the course of inquiry, he recorded statements of the relevant persons and perused the available record.
The court asked as to why he did not initiate further proceeding against the CDA’s officer? Mr Mehdi replied that it was beyond his mandate as he was assigned to probe the matter only.
Justice Sattar sought the relevant record and reserved his decision.

Moreover considering the shortage of the human resource, ministry has also banned extended leaves of doctors.
Secretary Health Iftikhar Ali Shallwani  has emphasised the importance of ensuring the highest standards of healthcare delivery and availability of doctors and medicine within hospitals.
He was chairing a meeting concerning administrative, financial matters, and the performance assessment of Pims. The meeting was attended by the officials from ministry and hospital.
According to a statement, the secretary was briefed by Pims officials on the pressing issue of human resource shortages affecting the performance of the hospital. It was also brought to his notice that the problem was exacerbated by the overwhelming patients load from not only Islamabad but from other regions across the country.
In response, Iftikhar Ali Shallwani directed the administration of Pims to accelerate the recruitment process for personnel to address the growing patient influx effectively.
Furthermore, the secretary was apprised that 107 vacancies for professors, associate professors, and assistant professors had already been advertised, with efforts underway to fill 405 positions for nurses and medical officers.
The Secretary expressed his concerns regarding disciplinary matters concerning doctors. He said that private practice of doctors employed by Government should be discouraged. He underscored the importance of curbing overseas travel on sponsored visits for doctors. He said that the doctors should provide affidavits confirming that any foreign visits were personally sponsored. This would ensure accountability and dedication of doctors to their professional duties, he added.
He instructed the Pims administration to ensure efficient healthcare provision and maintain professional conduct within the medical fraternity. He emphasised the necessity of rigorously enforcing disciplinary measures within the hospital’s workforce. He instructed the hospital administration to submit a comprehensive report detailing actions taken against employees found to be in breach of disciplinary protocols.
The secretary issued clear directives to the Pims administration to intensify their efforts to enhance patient facilitation during the sacred month of Ramazan.

He said that corneal contributions had the potential to give a fresh lease of life to thousands of people, as 9,000 people were on the trust’s waiting list for corneal transplants.
He noted that the trust receives 800 corneal donations annually and has increased its capacity accordingly. 
However, the majority on the waiting list have to wait for years to get their vision restored.
According to Rehmat Khan, there is a significant disparity between supply and demand of cornea in Pakistan and throughout the world, with corneal blindness accounting for up to 15pc of all cases of blindness.
He informed the media representatives that Americans provide corneal donations for Pakistani patients because residents are reluctant to volunteer for this charitable endeavour. 
According to him, in August 2018, the first-ever eye bank was formed at the trust’s Rawalpindi premises with the assistance of the American organisation Eversight. There, individuals can submit their wills to donate corneas.
He said because corneal donations in the country are so few, 53pc of eye patients lack access to donated corneas; as a result, corneas must be imported from the US and Sri Lanka. 
A cornea is one of the simplest tissues to transplant because the donor and recipient do not need to match.
He said it is a bloodless tissue that absorbs oxygen straight from the atmosphere. 
He went on to say that corneas from the elderly can be removed and transplanted into the eyes of much younger people. According to Rehmat Khan, the Al-Shifa Trust has begun corneal transplants at its Sukkar hospital in addition to its Rawalpindi facility.
In Sukkar Hospital, 50 corneal transplants have been completed successfully to date free of cost. Eighty percent of all surgeries performed at the Al-Shifa eye hospitals in Rawalpindi, Sukkar, Kohat, Muzaffarabad, and Chakwal are free of charge. So far, the trust has performed over one million different eye surgeries.

16,"World Bank mission reviews performance of ongoing agri projects in Pindi, Chakwal","Farmers provided 75pc subsidy on modern irrigation systems and other schemes under Priat project, delegation told.","RAWALPINDI: The World Bank mission visited Rawalpindi and Chakwal to review the performance of the ongoing projects of the Agriculture Department, Punjab, that are being executed with the assistance of the World Bank.
Director General of Agriculture (Water Management) Punjab Malik Mohammad Akram accompanied by the World Bank mission headed by Senior Agricultural Specialist Maryiam Chaudron and Senior Water Resources Specialist Francois Onimus, visited the ongoing projects.
On this occasion, Mr Akram briefed the delegation that with the support of the World Bank, the Punjab Irrigated-Agricultural Productivity Improvement Project (PIPIP) was successfully completed, through which drip and sprinkler irrigation systems were installed on an area of 20,649 acres in Rawalpindi Division and a solar system was also installed.
Apart from this, as many as 1193 lift action schemes and 562 water ponds were constructed.
In the Potohar region, this project produced two important results, whereas Rawalpindi Division is a rainfed area where the availability of water to crops depends only on rainfall. The PIPIP project promoted irrigated agriculture in this region.
This project helped to increase the area of gardens; besides, drip irrigation systems helped to make olive cultivation successful in this region, and under this scheme, a 60% subsidy was given to farmers.
After the success of this project, another project was launched last year with the support of the World Bank, which is called Punjab Resilient and Inclusive Agriculture Transformation (PRIAT).
In this scheme, farmers have been provided a 75% subsidy on modern irrigation systems and other schemes; an increase in the production of agricultural products from farmers’ crops is also a part of this project.
The PRIAT project will have a very positive impact on the economy of farmers and help reduce unemployment.
This year, 3360 acres of land in Rawalpindi Division will be brought under irrigation.
The World Bank mission appreciated the effort of Agriculture Department Punjab Water Management for successfully completing the PIPIP project.
