0,Shelling kills  four in Russian border region,"The attacks have drawn anger and frustration from the Kremlin, which has been keen to downplay the impacts of its offensive in Ukraine.","MOSCOW: Ukrainian shelling killed four people near Russia’s border city of Belgorod on Monday, bringing the total number of dead in the region since last week to 15, authorities said.
Attacks on Russian territory have intensified in recent days as Russia wraps up elections that could see President Vladimir Putin in power until at least 2030.
“Four people were killed in the village of Nikolskoye as a result of a direct shell hit on a private residential house,” governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said.
“Rescuers recovered the bodies of two more women from under the rubble,” Gladkov said, after posting previously that a 17-year-old boy and a man died of their wounds.
Combined with previous figures released by Belgorod’s health authorities, at least 15 people have been killed across the region since last Tuesday.
The attacks have drawn anger and frustration from the Kremlin, which has been keen to downplay the impacts of its offensive in Ukraine on the Russian population.
Russia’s border regions were targeted last week by a series of brazen cross-border raids by pro-Ukrainian militias, who claimed to have seized control of a village.
In a press conference after his re-election victory, Putin said he was considering creating a  “sanitary zone” in Ukrainian territory adjoining Belgorod to prevent further attacks.
“I do not rule out that, bearing in mind the tragic events taking place today, we will be forced at some point, when we deem it appropriate, to create a certain ‘sanitary zone’ on today’s territories subordinate to the Kyiv regime,” Putin said.

1,"AI poses threat to democracy, summit told",South Korean president says countries have duty to share experiences and wisdom so AI and tech could be employed to promote democracy.,"SEOUL: South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol on Monday called fake news and disinformation based on AI and digital technology threats to democracy, as some officials attending a global summit accused Russia and China of conducting malicious propaganda campaigns.  
Speaking at the opening of the Summit for Democracy in Seoul, Yoon said countries had a duty to share experiences and wisdom so that artificial intelligence and technology could be employed to promote democracy. 
“Fake news and disinformation based on artificial intelligence and digital technology not only violates individual freedom and human rights but also threatens democratic systems,” Yoon said. 
South Korea is hosting the third Summit for Democracy conference, an initiative of US President Joe Biden aimed at discussing ways to stop democratic backsliding and erosion of rights and freedoms.  
On Monday, China hit back at Seoul for inviting Taiwan Digital Minister Audrey Tang to give a video address.  
Though a presenter said Tang was speaking in a private capacity, her participation was not announced ahead of time by either Taiwan or South Korea, which has boosted ties with Washington but also sought to prevent major impact to its deep economic ties with China.  
Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said efforts to “expand the space for Taiwan independence activities under the banner of democracy and human rights” were doomed to fail.  
Digital threats to democracy, and how technology can promote democracy and universal human rights, were expected to be the main agenda of the three-day meetings in Seoul, attended by representatives from more than 30 countries, ranging from Costa Rica to the United States and Ghana.

2,"UN chief invokes film, warns of nuclear disaster","“Humanity cannot survive a sequel to Oppenheimer,” says Guterres.","UNITED NATIONS: UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres invoked Oscar-winning film Oppenheimer on Monday as he warned that the world faced the highest risk of nuclear war in decades.
At a Security Council session called by Japan, Guterres said that the biopic about the morally conflicted father of the atomic bomb  “brought the harsh reality of nuclear doomsday to vivid life for millions around the world.”
“Humanity cannot survive a sequel to Oppenheimer,” Guterres said.
“We meet at a time when geopolitical tensions and mistrust have escalated the risk of nuclear warfare to its highest point in decades,” he said.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has made thinly veiled threats to use nuclear weapons as he warns the West against its support for Ukraine, which Moscow invaded more than two years ago. Without naming Putin, Guterres said,  “Nuclear saber-rattling must stop.”  “Threats to use nuclear weapons in any capacity are unacceptable,” he said.

Guterres says threats to use nuclear weapons in any capacity are unacceptable

Elsewhere in the world, tensions surrounding nuclear-armed North Korea have continued to rise and Iran has been enriching uranium closer to the level needed if it decides to build an atom bomb.
Israel, the Middle East’s only nuclear-armed power albeit an undeclared one, has been at war since Oct 7. Guterres called on the United States and Russia to resume negotiations, at a standstill since the Ukraine war, on a successor to the New START nuclear arms reduction treaty which expires in early 2026.
He also called for progress on other initiatives including the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which entered into force in 2021 but has little practical effect as no nuclear-weapons states are party to it.
“Investments in the tools of war are outstripping investments in the tools of peace. Arms budgets are growing, while diplomacy and development budgets are shrinking,” Guterres said.
The United States, the only country to have used nuclear weapons in warfare, said it would work on one area with ally Japan, whose cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were devastated by atomic weapons in 1945.
The United States as well as France said they would join Japan in a coalition to push through the Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty, which would ban production of plutonium and highly enriched uranium, the key ingredients in nuclear weapons.
Most nuclear states have already stopped production. Discussions on a treaty have been blocked by Pakistan, which believes it would fall behind rival India and which enjoys diplomatic support from China.
“To forestall a potential arms race, we need to see an end to the production of fissile material for use in nuclear weapons, and continue pursuing negotiations on a Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty,” said the US ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield.
Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa, who led the meeting, vowed that Tokyo  “will further increase international and political attention” toward the treaty.

The ground-dwelling kiwi is one of New Zealand’s beloved national icons, but it is also one of the country’s most vulnerable native birds.
Conservationists have embarked on an ambitious project to restore kiwi populations to the forested hills that surround the capital Wellington.
As part of the project, a flock of 15 kiwi were coaxed from a sanctuary in New Zealand’s north on Monday, then flown more than 500 kilometres (310 miles) in two light planes to their new home. Project leader Paul Ward said it was a  “milestone moment”.
“I never thought we would see kiwi fly. It’s pretty exciting for our kiwi family in Wellington,” he said.
Few New Zealanders have ever seen the fluffy, shy, nocturnal kiwi in the wild.
They vanished from Wellington’s hills around 150 years ago, as predators were introduced and land was cleared for the growing city.
Monday’s kiwi transfer was the first by air, but the Capital Kiwi Project has been releasing adult birds around Wellington since 2022, hoping to re-establish numbers after killing off predators such as stoats and ferrets.

4,Three arrested in Spain over death of migrants,MADRID: Spanish police have arrested three people over the deaths of five migrants who were deliberately forced off ...,"MADRID: Spanish police have arrested three people over the deaths of five migrants who were deliberately forced off a speedboat last November, just off an Atlantic ocean beach in Cadiz in southern Spain, the Interior Ministry said on Monday.
The two men and one woman detained in the Algeciras area about 70 km southeast of Cadiz, are accused of forcing the migrants to jump at knife point into the swell with strong currents, despite knowing that many migrants could not swim.
The trio are also suspected of belonging to a criminal organisation, offences against the rights of foreign nationals, injuries and smuggling. Images published on social media in November showed a black inflatable speedboat circling in heavy tides off the beach and people on board pushing others off the side.
Police, who made the arrests after finding the boat, said there were at least 37 migrants on board who had paid between 3,000 euros and 12,000 euros ($3,270-$13,075) each for the journey between Kenitra in Morocco and Cadiz.
Despite its proximity to Morocco, the Cadiz area is not a common destination for migrants due to rough seas on the Atlantic coast and surveillance around the Strait of Gibraltar nearby.

5,Methane: a powerful gas heating the planet,Methane is a key target for countries wanting to slash emissions quickly and slow climate change.,"PARIS: Climate talks often revolve around reducing the most dangerous greenhouse gas CO2. But other powerful heat-trapping emissions — of methane — will be in the crosshairs at a global forum in Geneva this week.
Methane — which is potent but relatively short-lived — is a key target for countries wanting to slash emissions quickly and slow climate change. That is particularly because large amounts of methane are simply leaking into the atmosphere from oil and gas projects.
Methane emissions from the fossil fuel industry have risen for three consecutive years, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), hitting near record highs in 2023.
What is methane?
Atmospheric methane (CH4) occurs abundantly in nature and is the primary component of gas fuel. It is the second largest contributor to climate change, accounting for roughly 30 per cent of global warming since pre-industrial levels, according to UN climate experts.
Methane remains in the atmosphere for only about 10 years, but has a much more powerful warming impact than CO2. Its warming effect is 28 times greater than CO2 over a 100-year timescale (and 80 times over 20 years).
Exactly how much methane is released in the atmosphere remains subject to  “significant uncertainty”, according to the IEA, despite progress in the monitoring of emissions through the use of satellites.
And scientists are puzzling over a steady increase of methane in the atmosphere, with concentrations currently over two-and-a-half times greater than pre-industrial levels.
Gas leaks and cow burps
The majority of methane emissions — around 60pc — are linked to human activity, the IEA says, and the rest from natural sources, mainly wetlands. Agriculture is the biggest culprit, responsible for roughly a quarter of that pollution.
Most is from livestock — cows and sheep release methane during digestion and in their manure — and rice cultivation, where flooded fields create ideal conditions for methane-emitting bacteria.
The energy sector — coal, oil and gas — is the second largest source of human caused methane, which leaks from gas pipelines and other energy infrastructure, or is deliberately released during maintenance procedures.
A study published in the journal Nature in March found that oil and gas projects in six major producing regions of the United States were emitting three times as much methane as estimated by the government — losses worth $1 billion. Discarded household waste also creates large amounts of methane when it decomposes if left to rot in landfills.
What can be done?
The IEA estimates that rapid cuts in methane emissions linked to the fossil fuel sector could prevent up to 0.1 degrees Celsius of warming by mid-century. That might sound modest, but such a reduction would have an impact greater than  “immediately taking all cars and trucks in the world off the road”, the agency said.
IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol called it  “one of the best and most affordable” options for reducing global warming.

6,New Banksy mural depicting tree foliage appears in London,A photo of the mural was posted on Banksy’s official Instagram account where the artist usually claims responsibility.,"LONDON: A new artwork by British street artist Banksy has appeared in London, using green paint sprayed across the side of a building to mimic the foliage of a real, heavily pruned tree that stands a few metres in front of it.
A photo of the mural was posted on Banksy’s official Instagram account on Monday, where the artist usually claims responsibility for works of art to his more than 12 million followers.
When viewed from certain angles, the green paint lines up with the tree’s bare branches to represent its leaves. The work includes a stencil, typical of Banksy, of a person holding a spraying device, dripping in green paint.
The renowned street artist’s latest work sparked interest and excitement across social media platforms, including from lawmaker and former leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, who represents the area of north London where the art appeared.
“Banksy has come to Islington! What wonderful artwork, proving there is hope for our natural world everywhere,” Corbyn said in a post on X.
In December, artwork by Banksy showing three grey drones across a  “STOP” traffic sign in south London was removed by an unidentified man in broad daylight as passersby looked on. Police later made arrests. 
That fate looks unlikely for his latest piece, which stretches beyond the height of the fully grown tree and across several floors of a large building.

7,IAEA to help Iraq develop peaceful nuclear plan,Agency head Grossi says a team of Iraqi experts would visit the IAEA headquarters in Vienna in a few days to hold meetings.,"BAGHDAD: The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Rafael Grossi met Iraq’s prime minister in Baghdad on Monday as part of a visit to help the country develop a peaceful nuclear programme.
“We have discussed several projects in Iraq, including building a nuclear reactor for peaceful purposes,” Iraqi Education Minister Naim al-Aboudi told reporters following a meeting between Grossi and Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani.
Grossi said that a team of Iraqi experts would visit the agency’s headquarters in Vienna in a few days to hold meetings to  “set out a road map for the Iraqi peaceful nuclear programme” amid growing interest in nuclear energy in the region, including among Arab Gulf countries.
“We see that in the (United Arab) Emirates, we see that in Egypt, we will see that in Saudi Arabia and of course we should see it here in Iraq,” Grossi told reporters.
Iraq in the past had three nuclear reactors in Tuwaitha, its main nuclear research site, south of Baghdad. One was destroyed by an Israeli air raid in 1981 and the two others by US warplanes in the 1991 Gulf war that followed Iraq’s 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
“Definitely, turning the page on this complex past is of the essence and we’re doing just that,” Grossi said.

8,"Netanyahu’s claims about UNRWA ‘flat-out lies’, says US senator",The senator is among a group who demanded last week that Biden cut off military aid to Israel.,"WASHINGTON: US Senator Chris Van Hollen has refuted Israel’s allegation that the UN Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA is a proxy for Hamas, arguing that the accusations by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are “flat-out lies.”
The Maryland Democrat is among a group of senators who demanded last week that US President Joe Biden comply with the Foreign Assistance Act and cut off military aid to Israel. They argued that Section 620I of the Foreign Assistance Act requires the Biden administration to stop the sale and transfer of weapons to Israel if Netanyahu’s government continues to block humanitarian assistance to Gaza.
In an interview with CBS Face the Nation on Sunday, Senator Van Hollen said he believes Netanyahu’s claims about UNRWA being a proxy for Hamas are false. “Oh, there’s no doubt that the claim is a flat-out lie,” he declared.
The US lawmaker argues that the Israeli prime minister is using the allegation to dismantle UNRWA. “Netanyahu has wanted to get rid of UNRWA since at least 2017. That’s been his goal, not just in Gaza, but also in the other places (as well),” he said.
Explaining why he opposes the ban on UNRWA, Van Hollen argues that UNRWA provides the primary distribution system for food and aid in Gaza. “If you cut off funding for UNRWA and Gaza entirely, it means more people will starve, more people won’t get the medical assistance they need. And so it would be a huge mistake to cut them off.”
The senator says that Netanyahu has been opposed to a two-state solution, and that’s why he is trying to ban UNRWA. “Netanyahu has wanted to get rid of UNRWA because he has seen them as a means to continue the hopes of the Palestinian people for a homeland of their own. And he has been opposed to a two-state solution,” he said.
Senator Van Hollen also emphasises the need for a ceasefire in Gaza and the return of hostages. “We need to focus on getting the hostages back and a ceasefire. And this is why I’m for a ceasefire and the return of the hostages,” he said.
He recalls that the Biden administration has already put forward a National Security Memorandum requiring countries to certify compliance with US law. And this, he says, “is a very important tool that … applies to Israel and any other country that receives US military assistance.”
Pointing out that Israel is not in compliance with US law as of March 24, the senator says he wants to restrict military aid to Israel if they do not comply. “So, it’s not a total cut off. I mean, the Netanyahu government can open the Erez Crossing to help starving people in northern Gaza. They can stop turning away maternity kits, … they could stop turning away water purifiers.”
He rejects Israel’s claim that such tools “posed a dual-use danger that they could be used for military purposes. Explaining why he believes Netanyahu’s claim about UNRWA is “a flat-out lie,” he says: “If you look at the person who’s in charge of operations on the ground in Gaza for UNRWA, it’s a 20-year US Army veteran. You can be sure he is not in cahoots with Hamas.”
Refuting Netanyahu’s arguments about UNRWA, Van Hollen says if 14 of those 13,000 people who carried out the October 7th raid on Israel were from UNRWA, they should be held accountable.
“For goodness sake, let’s not hold 2 million innocent Palestinian civilians who are dying of starvation, let’s not hold them, essentially, accountable for the bad acts of 14 people,” he said.

9,Israeli forces kill 20 at Gaza’s Shifa Hospital,"Hamas says the military targeted the building without caring about  patients, medical staff 
or displaced people","JERUSALEM: Israeli troops raided the compound of Gaza’s Al Shifa Hospital early on Monday, killing 20 people in an operation Palestinian health authorities said caused multiple casualties and set off a fierce fire in one of the buildings.
The Israeli military said soldiers and special forces had conducted a  “precise operation” based on intelligence that the hospital was being used by senior Hamas leaders, and were fired upon when they entered the compound.Al Shifa, the Gaza Strip’s biggest hospital before the war, is now one of the only healthcare facilities that is even partially operational in the north of the territory, and is also housing hundreds of displaced civilians.
Hamas said in a statement the Israeli military had committed a new  crime by directly targeting the hospital buildings without caring about  patients, medical staff or displaced people in it.
“Suddenly, we started to hear sounds of explosions, several bombings, and soon tanks started to roll, they came from the western road and headed toward Al Shifa, then sounds of gunfire and explosions increased,” Mohammad Ali, 32, a father of two, who lives around one kilometre from the hospital, said via a chat app.

Hamas says the military targeted the building without caring about  patients, medical staff or displaced people

“We don’t know what is happening, but it looked as if it was a re-invasion of the Gaza City,” he added, saying that the military activities began at around 1am. Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry said a fire broke out at the entrance of the hospital complex, causing cases of suffocation among displaced women and children sheltering in the hospital. It said communication had been cut off, with people trapped inside the surgery and emergency units of one of the buildings.
“There are casualties, including deaths and injuries, and it’s impossible to rescue anyone due to the intensity of the fire and targeting of anyone approaching the windows,” the ministry said.
The Israeli army dropped new leaflets around the hospital in Gaza City.
“To all those who exist or are displaced in Rimal and the displaced in Al Shifa and its vicinity: you are in a dangerous combat zone. The IDF is operating hard in its residential areas to destroy terror infrastructure,” said the statement, which ordered the people to take the coastal road towards Al-Mawasi in the southern Gaza Strip.
The military issued footage of the overnight operation showing soldiers in the hospital compound engaged in gunfights.
Footage circulated on social media appeared to show an Israeli tank blocking the main gate of Al Shifa.Not far from Al Shifa, Israeli army forces raided a school where displaced families were sheltering, and detained several men there, residents and Hamas media said. Residents reported tanks were also operating on the edge of the Beach refugee camp and said tanks fired shells at some buildings nearby.
Israel came under fierce criticism last year when troops first raided the hospital, where they uncovered tunnels they said were used as command and control centres by Hamas. Hamas and medical staff deny the hospital has been used for military purposes or to shelter fighters.
WHO reaction
The  latest military operation around the hospital triggered alarm from the World Health Organisation.
“We are  terribly worried about the situation at Al Shifa Hospital in northern  Gaza,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus wrote on X, formerly  Twitter.
“Hospitals should never be battlegrounds.” Tedros said that Al Shifa had  “only recently restored minimal health services”. Most of Gaza’s hospitals are no longer functioning, according to the United Nations.

High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Josep Borrell, speaks to the media at the EU headquarters in Brussels, on Monday.—AFP

 
BRUSSELS: EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Monday that Israel’s military campaign in Gaza had turned the territory into the world’s biggest  “open-air graveyard”.
“Gaza was before the war the greatest open-air prison. Today it’s the greatest open-air graveyard,” Borrell said at a meeting of EU ministers in Brussels.
“It’s a graveyard for tens of thousands of people and also a graveyard for many of the most important principles of humanitarian law.” Borrell also reiterated his accusation that Israel was using famine as a  “weapon of war” by not allowing aid trucks into Gaza.
“Israel is provoking famine,” he told a humanitarian conference.
Israel’s Foreign Minister Israel Katz hit back at Borrell and told him to  “to stop attacking Israel and recognise our right to self-defence against Hamas’ crimes.”  “Israel allows extensive humanitarian aid into Gaza by land, air, and sea for anyone willing to help,” Katz wrote on X.The 27-nation EU has struggled to come up with a united response to the crisis in Gaza as some members firmly back Israel and others are more pro-Palestinian.
EU ministers were set to discuss a proposal by Ireland and Spain to suspend a cooperation agreement with Israel, but that move was unlikely to get the support of all 27 countries.
The bloc was however expected to agree on sanctions both against Hamas for sexual violence on Oct 7 and against violent Israeli settlers in the West Bank for attacking Palestinians.
Britain and the United States have already imposed sanctions targeting a small number of  “extremist” settlers.
