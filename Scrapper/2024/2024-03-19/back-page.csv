• Says one in three children acutely malnourished, two in 10,000 die every day of starvation or malnutrition
• Oxfam accuses Israel of ‘systematically and deliberately blocking’ delivery of aid
ROME: Half of Gazans are experiencing “catastrophic” hunger, with famine projected to hit the north of the territory by May without urgent intervention, a United Nations-backed food security assessment warned on Monday.
“People in Gaza are starving to death right now. The speed at which this man-made hunger and malnutrition crisis has ripped through Gaza is terrifying,” the head of the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) Cindy McCain said.
“To have 50 per cent of an entire population in catastrophic, near-famine levels, is unprecedented,” Beth Bechdol, the deputy director general of the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), said.
This amounts to around 1.1 million people “struggling with catastrophic hunger and starvation”, according to the WFP.
It added: “This is the highest number of people ever recorded as facing catastrophic hunger” under the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) partnership, which published its latest report on Monday.
The situation is particularly dire in the north of the besieged Palestinian territory, where there are about 300,000 people, the UN says — and where aid agencies have reported huge difficulty distributing food and other aid.
Aid charity Oxfam on Monday accused Israel of continuing to “systematically and deliberately block and undermine” the delivery of aid into Gaza, in violation of international humanitarian law.
The IPC system, conducted by the UN and aid agencies, is used by the UN or governments in deciding whether or not to officially declare a famine.
“Famine is imminent in the northern governorates and projected to occur anytime between mid-March and May 2024,” the IPC report said of Gaza.
“All evidence points towards a major acceleration of deaths and malnutrition. Waiting for a retrospective famine classification before acting is indefensible,” it said.
‘Wasted’ children
A famine is declared when 20 per cent of households face an extreme food shortage — which is the case in Gaza, the UN says — one in three children are acutely malnourished, and at least two in every 10,000 people die every day of starvation or malnutrition.
Children in Gaza face “extremely critical health conditions… exposing them to high-risk nutritional deterioration”, the IPC report said.
According to the WFP, “one in three children below the age of two is now acutely malnourished, or ‘wasted’. “This means they are dangerously thin for their height, which puts them at risk of death.”
Arif Husain, WFP’s chief economist, warned the final criteria for declaring a famine — the mortality rate — would “happen any time from now until the end of May”.
FAO’s Bechdol said that challenges of data collection and analysis meant it was “possible that famine is already occurring in the north”.
Gazans were “turning to alternative sources” for food, including animal feed and “inedible items, purely out of desperation”, she said.
Donors have turned to deliveries by air or sea, but air and sea missions are no alternative to land deliveries, UN agencies say.
‘300 aid trucks needed each day’
WFP said meeting basic food needs would require at least 300 trucks to enter Gaza every day and distribute food, especially in the north.
The agency has only managed to get nine convoys into the north since the start of the year, it said. The latest of these, on Sunday night, involved 18 truckloads of food supplies delivered to Gaza City.
“The convoy, the second to use a coordinated route into Gaza City and the north, delivered some 274 tonnes of wheat flour, food parcels and ready-to-eat rations.
“This route needs to be made available for daily convoys and safe access to the north,” it said.
The Rome-based agency said it needed Israel to “provide more entry points into Gaza” and allow use of the Ashdod port to bring in food aid.
The WFP’s Husain said: “Our hope is we can still avert a full-fledged famine. But the window is shutting and it is shutting very, very fast.”

1,SC orders fresh poll in PB-50 constituency,"The ECP’s decision was challenged by Awami National Party’s Zamarak Khan, 44,713 votes during voting on Feb 8.","ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court has ordered re-election in Balochistan Assembly’s PB-50 constituency in Qilla Abdullah.
Headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa, a three-judge SC bench on Monday set aside the Election Commission of Pakistan’s order for re-polling at six polling stations in the constituency.
The bench, including Justice Irfan Saadat Khan and Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan, ordered the ECP to conduct a fresh election as per the law.
The ECP’s decision was challenged by Awami National Party’s Zamarak Khan, who contended that the turnout at many polling stations in the constituency remained low.
His lawyer, Advocate Wasim Sajjad, argued that despite the low turnout, the ECP did not order a fresh voting at all polling stations.
The counsel claimed that re-polling was only ordered at polling stations where his client had won.
The ECP even cancelled the victory notification of Mr Zamarak after he had taken oath as MPA.
The court observed that it should not be dragged into the technicalities since it cannot hear four hundred election-related cases.
After the consent of all parties, the court ordered a fresh election in the constituency.
Mr Zamarak Khan had bagged 44,713 votes during voting on Feb 8, followed by Malik Nawaz of the JUI-F who secured 43,445 votes. Wayaz Khan of the PkMAP stood third with 34,604 votes.

2,US urges Taliban to prevent attacks from Afghan soil,Calls on both Afghanistan and Pakistan to prioritise the protection of civilian lives during security operations.,"WASHINGTON: The US State Department called on Kabul’s Taliban rulers on Monday to prevent terrorist activities originating from Afghan soil, while also urging both Afghanistan and Pakistan to prioritise the protection of civilian lives during security operations.
“We have seen reports that Pakistan carried out airstrikes in Afghanistan in response to the attack in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, on Saturday at a military post,” said the department’s Principal Deputy Spokesperson Vedant Patel when asked at a news briefing to comment on these developments.
“We deeply regret the loss of life and injuries sustained during the attack in Pakistan and the loss of civilian lives during the strike in Afghanistan.”
The US official, however, also sent a clear message to Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers. “We urge the Taliban to ensure that terrorist attacks are not launched from Afghan soil.”
And then he urged Pakistan “to exercise restraint and ensure civilians are not harmed in their counterterrorism efforts”.
The State Department official also urged “both sides to address their differences” while underlining the need for Afghanistan to curb terrorism.
“We remain committed to ensuring that Afghanistan never again becomes a safe haven for terrorists who wish to harm the United States or our partners or allies,” he said.
When a journalist interpreted his statement as suggesting that the United States did not support Pakistan’s stance on this issue, Patel said: “Any loss of civilian life is troubling and heartbreaking to us, so we want to make sure that when some of these operations are being conducted, every step possible is taken to ensure it is the perpetrators that are being held to account and not civilians who are being impacted.”
Emphasising Pakistan’s position as a close US ally, he said that Washington maintains “regular communication” with Pakistani leaders to “discuss Afghanistan in detail including through our counterterrorism dialogue and other bilateral consultations”.
Responding to a question about US Ambassador Donald Blome’s recent meetings with Pakistani leaders, he said: “Amb Blome on March 15 did meet with PM Sharif to discuss a broad range of bilateral issues, partnering with the government of Pakistan on regional security, US support for continued economic reforms with and through the IMF.”
He said that trade and investment, education, climate change, and other private sector-led economic growth issues were also discussed in this meeting. “And we continue to engage with our Pakistani partners, they discuss a number of range of other issues as well,” he added.

3,PIA plane back from Muscat after engine replaced,The engine was replaced with one removed from another Boeing 777 plane grounded at Jinnah International Airport.,"RAWALPINDI: A Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) Boeing 777 plane, which made an emergency landing at Muscat International Airport due to engine failure 13 days ago, returned home on Monday after its engine was replaced with another one.
The engine was replaced with one removed from another Boeing 777 plane grounded at Jinnah International Airport.
The engine was airlifted to Muscat on March 10 on a C-130 cargo plane.
Flight PK-714 from Madina to Islamabad carrying 392 passengers had to make an emergency landing at Muscat airport after one of its engines suddenly stalled and failed at 35,000 feet.
The aircraft, with 357 passengers and 35 crew members, had taken off from Madina one hour and 50 minutes late. After attaining an altitude of 35,000 feet, the pilot noticed some problem in the engine.
The plane was flying over Muscat when its left engine (engine number 1) suddenly stopped working. The cockpit crew decided to land at Muscat as it was the nearest airport.
After getting permission for landing, the aircraft safely landed with one operational engine in Muscat at 10.21pm.
The passengers were offloaded and were sent to the airport lounge.
Shortly after the plane landed at the airport, a group of engineers were sent to Muscat from Pakistan to get the engine repaired, but after examining it the engineers decided to ground the plane as the engine was damaged, probably after having been hit by an external object.
Later a relief flight was sent to bring back the passengers stranded at Muscat airport. After replacement of the engine, the PIA aircraft took off for Karachi.

4,"In New Zealand, Chinese minister calls for working with ‘friends’","The trip marks the start of a diplomatic blitz through New Zealand and Australia, Wang’s first visit to either country since 2017.","WELLINGTON: Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi made a rare visit to New Zealand on Monday, stressing the need to work with “friends” in the face of the “tumultuous international situation”.
The trip marks the start of a diplomatic blitz through New Zealand and Australia, Wang’s first visit to either country since 2017.
The whistle-stop tour is expected to focus heavily on trade as Beijing looks to lessen the pain from slowing economic growth at home.
Speaking in the capital Wellington before a meeting with his New Zealand counterpart, Wang said the trip was also a chance to shore up diplomatic ties that have come under strain as Beijing adopts an increasingly aggressive stance on issues such as Taiwan and the South China Sea.
“In the face of the current tumultuous international situation, we are willing to strengthen strategic communication with our friends in New Zealand on international and regional issues of common concern,” Wang said.
“And we will work together to maintain peace and stability in the region and the world,” he added before his closed-door meeting with New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters.
New Zealand is part of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance alongside the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia.
But Wellington has been criticised for taking a softer line on China — putting its trading relationship ahead of its allies’ security concerns.
In a statement on Monday, Peters said the talks touched on “trade, business, and people-to-people links”, but also acknowledged “areas of difference such as human rights”.
“We also highlighted New Zealand and China’s shared interest in a secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific region and raised concerns over increased tensions in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait,” he added.
China is New Zealand’s largest trading partner, and Chinese consumers have long had an appetite for the country’s meat, wine, milk and wood.
Wang said he believed that “China-New Zealand relations will continue to be at the forefront of China’s relations with developed countries”.
“The relationship between us has developed smoothly and well,” he said.
Later this week, Wang will meet Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong in Canberra.
China and Australia have recently resolved a series of simmering trade disputes that saw Beijing impose tariffs and trade barriers on key exports in 2020, retaliating after Canberra barred Huawei from 5G contracts and called for a probe into the origins of Covid-19.
But the two nations continue to spar over human rights and Beijing’s growing clout in the Pacific region.

5,Amini’s death in custody ‘unlawful’: UN mission,Says death was caused by physical violence in the custody of state authorities.,"GENEVA: A fact-finding mission mandated by the United Nations said on Monday the death of Mahsa Amini in the custody of Iran’s morality police was unlawful and caused by violence and that Iranian women still suffer systematic discrimination.
The death of 22-year-old Amini, a Kurdish Iranian woman, in September 2022 while in custody for allegedly flouting Iran’s Islamic dress code unleashed months of protests and the biggest challenge to the Islamic Republic’s clerical leaders in decades.
“Our investigation established that her death was unlawful and caused by physical violence in the custody of state authorities,” Sara Hossain, chairperson of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Iran, told the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva.
The fact-finding mission found the protests that followed were marked by extra-judicial executions, arbitrary arrests, torture and ill-treatment, as well as rape and sexual violence.
“These acts were conducted in the context of a widespread and systematic attack against women and girls, and other persons expressing support for human rights,” Hossain said.
“Some of these serious violations of human rights thus rose to the level of crimes against humanity.”
In response, Kazem Gharib Abadi, secretary general of Iran’s High Council for Human Rights, accused the fact-finding mission of a “glaring lack of independence and impartiality”.
In separate comments to the Human Rights Council, Javaid Rehman, the UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in Iran, said jailed human rights defender Narges Mohammadi “suffers from severe health issues, including serious heart and lung conditions, placing her health at great risk”.
“She was denied medical access because she did not have the mandatory hijab,” Hossain said about Mohammadi, who won the Nobel Peace Prize last year.
Hossain said that since the protests began in 2022, women and girls in Iran were confronted daily by discrimination “affecting virtually all aspects of their private and public lives”.
She said it was “hard to fathom” that women’s access to schools, universities, hospitals and courts as well as employment opportunities “should be subjected to a wholly arbitrary requirement of wearing the mandatory hijab”.

6,West decries Putin’s landslide election victory,"China, North Korea, India vow closer ties with Russia."," 

Vladimir Putin

LONDON: Western governments lined up on Monday to condemn Vladimir Putin’s landslide election victory as unfair and undemocratic, but China, India and North Korea and some other countries congratulated the veteran Russian leader on extending his rule by a further six years.
The contrasting reactions underscored the geopolitical fault lines that have gaped wider since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine two years ago, triggering the deepest crisis in relations with the West since the end of the Cold War.
Arriving in Brussels on Monday, EU foreign ministers roundly dismissed the election result as a sham ahead of agreeing sanctions on individuals linked to the mistreatment and death of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.
“Russia’s election was an election without choice,” German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said at the start of the meeting.

China, North Korea, India vow closer ties with Russia

Playing on Moscow’s reference to its war in Ukraine as a “special military operation”, French Foreign Minister Stephane Sejourne said Paris had taken note of the “special election operation”.
“The conditions for a free, pluralistic and democratic election were not met,” his ministry said.
British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said the election outcome highlighted the “depth of repression” in Russia.
“Putin removes his political opponents, controls the media, and then crowns himself the winner. This is not democracy,” Cameron said.
France, Britain and others condemned the fact that Russia had also held its election in occupied regions of Ukraine that it claims to have annexed during the war.
The Kremlin dismissed such criticism, saying the 87 per cent of the vote won by Putin during the three-day election showed that the Russian people were consolidating around him.
Ukrainian President Volody­myr Zelensky said Russia’s election had no legitimacy.
“It is clear to everyone in the world that this figure (Putin)… is simply sick for power and is doing everything to rule forever,” Zelensky said.
A White House spokesperson on Sunday said Russia’s election was “obviously not free nor fair”.
Putin congratulated
In sharp contrast, Chinese President Xi Jinping congratulated Putin, and said Beijing would maintain close communication with Moscow to promote the “no limits” partnership they agreed in 2022, just before Russia invaded Ukraine.
“I believe that under your leadership, Russia will certainly be able to achieve greater achievements in national development and construction,” Xi told Putin in his message, according to Xinhua News.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi echoed that message, saying he looked forward to strengthening New Delhi’s “time-tested special and privileged strategic partnership” with Moscow.
India and China, along with Russia, are members of the BRICS group of emerging economies that aims to challenge US domination of the global economy.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi, accused by the West of supplying weapons to Russia, also extended congratulations to Putin, stressing their desire for further expansion of bilateral relations with Moscow.
In Africa, where the West has been struggling to win support for its efforts to isolate Moscow over the Ukraine war, some newspapers saw Putin’s re-election as reinforcing the stance of Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger.
Those three states in the Sahel region have strengthened ties with Russia following coups in recent years at the expense of their traditional French and US allies.
“In Africa, this re-election could sound like a non-event, but given the context in the Sahel it takes on a particular meaning, because Putin embodies the new geopolitical balance of power on the continent with a growing (Russian) presence and influence,” said Burkina Faso daily Aujourd’hui au Faso.
