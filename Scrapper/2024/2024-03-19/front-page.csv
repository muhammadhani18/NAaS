• Clashes between Pakistan, Afghanistan security forces erupt, officer martyred; border crossings closed
• FO says operation targeted Hafiz Gul Bahadur outfit, terms militant groups threat to collective peace
ISLAMABAD: After Pak­istan conducted air strikes inside Afghanistan using jets and unmanned drones to target militants linked to the Hafiz Gul Bahadur group, fierce clas­hes erupted between the two countries along the bor­der, resulting in the martyrdom of one officer and injuries to three soldiers.
In a pre-dawn operation, the military targeted the militant outfit — responsible for the March 16 North Waziristan attack which martyred seven troops — in an ‘intelligence-based anti-terrorist operation’.
The attack came a day after President Asif Ali Zardari vowed to avenge the deaths of Pakistani soldiers.
The airstrikes were confirmed by the Foreign Office in a statement issued several hours after the sorties.
The FO said the operation targeted the Hafiz Gul Bahadur group responsible for several attacks inside Pakistan. “Pakistan…always prioritised dialogue and cooperation [with Kabul] to confront the terrorist threat. We have repeatedly urged the Afghan authorities to take concrete and effective action to ensure that the Afghan soil is not used as a staging ground for terrorism against Pakistan. We have also called on them to deny safe havens to the TTP and to hand over its leadership to Pakistan.”
The statement said “certain elements among those in power in Afghan­istan” were actively patronising the TTP and using the banned outfit as a proxy against Pakistan.
“Such an approach against a brotherly country, which stood with the people of Afghanistan through thick and thin, manifests shortsightedness. It ignores the support extended by Pakistan to the people of Afghanis­tan over the last several decades. We urge these elements in power to rethink the policy of siding with ‘Khwarij’ terrorists shedding the blood of innocent Pakistanis and to make a clear choice to stand with the people of Pakistan,” it said.
Islamabad said militant groups like the banned TTP posed a “collective threat to regional peace and security” and Pakistan fully realised the challenge faced by the Afghan authorities in combating the threat.
“Pakistan would therefore continue to work towards finding joint solutions in countering terrorism and to prevent any terrorist organisation from sabotaging bilateral relations with Afghanistan,” it said.
‘Eight killed’
Earlier, Afghan government spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said Pakistani aircraft had carried out airstrikes in Paktika and Khost provinces along the border, killing eight people.
Paktika is located near South Waziristan while Khost is situated near North Waziristan. In a statement, Mr Mujahid said “at around 3am Pakistani aircraft bombarded civilian homes” in Khost and Paktika provinces, claiming that all eight people killed were women and children.
Alleging that “houses of common people were targeted”, he said three women and as many children were killed in Paktika and a house collapsed while two women were killed in Khost, where a house was destroyed as well.
In a statement posted on his X account, Mr Mujahid said: “The Pakistani side is saying that [militant] Abdullah Shah was targeted in the strikes but he lives on the Pakistani side. Members of the same tribe live on both sides and routinely move across the border.”
He stated: “The Islamic Emirate strongly condemns the attacks and describes these as non-serious actions and violation of Afghanistani territory.”
The spokesperson further said: “Pakistan should not blame Afghanistan for their problems and failure to control violent incidents. Such acts can lead to dire consequences which will not be in control of Pakistan.”
A statement posted later by the Afghan foreign ministry said it summoned Pakistan’s charge d’affaires and also sent him a letter of protest. “Besides condemning the attacks, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs informs Pakistan that the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan has a long experience of fighting for freedom against the superpowers of the world and cannot tolerate aggression on its territory in any way.”
“The new civilian government and the people of Pakistan should not allow some circles to complicate the relations between the two neighbouring Muslim countries with their irresponsible actions and wrong policies,” it said.
Taliban retaliate
In response to airstrikes, Kabul targeted “bases of Pakistani security forces” across the border, said the Defence Ministry of Afghanistan.
The border forces of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan targeted military bases of Pakistan army across Durand Line with heavy weapons, the statement claimed.
An army officer embraced martyrdom and three soldiers sustained injuries in day-long cross-border clashes between Pakistan and Afghan Taliban forces on along border in district Kurram, police said.
“The clashes, which began on Monday morning, are still ongoing,” DPO Kurram Mazhar Jahan told Dawn.
There was, however, no word from ISPR on the clashes in Kurram as well as in North Waziristan, where media reports claimed an officer was wounded in crossfire.
The DPO said that the Kharlachi border crossing had to be closed.
Local officials said several properties were damaged after shells, fired from across the border which landed inside the houses in Pakistan.
Similar clashes were reported from North Waziristan where local sources informed that the Ghulam Khan border crossing had been closed.
“The clashes are still underway,” police officials said, adding the situation would become clear once the clashes stopped.
Afghanistan ‘enabler of terror’
The ISPR, in a statement, asserted that the “recent wave of terrorism in Pakistan has the full support and assistance of Afghanistan” but did not comment directly on the strikes.
“The Afghan interim government is not only arming the terrorists but also providing a safe haven for other terrorist organisations as well as being involved in the incidents of terrorism in Pakistan,” it stated.
“With the help of the Afghan Taliban and the supply of modern weapons, there has been an increase in the incidents of terrorism in Pakistan,” the ISPR added.
About the recent North Waziristan checkpost attack, the military’s media wing said the “fabric of loss of precious lives is also found with terrorists taking shelter in Afghanistan”.
The statement said there was “clear evidence of involvement of terrorists from Afghanistan” in the Zhob Garrison attack in July 2023.
It added that “TTP terrorists armed with the latest American weapons attacked two army check posts in Chitral” in September last year.
The military’s media wing said that the November attack on Mianwali Air Base was “also planned by the terrorists taking refuge in Afghanistan”.
It said “terrorists from Afghanistan used night vision goggles and foreign weapons” in the Dera Ismail Khan attacks in December.
“There is clear evidence of the involvement of TTP terrorists who took refuge in Afghanistan in the terrorist incident in Tank on Dec 15, 2023,” the ISPR stated.
The statement also said militants from Afghanistan were involved in the Peshawar Police Lines blast in January 2023, which claimed more than 80 lives.

1,Perpetrator of Mir Ali attack killed: ISPR,Says security forces conducted an intelligence-based operation following the reported presence of militants in North Waziristan.,"PESHAWAR: Eight militants, including the perpetrator of the March 16 attack on an army camp, were killed by security forces in North Waziristan on Monday, the military’s media wing said.
A statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Rela­t­ions (ISPR) said security forces conducted an intelligence-based operation (IBO) following the reported presence of militants in the area.
After an intense exchange of fire with security forces, eight militants, including the commander and a high-value target, Shera alias Janan, were gunned down.
ISPR added that Janan was the orchestrator of the March 16 attack in which seven security personnel, including two officers, embraced martyrdom.
He was a highly wanted target for the law enforcement agencies, the statement read.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other terrorists found in the area as the security forces of Pakistan remain determined to wipe out the menace of terrorism from the country,” it asserted.
The operation took place two days after six militants stormed a Frontier Corps’ post in the Khaddi market area of Mir Ali in North Waziristan.
The militants rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into the gate at 6:15am, followed by multiple blasts, including a suicide bombing.
A portion of the building collapsed following the attacks, resulting in the martyrdom of five security personnel.
The six militants were killed in a subsequent clearance operation while Lt Col Syed Kashif Ali, who led the operation, and Captain Muhammad Ahmed Badar embraced martyrdom.
A group affiliated with Hafiz Gul Bahadur, previously a government contractor and a good Taliban-turned-militant leader, claimed responsibility for the attack.

2,Imad stars in last-ball thriller as United clinch third title,Multan Sultans lose their third final in a row.,"

KARACHI: The Islamabad United players celebrate with the trophy after the PSL final, on Monday night. —Tahir Jamal / White Star

 
KARACHI: At the National Bank Stadium here on a Monday night, Karachi finally showed up. The house was full at the venue, which was criticised for low turnout all season, when it mattered the most.
And the HBL Pakistan Super League final did not disappoint. The crowds witnessed a thriller, which ended with Islamabad United captain Shadab Khan lifting the side’s third PSL trophy and Multan Sultans players ruing as many lost finals, this time by two wickets.
It had all come down to Imad Wasim’s nerves — he was caught on camera soothing them smoking a cigarette in the dressing room earlier, after having registered the first-ever five-wicket haul in a PSL finale.
Imad arrived at the crease after Martin Guptill was run out after scoring a half-century and putting up 47 with Azam Khan following United’s shaky start which had seen them go three down for 55 runs by the ninth over in their pursuit of 160 runs.

Multan Sultans lose their third final in a row

Imad saw Azam, Haider Ali and Faheem Ashraf fall cheaply on the other end, leaving United reeling at 129-6, needing 31 in three overs.
In came Naseem Shah — bringing with him memories of cruel match-winning knocks against Afghanistan — as he clobbered Iftikhar Ahmed for a big six over square-leg. Imad followed it up with two square drives, a magnificent one and a streaky one for two more boundaries.
Naseem (17 off 9) flicked it away off Mohammad Ali like an expert batter for four more, a leg-bye levelled the scores, only for him to edge a bouncer behind to Multan captain and wicket-keeper Rizwan on the penultimate ball.
Fittingly, he had left behind that one, winning run, for his brother Hunain to score and the right-hander squeezed it through the in-field on the off-side for a boundary, taking United across the line as the team’s whole camp ran into the ground. Out came the celebrations and the Palestine flags, as the United players waved them in their victory lap. Imad joined in, with 19 off 17 against his name.
Earlier, Multan were boosted to a competitive total by an Iftikhar onslaught in the last two overs of the innings.
In a surprising move by the side, the right-hander came into bat at number eight, with Multan having sent tailenders David Willey and Usama Mir up the order.
The move clearly did not materialise as Imad and Shadab ripped through the Sultans’ line-up, giving Iftikhar the stage to prove his worth.
The powerful batter launched medium pacer Tymal Mills out of the park in the 19th over for his first six and cleared midwicket for another on the very next ball as chants of “Chacha, Chacha” echoed round the stands.

In the last over, Iftikhar swivelled for four more, cleared backward square for another maximum and added a boundary on a no ball to spoil Naseem’s amazing figures of nine runs in three overs to 25 runs in four overs.
Iftikhar’s unbeaten 32 off 20 provided the much needed impetus to an innings that was held together by Rizwan’s 53-run partnership with Usman Khan, with the latter hitting 57 off 40 — his fourth fifty-plus score this season.
Shadab broke the stand at the halfway stage and went on to get Usman and Usama six overs later.
Imad, who had dismissed opener Yasir Khan and Willey in his opening spell and Johnson Charles in the 12th over, added the scalps of Khushdil and Chris Jordan to his name on consecutive balls in the 18th, which also saw Abbas Afridi get run out, thanks to a bullet throw by Shadab.

3,PIA flights to UK may resume  in May,CAA Additional Dire­ctor General Taimur Iqbal stated this while presiding over the 43rd E-Kacheri.,"RAWALPINDI: The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has expressed the hope that the Pakistan Int­ernational Airlines fli­ghts to the United King­dom would likely resume in May as inspections in this regard have been completed.
CAA Additional Dire­ctor General Taimur Iqbal stated this while presiding over the 43rd E-Kacheri.
A spokesman for the CAA said on Monday that E-Kacheri commenced with a review of the previous session, which included nine follow-up complaints.
Commenting on the follow-ups, the additional dir­ector general emphasised the importance of passengers knowing their rights and filing claims for grievances like flight cancellations. He said airlines needed to provide more inf­ormation than just saying ‘technical’ reasons for cancellations or delays lea­ding to cancellations.
About PIA flights to the UK, the additional DG exp­r­e­ssed the hope for an update in May as inspections have been completed.
In response to a complaint about Federal Inves­t­i­gation Agency (FIA) staff at the immigration co­u­nters, he said the age­ncy is responsible for assi­gning personnel to immigration counters, especially during peak hours.
The issue has been raised multiple times and it will be pursued further, he added.
In reply to a question about drones, he said a pol­icy document on drone is being prepared and it will be available on the CAA website once finalised.
Mr Iqbal, in response to a question regarding the investigation report of the PK 8303 crash, said there are specific procedures and requirements that must be followed to ensure accountability.
Addressing a complaint about lack of proper signage at Quetta International Airport’s parking lot, he instructed the staff concerned to designate spaces for special persons and install visible markings to assist passengers and other visitors.
In reply to a question about commencing flights from D.G. Khan to Dubai, he stated that currently no airline operates to the district due to it being economically non-viable.

4,"Pakistan, IMF extend talks to conclude SBA review",Wrap-up meeting today to finalise letter of intent and Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies.,"• Wrap-up meeting today to finalise letter of intent, MEFP
• Both sides agree on contingency measures to address data gaps
ISLAMABAD: With an apparent understanding reached during the final review of the $3 billion Standby Arrange­ment, the visiting staff mission of the Interna­tional Monetary Fund (IMF) and Pakistani authorities agreed on Monday to extend talks overnight to conclude the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP).
The fina­nce ministry had earlier annou­nced the schedule of rev­iew talks ending on March 18. However, inf­ormed sources said that the two sides had hectic sector-wise meetings, which were imp­acted by red­uced working hours due to Ramazan, thus spi­lling a couple of agenda items over to Tuesday (today).
The final wrap-up meeting, customarily represented by the finance minister, will now take place on Tuesday and the letter of intent (LoI) and MEFP on behalf of the minister and the governor of central bank will be finalised the same day. “Most of the work on the documentation is already complete,” an informed source said.
The sources told Dawn that the two sides had agreed on a set of contingency measures to address gaps in data in case of any slippages for the period ending March 31. The two sides would remain in contact on a ti­m­ely basis in the run-up to pre­sentation of Pakis­tan’s case to the Fund’s executive board for approval to the disbursement of final tranche of about $1.1bn in the first part of April. Pakistan has already received $1.9bn out of the $3bn SBA signed in July last year.
The two sides on Mon­day had detailed discussions on upgrading the Anti-Money Laun­dering (AML) and the Comba­ting the Fina­ncing of Terror (CFT) laws in line with best international practices as advised by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). These meetings, atten­ded by FBR, SBP, SECP, and other stakeholders, also covered the secrecy safeguards pertaining to access of banks data to assets documentation of public officials.
The sources said the banks would be bound to share data with FBR, but there would be standard protocols as to who could, to what extent, and in what format the data could be accessed to avoid its public disclosure. There would also be certain exemptions related to specific ‘holy offices’, but these exemptions would be limited to a few.
Officials also hinted at increasing the rate of petroleum development levy on sale of major oil products from the existing rate of Rs60 and the upper limit of Rs100 per litre may be provided for in the finance bill 2025, instead of any consideration for GST that mostly goes to the provinces.
The sources said Pak­is­tan has shared with the IMF mission a detail plan regarding a complete freeze on electricity and gas sector circular debt. The base electricity tariff would be revised with effect from July 1, 2024 in a manner that consumers would face predictable monthly fuel costs and quarterly adjustments, and start scaling down the outstanding circular debt, which stands at over Rs3 trillion, including Rs2.3trillion of fresh stock and over Rs700bn parked in Power Holding Company.
Similarly, the consumer-end gas tariff would also be revised upward effective from July 1, 2024, for which the regulatory process would be completed well ahead of the deadline. The schedule of tariff adjustments, both in the gas and power sectors, would be strictly followed, and this would also become part of the next ‘longer and larger’ programme with the IMF to be finalised on the sidelines of the April 15-20 spring meetings of the World Bank and the IMF.
The sources stated that the government has already shared with the fund mission the FBR’s digitalisation programme and has expressed its commitment to improving the tax system for the real estate sector.
For this purpose, and for the effective regulation of both the retail and wholesale sectors, related legislation and subordinate legislation will be included in the upcoming federal budget, harmonised with the provinces. Retailers will also be brought into the tax net through compulsory registration.
Alongside, the tax rates for non-filers in real estate transactions would be substantially and prohibitively increased and all the real estate societies and housing authorities would be registered with the relevant revenue authorities. Their transactions would be monitored on a pattern of points of sale (POS) network of retail sector and through the banking instruments.
In a related meeting, Sardar Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari, who was reassigned the ministerial portfolio for Power Division said in a statement that “circular debt has mounted to Rs3 trillion with an annual addition of approximately 700bn to 800bn, which adversely affects the economy of the country”. With unwavering determination, he is committed to undertaking every possible measure aimed at controlling circular debt and mitigating inefficiencies plaguing the power sector, hindering its progress, said the statement.

5,"Imran, Qureshi’s lawyer questions Azam’s conduct",Argues ex-principal secretary to the PM gave differing statements in cipher case.,"ISLAMABAD: Counsel for PTI leaders Imran Khan and Shah Mehmood Qureshi on Monday raised questions over the conduct of former principal secretary Azam Khan in the cipher case.
An Islamabad High Court (IHC) division bench, comprising Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, took up the bail pleas of the former prime minister and foreign minister who were sentenced to 10 years in the cipher case.
Barrister Salman Safdar argued that Mr Azam — the prosecution’s star witness in the case — allegedly went missing for about a month and only reappeared after the case’s First Information Report (FIR) was registered.
As per the counsel, Azam Khan as well as former finance minister Asad Umar were being probed in the case.

Argues ex-bureaucrat gave differing statements in cipher case; MNA Dogar expects PTI leaders’ ‘acquittal’ today

However, the former bureaucrat did not seek a pre-arrest bail when he was called by the FIA to record his statement before the investigation officer under Section 161 of the CrPC.
Mr Safdar argued that the prosecutor’s witness also testified before a magistrate under Section 164, but the statement before the Special Court was slightly different from what he had testified earlier.
When Justice Aurangzeb asked what was attributed to Mr Azam, the counsel replied that he was allegedly directed to prepare minutes of the meeting after receiving the cipher sent by the then ambassador to the US.
Barrister Safdar argued that the FIR levelled specific allegations against Mr Khan and Mr Qureshi because of their public statements regarding the cipher.
He recalled that the IHC denied post-arrest bail to the two PTI leaders, but the decision was overturned by the Supreme Court with some observations.
He pointed out that after the dismissal of Mr Qureshi’s bail plea, the IHC directed the court to conclude the trial in four weeks.
The trial court judge, the lawyer argued, “religiously followed” the directive and recorded the statements of 25 witnesses in one day despite the fact that IHC had earlier scrapped the case proceedings twice because of serious legal loopholes.
He argued that the judge even closed the defendants’ counsel’s right to examine the witnesses and appointed a state counsel for cross-examination.
The Official Secrets Act could be invoked for sharing sensitive information with the enemy state. However, the ex-PM and foreign minister were convicted under this law, which was unprecedented, Barrister Safdar argued.
Justice Farooq observed that the Act is over a century old, and parliament could have amended it to remove outdated sections. Later, the court adjourned proceedings till Tuesday (today).
Imran’s decision to join SIC
While talking to media outside the IHC, PTI MNA Malik Amir Dogar expressed hope that PTI leaders would be “acquitted” today.
He said the judges’ observations during the detailed hearing on Monday indicated that the case is nearing conclusion.
He also commented on the decision of PTI-backed winning candidates to join the Sunni Ittehad Council and said it was taken with Imran Khan’s permission.

6,"President to travel in 1st class, PM, services chiefs in business class",Austerity measures introduced to cut cost on foreign trips.,"• Austerity measures introduced to cut cost on foreign trips
• Cabinet members except foreign and commerce ministers restricted to three annual visits, exemptions apply
• MNAs, senior bureaucrats allowed business class
ISLAMABAD: The cash-strapped federal government on Monday issued a travel advisory for the president, prime minister, chief justice, services chiefs, and bureaucrats among others binding them to fly in certain classes to cut costs.
In a notification, the Cabinet Division said the president and the CJP will travel in ‘class-1’, whereas the PM, Senate chairman, National Assembly speaker, ministers, services chiefs, MNAs, federal secretaries, grade-22 officers and ambassadors will travel in business class.
Other officers of the federal government, attached departments, autonomous and semi-autonomous bodies, corporations and other institutions under the administrative control of various ministries/divisions will travel in economy class.
According to the advisory, foreign travel of officers shall be allowed only in cases of obligatory visits and that too in the economy class.
Non-obligatory visits
In case of non-obligatory visits that are to be funded, wholly or in part, by the government, an exemption shall be obtained from the austerity committee constituted by the Ministry of Finance in February 2024 or any successor austerity committee. Such visits, if not funded by the government, will not require the exemption. Similarly, not only the officers would be barred from staying in five-star hotels, but no support staff would accompany them on foreign visits. If required, Pakistan’s missions abroad can be approached for support staff.
In cases where funding by the government or its attached departments is involved, partial or complete, teleconferencing shall be the first preference in both obligatory and non-obligatory visits.
Approval process for visits
The cabinet members, federal and additional secretaries will have to get prior approval from the PM for travelling abroad. Similarly, the officials below grade 20 will have to get permission from the relevant minister and secretaries to go abroad.
If a delegation exceeds three members it will get permission from the PM through the Foreign Office, said the notification, adding that the PM may dispense with the requirement of routing the summaries for visits abroad through one or more divisions in cases of emergency.
It added that information about all foreign visits, irrespective of the approving authorities, would be immediately shared with the Foreign Affairs Division as well as the Pakistani missions in advance.
In cases of foreign visits by officials from the foreign ministry, a delegation of up to five members will be approved by the ministry but permission will have to be sought from the PM if it exceeds five members.
The notification said both the minister and the secretary of a ministry/division shall not be out of the country at the same time except for in “unavoidable and very exceptional circumstances”.
The ministries/divisions seeking such an exemption shall submit the case for approval of the PM and add a paragraph to the summary fully justifying the exemption being sought.
It said ministries/divisions shall ensure that to the maximum extent possible, officers of Pakistan embassies in the country in which a meeting/conference is to take place, represent Pakistan at such meetings. However, the ministries/divisions concerned shall provide proper briefing material to the Pakistan missions abroad well in time.
The conferences which can be handled by Pakistan missions abroad will be identified and proper intimation shall be sent to the missions concerned. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs shall coordinate in such matters. In case a visit is considered unavoidable, it should be explicitly mentioned in the summary as to why the Pakistan mission abroad cannot handle the issue.
The cabinet members will not be allowed to travel abroad more than three times in a year except for special circumstances. However, foreign and commerce ministers will be exempted from this restriction. All divisions should obtain NOC from the Economic Affairs Divisions for visits with respect to international financial institutions.
For workshops of government officers up to BS-19, where no government funding is involved, the establishment division in consultation with all ministries/divisions shall formulate detailed policy guidelines. Till such time that these guidelines are issued, the current dispensation shall continue.
The notification said that no minister or government functionary shall solicit at their own an invitation for participation in trainings, seminars, conferences, workshops, meetings etc. from any source.
Members of the National Security Committee, federal ministers, ministers of state, advisers, SAPMs, persons holding the status of federal minister or minister of state without cabinet rank, parliamentary secretaries, and provincial governors shall not avail of any offer of airfare or per-diem made by a foreign government or international agency for a visit abroad except made by the UN agencies/OIC.
Summaries seeking orders from the PM should reach him 14 days before the visit abroad through the finance and foreign ministries (where applicable) and shall contain details of the expenditure involved, including the foreign exchange component and balance in the relevant budget head (in the main body of the summary) and details of previous visits abroad during the last twelve months.
