0,"State Life plans reserve fund for cancer treatment, dialysis under Sehat Card in KP",Asks government to provide Rs400m for initiative.,"PESHAWAR: After receiving Rs5 billion from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government last Monday for the resumption of its health insurance scheme, the State Life Insurance Corporation has sought Rs400 million additional funds to set up a “reserve fund” to ensure uninterrupted cancer treatment as well as dialysis for patients covered by the Sehat Card Plus, say officials.
They told Dawn that the SCP resumed in the province’s hospitals in both the public and private sectors on March 12 after remaining partially suspended for more than one year.
The officials said 9,000 patients were admitted to hospitals in the province in the last week for free treatment under the government’s health insurance programme.
They added that Rs177.1 million was spent on the patients admitted.

Asks government to provide Rs400m for initiative

The officials said they had informed health minister Syed Qasim Ali Shah that the SCP required to establish a reserve fund to make sure that cancer patients and those with damaged kidneys could avail themselves of complete care under the health insurance scheme.
 
 

They said cancer and kidney failure required long treatment and extra money.
The officials said normally, patients got free treatment when its cost stayed within the limit of Rs400,000, but if the cost went beyond that, the remaining amount was paid from the reserve fund, but that currently didn’t exist.
They said under the SCP, every family permanently living in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa could avail itself of health services up to Rs1 million annually, but if Rs400,000 was spent, the matter was sent to a committee to sanction the rest of the amount from the reserve fund.
The officials said the Sehat Card programme was launched in 2015, covering a few people in four selected districts, but was later expanded to the entire population of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
They said under the programme, Rs70.342 billion had been spent on the treatment of 2.812 million people, and the treatment included 164 kidney and 64 liver transplants, 169,107 cardiac procedures, 530,041 dialysis sessions, and 54,710 chemotherapy cases.
The officials said liver transplants cost Rs5 million and renal transplants Rs1.4 million and no plans were in the works to resume them.
They added that the SLIC, the executor of the programme, had received Rs5 billion from the government but Rs17 billion dues had yet to be cleared.
“The insurer will decide about transplants when it gets more government funding. We are waiting for these procedures to resume,” an official told Dawn.
He, however, said dialysis and cancer treatments were very important and the patients couldn’t be left halfway through treatment.
“Most of these patients consume their permissible limit in four to six months and have to suffer for the rest of the year,” he said.
The official said the health minister was briefed about the situation and was hopeful about the early release of funds.
He said the patients needing cancer treatment and dialysis were generally very poor, and while the cost of treatment was very high, the government wanted to ensure their free care without interruption.
 
 

Other officials said the programme suffered during the last caretaker government in the province as it didn’t allocate money to keep it afloat.
They said the SLIC used to suspend and resume the programme during the caretaker government due to a lack of funds, while free services were restricted to cancer, dialysis, and emergencies in Oct 2023.
The officials said the people requiring cardiac care had also been awaiting the provision of free health services since the re-launch of the SCP last week.
They, however, said the people needing liver and renal transplants were likely to get much benefit from the programme as both procedures consumed Rs5 million and Rs1.4 million, respectively.
The officials said the suspension of SCP had adversely impacted more than 20 people, who had already undergone many investigations prior to renal transplants at hospitals, but there were no prospects that their free procedures would take place anytime soon.
They said the PTI, which pioneered the programme, was required to ensure the provision of funds for transplants.
The officials, however, said patients requiring transplants had to wait as the State Life Insurance Corporation was expecting more funds to come in from the government to resume transplants.
They said the insurer had received Rs5 billion from the government and would get Rs3 billion more on a monthly basis to run the programme across the province.

2,KP opposition to move court on reserved seats issue,Urge KP Assembly speaker to call a session for the swearing-in of women on reserved seats.,"PESHAWAR: Opposition members in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly on Monday said if the oath was not administered to women lawmakers elected to reserved seats, the court of law and the Election Commission of Pakistan would be approached for relief.
They urged Speaker of the assembly Babar Saleem Swati to call a session for the swearing-in of those women, saying the house was incomplete without them for the Senate elections to be held on April 2.
“Oaths are not being administered to women MPAs elected to reserved seats. If the KP Assembly session is not called, we [the opposition] will approach the court of law and the ECP,” Opposition Leader in the KP Assembly Dr Ibadullah Khan told a presser here.
Dr Khan, a PML-N member, was joined by Ahmad Kundi of the Pakistan Peoples Party, Arbab Usman of the Awami National Party and Malik Taiq Awan and Sobia Shahid of the PML-N.
He alleged that Speaker of the assembly Babar Saleem Swati was acting like a worker for his party.
The opposition leader said the recent meeting between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur in Islamabad was a positive development.
Mr Kundi said issues were always resolved in parliament.
He said if someone had any issue with the Feb 8 general elections, it should be discussed and resolved inside parliament.
“[The PTI] ... did not receive any reserved seats under the law, while the opposition got them legally. This will not be good if the Senate elections are held without women elected to reserved seats,” said ANP member Arbab Usman.
He added that the ANP supported other members of the opposition benches and would always raise a voice for democracy.

4,24 universities in KP working without regular VCs,Academician says absence of full-time heads affects performance of higher education institutions.,"PESHAWAR: The number of universities functioning without regular vice-chancellors rose to 24 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as five more vice-chancellors completed their tenure on March 16, according to sources.
“It is alarming that out of 34 public sector universities in the province, 24 are not headed by a regular vice-chancellor,” an academician at University of Peshawar told Dawn. He said that absence of regular vice-chancellors was affecting the universities administratively and financially.
Sources said that 19 public sector universities were already functioning without regular VCs while the tenure of five more heads of universities completed on March 16. They said that the VCs of Fata University Dara Adamkhel, Islamia College University Peshawar, University of Buner, Women University Mardan and University of Chitral completed their tenure on March 16.
 
 

They said that eight universities had been functioning without regular VCs for the last one year.
They said that the public sector universities working without regular VCs for the last one year included Abbottabad University of Science and Technology, Gomal University Dera Ismail Khan, Khushal Khan Khattak University Karak, University of Agriculture Dera Ismail Khan, University of Lakki Marwat, Hazara University Mansehra, University of Engineering and Technology Mardan and Women University Swabi.

Academician says absence of full-time heads affects performance of higher education institutions

Similarly, seven universities including Abdul Wali Khan University Mardan, Bacha Khan University Charsadda, Shuhada-i-APS University of Technology Nowshera, Kohat University of Science and Technology, University of Peshawar, University of Science and Technology Bannu and University of Engineering Peshawar have been functioning without regular VCs for the last three months.
Sources said that the newly-established universities including University of Agriculture Swat, University of Engineering and Applied Sciences Swat, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Swat and University of Shangla were also working without regular VCs.
They said that the process for appointment VCs of 19 public universities had been completed two months ago. They added that provincial government was reluctant to notify the names of VCs without any justification, prolonging the unnecessary delay.
The academic search committee for the appointment of vice-chancellors has conducted interviews of aspirants for VCs of 19 universities from January 22 to 26.
 
 

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Universities Act, 2021, has empowered the academic search committee to conduct interviews of candidates for the post of vice-chancellors and recommend to the government a panel of three persons for selection of a VC from each panel.
Sources said that in light of the interviews for VCs of 19 universities, the academic search committee had recommended to the government a panel of three candidates for each university. They added that the recommended panels were also approved by the previous caretaker cabinet and signed by the caretaker chief minister.
However, instead of notifying the appointment of VCs, the authorities at the helm of affairs forwarded the names of the shortlisted candidates to intelligence agencies for security clearance, they said. “Security agencies have given clearance of potential VCs a month ago but despite that the government is reluctant to appoint regular VCs of universities,” they added.
Section 12 of the law states: “The vice-chancellor shall be appointed by the chancellor on the advice of government from a panel of three candidates recommended by the academic search committee.”
When asked about the government intentions regarding the possible changes in the panels shortlisted and recommended by the academic search committee, an official at higher education department said that as per decision of Supreme Court of Pakistan, the chief minister was required to recommend the name on top of the panel as VC to the governor, the chancellor of the public sector universities in the province.
The judgment of Supreme Court of Pakistan issued on July 28, 2018 states: “The person, who stands first in the merit, shall be appointed as vice-chancellor except if the government has any reason not to appoint him, which reason(s) shall be recorded in writing. Such reasons and validity thereof shall always be justifiable by the court of law.”
Minister for Higher Education Meena Khan was not available for comments.

6,Asfandyar Wali wins defamation suit against Shaukat Yousafzai,"PTI leader had accused ANP chief of ""selling Pashtuns for $25m"".","PESHAWAR: Awami National Party chief Asfandyar Wali Khan has won Rs150 million in a defamation lawsuit against Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf leader and former provincial minister Shaukat Ali Yousafzai.
Additional district and session judge Ejazur Rehman Qazi announced an ex parte verdict in the case as Mr Yousafzai didn’t attend court proceedings.
Mr Asfandyar had sued the PTI leader through his counsel, including Tariq Afghan and Sajeed Afridi, for alleging in a presser on July 25, 2019, that the ANP chief had “sold Pashtuns for $25 million.”
Mr Yousafzai was the spokesman for the then PTI government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The counsel for Mr Asfandyar told the court that their client was the son of Pakhtun leader Khan Abdul Wali Khan and the grandson of Pakhtun leader Bacha Khan, both prominent leaders of international repute in the Independence Movement.

PTI leader had accused ANP chief of ‘selling Pashtuns for $25m’

They added that Mr Asfandyar had served as a member of the National Assembly four times and as a senator and a member of the KP Assembly once.
The lawyers insisted that the defendant made the defamatory accusation against their client intentionally to “adversely affect his reputation in the public mind and lower his status in public.”
In the five-page detailed judgement, the court declared that the parties were asked to list witnesses, which they did, and to produce evidence in the case.
It added that the plaintiff produced six witnesses and the defendant just one, but during the “course of the defendant’s evidence,” the defendant failed to attend the court, so he was proceeded against ex parte.
The court declared that the burden to prove the issue was on the defendant, but as he had been proceeded against ex parte, no evidence was available on record from him to prove his contention.
Regarding the issue of the plaintiff being entitled to the recovery of Rs100 million in damages and Rs50 million in aggravated damages, it noted that the burden to prove the matter was on the plaintiff, who produced six witnesses, including his attorney.
“The careful perusal of the record produced by witnesses revealed that the defendant made derogatory remarks during a news conference that were published by newspapers and failed to submit any explanation or justification for them.
He also failed to submit that his remarks during the news conference were not derogatory, i.e., slander and libel, but truth. Therefore, the issue was decided in favour of the plaintiff,“ it ruled.
The court also declared that the plaintiff successfully established the “cause of action and entitlement of decree,” so both issues were decided in his favour.
“In view of what has been discussed above, the lawsuit of the plaintiff is decreed in favour of the plaintiff as prayed,” it ruled in the verdict.

10,High court reserves judgement on ‘bogus’ FIRs against family,Petition was filed by CDA officer after judicial magistrate absolved Sialkot-based family of charges,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) reserved its decision on a petition related to registration of bogus First Information Reports (FIRs) against a family by a director of Capital Development Authority (CDA).
IHC Justice Babar Sattar was hearing the petition filed by CDA’s Director Iftikhar Ali Haideri against the order of a judicial magistrate absolving the Sialkot-based family without handing over their custody to police on physical remand. 
During the hearing last week, the court took notice of a report filed by the superintendent of police (SP) Special Investigation Unit (SIU) Rukhsar Mehdi which accused Mr Haideri of using his influence to register bogus FIRs against the family to settle a personal score.
As per the report, the FIRs were registered in three police stations in Islamabad after a brawl between Haideri’s brother and the family in Sialkot. A woman had approached the police against the registration of the FIRs against her husband, son, grandson and a daughter in the Sumbal, Banigala and Industrial Area police stations of Islamabad and Sialkot. SP Mehdi initiated the probe and in his report termed the registration of criminal cases against the family a “mockery of the justice system.”

Petition was filed by CDA officer after judicial magistrate absolved Sialkot-based family of charges

The report added, “There is one government officer Iftikhar Ali Haideri [who] has played havoc with the entire justice system.” 
As per the report, Mr Haideri’s brother Qamar Abbas had a brawl with the applicant’s family in Sialkot and since then the officer “was trying to settle his score by twisting the long arm of law.”
The report stated, “This entire plot hatched by this government officer is shameless but the height of the shame is when an innocent young lady got arrested by the Gujrat police and later on by the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) police in false and criminal cases on the day she was to wed.”
The report recommended that the “officer Mr Iftikhar Ali Haideri must answer for whatever dirty games he played”.
The investigation found that “the FIRs of Sumbal and Banigala police stations are false whereas the implication of the victims in Industrial Area police station is a lie.” The report recommended that “the said government officer must face the law for violating it so ruthlessly.”
Mr Mehdi appeared before the court and stated that he was assigned the inquiry into the matter by the higher authorities.
He said that during the course of inquiry, he recorded statements of the relevant persons and perused the available record.
The court asked as to why he did not initiate further proceeding against the CDA’s officer? Mr Mehdi replied that it was beyond his mandate as he was assigned to probe the matter only.
Justice Sattar sought the relevant record and reserved his decision.

11,27 welfare centres set up in Mansehra,MANSEHRA: Authorities have established 27 more family welfare centres here amid the rising use of contraceptives....,"MANSEHRA: Authorities have established 27 more family welfare centres here amid the rising use of contraceptives.
“These family welfare centres will cater for the unmet contraceptive needs of married couples in the rural parts of Mansehra,” district population welfare officer Saifur Rehman told Dawn on Monday.
He said the rate of contraceptive use in the district was 47 per cent.
Official data showed a surge in the number of couples, especially women, opting for family planning methods in the district in recent years.
It revealed that Mansehra’s 44,362 women used contraceptives in the financial year 2021–22, but the number went to 65,143 next year (2022–23).
“We expect more families to use contraceptive devices and medications in the current fiscal year,” Mr Rehman said, adding that 53,360 women had so far visited 27 family welfare centres to avail themselves of family planning services.
He said employees were being appointed to the new centres, whose tally had reached 59 in the district.
Deputy district officer of population welfare (technical) Dr Rabail Siraj said more and more couples, especially women, were preferring modern contraceptive methods to traditional ones.
“All modern contraception methods, including pills, subcutaneous implants, and surgeries, are more reliable and safer against sexually transmitted diseases and hepatitis B and C than the traditional methods,” she said.
Dr Rabail said permanent surgery for men for birth control was one of the most reliable and safest modern ways, but almost no one in Mansehra went for it.
She said the number of residents using modern contraceptive methods was increasing fast due to their “socio-economic conditions.”
“Over 118,000 women opted for family planning in our district from July 2022 to Feb 2024,” she said.

Officials said that the two arrested men, both locals, were allegedly hired by the custom officials for collection of illegal money from truckers in order to ‘facilitate’ their out of turn crossing of the border.”
Transporters alleged that custom staff conducted prompt clearance of goods and then issued gate pass to truckers after taking a hefty amount from them.
Sources in Torkham said that 100 to 150 loaded vehicles were allowed out of turn to cross the border while the rest were made to wait for several days both at the border and on the main road due to slow process of custom clearance.
Security officials said that they also recovered Rs185,000 from the two arrested men which they said was unlawfully collected from truckers at the border crossing.
However, sources said that Monday’s arrest of two civilians working on behalf of custom authorities was a tit for tat of the Friday’s arrest of the cook of border security forces for alleged smuggling of foreign currency to Afghanistan.
They said that security forces had taken into custody two civilians working for police at Charwazgai and Michni checkposts for their alleged involvement in taking illegal money from transporters.
