5,Traders’ body puts its weight behind corporate farming,HYDERABAD: The Hyderabad Chamber of Small Traders & Small Industry president Mohammad Farooq Shaikhani has ...,"HYDERABAD: The Hyderabad Chamber of Small Traders & Small Industry president Mohammad Farooq Shaikhani has lauded federal government’s initiative for crafting a corporate farming policy aimed at advancing Pakistan’s agriculture sector.
Mr Shaikhani said in a statement issued here on Monday that formulation of a National Seed Policy and enactment of Agriculture Development Authority Act were badly needed to facilitate the corporate farming.
He said that 90pc of landholders had small pieces of land measuring from five to 12 acres and expressed concerns over absence of statistics and required mechanism for ascertaining eligibility of subsidy for bona fide recipients under the new agriculture policy. 
He feared that without data collection the policy might inadvertently favour big landowners thus neglecting smaller cultivators and perpetuating disparities.
He said that Pakistan’s significant agricultural potential with 40pc of cultivable land could address the nation’s food needs and advocated adoption of international farming technologies, including researched seeds, high-quality pesticides, urea and modern machinery to substantially increase crop yields.
He called for ensuring market prices for seeds, urea, pesticides and agricultural commodities, alongside providing subsidies to farmers and highlighted adverse impact of rising production costs and fluctuating crop prices on farmers’ livelihoods and government’s reputation, emphasising the need for immediate attention towards mitigating these challenges.
He stressed the need for bringing a green revolution to drive agricultural development in Pakistan, advocating strategic crop selection based on land suitability. With decline in international wheat prices, he said, a shift was needed for growing commodities that were imported like palm oil. 
Mr Shaikhani recommended a halt to sugar cane cultivation due to its being high delta crop, and redirecting resources towards cultivating other valuable food crops, including cotton. It was a proactive measure, he said.
He said that Pakistan’s position as the seventh largest agricultural nation globally, drawing attention to a planning and development ministry report which revealed that 24pc of Pakistan’s population approximately accounted for 55m individuals who lived below poverty line.
He said that 29pc Pakistanis suffered from undernourishment, 40pc among them children. Pakistan’s human development index stood at 0.544, ranking 161 out of 192 countries while its placement at 102 out of 126 countries in Global Hunger Index highlighted the need for policy reforms. These statistics indicated disconnect between policy formulation and ground realities, showing systemic bias that favoured the elite, he said.
He proposed that policies including agriculture development policy be crafted and executed at state level in order to emphasise their stability and credibility among international organisations. By decentralising policy-making, continuity could be ensured, independent of changes in government leadership, he said.

7,Bandits in Kandhkot-Kashmore kill teacher who defied their ‘rule’ by going to school in no-go area,"Viral video clip shows the slain teacher, armed with a gun for safety, going to school with his students.","SUKKUR: Dacoits gunned down a primary schoolteacher, when he was driving to his school on a motorcycle along Hazaro Shakh (water channel) on Magsi-Karampur road near Tangwani town, Kandhkot-Kashomre district, on Monday.
The teacher Allah Rakhiyo Nandwani, a resident of Khando Khan Nandwani, taught at a cluster primary school in Nasrullah Khan Bijarani village, which was considered a ‘no-go’ area.
He had recently earned fame and great respect through his videos uploaded on social media in which he expressed his determination to continue to defy bandit-rule by going to the “no-go” area regularly to educate children.
A video clip that showed the slain teacher armed with a double barreled gun going to his school along with his young students went viral on the social media. He could be heard in the video saying that he had taken up the weapon for his safety and would go to the school even at great risk to his life.
The video attracted thousands of social media users, who appreciated his resolve and lashed out at the area police’s criminal negligence in protecting lives of general public, especially teachers.
The way the outlaws fired straight at the teacher’s chest showed they had targeted him to make him an example for others who might dare to challenge their control and end their fear.
Sources said the dacoits managed to escape away with the teacher’s motorcycle into nearby riverine area.
Police said that they rushed to the area after receiving information about the teacher’s murder and shifted his body to Karampur taluka hospital. The body was handed over to heirs after completion of medico-legal formalities, they said.
The news about the teacher’s brutal killing spread like jungle fire on social media, with netizens heaping harsh criticism on district police and promoting Sindh Minister for Home Zia Lanjar to direct Larkana DIG to submit to him a report about the incident.
Family stages protest
The bereaved family along with a large number of supporters placed the teacher’s dead body on the Kandhkot-Thull road at Magsi stop and staged a demonstration, blocking all vehicular movement on the road.
The victim’s brothers, Mithal Nandwani and Moula Bakhsh Nandwani, who led the protest, said that no one was safe on roads where highwaymen committed crimes without fear of police and recklessly killed people over resistance.
They demanded their brother’s killers should be brought to justice and people should be protected from criminals and dacoits.
A few hours later, DSP Tangwani arrived there and assured the protesters of the killers’ arrest. Thereafter, they called off the protest.
Sources said the victim had left behind two wives, two daughters and a young son besides a large number of relatives, students and admirers to mourn his death.

THATTA: A large group of experts, including historians, researchers, archaeologists and columnists, along with several octogenarian locals, gathered here to share their knowledge and findings to challenge the “fabricated” and “concocted” versions that distorted facts about ‘Noori Jam Tamachi’, a folktale recognised by historians as the true love story of Queen Noori and Samma Dynasty ruler Jam Nizamuddin Tamachi.
The authentic history books characterise Noori as one of the seven well-researched queens of Sindh. 
The distortion of certain facts highlighted by the group of experts was endorsed by the octogenarian locals present at the gathering. They appeared sure that the grave on the tiny island in Keenjhar Lake frequented by around 10,000 tourists, picnickers and history buffs on weekends for decades is not of the legendary figure, Noori. In fact, her grave is the one present beside the tomb of Jam Nizamuddin Tamachi under a canopy at the Makli necropolis in Thatta, according to the participants of the discussion.
The claim made in unison at the gathering was based on an extensive study, site visits and interviews with knowledgeable figures and other locals all undertaken by the group of experts, who included historian and former senator Dr Karim Khuwaja, former director general of culture & tourism department Dr Mohammad Ali Manjhi, noted environmentalist and history analyst Masood Lohar and columnist Zahid Ishaque Soomro. Their aim was to rectify fallacies in order to present a correct one of Sindh’s most interesting parts of history and the keenly revealed folktale for the future generations. 
The folktale is found in the poetry of revered sufi Saint Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai and is focused particularly in the compositions ‘Sur Kamod’ and ‘Sur Karayal’. Other literary giants such as Sheikh Ayaz and Sajid Soomro also reveal the tale in their poetry and prose works that further glorify the characters and fascinate history buffs. 
According to the group’s research, it was during expansion work of Keenjhar Lake in the recent past that the island emerged. It actually had the graves of Samma Dynasty ruler Hoondrro Shah and his son, both spiritual figures as well. However, according to the research, the guides and other people extending hospitality to foreign and local tourists unknowingly distorted the facts making people to believe that the grave present near her spiritual leader Hoondrro Shah was of Noori. Octogenarian locals including Dada Adam Gandhro and Jummo Mirbahar appeared in agreement with the view. 
The 14th century Samma Dynasty was founded by Jam Unnar and extended its rule across the Indus valley spread over a territory covering the present day Pakistan and some parts of India. 
Samma rulers are known for their administrative reforms and patronage of arts. They played a significant role in shaping up the cultural landscape of Sindh. Jam Nizamuddin is revered for his great contributions to governance and culture. 
The experts at the gathering asserted that Sindh government, media, literati, historians and all other concerned people must put in their efforts and revisit this particular part of Sindh’s history and facts for the sake of accuracy. 
According to facts, Noori was born to King Jasodhan and Marviyat Rani but was raised by the Gandra tribe. The ‘Noori Jam Tamachi’ tale reveals that a prince, Tamachi, fell in deep love with Noori, who was exceptionally cute and attractive, during a hunting expedition in the Keenjhar Lake area. The love affair led to their marriage and her ascension to the position of queen.
Numerous fascinating versions of the folktale and its reflection in the poetry of Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai and works of many other literati, researchers and scholars made Noori and Jam Tamachi immortal figures, hence attracting people to their eternal abodes.

9,Rangers vacate historical Radio Pakistan building after eight years,Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation plans to move back news section and most operations to the building.,"KARACHI: The big old banyan tree in one corner of the premises still lends the same shade it provided to the famous limestone building with the minarets and its surrounding barracks all these years. But the wooden cage for the hummingbirds built around its base is empty now. The clay nesting pots, too, are as vacant as the main building.
The doors to the main building have been closed with little white slips with the date ‘18-01-2024’ pasted on them with Scotch tape. They also have ‘PBC Project Cell (South Zone)’ stamped on them.
This is the current situation at the historical landmark building of Radio Pakistan on M.A. Jinnah Road after it along with the bird cages was quietly vacated by the Anti-Terrorist Wing of Sindh Rangers around the second week of January after around eight years. The cement barriers are still there, outside the main gate so not many realised the move back to normality.
“Yes, true, we have vacated the Radio Pakistan building,” a Sindh Rangers spokesman confirmed to Dawn.

PBC plans to move back news section and most operations to the building

When asked the reason for the sudden move, he sounded exasperated.
“All this while the media has been pointing fingers at us, calling us squatters. And now that we have left the building, you also have an issue with that? Look, we don’t barge into places ourselves. It was only a temporary arrangement provided to us by the Government of Sindh. We have now moved to a new place, designed according to our needs, near the Toll Plaza in Gadap,” he informed.
“Well, if you think about it, this was really not an ideal place for the Ranger to begin with,” said a senior Radio Pakistan employee on condition of anonymity. “They are more comfortable in open cantonment areas, not in the middle of the city. I’m sure they also must have had their own safety issues here,” the senior employee pointed out.
While the Rangers were housed in the old building, Radio Pakistan Karachi operated from another building near the Civic Centre in Gulshan-i-Iqbal.
The Rangers were not responsible for that move. The step had been taken after fire broke out in the old building back in October of 2007. The Rangers only arrived there in 2015 to look over security arrangements during Muharram.
While they stayed for some eight years, it must be mentioned here that they did not interfere with Radio Pakistan‘s work being carried out at the old building such as planning at the project cell and the publication of the Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation’s monthly Urdu magazine Ahang from there.
Now, there are plans to slowly but gradually move back most operations, starting with sales and marketing, and news section to the historic building.
The building was inaugurated on July 16, 1951, following the Karachi station’s move there from the Intelligence School on Queen’s Road where medium wave transmission from Karachi had kicked off soon after Partition under the able guidance of stalwarts of the likes of Z.A. Bukhari, Shahid Ahmed Dehlvi, S.M. Saleem and Abdul Majid.

10,More than 600 confiscated birds released by wildlife dept,KARACHI: The provincial wildlife authorities on Monday rescued 635 birds from two places in the city.,"KARACHI: The provincial wildlife authorities on Monday rescued 635 birds from two places in the city.
Officials said that 375 red-vented bulbul and 150 house sparrows were rescued from the Empress Market.
A total of 110 house sparrows were confiscated from vendors selling the birds near Kala Pul. The birds were later released in Malir.
“Acting on a tip-off, we raided a spot at the Empress Market where we found house sparrows and red-vented bulbul in cages left near a shop. No suspect could be arrested,” wildlife officer Ashfaq Ali Memon told Dawn.
The official, who is currently posted at the Empress Market, said that investigation into the case was continuing.
“All shopkeepers at the Empress Market have been informed about the law on wildlife species and they have been asked to cooperate,” he said.
According to experts, the avian population across the city has declined drastically over the years. 
They blame multiple factors for this phenomenon including shrinking green spaces, growing urbanisation, use of pesticides, release of hazardous radiation from mobile phone towers as well as rampant poaching.
Given this situation, the provincial wildlife authorities launched on March 17 “Let’s count the sparrows” campaign with an aim to create public awareness about sparrow conservation and protection. The result of the counting would be released on Wednesday (tomorrow) to mark World Sparrow Day.

An employees’ union of the PIA and the Society of Aircraft Engineers of Pakistan (SAEP) have jointly moved the SHC and submitted that the federal government was taking steps to privatise/sale the PIA and the Privatisation Commission had also appointed a British firm as financial adviser for this purpose.
Referring to some rulings of the apex court, the petitioners contended that only an elected government could take major policy decisions.
They asked the court to declare all actions taken by the caretaker set-up for the privatisation of the PIA null and void and without lawful authority.
They also impugned the amendments in the PIAC (Conversion) Act, 2016 authorising the federal government to issue fresh shares or cancel any shares as it may deem fit.
They argued that such an amendment was made in violation of the company law and the authority in this regard was not vested with the government; whereas the impugned amendment had also been carried out to facilitate the privatisation of the national flag carrier.
After a preliminary hearing, a two-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi issued pre-admission notices to the respondents for April 3.

14,Digital payment system for Peoples Bus Service from next month,Sharjeel says electric buses will run on two more routes,"KARACHI: Sindh government on Monday announced starting two more routes under Peoples Bus Service in Karachi after Eid while launching the same service next month in Mirpurkhas and introducing prepaid payment system from April 18 that would gradually replace payment of fare in cash.
These developments were announced by Sindh Transport Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon while addressing a press conference at his office.
He also hinted at procurement of 500 more buses very soon which would become part of the fleet of Peoples Bus Service.
Mr Memon, who also holds the portfolio of excise and taxation, said after Eid, two more routes of electric buses would be introduced in Karachi and the service was set to be expanded to Mirpurkhas after Ramazan. 
The Sindh government, he said, in first phase had planned to launch People’s Bus Service in every divisional headquarter and the target was almost achieved.

Sharjeel says electric buses will run on two more routes

“Now after the success of first phase, we would launch the service in every district headquarter,” he added.
He said from April 18, automated fare collection system would be introduced on routes of People’s Bus Service in Karachi that would offer prepaid cards to passengers which could be used on all routes of the service and also the BRTs Green Line and Orange. 
“From April 18, this automated system is being introduced for Route-1 and Route-9,” said Mr Memon. “Once it starts running successfully, the system would be introduced on all routes. It would bring major relief for the passengers as the same prepaid card would be used on all public transport schemes whether it’s Green Line, Orange Line or the upcoming BRT projects.”
He blamed the “lethargic approach” of the caretaker government that failed to introduce the automated fare system despite the fact that the past government of the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) had completed all groundwork and technical formalities before its terms came to end.
“Another major development is that we are going to start ground-breaking of BRT Yellow Line after Eid and in first phase Jam Sadiq Bridge in Korangi would be rebuilt as part of the project,” said the transport minister.

15,CEC issued notice on PTI pleas seeking contempt proceedings,SHC directs alleged contemnors to file comments by 28th; warns no further adjournment will be granted,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court (SHC) on Monday issued notices to the chief election commissioner (CEC) and others on applications filed by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf-backed independent candidates, seeking contempt proceedings against the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for not deciding their complaints against provisional results of general elections through ‘speaking orders’.
A two-judge bench, headed by Chief Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi, warned that an appropriate order may be passed if detailed reasons had yet not been written in those matters.
It also directed the alleged contemnors to files comments before March 28 and said that in future, no further adjournment would be granted on any ground.
Citing CEC Sikandar Sultan Raja and four members of the ECP as well as provincial election commissioner, Sindh as alleged contemnors, PTI-Sindh president Haleem Adil Shaikh and two other party-backed aspirants in their contempt applications submitted that they had not complied with the SHC order passed on Feb 13 regarding their election complaints.

SHC directs alleged contemnors to file comments by 28th; warns no further adjournment will be granted

At the outset of the hearing on Monday, deputy director-ECP Abdullah Hanjrah appeared on behalf of the alleged contemnors and sought copies of the contempt applications.
He also requested for time to seek instructions and to file reply/objection.
Deputy Attorney General (DAG) Khaleeq Ahmed and Assistant Advocate General (AAG) Saifullah also made similar requests and the lawyer for the applicants Ali Tahir undertook to provide the same during the course of day.
In the first instance, the bench said that comments be called before the next date with an advance copy to the lawyer for the applicants.
However, it clarified that “if detailed reasons had not yet been written in the instant cases, learned counsel for petitioners present in court may be justified to allege that in the aforesaid petitions, the delay had deliberately been made and earlier court order had not been complied with in letter and spirit whereby a cut of date was also given for such purpose”.
“Therefore this court shall be constrained to call for the entire record and proceedings from the office of Election Commission of Pakistan, whereas, some concerned officials along with entire record of the petitioners’ cases, including Forms 45 and 47 in respect of the petitioners for the purpose of verification and thereafter, appropriate order may be passed in the instant petitions. No further adjournment on any ground will be granted on the next date,” the bench in its order added.
Adjourning the hearing till March 28, the bench asked its office that a copy of this order may be supplied cover-in-hand to the deputy director-ECP as well as DAG and AAG for onward transmission to the quarters concerned.
The PTI’s provincial chief submitted that he had contested election from NA-238 (Karachi East-VI) and as per the Form-45s, he was leading with around 65,000 votes, but the results were changed at the office of returning officer since he was shown as runner-up in the impugned Form-47s/provisional result.
PTI-backed Abbas Hasnain and Khalid Mehmood also contended that they contested the Feb 8 general elections from NA-247 (Karachi Central-I) and NA-231 (Karachi Malir-III), respectively, and according to From-45s, they were also leading with big margins, but they were shown defeated in the impugned Form-47s/provisional results.
The applicants submitted that on Feb 13, the SHC had disposed of around 50 identical petitions filed by the PTI-backed aspirants against provisional results and had ordered the ECP to decide the petitioners’ complaints through ‘speaking orders’ before Feb 22.
They also stated that about issues regarding consolidation of results, the SHC had also directed the ECP to resolve the discrepancy in Form-45s and Form-47s (provisional results) after scrutinising the record available with the ECP or provided by the petitioners.
However, they submitted that the alleged contemnors had dismissed their complaints without speaking orders and passed the actual short orders on Feb 23, but put the date of Feb 21 on such orders to mislead the court.
The applicants also argued that the election watchdog had also not resolved the issue regarding discrepancies found in Form-45s and Form-47s.
They further stated that the alleged contemnors had committed deliberate and wilful contempt of SHC’s Feb 13 order and rendered themselves liable to be proceeded and prosecuted for contempt of court.

16,Two PTI candidates move court for registration of case against ROs,KARACHI: Two Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf-backed independent candidates approached the district and sessions judge ...,"KARACHI: Two Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf-backed independent candidates approached the district and sessions judge (West) on Monday, seeking directives for the registration of FIRs against the returning officers (ROs) of NA-242 and NA-243 for the alleged fraud during the Feb 8 elections.
The candidates, Dawa Khan from NA-242 and Advocate Shujaat Ali Khan from NA-243, submitted the applications under Section 22-A of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), seeking instructions for the respondents, SP of the Complaint Cell (West) and SHO of SITE-A police station, to initiate cases against the polling staff of the said constituencies.
In his application, Dawa Khan claimed that according to Form-45s available to him, bearing signature, thumb impressions with CNIC numbers of the concerned presiding officers and polling agents, he had secured 53,910 votes while Muttahida Quami Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) candidate Mustafa Kamal bagged 24,283.
In addition, Shujaat claimed to have received 49,294 votes while his opponent Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) candidate Abdul Qadir Patel, secured 43,045 votes.
But according to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), both PTI leaders finished as runners-up in the elections, with NA-242 won by the MQM-P candidate who secured 71,767 votes while the PPP candidate bagged 60,266 from NA-243.
Counsel for Mr Dawa alleged that on the election night, his client, along with Karachi Bar Association members and party workers, attempted to access GCT College for official results. But police stopped them.
They cited alleged malpractices by polling staff, including District Returning Officer (DRO) Junaid Iqbal, Returning Officer (RO) Kanwar Kausar, Assistant Returning Officer (ARO) Ismail Awan, and Abdul Majid, who were purportedly involved in forging Form-47s with the intent to alter official documents.
On the other hand, Shujaat stated that the DRO and RO Zahoor Ahmed Mari had tampered with various Form-45s through ‘overwriting and cutting’ and managed forged and fabricated forms with the intention of fraud. He also highlighted that they had misused their official status and violated the rules of the Constitution.
He also contended that it was the ECP’s obligation to upload Form-45s within 14 days after the election, but claimed that the forms uploaded on March 5 were dubious.
Both leaders informed the court that they had approached the respondents to lodge complaints against the returning officers and to record their statements under Section 154 of the CrPC. However, they alleged that those complaints were not duly acknowledged. They requested the court to provide the available legal remedy.
