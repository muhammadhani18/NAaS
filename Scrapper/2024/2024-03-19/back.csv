Initial investigations revealed that differences had arisen between the deceased and the accused over religious matters. A report quoting Imtiaz Janjua, a spokesperson for the district police, stated that the assailants believed the slain teacher, Safoora Bibi, had committed blasphemy.
According to the FIR, the three girls - Umra Aman, 24, daughter of Deen Badshah; Razia Hanifia, 21, and Aisha Noman, 17, daughters of Allah Noor - allegedly attacked the teacher with a stick at the seminary gate and later stabbed her in the neck.
The accused students had reportedly informed the police that a religious figure had appeared in the dream of a 13-year-old relative, indicating that the teacher had committed blasphemy. A knife and a stick were recovered from the arrested girls, as stated in the FIR.

1,Legal opinion sought on SIC's status,National Assembly speaker seeks AGP whether party can be classified as a parliamentary party,"The National Assembly Secretariat has sought legal opinion from the Attorney-General for Pakistan (AGP), Mansoor Awan, asking the state’s top law officer whether the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) can be classified as a parliamentary party.
The little-known SIC became one of the largest parties in parliament when independent lawmakers, backed by the PTI, joined it after the official results of the February 8 general elections were announced.
In its letter to the AGP, the secretariat stated that SIC Chairman Sahibzada Muhammad Hamid Raza requested NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq on March 14 to appoint Zain Hussain Qureshi as the SIC’s parliamentary leader.
The letter highlighted that the SIC did not participate in the last general elections as a political party and therefore did not secure a single general seat in the National Assembly. Even its chairman contested the last general elections as an independent and was elected as an independent member.
""About 86 independent members (mostly backed by the PTI) have joined the SIC after the general elections. However, confirmation in this regard has not yet been received by this secretariat from the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).

""Moreover, in its February 28 order regarding applications filed by the SIC for allocation of reserved seats in the National Assembly and provincial assemblies of Punjab, Sindh, and K-P, the ECP declared that the SIC is not entitled to claim quota for reserved seats for women and non-Muslims due to non-submission of a party [priority] list for reserved seats.
""As it is a legal question whether the SIC can be classified as a parliamentary party or otherwise, keeping in view the aforementioned facts, the Honourable Speaker has requested to seek the legal opinion of the learned AGP on the matter.
“The AGP has been requested to furnish his legal advice on the aforementioned legal question at the earliest for the perusal of the speaker,” the letter said.
On December 22, 2023, the ECP stripped the PTI of its election symbol due to alleged irregularities in the party’s intra-party elections held on December 2.
The Supreme Court later upheld the ECP order, and the party’s candidates later had to contest the February 8 elections as independents.
The party’s winning candidates had later joined the SIC following an agreement.

6,SC maintains stay on SHC order on tax collections by Cantts,Bench refers sugar price issue to larger bench,"The Supreme Court maintained its stay order against a Sindh High Court (SHC) order to the cantonment boards to refund the tax amount collected under the property laws of 1958, and asked the Sindh’s advocate general to take fresh instructions from the provincial government.
A five-judge larger bench, led by Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, heard the appeal of the federal government against the SHC decision regarding tax collection in cantonment boards. The bench allowed the boards to collect the taxes until the next date of hearing.
According to the appeal, a presidential order was issued in 1979 on the property tax law of 1958 and in 1985, the then Gen Ziaul Haq’s regime gave the presidential order a constitutional cover. The 18th Amendment in 2010 also did not touch the matter.
The court was told that the collection of tax by the cantonment boards was federal, and not a provincial, matter. During the hearing, Justice asked as to why the Sindh government did not make the law a provincial subject by enacting legislation.

Barrister Ayyan Memon, the lawyer for the private petitioners, argued that in 1988, the Supreme Court had laid down the principle that the measures protected under Article 270 of the Constitution could be reviewed and declared null and void.
The bench gave time to the Sindh advocate general to take instructions from the provincial government about any legislation. Until the next hearing on April 22, it said, the boards could collect tax under the 1958 Act, as the injunction against the SHC decision to refund the tax collected would remain intact.
Meanwhile, a three-member bench, led by Justice Shah heard the case related to the determination of sugar prices. The counsel for the sugar mills informed the bench that the case challenged the Price Fixing Act, 1977.
The bench referred the matter to the administrative committee for the constitution of a larger bench for further hearing of the case. The case was adjourned for an indefinite period.
The bench also took up a case against additional tax in electricity bills. The counsel for the petitioners said that the Registration Act was not applicable to the petitioner institutions.
He added that the general sales tax (GST) was already being paid by the institutions.
The court issued notices to all parties, including the federal government on the petitions and adjourned the case until April 25.

7,Nawaz concerned over IMF's electric shock,"How much more can people endure, PML-N asks","PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif on Monday raised concerns over the impending surge in electricity and gas prices under the directives of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), questioning the extent to which the people could bear such burdens.
Addressing a special meeting of the Punjab government alongside Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif, Nawaz Sharif stressed the pressing need to address the potential hike in utility prices imposed by the global lender.
Senior provincial ministers and officials were in attendance, including Marriyum Aurangzeb, Azma Bukhari, Bilal Yasin, Syed Ashiq, and Sania Ashiq, along with chief secretaries and other concerned authorities.
During the briefing, it was revealed that previous procurement methods subsidised wheat prices uniformly, benefiting both the impoverished and the rich alike.
However, mounting circular debts, now totalling Rs630 billion, posed a grave challenge to the government. If left unaddressed, experts warned the debt could soar to a staggering Rs1.1 trillion.
Meanwhile, the daily interest payment on loans alone amounted to a staggering 250 million, prompting the government to abolish general wheat subsidies.
The meeting resolved in principle to provide solar panels to farmers for tube wells in a move aimed at alleviating the burden of expensive electricity.
Nawaz Sharif reiterated the need to prioritise farmers' concerns, stressing that government funds should be dedicated to supporting agricultural initiatives. He also emphasised the importance of ensuring fair compensation for farmers' labour and shielding them from exploitation by middlemen.
Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif echoed these sentiments, stressing the importance of providing farmers with modern machinery and reviewing drip irrigation techniques.
She called for a comprehensive strategy to combat the mafia engaged in the sale of overpriced fertilisers to safeguard agricultural interests.
It is pertinent to note that Nawaz's coincide with the anticipated finalisation of a staff-level agreement. Reports suggested that Pakistan has pledged to implement timely escalations in electricity and gas tariffs, along with the elimination of tax privileges.
According to the reports, electricity rates are slated for another hike starting July 1st. Additionally, mechanisms will be established for periodic adjustments on a monthly, quarterly, and yearly basis to facilitate cost recovery.

8,Marwat says evidence of ‘killer contract’ given to FIA,PTI leaders appears before Cyber Crime Cell in probe into controversial tweet against Punjab CM,"Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader Sher Afzal Marwat appeared before the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on Monday in the inquiry into his allegations against Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz in his tweet on the social media platform of X.
The FIA Cyber Crime Cell Islamabad started an inquiry against Marwat, who is a member of the National Assembly (MNA), on the request of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) MNA Aqeel Malik, for uploading the controversial tweet and video regarding allegations against Chief Minister Maryam.
Marwat reached the Cyber Crime Cell office in Islamabad at the given time and appeared before Additional Director Ayaz Khan and Inquiry Officer Sub-Inspector Waseem Khan. He said he answered their questions for two hours.
Talking to the media later, Marwat said that he came in response to an FIA notice and answered their questions. He explained that he received evidence that a person who escaped from Pakistan, and had been in Dubai for 15 years, was contacted by some Indians to target him [Marwat].
According to the contract killers, Marwat alleged, they came on behalf of Maryam Nawaz. Marwat added that there were audio messages of the same contract killers that the Indians had made the payment of $100,000.
Marwat continued that the audio messages were there, besides the audio messages of the person, through whom that evidence reached him were also there, which had been shared them with the FIA.
“This information came to my knowledge through our MNA Naseem Ali Shah,” he said.
He further said that this was conveyed to Shah by some people of his constituency. Therefore, he added, he had asked the FIA to examine the MNA and then that person, who originally received the message from Dubai, whom he alleged was a relative of the contract killer.
Marwat said that the messages were in both Urdu and Pashto languages. He added that he asked the FIA to listen to those messages and check the criminal background of the person, who was sending the messages.
He said that he had given an application to the FIA that if he was right then a first information report (FIR) be registered against Shehbaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz. Because if anything happened to him, then “these two persons will be responsible”, he added.
Marwat alleged that his party’s mandate in the February 8 election was stolen and the PML-N came to power. It was for the first time that the Punjab had said “no” to the establishment and Punjab gave a “two-thirds mandate” to the PTI, he claimed.
He alleged that the PTI was facing great hardships, but stressed he would not bow down. The people had voted for the PTI, he said, adding that if a tendency of murders was introduced, then the entire politics would be in danger.
Responding to a question, Marwat alleged that institutions were not independent in the country. He added that the FIA was working under Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, so when a PTI leader filed an application against Maryam Nawaz, would “he get justice?”
Marwat said that he would fully cooperate in the investigation. He thanked MNA Aqeel Malik for seeking inquiry into his tweet, which he said, led to the FIA inquiry. He said that the FIA had asked him for the phone numbers of some people during the inquiry, which he had provided to the investigators.
