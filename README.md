# NAaaS
News Analytics as a Service is an automated platform that displays NEWS plotted on a map of Pakistan that can be filtered based on time frame, location and key words. This is achieved by scrapping the NEWS and then extracting the focus time and focus location out of the NEWS documents and then plotting them according to the focus location
