'Extraordinary intervention': Cabinet accuses CJP of 'misconduct',Federal cabinet condemns CJP's 'interference in strongest possible terms',"The federal cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, has issued a strong condemnation against Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial for his ""extraordinary intervention"" in the arrest of former premier and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan. The cabinet deemed the intervention as ""misconduct"" on the part of the top judge.
According to the federal cabinet, Imran Khan's arrest was carried out in compliance with the Constitution, law, and legal procedures in the ""open and shut case of corruption and corrupt practices"".
The federal cabinet reiterated its stance that the CJP's interference was unjustifiable and condemned it in the strongest possible terms. It denounced the CJP's interference as ""misconduct"".

In the federal cabinet meeting, the ruling alliance not only condemned the CJP’s act of providing ""relief"" to Imran but also “strongly condemned” the CJP’s words, especially, when he addressed to Imran by saying: “Good to see you”.
The cabinet said that the expression “good to see you” by a person sitting on the highest seat of justice – CJP – for an accused arrested in a corruption case was “a shameful stain” on the forehead of the justice.
The cabinet statement read that the history of Islam, the civilised world, and judicial forums attest that such behaviour is unbecoming of any judge.
Case against Imran
The government’s reaction has come a day after CJP Umar Ata Bandial led a three-member bench that granted “extraordinary” relief to the PTI chairman in an alleged multi-billion corruption case of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB).

On Thursday, a three-member bench led by CJP termed Imran’s arrest “invalid and unlawful”, directed the law enforcers to provide him “foolproof” security until his appearance before the Islamabad High Court (IHC), “requested” Imran to condemn the violence that took place following his arrest from IHC premises and asked him to consider opening up dialogue with political opponents.
The former premier was arrested on May 9 from the premises of IHC only to be released on May 11 by the Supreme Court. Rangers on orders from NAB had arrested Imran from the IHC over allegations that he looted Rs50 billion from the national treasury along with a property tycoon and got the Al-Qadir University Trust registered on 450-kanal of land.
Though, IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq had termed Imran's arrest as “lawful”, the top court overturned the decision by declaring the same as “unlawful”, noting that the entire process needed to be backtracked since a citizen enjoyed certain guarantees, particularly access to justice, on the court premises.
Meanwhile, while responding to the letter written by President Dr Arif Alvi to PM Shehbaz following Imran’s arrest, the cabinet not only condemned the move but expressed that President Alvi’s letter was proof that he was working more as a party worker than the head of the state.
Once again, the cabinet noted, President Alvi has proved his subservience to Imran instead of the Constitution and Pakistan, saying the person sitting in the office of the President has once again violated his oath.
In his letter to PM, President Alvi wrote that he was “shocked” over the manner in which ex-PM was arrested from inside IHC premises, saying he was shocked to see the video of the incident showing the abuse on Imran as he is a popular leader and the head of a major political party.
Earlier in his address, PM Shehbaz disapproved the ""double standards of justice"" meted out to the PTI chief in the cases against him, adding that the coalition government would take every step to ensure the rule of law in the country.
The PM said that the other political leaders in the country faced trials and tough handling while Imran was given “privileged treatment”. He termed the Supreme Court’s relief to Imran as “nothing but an NRO” – (National Reconciliation Order), the one given by the ex-military ruler Gen Pervez Musharraf to the PML-N and PPP leadership in 2007.
At the outset of the federal cabinet meeting, Law Minister Azam Nazir Tarar briefed the meeting on the overall political situation as well as about the PTI chairman’s arrest, subsequent release and the protest that took place in between his arrest and release.
Following Imran’s arrest, the protesters took to the streets and attacked, ransacked and torched key government and military buildings, including the General Headquarters (GHQ) and the residence of the Corps Commander Lahore. Radio Pakistan building in Peshawar was also torched.
During the protest, at least six people lost their lives, dozens of others were injured and hundreds of PTI supporters were detained, including key PTI leaders. Though Imran was given relief by the Supreme Court as well as given bail by the IHC on Friday till May 18, the key leadership and PTI workers remained behind bars.

Social media blackout boosts Imran Khan's momentum,"Experts say govt ban did more harm than good as PTI supporters adapted quickly, using VPNs to skirt restrictions","A state-imposed social media blackout to quell massive protests around the arrest of former prime minister Imran Khan has instead fuelled momentum for him, analysts say.
Moments after Khan was detained by a swarm of paramilitary Rangers on Tuesday, the interior ministry restricted nationwide access to Twitter, Facebook and YouTube.
Mobile data coverage -- used by political activists to organise protests on messenger apps such as WhatsApp, but with far larger effects on the wider populace -- was also cut.
But Khan's supporters quickly found workarounds, leaving social media awash with calls for protest and shaky handheld clips of thousands of demonstrators clashing with police.
The move was a ""crass miscalculation"" by authorities, according to Shahzad Ahmad, director of digital rights organisation Bytes for All. ""It's only going to work against them.""

Leading his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party in opposition, Khan remains staggeringly popular and has crafted a campaign accusing the parties and army of colluding to keep him out of power, lock him up and even assassinate him.
Blocking social media only fuels the PTI's argument, said digital rights activist Usama Khilji.
""It's adding to their popularity because it's being seen as a move to curtail basic rights of citizens.""
On Thursday, the Supreme Court declared Khan's arrest invalid, but the political turmoil has continued, and the internet restrictions remain in place.
Ahmad said the authorities who ordered the ban are ""dinosaurs"" who ""do not have an idea how rapidly things are changing"".
""They think in the mindset of absolute power,"" he said.
But internet and social media use has exploded in Pakistan in recent years, fuelled by the widespread availability of cheap smartphones.

Mobile broadband subscribers jumped from 56 million in 2018 to 116 million in 2022 -- around half of the country -- according to the telecom regulator.
Internet censorship has been common in recent decades, even under Khan's government.
But a young, tech-savvy citizenry has adapted quickly, using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to disguise their locations and skirt restrictions, Ahmad said.
Despite the ban, Twitter ""was still very active in the country because people had their VPNs ready,"" he added.
The mobile data outage, however, cannot be circumvented in that way.
In Peshawar, PTI supporter Ikram Khan told AFP that party activists were expecting ""a complete (internet) shutdown"", so they hurriedly transferred mobile phone clips to computers equipped with wired internet connections and VPNs.
There was a delay in uploading the videos to Instagram and Twitter, and streaming service Facebook Live could not be used, but ""we still did our job well"", the 31-year-old told AFP.
""We know how to handle the situation.""
The internet shutdown has triggered international condemnation.
Amnesty International Pakistan campaigner Rimmel Mohydin told AFP it was ""a clear human rights violation"".
It can ""facilitate further violations of human rights, including impeding the documentation of unlawful use of force,"" she said.
Such remarks give credence to PTI claims they are being silenced, according to analyst Hasan Askari.
""The international concern definitely goes in their favour,"" he said.
Khan came to power in 2018 marketing himself as a political outsider, riding a pioneering wave of social media enthusiasm to challenge the country's two main dynastic parties, who between them have ruled Pakistan for decades.
Last April, after having lost the key support of Pakistan's powerful military -- which has itself ruled the country directly for more than three decades -- he was ousted in a no-confidence vote.
The ensuing political chaos has exacerbated an economic downturn that has seen decades-high inflation, the rupee tumbling to a record low Thursday, and deadlocked bailout negotiations with the International Monetary Fund.
The latest internet outage has added to those woes, costing Pakistan as much as $53 million a day according to global internet monitor NetBlocks, with mobile data coverage powering economic transactions, including credit and debit card point-of-sale terminals.
A shaky coalition government now faces the prospect of an electorate galvanised by simultaneous political and economic crises ahead of elections due no later than October.
The blackout ""is quite disproportionate"" said Khilji. ""It does show a panic where the state is sort of caught off guard and it seems like they didn't really plan this well.
""The biggest issue is that people are already frustrated with the economic situation and this just adds on top of that,"" he said.
""It's giving more of a reason for citizens to be unhappy with the current government.""

Friday marks the fourth consecutive day since PTI supporters have been protesting party chairman and deposed premier Imran Khan's arrest - in the Al-Qadir Trust case.
The Supreme Court (SC) had deemed the arrest illegal a day earlier, ordering Imran to approach the IHC for bail in the case.
The IHC today granted the former premier two-week interim bail.

Ahead of the crucial hearing, PTI leader Hammad Azhar released a short video on Twitter and urged the party's supporters to reach Islamabad.
""Everyone should reach Islamabad and safeguard themselves from illegal arrests,"" said the PTI leader.
In a statement being shared on social media, PTI leader Shehryar Khan Afridi warned that ""if something happens to Imran Khan, then we will destroy ourselves but will not let you people live"".
In the same breath, he said, ""we are peaceful"" but urged the government ""not to take decisions that will render the situation out of control"".
Notably, many of the PTI's senior leaders are in police custody amid an ongoing crackdown, with several other protestors also rounded up for rioting.

Int'l body for mobile ecosystem expresses concern over internet shutdowns,"GSMA pens emergency letter to IT minister, demands restoration of broadband services","A global organisation of mobile ecosystem, Groupe Speciale Mobile Association (GSMA), has expressed concern over the shutdown of broadband internet in Pakistan.
According to Express News, in an emergency letter to Federal Minister of Information Technology and Telecommunication Syed Aminul Haq, the GSMA has pressed the government to put an end to internet disruptions.
The mobile broadband services have remained suspended for a consecutive fourth day in several parts of the country in the aftermath of the riots triggered by the arrest of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan on May 9.
Condemning the decision to suspend internet services, the international organisation has said that the suspensions have impacted both consumers and businesses alike.
Prolonged internet outages are causing problems for citizens' health, education, social and economic well-being, and business and investment in the telecom sector have been severely affected, the GSMA reportedly said.

The global mobile ecosystem organisation also stressed that the disruptions are affecting the investment and economic management measures for Pakistan.
It urged the government to proceed with such measures with caution and restrict shutdowns to only unavoidable circumstances, in accordance with relevant laws, most notably, the International Human Rights Convention and the ITU Constitution.
It may be noted here that the disruptions to internet services have caused a loss of at least Rs1.6 billion to telecom companies, while the government has suffered a loss of Rs570 million in revenue from telecom companies as well.
The suspension is affecting e-commerce, online services, home delivery and ride-hailing apps too.
The matter is also pending before the Lahore High Court and the court has sought replies from the federal government and Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) by May 22 in a plea seeking directions to restore the internet services and resume the operations of social media platforms including WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
However, LHC Justice Sheikh had turned down the petitioner’s request to grant interim relief by immediately passing directions to restore the internet services.

IHC stays criminal proceedings against Imran in Toshakhana case,"Court issues notices to ECP, other respondents; schedules hearing for June 8","The Islamabad High Court (IHC) ordered a local court on Friday to stop indictment proceedings against Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief and former premier Imran Khan in the Toshakhana (gift repository) case.
Imran had filed a plea with the high court challenging the maintainability of criminal proceedings against him in the Toshakhana case, filed by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq presided over the hearing and issued the stay order, as well as notices to the ECP amongst other respondents.
The court has postponed the proceedings until next month, and issued notices to Imran on all four of his applications as well.
Notably, the applications had come as the PTI chief was indicted in the case two days ago. The trial court had summoned the witnesses on May 13.
The indictment hearing for the Toshakhana case had been held at the New Police Line Guest House after the hearing for the Al-Qadir Trust case, in which the PTI chief was arrested from the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on May 9.
Speaking to the media after the hearing of the case, Imran’s lawyer Sher Afzal Marwat had said that the former prime minister and lawyers had boycotted the indictment proceedings.
He had maintained that the court indicted the PTI chief despite his expressing a lack of confidence in the judge hearing the case.

It may be noted here that on May 5, additional sessions judge Humayun Dilawar had dismissed two petitions filed by the PTI chief challenging criminal proceedings against him in the Toshakhana case after hearing arguments from both sides.
During the proceedings at the IHC today, Imran's lawyer Khawaja Haris argued that he ECP's complaint is not admissible because no letter has been submitted by the electoral watchdog to appoint a competent authority.
""The ECP has only asked its office to file the complaint, and a complaint filed without the competent authority cannot be heard,"" he said, adding that ""complaints cannot be sent for criminal action after the prescribed time fo 120 days.""
The lawyer informed the court that the issue had been raised with the trial court as well, however, the judge had said that they will be addressed during the evidence stage of the proceedings.
""Our argument is that no further action can be taken on the complaint,"" he stressed.
He further said that ""we are objecting to whatever is on record. The matter of criminal proceedings should first go to the magistrate and then to the sessions court.""
""The complaint has to be first filed with the magistrate and then he has to record the opening statement and send it to the sessions court,"" Imran's lawyer said.
Upon hearing the arguments, CJ Farooq issued notices to concerned parties and postponed the proceedings until June 8.

The arrests are the latest in an ongoing crackdown against the party leadership.
Top PTI leaders, including Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Fawad Chaudhry, Asad Umar and Omer Cheema, were taken into custody within 24 hours and transferred to Adiala Jail under detention for 15 days following countrywide protests against former prime minister Imran Khan’s arrest.
Qureshi was arrested in the wee hours of Thursday after the police raided Gilgit-Baltistan House in Islamabad under Section 3 of Maintenance of Public Order (MPO).
The security personnel rounded up over 1,800 PTI leaders and supporters since the protests began on Tuesday when Imran was arrested from the Islamabad High Court (IHC) premises. However, the Supreme Court ordered his immediate release on Thursday evening in the Al-Qadir Trust case.
The Islamabad police spokesperson had confirmed the arrests, adding that Imran’s spokesperson Musarrat Jamshed Cheema, her husband Jamshed Cheema, Malika Bukhari and Senator Falaknaz had also been taken into custody under Section 3 of the MPO and transferred to Adiala Jail, Rawalpindi under 15-day detention.

However, the arrests of Dr Yasmin Rashid and Dr Shireen Mazari have come after the country witnessed a break in the violent protests last night as the PTI hailed the Supreme Court's verdict to release their party chairman.
“The leadership of the PTI will decide the next political course of action after consultation. The PTI believes in peaceful political struggle. The PTI hopes that all institutions will strictly follow the orders of the Supreme Court and take care of the security of chairman Imran Khan,” a statement issued by the PTI said.
Details of PTI's Senior Vice President Shireen Mazari's arrest still remain unclear.
The party issued a statement on social media condemning the arrest but did not provide further information on the issue.
A former PTI lawmaker Kanwal Shauzab said that ""50 Islamabad police personnel raided Shireen's house at 3 am and arrested her. She is a brave leader of the PTI and a patriotic Pakistani and this is the crime for which she has been taken into custody"".

PTI leader Andalib Abbas revealed that Dr Yasmin Rashid was hiding in Defense or Cavalry Ground and she was abducted at 6:30 in the morning.
She said that her colleague had been absent from her home for several days due to police raids.
""Two days ago, Dr Yasmin Rashid's 80-year-old husband and 76-year-old brother-in-law were also arrested from their family residence,"" she said.
While the brother-in-law still remains in custody, Dr Yasmin Rashid's husband has been released due to his poor health, the PTI leader said.
""Forty to 50 people came with four to five vehicles to arrest Dr Yasmin,"" Abbas added.
It may be noted that Dr Yasmin was to make her way to Islamabad with other party workers ahead of Imran Khan's hearing.

Govt action to arrest Imran backfires,SC orders to release PTI chief serve major blow to ruling coalition,"Imran Khan’s release following a brief detention on Thursday is seen as a major blow to the ruling alliance which was hoping to use the arrest to bolster its political capital but found itself on the defensive again, lamenting that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party once again got preferential treatment.
In a dramatic turn of events, the PTI chairman was arrested on May 9 from the premises of the capital’s high court only to be released on May 11 by the Supreme Court.
Rangers on orders from the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) had arrested Imran from the Islamabad High Court (IHC), over allegations that he looted Rs50 billion from the national treasury along with a property tycoon and got the Al-Qadir University Trust registered on 450-kanal of land.
In between, protesters took to the streets, and key government and military buildings were attacked, ransacked and torched, at least six people lost their lives, dozens of others were injured and hundreds of PTI supporters were detained, including key PTI leaders.
Though the period between the arrest and release has highlighted the deepening political polarization in the country, some experts believe that the events of May 9 – which was declared as history’s dark chapter by the army – will have a negative impact on the PTI-establishment relationship.
Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat) President Ahmed Bilal Mehboob feels that “the events of 9th May following the arrest of Imran would have profound and adverse impact on the future relationship of the establishment and the PTI.”
The Pildat chief said the rampage of PTI supporters and their attack on military installations and properties will eventually harm the public standing of the party.
The inability of the security agencies for whatever reason to protect the symbols of the military might such as the GHQ, the Lahore Corpse Commander’s residence and other properties has also dented the image of the military’s invincibility.
 “Unless the perpetrators are quickly identified, prosecuted and punished, the wounds inflicted on May 9 will not heal,” he said.
Commenting on the arrest of Imran, Mehboob said the manner of arresting the PTI chief was inappropriate and it was correct on the part of the IHC to initiate judicial enquiry against the police and other agencies responsible for that.
However, he added, the SC decision to release Imran would give an opportunity to the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PMLN) and other ruling parties to claim that courts are applying double standards.
Abdul Moiz Jaferii, a lawyer and political analyst, said the government has been given an excuse to keep delaying elections. The development has also allowed the government to pit the establishment against Imran Khan directly.
Jaferii said the recent events have also proven to “the anti-Khan team” that they have very little options to shut him out of the political process because he is too popular to take a risk against.  “If polls were held tomorrow, the PTI would make a clean sweep.”
Though the government has lost much of its political capital after coming into power by ousting ex-premier Imran Khan through a vote of no-confidence in April 2022, it is still struggling to take advantage of the situation by undermining Khan’s credibility.
As the country heads to the next polls, the power politics-based brutal struggle among the political forces has raised questions about the future of democracy in the country.

SC order on Imran's arrest to set legal course,Legal experts weigh in on far-reaching impact of ruling on every court of the country,"The 'extra ordinary' bail relief granted to former prime minister Imran Khan by the Supreme Court has stirred a legal debate, with experts seeing it as a victory for the battle-hardened PTI chief.
Though the Islamabad High Court will decide about the PTI chief’s pre-arrest bail today (Friday), Imran is lucky to grab the attention of the apex court.
A lawyer believes that the PTI chief has emerged victorious as the apex court proceedings will have a far-reaching impact on every court of the country, adding that now all the lower courts, including the high courts, will stand up against state institutions that have been active against Imran since April last year.
The lawyers agree with the court order wherein it is stated that the manner of execution of the arrest warrant issued by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) chairman dated May 1, 2023 in the Al-Qadir Trust case within the premises of the IHC against the petitioner is invalid and unlawful.
The execution of the said warrant violated the petitioner’s right of access to justice and the sanctity and safety of the court as he had already surrendered to the court for seeking judicial relief.
“In this regard, the fundamental rights of the petitioner under articles 4, 9, 10-A and 14 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan have been infringed"", says the written order.
However, one section of the lawyers has strong reservations over the manner wherein the bench addressed Imran during the hearing.
Imran who was produced before the bench was visibly “down”.
The judges wanted him to deliver a message to his party supporters through the media for restoring peace in the country. Imran, however, said that he is totally aloof about the happenings all over the country after his arrest.
Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial who welcomed him on the rostrum also urged Imran to resume political dialogue in national interest.
The government, especially the establishment's, position has weakened after the relief given to Imran at this critical time.
It is learnt that the government functionaries are in shock over the outcome of the SC hearing. They were not expecting that the SC will go too much in favour of Imran.
The hearing will also affect the sentiments of military officials who are being targeted by the PTI supporters since the arrest of their leader on May 9. However, it is not clear what kind of reaction can come now.
The SC hearing will also affect the working of the IHC wherein controversy has already started over the release of two judges’ ruling in the Tyrian White case without the permission of the chief justice.
The lawyers appreciate the SC for discontinuing the precedent wherein accused persons could have been arrested within the court premises without getting access to justice.
They, however, say that now the SC should compel Imran to sit for dialogue in order to set the rules of the game before the elections.
Likewise, the judges should end the perception that they are shaping national politics in order to secure judicial politics.
The inclusion of Justice Athar Minallah in the special bench has also made a difference in Thursday’s hearing.
Justice Minallah is consistent in providing relief to the accused persons in matters related to civil liberties.
He has also an emotional attachment to the IHC wherein he worked as the chief justice for almost four years.
Justice Minallah, through judicial orders, had restored the confidence of every political party in the capital’s high court during his tenure.
A lawyer believes that the sanctity of the IHC premises was violated by arresting Imran from there, therefore his involvement in this matter was understandable.
If the IHC grants pre-arrest bail, the government has various options to deal with Imran as it can arrest him under Section 3 of the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) from Islamabad.
Section 3 MPO stated: “The government, if satisfied that with a view to preventing any person from acting in any manner prejudicial to public safety or the maintenance of public order, it is necessary to do, may, by an order in writing, direct the arrest and detention in such custody power to arrest and detain suspected persons.”
CJP Bandial was firmer during the hearing. It also reflects how the unity of the court gives a powerful impact on the public.

NAB seeks time to submit report on M6 fund embezzlement,Anti-graft body fails to submit reference 7 months after multibillion rupees corruption surfaced,"Almost seven months after the authorities unearthed multi-billion rupees corruption in the land acquisition for Sukkur-Hyderabad M6 motorway, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) is yet to submit its final reference in the accountability court. 
During the hearing of the case on Thursday, the judge Mehboob Ali Dayo asked the investigation team of the bureau about the reference. 
On which, the investigation team informed the court that it will take some more time to complete the reference as the chairman NAB has directed them to combine the investigations of the land scam in Matiari and Noushehro Feroze districts. 
After that development, the director general NAB Karachi has been leading the investigation. 
The deputy commissioners and assistant commissioners of the two districts, officials of Sindh Bank and private persons have been accused for the alleged embezzlement of funds.
Reportedly, at the last hearing of the case held on April 28, the court had directed the NAB to file reference on May 25. 
DC of Matiari district, Adnan Rasheed, former assistant commissioner Saeedabad taluka, Mansoor Ali Shah, former Sindh Bank manager, Tabish Ali Shah, Ashiq Kaleri and others who have been dismissed from the service, were produced before the court at the hearing. 
Kaleri's counsel advocate Ayaz Tunio pleaded the court to release his client who submitted Rs1.249 billion plea bargains at the last hearing.
He claimed that a meeting of the bureau has accepted the plea under which seven immovable assets worth over Rs633 million have been frozen by NAB after the disclosure by Kaleri.

Imran accuses IHC CJ of 'taking orders' in alleged audio leak,Ex-PM can purportedly be heard giving instructions to PTI leader Musarrat Javed Cheema in phone conversation,"An alleged audio call recording between Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan and party leader Musarrat Javed Cheema has surfaced online in which the PTI chief can purportedly be heard accusing the Islamabad High Court (IHC) Chief Justice of 'taking orders'.
The former prime minister can allegedly be heard giving instructions to PTI leader Musarrat Javed Cheema in the alleged phone conversation.
Transcript of the alleged phone conversation between Imran Khan and Musarrat Javed Cheema:
Imran: So Musarrat, what's the situation? Did they get the message?
Musarrat: Sir, I have conveyed the message. We are sitting here in the high court and we are saying that we will not go under any circumstances to produce Khan sb.

Musarrat: Khawaja Haris and Salman Safdar both are here with me. I am sitting with them. If you want to speak, you can.
Imran: No, I just wanted to ask them that they should talk to Azam Swati that he should do it in Supreme Court as well as what they have done is malafide.
Musarrat: Yes, absolutely. Don't worry about it, sir.
Imran: What is this chief justice doing? Who takes orders from them?
Musarrat: Whether NAB people come or someone else [it doesn't matter]. I am standing right in front of Salman Safdar. I told him to say that produce [Imran] in court. I am sitting next to Khawaja Haris and him. We cannot leave like that. We will remain in court. Where your case is being heard... with chief justice.
Imran: No, but he takes orders from them. Talk to Azam on the other side. You must talk to Azam.
Musarrat: Okay sir. Please take care of yourself.
The recorded phone conversation purportedly took place on Wednesday, a day before the Supreme Court of Pakistan declared Imran Khan's arrest illegal and ordered his immediate release in the Al Qadir Trust corruption case. 
The former premier was arrested on May 9 by the paramilitary Rangers force on orders from the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) from the Islamabad High Court (IHC), over allegations of having looted Rs50 billion along with a property tycoon from the national treasury and getting the Al-Qadir University Trust registered on 450-kanal of land.
Hours after Imran's arrest, the IHC had declared that his arrest from the court's premises was carried out legally, as the PTI alleged political persecution.
The PTI chief had challenged his arrest in the apex court, which ordered his immediate release earlier today. 
In another leaked audio recording, a senior reporter covering the Supreme Court of Pakistan, Abdul Qayyum Siddiqui, and a lawyer representing PTI, Khawaja Tariq Rahim, can allegedly be heard discussing a possible court decision regarding Imran Khan.
Transcript of alleged phone conversation between reporter Qayyum Siddiqui and PTI lawyer Khawaja Tariq Rahim:
Rahim: So what's up?
Siddiqui: Nothing, they just called to bring Imran Khan today.
Rahim: They (the court) will order to go back to [Islamabad] High Court and a protective bail will be issued till tomorrow. In the High Court, he (Imran Khan) will raise objection on the Chief Justice. Chief Justice himself will write it down and mark Kiyani [to take the case].
Siddiqui: Mohsin Kiyani?
Rahim: Yes, Mohsin Kiyani. And Mohsin Kiyani will grant the bail. Anything else?
Govt censures SC for providing 'relief' to Imran
Earlier on Thursday, Federal Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb also censured the Supreme Court for providing relief to the PTI chairman.
""The SC is giving relief to a criminal, a terrorist, a gangster who leads armed groups,"" said Marriyum Aurangzeb, lamenting that ""after the arrest, terrorists and armed groups attacked state and public property in the country"".

She maintained that the PTI leadership has ""incited armed groups to violence"", and at another point stressed that ""the leader of these armed groups is the terrorist"".
""Corps Commander's house was burnt, patients were taken out of ambulances and ambulances were set ablaze, mosques were targeted by arsonists, metro stations were burnt, policemen were attacked, their vehicles set on fire,"" she said.
""Had this terrorist been punished earlier, the country would not be burning today,"" she added.
""If courts support armed groups, encourage them, then similar relief should be given to all people,"" said Marriyum.
She also said that ""contempt of court could have been avoided"" had the courts upheld justice when political leaders including Nawaz Sharif, Asif Ali Zardari, Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, Rana Sanaullah, Salman Shehbaz, Hamza Shehbaz, Miftah Ismail and others were ""dragged and thrown in jails"".
""Real contempt of court happens when the country's courts become shelters for armed groups and terrorists,"" she added.
