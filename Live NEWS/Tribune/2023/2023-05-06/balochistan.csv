2,Punjab rains claim first casualty,7 people sustain injuries as roof of mosque caves in,"Although the weather temporarily turned pleasant after heavy rains across the province on Thursday, yet it was not an unmixed blessing since it resulted in one casualty and many injuries, besides the damage it caused to things material.
The casualty occurred on the outskirts of Okara where a 55-year-old woman, who lived in a house with a roof of bamboo sticks, died when the roof collapsed, suffocating her to death under the weight of the bamboos. 
On the other hand, seven people were injured when the roof of a mosque caved in due to rain in Adda Panwan, a Tehsil of Shahkot district in Nankana Sahib. 
Moreover, roof of a dilapidated house collapsed in Kasur, burying two young men, Ghulam Akbar and Owais, under its debris. Rescue 1122 staff reached the spot, cleared the debris and shifted the injured to the hospital where their condition was said to be stable. 
Rain damaged many crops including that of melon, watermelon, corn and wheat in the surroundings of Sarai Mughal, Sirsingh Chak 50, Dolo Multani and Beharwal Kalan. The All Pakistan Kisan Ittehad has demanded of the government to compensate their losses. They also demanded of the government to wave payment of Abiana.
Besides, slum areas got severely affected by rain in and around Chunian.
According to the Met office, light and heavy rains will continue in Punjab due to low pressure system coming in from the west. 
Meanwhile, wheat and vegetable crops in several villages of the Soan Valley suffered significant damage due to the stormy weather. 
The villages affected by the inclement weather were Khabaki, Kunhati, Ahmedabad, Beyakh and Khora. The estimated losses ran into millions of rupees. The loss means that production of wheat in the valley is likely to drop by 200 to 500 kilograms an acre. 
The rain occurred when wheat was in its final stages of preparation.
Malik Shahzad Awan, a farmer in Khora village, said that the wheat crop had suffered a lot due to the rain and hailstorm. 
He said the farmers of the valley had already been down in the dumps over not getting proper prices for their crops in the markets. And after the losses caused by the rain they felt as if a mountain had fallen on them.
The potential damage to vegetables would result in consumers loosening their purse strings.

4,Politicisation of depts getting hard to hide,Targets of corruption inquiries shift with changes in govt,"Allegations of politicisation of institutions remain a major issue in spite of vehement claims by top officials of neutrality and impartiality. 
A recent episode of a team of the Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) from Gujranwala, led by Additional Director General Waqasul Hassan resorting along with a heavy contingent of Lahore police to a late night expedition at the residence of former chief minister Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi's residence at the Zahoor Elahi Road brought the issue into the limelight one again.
The state institutions spend significant resources and energy to foster claims of upholding the notion of the rule of law, equality before the law and not serving as pawns of political bigwigs. Call it a Freudian slip under immense pressure after leading an unsuccessful operation for three hours and facing harsh questions by the media or an opinion based on his experience that he appeared to refer to the political landscape of the country.
He was answering a journalist’s question about targeting the opposition outside Elahi's residence after tendering an apology to PML-Q leader Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain's son and Federal Minister Salik Hussain for raiding his house. The minister’s hand was injured during the police’s effort to break into his house. 
Hassan said the offence of corruption was committed by people who enjoyed power and authority. When grilled by the journalists as to why his department acted when those people were no more in the government and were in the opposition, he conceded that it was unfortunate but a reality of Pakistan. 
After taking charge as the chief minister, Pervaiz Elahi had immediately transferred ACE Director General Rana Abdul Jabbar who was serving as the DIG operations in Lahore when Model Town incident had happened in 2014. After Mohsin Naqvi was appointed as the Caretaker Chief Minister of Punjab, Sohail Zafar Chatha was appointed as the DG of ACE and Waqasul Hassan as Additional DG.
Chatha had served at key position under the previous PML-N governments.
When the PTI came into power, an inquiry against him had been initiated by the NAB, following which he had gone abroad.
Similarly, Hassan had served before 2018 as DPO and on other police posts commonly deemed lucrative.
However, during the PTI rule, he spent most of the years outside Punjab. Even after being transferred to Punjab, he remained away from key posts and most of the time remained posted at the IG Office.
Along with the shuffling of officers with the change of governments, the registration of cases also took a shift. 
When the PTI was in power, the Punjab ACE registered over 70 cases of against PML-N leaders. 
After the change of government, ACE's proceedings in the cases have been on a standstill. Meanwhile, the establishment has been moving at a fast pace in the other direction, a glimpse of which was shown in the way it conducted the raid at Elahi's house and arrested his aides Mohammad Khan Bhatti and Sohail Asghar. 
Cases are being registered against PTI leaders and hardly anyone of them in the province is left not facing an of the ACE. 
The ACE has moved against former chief ministers Pervaiz Elahi and Usman Buzdar, Farah Shah, Zartaj Gull, Yasmin Rashid and a number of other leaders.
The situation has once again raised questions about the state institutions being upholders of the rule of law and constitution or the muscles of the governments and people in power to serve and protect their interests.

5,Court reserves decision on Elahi’s contempt plea,ACE official directed to come up with amended report,"Lahore High Court’s (LHC) Justice Tariq Saleem Sheikh reserved a decision on a plea filed by former chief minister Punjab Chaudhry Pervez Elahi seeking initiation of contempt proceedings against Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) and police officials for conducting a raid at his Zahoor Elahi residence seeking his arrest.
As proceedings commenced, the law officer implored the court that on the direction of the court, the additional director general Anti-Corruption Waqas Hassan had publicly tendered an apology.
To this, Justice Sheikh remarked that he did not pass any such order of tendering an apology publicly.
Meanwhile, Justice Sheikh also directed the aforementioned official to come up with an amended report by removing a specific line that he (official) had tendered a public apology on the direction of the court.
The law officer told the court that all officers were of claim that they could not even think to commit contempt of court by not complying the court’s orders.
The director general anti-corruption, additional director general anti-corruption and other officials from the police were present in the courtroom.
Earlier proceedings
The law officer tendered an unconditional apology on behalf of the officials including additional director general anti-corruption Waqas Hassan.
The law officer contended to the court that those words used in the petition have nothing to do with reality. To which the petitioner Elahi’s counsel advocate Amir Saeed Rawn claimed they are ready to submit an affidavit that these words were used by the anti-corruption official.
On a point, Justice Sheikh remarked either the accused party should defend this matter or leave them at the mercy of the court. 
This practice would not be tolerated, Justice Sheikh made clear.
