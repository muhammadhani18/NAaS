0,Entrepreneurs bridge trade relations with world,Explore Chinese market at Canton Fair to start business with counterparts,"“When I heard that there will be an international booth and a lot of international visitors will be participating, I felt like it’s a must to visit and find out the possibility of doing business with China as well as the whole world,” Rana Javed Akhtar, Chief Executive MK Sons (Pvt) Ltd, told China Economic Net (CEN).
He was attending the 133rd China Import and Export Fair held in Guangzhou. The exhibition – known as Canton Fair – kicked off on April 15 and entered its third and final phase on May 1.
Held in three phases through May 5, it is also the largest in history, with a record number of exhibition areas and exhibitors.
Its offline exhibitors rose to more than 34,000 this year, with more than 9,000 new exhibitors, and online exhibiting enterprises reached 39,281.
“We are here for the first time,” Akhtar said, adding that he was hoping for the best.
“I was really impressed. The fair is well organised; we got good services from the constructor and from the Cantonese people. I brought in the best textile products. I would like to see how I can explore the market and how to start business with the Chinese buyers.”
Another first-time exhibitor at the fair Safdar Fayyaz, Chief Manager Exports at Piano Exports FZCO, also expressed his enthusiasm about the event.
“China is our big partner. We have heard that it is one of the largest fairs, so we are eager to come here, and hopefully more coordination will be seen in the future,” he voiced hope.
As one of the largest manufacturers of writing instruments and stationery items and one of the leading exporters to the globe, Piano Exports FZCO showcased its dazzling products with attractive prices and quality combination to international visitors.
Though visiting for the very first time, Fayyaz was quite confident about the future performance of products coming from an old brand established in 1965.
As entrepreneurs see it, their Make-in-Pakistan products can make its way into the Chinese market, and even beyond it.
“Pakistani textile products have their own edge here,” Akhtar told CEN. As China is a fast developing country, Pakistan with its specialisation in making certain textile goods will be able to break into this market with retailers.
“There should be more visits and exchanges between both countries,” he suggested.
“One of the best things we are doing right away is colouring pencils. We have some unique coloured pencils that may be of interest for Chinese buyers,” Fayyaz noted.
He observed that e-commerce was very important when exploring the Chinese market, “so we will definitely develop it very soon.”

1,Oil on track for third weekly fall,"Technically, crude has been through an exaggerated liquidation sell-off, Kissler said","Oil prices rose on Friday but were set for a third straight week of losses after sharp declines earlier in the week on fears about interest rate hikes, US banking sector problems and slowing Chinese demand.
Brent crude rose $2.88, or 4%, to $75.37 a barrel by 1703 GMT. US West Texas Intermediate was up $2.85, or 4.2%, at $71.42 after four days of declines that sent the contract to lows last seen in late 2021.
The Brent benchmark was on track to finish the week with a decline of about 5.2%, while WTI was set for a 6.6% loss, despite heading for their biggest daily percentage rises in a month.
“Crude is trying to reverse the recent washout in prices triggered by higher interest rates and recession fears mostly in the banking sector,” said Dennis Kissler, Senior Vice President of Trading at BOK Financial.
Technically, crude has been through an exaggerated liquidation sell-off, Kissler said.

3,Wall Street climbs on upbeat Apple results,Stronger jobs report eases fears of imminent economic downturn,"Wall Street’s main indexes gained on Friday as Apple’s upbeat results underscored resilience in corporate earnings, while a stronger-than-expected jobs report eased fears of an imminent economic downturn.
Apple Inc gained 4.4% on better-than-expected results, helped by strong iPhone sales and notable inroads in India and other newer markets, fuelling a near 2% advance in technology stocks.
Investors appeared to take in stride data showing US employers boosted hiring in April while raising wages, pointing to sustained labour market strength that could prompt the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates higher for some time.
The Labour Department’s report showed non-farm payrolls increased by 253,000 last month, higher than economists’ expectations of 180,000.
Wages increased 4.4% year-on-year in April after climbing 4.3% in March, while the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%.
“This is a strong report and shows that the labour market is resilient. It bails out the Fed for raising another quarter point,” said Peter Cardillo, Chief Market Economist at Spartan Capital Securities.
“It’s been a tough week for the stock market, the regional banking problems have raised the fear factor, but Apple earnings came in strong. Stocks are coming up from near-term oversold condition.”
Traders are betting the Fed will start easing the policy rate by September, according to CME Group’s FedWatch Tool, compared with July before the release of the jobs data.
The Fed raised its interest rate by 25 basis points as expected on Wednesday, but Chair Jerome Powell noted it was too early to say with certainty that the rate-hike cycle was over as inflation remains the chief concern.
Wall Street fell on Thursday after PacWest Bancorp’s move to explore strategic options deepened concerns about the health of regional banks, pulling down shares of peers and big banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo & Co.

4,Dollar supply improved 16% in Mar,It signals rupee may appreciate against greenback in near future,"Latest financial numbers indicate the supply of US dollar has improved 16% in Pakistan’s economy, signalling the rupee will appreciate against the greenback in the near future.
According to a report of the Optimus Capital Management (OCM), Pakistan’s net foreign exchange derivatives position improved by around 16%, or $900 million, to negative $4.8 billion in March 2023 compared to negative $5.7 billion in February 2023.
This means central bank borrowing from domestic commercial banks fell to $4.8 billion in March compared to $5.7 billion in February as it retired some of the debt, a financial expert elaborated.
The net foreign exchange derivatives are calculated by subtracting the foreign exchange reserves held by commercial banks from the reserves of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), as the central bank borrows the reserves of commercial banks (swapping dollar against rupee), it has been learnt.
The increase in US dollar supply has only theoretically improved the outlook for the rupee-dollar exchange rate.
The domestic currency continued to appreciate for the third consecutive working day on Friday as it inched up 0.08%, or Rs0.23, to Rs283.59 against the US dollar in inter-bank market.
The currency has continued to stabilise around current levels for the past one month.
OCM stated, “US dollar supply in the inter-bank market has considerably improved as manifested in the rising rupee-dollar forward premiums (rate) and declining SBP’s net short position.”
Talking to The Express Tribune, Ismail Iqbal Securities Head of Research Fahad Rauf said the increased supply of US dollar in the inter-bank market encouraged the central bank to purchase the surplus greenback and partially repay the debt to commercial banks last month.
He recalled that Pakistan’s current account turned a surplus at $654 million after a gap of 28 months in March 2023.
Rauf noted that SBP’s reserves had improved to $4.46 billion compared to less than $3 billion a couple of months ago. The improvement came partially through the $2 billion refinancing provided by China.
Despite the improvement, Rauf added, the central bank’s reserves remained critically low at $4.46 billion, providing just one month of import cover. “SBP’s reserves should provide at least three months of import cover at $15 billion.”
Furthermore, the turnaround in the current account balance was not a development that could be celebrated as it was an outcome of controlled imports. The government has virtually suspended imports, which resulted in complete or partial closure of factories and left millions of people jobless.
Imports reduced to less than $3 billion in April compared to an all-time high of around $8 billion hit earlier. The government has controlled imports due to the low foreign exchange reserves and to mitigate the risk of default.
The research head was of the view that the critically low foreign exchange reserves would not allow improvement in the rupee-dollar exchange rate in the near future.
However, the exchange rate would improve once the government attracts $8-10 billion in foreign investment or friendly countries provide new bailout packages.
He said the government was making efforts to convince the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to revive its $7 billion loan programme.
However, the fund has continued to put new conditions. In its latest condition, the lending institution has asked the government to further hike its key policy rate and impose new taxes in the next fiscal year budget.
Other global financial institutions and friendly countries have pledged around $9 billion in flood relief in January 2023. They are, however, waiting for the IMF’s nod for the revival of its loan programme to fulfil their financial commitments.
Meanwhile, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar has approached the United States for the second time in the past two months for the revival of IMF loan programme.
The IMF, however, said Pakistan needed to take financial commitment from friendly countries that they would lend $6-7 billion by the end of June 2023.
Earlier, Saudi Arabia and the UAE indicated fresh commitments of $2 billion and $1 billion respectively to the IMF.

5,Food sector displays robust growth,"Increase in prices, rebounding margins behind strong performance","Despite economic meltdown, the agriculture sector of Pakistan recorded a robust growth in the first quarter of 2023, driven by price increases and rebounding gross margins.
According to a JS Research report, the food sector continued to show robust performance during 1QCY23 as the topline expanded by 47% year-on-year (YoY).
Speaking to The Express Tribune, JS Global analyst Amreen Soorani highlighted that for the analysis of food sector’s performance during 1QCY23, a proxy of 11 listed food companies was taken for observation.
The majority of the contribution came from four companies that were broadly milk producers – Nestle Pakistan, FrieslandCampina Engro Pakistan, PREMA of At Tahour, and Fauji Foods – while other companies included a mix of confectionery, ready-made food items and other food segments.
According to the analysis, the topline growth was driven more by unit price increases and less by volumetric growth, said Soorani, attributing the boost to the ongoing higher food inflation, with limited/ negative economic growth.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for April 2023 clocked in at 36.4% YoY, and up 2.4% month-on-month, which was the highest YoY inflation since the available data, ie July 1965, according to AHL Research.
“This takes average inflation for 10 months of fiscal year 2022-23 to 28.23% compared to 11.04% in the corresponding period of previous fiscal year (FY22).”
Despite inflationary pressures and higher commodity prices, the sector was able to more than pass on the impact of cost to end-consumers as gross margins rebounded to 26%, up five percentage points quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) and two percentage points YoY.
The sector was also able to broadly expand its operating margins to 17%, the highest in recent history. Bigger companies witnessed higher efficiencies in selling and distribution expenses, which contributed to the expanding margins.
Muhammad Ali, an analyst at AKD Research, while talking to The Express Tribune pointed out that in the last six to eight months, prices increased phenomenally, which provided a margin to Pakistani food companies.
“Moreover, in the international market, prices of many commodities such as vegetable oil and seeds have gone down, which has also contributed to the increased margins,” he said.
Despite a negative impact on the margins of food companies due to the rising dollar, the food sector along with the banking and IT sectors experienced growth in the current economic situation, although the food sector was making losses last year. On the other hand, other sectors were facing a decline.
A high interest coverage ratio of seven times also favoured the sector’s limited increase in expenses in the ongoing high interest rate scenario when compared to other manufacturing sectors.

6,Climate change to severely impact CAREC region,"ADB cautions it can lead to water scarcity, food insecurity, conflict","Asian Development Bank (ADB) Director General for Central and West Asia Yevgeniy Zhukov said on Friday that climate change was expected to have severe impacts in the region covered by the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (Carec).
The grouping includes Central Asia, Mongolia, Pakistan, China and the South Caucasus.
He made the remarks at a press conference while launching a study titled “Carec 2030: Supporting Regional Actions to Address Climate Change” on the sidelines of the 56th ADB annual meeting.
Zhukov urged Central and West Asia and neighbouring countries to address the increasingly severe impact of climate change that could lead to water scarcity, food insecurity, and even conflict in the region. Carec 2030 is a study on climate challenges and opportunities in member countries of the regional cooperation framework.
According to the report, year 2022 witnessed particularly dramatic and deadly examples of the impact of climate change in the region, including the devastating floods in Pakistan, punishing droughts in Afghanistan and China, days and even weeks of excessive heat, and cross-border conflict over scarce water resources in Central Asia.
“The recent, intense weather events in Central and West Asia show that we need to take urgent collective action,” Zhukov said.
“Countries in the region must work together to cut greenhouse gas emissions, ramp up climate resilience and manage precious, shared natural resources for the betterment of all.”

7,Budget deficit widens by Rs3.5 trillion,Debt servicing cost alone Rs139b more than federal govt’s net income,"The federal budget deficit widened by over Rs3.5 trillion in the first nine months of current fiscal year on the back of a massive surge in spending on debt servicing and defence needs that consumed two-thirds of the total expenditure, the Ministry of Finance reported on Friday.
Fiscal operation details showed an abnormal increase of 70% in the debt servicing cost, which skyrocketed due to record-high interest rates.
During the July-March period, interest expenses stood at Rs3.58 trillion, up by Rs1.46 trillion compared to the same period of last fiscal year.
The cost of debt servicing alone was Rs139 billion more than the federal government’s net income during the same period. Earlier, the net income was fully meeting the interest expenses while partly covering the defence budget.
The federal government paid Rs3.1 trillion in domestic debt servicing, which was equal to 87% of the total debt servicing. The high share of domestic debt servicing underscores Pakistan will have to restructure the domestic debt along with the external debt to find a solution to the looming default risk.
However, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar on Friday again ruled out the possibility of debt restructuring, a path that can avert the debt default. The central bank has set the interest rate at 21% to contain inflation, a goal that the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) could not achieve but in the process dented fiscal position of the country.
It also forced the government to cut other expenses to pay for debt servicing and defence needs.
However, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said this week that Pakistan needed to further increase the interest rate to ease inflationary pressures.
As against the earlier estimate of Rs4 trillion, the government sees the debt servicing cost jumping to Rs5.2 trillion by the end of current fiscal year.
All other major current expenses, excluding defence, showed a negative growth in the first nine months of FY23. The other expenses amounted to Rs2.06 trillion, down by Rs429 billion, or 17%, compared to last year.
Excluding military pensions and expenses on the armed forces development programme, Rs1 trillion was spent on defence in nine months, which was Rs119 billion, or nearly 14%, more than last year.
Gross revenues swelled to Rs6.4 trillion and Rs2.95 trillion of federal taxes were transferred to provinces.
With a net income of Rs3.44 trillion, cumulative spending on debt servicing and defence jumped to over Rs4.6 trillion, Rs1.1 trillion more than the government’s net income. It suggested that Pakistan would continue to face the debt trap.
Furthermore, development expenses amounted to only Rs329 billion in nine months, as compared to Rs452 billion in the same period of last year, showing a reduction of 27%.
The government paid Rs524 billion in subsidies during the first half of current fiscal year.
Under the IMF programme, Pakistan had committed to converting its primary deficit, calculated after excluding interest payments, into a surplus of 0.2% of GDP, down from last fiscal year’s 3.1%. As a result of uncontrolled spending, however, the government will miss the target.
During the recent review talks, the IMF agreed to relax the primary budget deficit ceiling to 0.5% of GDP. Details have not yet been made public due to the delay in reaching a staff-level agreement.
Moreover, the federal budget deficit widened to nearly Rs3.54 trillion in the first nine months of FY23, as the gap between expenses and revenues was equal to 4.2% of GDP. In absolute terms, the deficit was 12% more than last year.
But due to the inflated size of the economy, the deficit was reduced by half a percentage point, thanks to nearly 37% inflation.
During the current fiscal year, the federal government’s total expenditure shot up to over Rs7 trillion, an increase of 17%. Current expenditure rose to Rs6.7 trillion, up by 21%. Non-tax collection increased to Rs1.24 trillion in nine months, higher by Rs258 billion or 26%.

9,Chinese bank opens LC for Russian oil import,"Pakistan will pay for 100,000 tons of crude oil in Chinese yuan","Pakistan has opened a Letter of Credit (LC) in the Bank of China for import of first oil cargo from Russia, which is expected to arrive in the last week of May.
According to sources, the LC has been opened in the Chinese bank in an attempt to make payment for the cargo – the first-ever purchase of Russian oil by Pakistan – in Chinese yuan. Russia will send a ship carrying 100,000 tons of crude oil.
At present, Pakistan is importing crude oil on a free-on-board (fob) basis, which means refineries will pay for the oil to be transported to the port.
However, Islamabad is importing oil from Russia on a cost, insurance and freight (CIF) basis, which means it will pay for the cargo after delivery at its port.
Though the payment for Russian oil will be in yuan, it will put a burden on Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves.
Pakistan receives currencies like UAE dirham and Saudi riyal from the two countries, hence, it would have been easier to make payments in those currencies instead of yuan, officials said, adding that yuan was not available and the country would have to buy it.
Consequently, Pakistan will have to arrange US dollars to buy the Chinese currency at a time when it is struggling to ease the pressure on its reserves. Already, imports have been restricted to reduce the burden of arranging dollars.
Initially, Moscow offered the option of making payments in three currencies including the UAE dirham, Chinese yuan and Russian ruble. The decision to pay in yuan came in the wake of US sanctions on Russia.
Pakistan, which follows the Platts price index, is hoping to get a discount of $16 to $18 per barrel on Russian crude oil.
“Russian oil will be shipped to Pakistan Refinery Limited (PRL) for testing its quality and production of refined products,” a source said.
This way, the economics of petroleum products produced from the first Russian cargo will be assessed based on the discount offered. So far, the specifications have not been found to be too good. Additionally, the freight rate is very high.
The discount has been offered to match the quality and freight rate for Arab Light Crude which Pakistani refineries are currently processing.
In addition to this, the ratio of Russian oil-based refined products will vary, which can disturb the economics of petroleum products.
According to the source, the processing of Arab Light crude leads to production of 45% high-speed diesel (HSD) and 25% furnace oil while the Russian crude will produce 32% HSD and 50% furnace oil.
“If we take such a ratio, Pakistan will require higher discounts from Russia,” the source remarked.
According to sources, the government will make a final decision after PRL submits its test report including the production ratio of diesel, petrol and furnace oil.
Refineries have already been facing difficulties in disposing of furnace oil after the country’s power plants shifted focus to liquefied natural gas (LNG).
Where would the furnace oil go, sources asked, adding that low production of HSD would increase cost, eroding the incentives given by Russia. Of late, the refineries have started exporting furnace oil.
During the previous tenure of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), the government began LNG import for the first time in 2015. However, it did not conduct due diligence for the consumption of furnace oil. Since then, the refineries have been in trouble, facing partial shutdown several times over power sector’s refusal to lift furnace oil stocks.
