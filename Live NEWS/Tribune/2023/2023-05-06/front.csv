0,Afghan peace at centre of trilateral talks,"Pakistan hosts China, Afghanistan at regional moot","Pakistan and China on Saturday sought to reassure Afghanistan that they would work towards stabilizing the war-torn country amid concerns over terrorism spilling over to the neighbouring countries.
The top officials of the two countries also sought guarantees from the visiting Afghan Interim Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi to do their part of the deal and nip the terror organisation in the bud.
Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari reiterated that peace and stability in Afghanistan remained vital for the socioeconomic development, connectivity and prosperity of the region.
‚ÄúWe will continue to work together with all stakeholders for peaceful, stable, prosperous and united Afghanistan,‚Äù the foreign minister said while addressing a joint news conference with the visiting Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang as Pakistan hosted the day-long 5th China-Pakistan-Afghanistan Trilateral Foreign Ministers dialogue at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

According to a statement issued by the Foreign Office, Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, China‚Äôs Foreign Minister Qin Gang, and Acting Foreign Minister of Afghanistan Amir Khan Muttaqi held productive discussions on covering areas of political engagement, counterterrorism, trade and connectivity.
‚ÄúPakistan is looking forward to advancing our common agenda for regional cooperation under the trilateral framework,‚Äù the Foreign Office statement added.
While this will be the Chinese foreign minister‚Äôs first visit to Pakistan, Muttaqi last travelled to Pakistan in November 2021, just a few months after the Afghan Taliban took control in Kabul.
The visit to Pakistan by the Afghan minister comes in the same week the UN hosted a conference on Afghanistan in Doha, Qatar, without inviting the country‚Äôs Taliban rulers.
Amir Khan Muttaqi is barred by international sanctions from leaving Afghanistan but was granted an exemption for a trip to Islamabad just days after the United Nations secretary-general again condemned the Taliban government's curbs on women.
With the minister for commerce and industry in tow, the Afghan delegation was one of the most high-profile to travel abroad since the Taliban seized power in August 2021 following the withdrawal of US-led foreign forces and collapse of the Western-backed government.

1,Imran builds up ‚Äòpressure‚Äô on govt to hold polls,Says rallies will start from Lahore next week and conclude in Attock on May 14,"PTI Chairman and former premier Imran Khan on Saturday announced to take to the streets in Punjab from next week in a bid to force the ruling coalition government to hold elections in the Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa assemblies, saying ‚Äúhe would start from Lahore and conclude in Attock on May 14‚Äù, and vowed to continue his struggle for the ‚Äúsupremacy of rule of law‚Äù in the country.
Earlier in the day, the PTI chief led a public rally in Lahore held to show support and solidarity with the Supreme Court and chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) amid the ongoing impasse between the judiciary and the parliament over the holding of polls in the two provincial assemblies.
Rallies were also taken out in other major cities of the country including Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Peshawar and Mardan.
A large number of PTI workers, supporters, lawyers and people from different walks of life participated in these rallies.
Addressing the rally in Lahore, Imran noted that ‚Äúimported rulers imposed in the country‚Äù had ruined the national economy.
‚ÄúToday, Pakistanis have awakened and come out of their houses to express solidarity with the chief justice of Pakistan who is standing for the supremacy of the Constitution,‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúIn just one year, they (incumbent government) have caused unprecedented inflation and unemployment in the country. Rupee has depreciated by almost 50 per cent owing to the flawed policies of the present rulers and political uncertainty in the country.‚Äù

Imran said no enemy had harmed Pakistan in the manner General (retd) Qamar Javed Bajwa did.
‚ÄúHe (Bajwa) had imposed these corrupt rulers who have no stake in the country. All their wealth, children and assets are parked in foreign countries. They came here to rule Pakistan.‚Äù
Castigating PM Shehbaz who is in the United Kingdom to attend the coronation ceremony of King Charles III, the PTI chairman questioned what the premier was doing in London when the country was grappling with terrorism.
‚ÄúThe other day, six officials of armed forces were martyred while on Thursday seven teachers were killed in Parachinar.‚Äù
Imran defends Bilawal
Commenting on foreign minister‚Äôs visit to India, Imran said Bilawal should have carried out the consultation process before going to the neighbouring country.
‚ÄúWhenever you go on a state visit by spending taxpayers‚Äô money you should consider pros and cons of the visit,‚Äù he said.
FM Bilawal was in Goa to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation‚Äôs Council of Foreign Ministers meeting last week.
Commenting on Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar presser where he censured Pakistan, the PTI chief said, ‚ÄúIndia should have a little courtesy but should know that powerful never remains powerful‚Äù.
‚ÄúThough, Pakistan is passing through a difficult time but by establishing rule of law the country will rise again,‚Äù he added.
The former premier reiterated that free and fair elections were the only way forward to end current chaos in the country, adding that PTI had sacrificed its Punjab and K-P governments to seek fresh mandate but polls were not held even the stipulated time of 90 days had passed.
Imran stressed that his party would not allow anyone to breach the Constitution and will continue its struggle for ‚Äúreal independence‚Äù in the country. ‚ÄúI will not stay home until the establishment of the rule of law and supremacy of Constitution in the country.‚Äù
He said that their struggle was not political but a ‚Äújehad‚Äù for ‚Äúreal independence of Pakistan‚Äù.

2,IHC declares NAB notices in gifts case illegal,Court says bureau can issue new notice after fulfilling all requirements of law,"The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Saturday declared the notices issued by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) to PTI Chairman Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi ‚Äúare not in accordance with the law, therefore they have no legal status‚Äù.
IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Babar Sattar issued a detailed seven-page decision that stated that the bureau, according to the NAB amendment, has to state in the notice whether it is summoning the former prime minister and his wife as an accused or in any other capacity.
‚ÄúWhile sending notices to Imran and Bushra Bibi, Section 19(E) of the NAB amendment was not fully implemented,‚Äù the IHC observed.
The court added that if the person is an accused, he should be informed of the charges so that he can present his defence.
The IHC further maintained that the accountability bureau can issue a new notice after fulfilling all the requirements of the law.
‚ÄúThis amendment of NAB shows that it was done to fulfill the requirements of Article 10A fair trial,‚Äù noted the IHC.
The former prime minister and his wife had pleaded in a petition before the IHC filed through Khawaja Haris Ahmed and Barrister Gohar Ali Khan that the anti-graft body had issued the notice in violation of Section 19 of the National Accountability Ordinance.
‚ÄúThe contents of the call-up notice unambiguously establish that the respondent [NAB] had, through their impugned notice, initiated a fishing exercise, rather than complying with the provision of law before issuing the same,‚Äù the petitions stated.
The court was thus requested to declare the NAB notice illegal.
Read Questionnaire sent to Imran in Toshakhana case
The move came as the NAB summoned the PTI chief and the former first lady in the Toshakhana case. The NAB team arrived at Imran's Zaman Park residence to deliver the notice to Bushra, who was summoned on March 21.
Earlier, the accountability watchdog had summoned the PTI chief and his wife to their Rawalpindi office on March 9 for investigation in the Toshakhana case.
Imran's summons notice was sent to his residences at Bani Gala and Chak Shehzad in Islamabad.
NAB inquired about jewellery sets presented to Bushra, which included a Rolex watch, a gold and diamond locket gifted by the Emir of Qatar, and two necklace sets presented by the Saudi crown prince on September 18, 2020, and May 21, 2021, respectively.
The notice stated that the ‚Äúcompetent authority has taken cognisance of an offence allegedly committed by the accused persons under the provisions of NAO, 1999‚Äù.
‚ÄúIn this regard, the inquiry proceedings have revealed that during your tenure in office you retained some state gifts presented to you by various foreign dignitaries including the following luxury items ‚Äî five Rolex wristwatches; one iPhone presented by Chief of Staff, Qatar Armed Forces, dated 14.11.2018; (No. E67574V3), a pair of cufflinks, one ring; unstitched cloth from Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia dated 18.09.2020; Graff gift set containing one Graff wristwatch Master Graff Special Edition Mecca timepiece, one 18K gold and diamond Graff pen and a ring and pair of cufflinks with micro-painting of Mecca,‚Äù it added.
Toshakhana, operating under the Cabinet Division, is tasked with safeguarding valuable items and presents gifted to Pakistani public officials. Imran has encountered legal challenges due to his possession of gifts cited in the NAB notice, resulting in his previous disqualification by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP). Additionally, Imran is scheduled to be charged in a distinct Toshakhana gift-related lawsuit by the IHC on May 10.
Miscellaneous petitions
Imran has also filed two civil miscellaneous applications, seeking directions to club all his cases at one appropriate venue and permission for audio/video-link during his court appearances.
The applications were filed by the petitioner through his counsel Barrister Salman Safdar in the Lahore High Court (LHC) on Saturday.

Imran's counsel requested the court to direct concerned authorities to make necessary arrangements for conducting all cases against the petitioner at a specified venue or court, minimising disruption to other judicial work, and ensuring foolproof security arrangements for everyone present during the proceedings, including judges, lawyers, litigants, and court staff.
Separately, the PTI chief prepared a ‚Äúspecial‚Äù power of attorney, nominating lawyer Naeem Panjutha as his substitute for court proceedings.
According to the power of attorney, a copy of which is available with The Express Tribune, Panjutha has the authority to file petitions, appeals, and intra-court appeals in all courts.
Furthermore, the lawyer also has the authority to record a statement in court on the former prime minister‚Äôs behalf.
Imran has maintained in the power of attorney that due to personal engagements as party chief, he cannot appear in court in civil and criminal cases.

3,IMF negates govt‚Äôs claim of meeting loan conditions,Mission official says upcoming budget details also need to be shared,"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Friday said that the $1.2 billion 9th review of the bailout programme will be completed once the necessary financing is in place and the agreement is finalised, noting that there was an agreement on the issue between both the sides.
The statement, sent to The Express Tribune, highlights a widening trust deficit between Pakistan and the IMF, as it negates the claim made by the government with respect to meeting all prior actions necessary to complete the 9th review.
The government will also have to satisfy the global lender about the policies that it wants to roll out, including the budget for the fiscal year 2023-24 -- a demand that the finance ministry officials claim was tantamount to changing goalposts.
‚ÄúThe IMF continues to work with the Pakistani authorities to bring the 9th review to a conclusion once the necessary financing is in place and the agreement is finalized,‚Äù stated Nathan Porter, the IMF Mission Chief to Pakistan.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Finance Minister Ishaq Dar had claimed that Pakistan met all the prior conditions agreed for reaching a staff-level agreement and there was no reason for holding back the agreement.
On Thursday, in an article published in an English day, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar had claimed that ‚ÄúPakistan has already complied with all the prior actions for the 9th review with the IMF‚Äù. Dar further wrote that it was expected that the staff level agreement will be signed soon with the IMF which should be followed by the approval of the 9th review by the IMF board.
But Nathan‚Äôs statement negated what the Pakistani authorities have been claiming since February 9, when the face-to-face talks ended inconclusively.
Nathan did not explain the quantum of the necessary financing that Pakistan has to put in place to conclude the 9th review for the $1.2 billion loan tranche that has been delayed by seven months now.
The finance minister had said that Pakistan needed $6 billion to bridge the financing gap till June this year. Out of which Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates had assured Pakistan of providing $3 billion but there are no firm assurances for the rest of the loans.
Pakistan‚Äôs gross official foreign exchange reserves remain at $4.5 billion. The country needs to pay nearly $4 billion to the world on account of principal and interest on debt, including $1 billion SAFE deposit of China, till June this year.
Since the government does not have a credible financing plan for July-December period of the next fiscal year, the sources said, Pakistan also needs to arrange funds to repay the loans during the first half of the next fiscal year.
The external debt repayments, including interest, for the July-December period amount to $11 billion, said the Finance Ministry sources. Even if China and Saudi Arabia rollover their short-term debts, Pakistan will still need over $4 billion to repay to the international creditors during the first half of next fiscal year. These include payments to the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, Saudi Fund for Development, Islamic Development Bank and Chinese commercial banks.
Nathan Porter has also mentioned the next fiscal year‚Äôs budget in his statement, which the government wants to present around June 10. ‚ÄúIn addition, the IMF supports the authorities in the implementation of policies in the period ahead, including in the technical work to prepare the fiscal 2024 budget, which is to be passed by the National Assembly before end-June,‚Äù said Porter.
The Ministry of Finance, already struggling to meet other conditions, seemed irritated by the IMF‚Äôs new demand. Senior finance ministry officials argued that the IMF should not link the approval of the 9th review with the next year‚Äôs budget.
They said that the issue of the fiscal year 2023-24 budget should be taken up at the time of the discussions for the 11th review. ‚ÄúThe IMF‚Äôs demand is worrisome,‚Äù said a cabinet member on condition of anonymity.
Less than two months are left in the expiry of the stalled $6.5 billion IMF programme. There seems to be no possibility that Pakistan and the IMF will conveniently complete the remaining three outstanding reviews of the programme.
Due to Pakistan‚Äôs failure to implement the programme conditions on time, the $2.6 billion still remain undisbursed out of the $6.5 billion despite getting a nine-month extension in the programme by former finance minister Miftah Ismail.
The finance ministry sources said that the finance secretary recently urged Nathan Porter to review the demand for an agreement on the next year‚Äôs budget.
However, the IMF, already agitated by the government‚Äôs contradictory claims about completion of the conditions, may not offer any major relief to Pakistan.
There are concerns that the coalition government may try to unveil a politically-oriented budget, which will make it more difficult to take the country out of the economic crisis in the near future.
