About non-custom-paid vehicles, he added that the matter was being dealt by the Customs Department and the provincial government has nothing to do with it. 
""We have received complaints about drugs being used inside educational institutions. I request the education minister to fix a day for a briefing on it,"" he said.
The issue of drugs being used in the educational institutions was raised by PTI MPA Dr Imran who said, ""Why the government does not visit local schools."" He added that over 187,100 deaths occur in a year in Pakistan due to drugs-related issues. The UNODC claims over 800,000 people, aged between 15 and 64, use heroin regularly.
