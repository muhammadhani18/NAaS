6,Dengue report rings alarm bells for Rawalpindi,"Says dengue larvae detected in more than 1,000 spots during surveillance","An anti-dengue monitoring report has raised alarm bells for Rawalpindi after the discovery of a huge quantity of larvae in over a thousand houses and commercial buildings in the garrison city.
The surveillance report has been submitted to the district administration which has painted a gloomy picture of the situation as a huge quantity of dengue larvae has been detected across the Rawalpindi district during indoor and outdoor surveillance, which has also baffled officials.
The report has predicted an all-out dengue outbreak in Rawalpindi this year due to the prevalence of dengue larvae. It said that the situation could worsen further when the weather turns hot, which provides an ideal ground for the breeding of dengue virus.
Sources said that a decision has been made to launch a new campaign against the dengue larvae on a war footing basis.
The sources said that all department heads who fail to conduct effective anti-dengue campaigns will get show-cause notices and cases will be registered against locals and traders who fail to implement the instructions.
Sources said that the district administration has received the dengue surveillance report. The four units of the Rawalpindi district — Rawal Town, Potohar Town, Rawalpindi Cantonment and Chaklala Cantonment — were under indoor and outdoor surveillance as of January 1, 2023, according to the report.
Dengue larvae were examined in over 0.14 houses during this period, and dengue larvae were detected in 966 houses. The report has blamed the residents for their negligence over the widespread detection of the larvae.
Dengue larvae can be found breeding in open water tanks, pots, and other locations inside homes.
The report indicated that the anti-dengue surveillance teams inspected 16,919 sites during the outdoor surveillance and 134 high-density dengue larvae spots were found.
The report said that dengue mosquitoes and larvae were discovered at 1,100 different locations around Rawalpindi.
According to the report, experts have voiced concerns that this year's dengue mosquito attacks in Rawalpindi may become more severe because of the recent rains and offhand anti-dengue operations.
The report said that the dengue virus can easily attack citizens because the larvae was widespread in densely populated areas.
Sources said all departments have been directed to use all available resources to make the anti-dengue campaign a success.
The sources said there is the risk of rising dengue cases as the recent rains have provided an ideal ground for the breeding of dengue larvae and mosquitoes.
The report said that despite several measures and fogging, dengue mosquitoes could not be eradicated. It said that the current temperature and humidity in Rawalpindi were providing favourable conditions for dengue mosquitos to breed.
An official claimed that the Rawalpindi administration was active to eradicate dengue but the negligence and carelessness of the citizens were hampering the efforts.
