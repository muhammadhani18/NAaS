0,Govt seeks to quash pleas against suo motu law,Top court again requested to form full court to hear matter,"The federal government on Saturday urged the Supreme Court to reject the petitions challenging the law aimed at curbing the top judge’s discretionary powers to take suo motu notices and form benches.
Instead, it stipulates that these powers will be vested in a three-member committee, comprising the chief justice of Pakistan and two-senior most judges.
In a separate application, the government also demanded the formation of a full court to hear the pleas against the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act 2023, despite its similar request --albeit made informally -- being recently turned down by the SC.
In a concise statement, Additional Attorney General for Pakistan Amir Rehman submitted the federal government’s eight-page response to the SC bench hearing the petitions against the law.
The government maintained that the bill had become an Act of parliament after it was passed in a joint sitting last month.
“The instant petition[s] [are] clearly an attempt to prevent the advancement of justice, independence of judiciary and availing of remedy to persons aggrieved of any judgment and/or order of this Hon’ble Court passed under Article 184-3,” it read.
It added that the petitioners had approached the court “with unclean hands, lack bonafide and as such, are not entitled to any indulgence by this Hon’ble Court”.
“In terms of Section 2, the power to constitute benches, which is thereto vested in the Hon’ble Chief Justice under the Supreme Court Rules, 1980 (the SC Rules), is to be exercised by a committee comprising of the Hon’ble Chief Justice and the two next senior most judges of this Court,” it added.
The government argued that the concept of Master of Roster, had no statutory backing.
It added that the law would regulate the authority of the chief justice of Pakistan under Article 184-3 of the Constitution.
The government noted that the law would not reduce the powers of the judiciary.
It argued that the law had given the right to appeal under the authority of Article 184-3.
It continued that Article 10-A of the Constitution gave the right to a fair trial, adding that the power of revision in Article 184-3 was very limited.
The response stated that the right to appeal was essential to a fair trial.
It contended that the Act could not in any sense be considered to interfere with the judiciary's functions or to curtail its powers.
It maintained that the law was not in any way inconsistent with the Constitution.
The reply noted that the SC had itself conceded that there were difficulties with the formation of benches in cases of suo motu notice taken by the CJP.
It was further argued that many cases were not scheduled for months. The response added that there were also instances where the appeals of the accused had been scheduled after the execution of the case.
The response concluded with the government asking the SC to reject the petitions filed against the Act.
In its application for the full court, the government noted it had requested that the petitions be heard by all the  judges of the court because of the paramount importance of the constitutional questions involved and the fact that it was a case of first impression.
“The parliament passed the [law] in exercise of its powers under the Constitution while fully cognisant of the principles of separation of power and constitutional command to secure independence of the judiciary,” the application added.
According to the petition, the government hoped that the full court would be able to resolve the issue in the fairest and most transparent manner possible, in the interest of upholding the rule of law and independence of the judiciary.

1,"Ruling alliance, PTI locked in a stalemate","While govt seeks more time for talks, PTI sees no hope in the parleys","The stalemate between the ruling alliance and the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) continued on Friday as the government urged the Supreme Court to give more time for talks between the two sides but the PTI leadership didn’t see any hope in the talks and pressed for holding polls in Punjab on May 14.
At the Supreme Court, the leadership of both sides remained adamant on their stance but pointed fingers at the other side for not showing flexibility in the three rounds of talks held in the past few days but ended without agreeing on the dissolution of the national, Sindh and Balochistan assemblies as well as on the date for general elections in the country.
While Federal Minister for Railways Khawaja Saad Rafique expressed hope that issues could be resolved through dialogue, PTI Vice Chairman Shah Mehmood Qureshi said the government did “nothing new” in the talks despite PTI trying to make the negotiations a success.
The railways minister said that the government and PTI have held meaningful negotiations and there has been no delay in the matter, saying that the on-going issues could be resolved through negotiations and the court should give more time.
Speaking to the media outside the Supreme Court, the minister clarified that the government doesn’t have any intention to continue ruling beyond the constitutional period. For political reconciliation, he said, the ruling alliance has shown flexibility in the talks.
Rafique said that Pakistan has fulfilled all the conditions of the IMF yet an agreement could not be reached. While referring to the political volatility, he said that the former premier Imran Khan should show patience for a few more weeks in the larger interest of Pakistan.
In his media talk, Rafique said that the government not only wants transparent elections but wishes that everyone should accept the poll results. He said that the court should not give instructions as politicians can sit across the table on their own to solve issues.
On the dissolution of the assemblies, Rafique said that prematurely dissolving both Sindh and Balochistan assemblies just because Punjab assembly has already been dissolved was a difficult task.

Earlier in his statement before the court, Rafique while urging the court to give more time said that the ruling parties wish to find a solution through dialogue, adding the government does not want to stay even an hour beyond its term.
Meanwhile, Qureshi while talking to the media after the hearing in the Supreme Court said that the government was going left and right in the name of negotiations and it is not showing any flexibility.
The PTI leader alleged that the government did not consider PTI’s suggestions even when PTI expressed willingness that it was ready to go back to the National Assembly, amend the constitution, accept the caretaker government and the results of the upcoming general elections.
Qureshi said that the government was sticking to its stance and did not even show any flexibility before the Supreme Court, saying the government’s representatives rather talked arrogantly.
He said that PTI was trying its best to make the negotiations fruitful and had made every possible effort for achieving the objective but the government, in the meantime, was busy arresting PTI workers.
He said that everyone knows that parliament was being used by two big families of the country to protect their political interests while pushing the country towards a constitutional crisis. He also alleged that there has been no progress in the government’s negotiations with the IMF.
In between April 27 and May 3, the much-anticipated talks between the ruling alliance and PTI remained inconclusive as leaders from both sides confirmed that there was a “stalemate” between the two sides on the date for the dissolution of the assemblies and holding of the general elections in the country.
Though the negotiators from the ruling alliance and the PTI had failed to develop a consensus on the date for dissolving the National, Sindh and Balochistan assemblies and holding polls, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar had said that both sides agreed upon holding general elections on the same day under the caretaker set-up, saying that both sides have agreed to accept poll results as well.
The third round of talks between the government and the PTI was held at the Parliament House on Tuesday night but it couldn’t lead to ending the ongoing political and constitutional stalemate as both sides failed to make headway on the assemblies’ dissolution and holding of general elections.

4,"Parliament, judiciary face off",Experts believe CJ has the key to avert crisis,"Some experts believe that Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandail’s reluctance to constitute a full court to hear crucial political cases has not only led to a clash between parliament and the apex court but also resulted in a division within the top judiciary.
Parliament and the judiciary came face to face after a three-judge bench—led by CJP Bandial and consisting of Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Muneeb Akhtar—on April 4 ordered the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to hold elections for the Punjab Assembly on May 14.
Rejecting the decision, the parliament first passed a resolution against the bench and later rejected a government bill seeking release of funds for the polls.
The coalition government and the ECP oppose polls in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) citing lack of funds and security concerns while the SC bench and the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party are pushing for holding elections within 90-day constitutional period or a date close to it.
Justice Bandial last week sought record of the parliament’s proceedings with regard to the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023, while rejecting requests to form a full court to hear pleas filed against the piece of legislation that curtails the CJP’s powers.
In response, the lawmakers in the National Assembly called for accountability of the judiciary and judges and even urged the NA speaker to convert the whole house into a committee and summon the CJP before it to seek an explanation from him over seeking record of assembly proceedings.
“I think that parliament reached this level of defiance because the CJ continued to rely on a few judges while ignoring some of the senior most judges while hearing politically important cases,” said Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat) President Ahmed Bilal Mehboob.
“This led to a formal disagreement from within the SC in the form of judgments and orders. This phase of the restlessness could have come to an end if the CJP had convened a full court,” he said. The Pildat chief said the CJP has been conducting things rather unfairly up till now.
Mehboob said this crisis may come to an end after the CJP’s retirement but will leave a trail of bitterness. He described the ECP’s May 3 review petition as a “silver lining”.
“The petition has provided an opportunity to the bench to review their unenforceable order to hold election on 14 May without in-depth consideration of the ramifications of split elections and the prevailing security situation as later briefed by the top security officials to the CJP in his chamber.”
Mehboob hoped that the bench will steer itself and the country out of the current crisis, saying pleasantly surprising is the attitude of the two rival political sides, who did not agree on an election date but struck a conciliatory tone and may still agree on a date to hold elections for all the legislatures simultaneously.
However, renowned legal expert Faisal Siddiqi only sees chaos reigning supreme. For him, the current legal impasse is not merely a judicial crisis but judicial chaos, saying nearly half of the top court’s judges have disagreed and criticized the CJP over his reluctance to constitute a full court.
Read Parliament, judiciary stand face to face
Siddiqi, who regularly writes on legal issues, said he had predicted the scenario of constitutional stalemate in his column and interview in the second week of April.
The CJP fears judicial dissent, Siddiqi noted, saying the government while taking advantage of judges’ divide started openly defying the top court’s orders. He felt that only CJP Bandial could stop the judicial anarchy from spreading further as he has the powers as well as responsibility to do so.
For him, the solution lies in calling a full court administrative meeting to develop a consensus on the constitution of benches and listing of the cases as envisaged in the Act of 2023. He, however, expressed little hope that such consensus would be reached.
Former senator Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar while responding to the questions about the clash between the institutions where lawmakers want to ensure parliament’s sovereignty while judges wish to maintain judicial writ said that “these are all signs of an imploding society”.
“All institutions have lost credibility and are bitterly divided,” the former Senator said, “with no sanity in sight it’s the common Pakistani who’s paying the price.” He noted that inflation has hit through the roof and terrorism is on the rise.
Khokhar said that one can only hope that “all stakeholders will take a step back, take stock of the gravity of the crisis and decide on a date to go to polls for people of Pakistan to settle the matter in free and fair elections.”
Political expert Zaigham Khan said that the ongoing tussle is not just a clash between institutions but a clash between the three pillars of the State; parliament, executive and judiciary; as they are in a confrontation mode.
“The problem is old; the institutions are trespassing into each other’s space,” Zaigham said, recalling that the issue started from ex-CJP Iftikhar Chaudhry’s era when “his brand of Supreme Court started intruding into executive and parliament’s territory. This trend has continued.”
Zaigham said that the Supreme Court while interpreting the constitution has effectively re-written it and they have tried to do things that belong to the executive and parliament. “Parliament is hitting back but the problem is it can’t do much because there is no effective system of the Supreme Court’s accountability,” he said.
“If Supreme Court does something against the Constitution, there is hardly anything you can do about it,” Zaigham said, “this situation is dangerous because it is leading to sort of anarchy, which is very dangerous for the State; for the working of the State; and for judiciary. Both sides are at fault.”
Elaborating further about the fault, he said that elections must be held within 90 days but the way Supreme Court took over the cases from the high court and started conducting proceedings under Article 184/3 has complicated the problem.
“National Assembly’s resolutions are simply meaningless as the assembly acts through legislation and amendments in constitution,” he said, saying the National Assembly can be effective only in the current situation if it could amend the constitution. But, he said, that can’t happen right now.
“Supreme Court has lost much of its moral authority due to its own internal division and judicial activism, which has in fact turned into political activism,” he concluded.

7,FM urges SCO unity to confront plethora of challenges,Bilwal terms security of the region a joint responsibility,"Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari on Friday stressed the need for collective action by the regional countries under Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) to jointly address the common issues, including climate change, poverty and terrorism.
In his address at the SCO Council of Foreign Ministers meeting in the Indian coastal report, the foreign said that geopolitics must not affect the commitment to address these challenges and learn lessons for the collective good.
“The solution to our collective challenges should be collective action, not a divided reaction… We must isolate these issues from hyper-partisan geopolitics if we are to succeed,” he told the SCO foreign ministers.
“Pakistan remains committed to multilateralism and will continue to play a leading role at all international forums, including the United Nations, for forging friendly relations among nations and supporting peaceful settlement of international disputes,” he added.
In a comprehensive speech, the foreign minister highlighted Pakistan’s vision of enhanced regional economic connectivity and win-win cooperation. “Our excuse cannot be that we were too divided to put up a fight!”
Climate change
Bilawal said the climate crisis posed an existential threat to the humanity and proposed a joint working group in the SCO on climate change. He reminded the developed world of their commitment to providing $100 billion annually for climate finance.
On connectivity, he said Pakistan will host a ‘Conference on Transport Connectivity for Regional Prosperity’ in September this year and added that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) could be a force multiplier for regional connectivity.
Poverty
The foreign minister emphasised that poverty still plagued this region and mentioned that Pakistan was proud of the internationally acclaimed Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP).
The BISP, the minister added, ushered Pakistan into a silent revolution of poverty alleviation together with women’s empowerment. “The establishment of a special working group on poverty alleviation proposed by Pakistan would be a step forward.”
Regional security
Bilawal termed the collective security of the region a joint responsibility, stressing that terrorism continued to threaten global security. “Let’s not get caught up in weaponising terrorism for diplomatic point-scoring,” he warned.
He recalled that he spoke as the son, whose mother was assassinated at the hands of terrorists. “I feel the pain of this loss, empathise with victims across the world in a way most can’t,” he said, referring to the martyrdom of late Benazir Bhutto in 2007.
“Pakistan is firmly committed to being a part of regional and global efforts for eradicating this menace that requires a comprehensive and collective approach to address its root causes as well as the threats posed by specific groups,” he said.
“It requires that we let this challenge unite us to fight it rather than divide us to become its victim. Our success requires us to isolate this issue from geo-political partisanship,” the foreign minister added.
The foreign minister called for strengthening the Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO RATS) to effectively address the growing threats to peace and security.
At the same time, the foreign minister emphasised: “We must stop conflating non-state actors with state actors. Condemn all forms of terrorism including state-sponsored terrorism.”
Afghanistan
He called upon the international community to meaningfully engage with the interim Afghan government to better understand and influence the course of events, especially on girls’ right to education and security.
He called on the authorities in Kabul not to allow the use of Afghan soil for terrorism. “A peaceful and stable Afghanistan is a key not only to regional integration and economic cooperation but also to global peace and stability,” he said.
He commended China’s recent role in bridging differences between Saudi Arabia and Iran. “When great powers play the role of peacemaker, we can unlock the potential of peace, while paving the way for greater cooperation, regional integration, and economic opportunities for our peoples.”
The chair of the SCO Council of Foreign Ministers, Dr S Jaishankar, foreign ministers of SCO member states, the secretary general of the SCO, and the director of the executive committee of SCO RATS attended the meeting.
