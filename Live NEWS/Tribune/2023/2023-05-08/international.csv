0,PDM-PTI negotiations ‘not to bear fruit’,Khattak says government not sincere in holding elections,"Provincial President of Pakistan Tahreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Pervaz Khattak has said that negotiations between Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) and PTI will not bear fruit because the ruling coalition was not sincere about it.
“These negotiations are just a tactic to buy more and more time and the government is not willing to hold elections,” he said while talking to journalists on Saturday.
Khattak said that if the PDM wants the elections of the provincial and national assemblies on the same day then it should dissolve the national assembly and provincial assemblies too to pave way for it.
“We will not hold talks with PDM in the future and there should be no negotiations with them on this issue,” he maintained, adding that PTI has moved the Supreme Court for Punjab elections while the K-P elections case has been in the Peshawar High Court.
“We expect that the courts would decide the case as per the constitution and if the constitution is violated then it would be a great injustice with this country,” he observed.
“It will be a great injustice too if the judges are insulted by the rulers of this country and it will be a law of the jungle then,” he said, adding that PTI has no objection to a full court to decide cases.
Khattak hit out at the PDM by saying that it took power to clear cases against key figures of the ruling coalition.
“These people have no intention to serve the masses. They are in power to fulfil their own personal agenda,” he added.
Replying to a question about the tussle between the parliament and Supreme Court, Pervaz Khattak said that personal motives had made the rulers blind as introducing any amendments needed a two-thirds majority instead of simple majority,
“PDM fears that Imran Khan will sweep the elections and that is why they are employing such tactics. But in politics some people will win and others will lose. It is part of the game so they should go for the polls,” he shared.
Khattak said that PTI has no misunderstanding about the intentions of the PDM and government and that is why it will not hold talks with the government.

2,Flour prices go up across Balochistan,"According to dealers, a 20 kilo bag of flour in Quetta has touched the Rs3,100 mark","The price of wheat flour has been on the rise across Balochistan as the government has failed to ensure availability of food staple in sufficient quantity to overcome the shortage.
The flour crisis has further worsened in Quetta, Loralai and other parts of Balochistan as the supply has been interrupted over the past few weeks.
The provincial government appears to be helpless in the face of the crisis as per kilogram flour is being sold at over Rs160 in the local market.
According to dealers, a 20 kilo bag of flour in Quetta has touched the Rs3,100 mark and people are also worried due to the situation because everyone was expecting a decrease after the start of wheat harvest across the country.
The flour dealers in Balochistan have announced a strike against the ban on inter-provincial supply of flour from Punjab. According to flour dealers, there was a ban on bringing flour from Punjab and trucks loaded with flour had been stopped at check posts on the Punjab border with Balochistan.
They sought assistance from the government to resolve the issue on an emergency basis and make sure the availability of flour at affordable rates for the people of Balochistan.

3,Thousands march against teachers’ slaughter,Later the protesters gathered outside the press club and started a sit-in,"Thousands of local residents on Sunday once against took to the streets against the brutal killing of eight people at a school near Pak-Afghan border in Kurram tribal district.
The protest rally started from Ziaran and culminated in Para Chinar Chowk. It was attended by a large number of people including students, members of civil society and political parties.
The participants chanted slogans and demanded arrest of those responsible for the atrocity.
Later the protesters gathered outside the press club and started a sit-in.
“The slain teachers and drivers had no enmity with anyone. The story of the land dispute is fabricated by the district administration in order to draw the attention away from this act of sectarian-motivated terror attack,” said the speakers while addressing the sit-in.
“We really condemn the false reports by the district administration in this regard. The school is located 35-km away from the district headquarters and the district administration has no idea of the ground reality,” they said, adding that no one could kill seven people inside a government high school without inviting attention in the name of land dispute.
It may be mentioned here that K-P Caretaker Chief Minister Muhammad Azam Khan on Thursday sought report of the brutal murder of eight people including five schoolteachers in Kurram district.
He took notice of the incident and directed district administration as well as police to submit a report in this connection. The chief minister expressed his sorrow over the loss of precious human lives, saying that targeting teachers inside a government school was indeed a tragic incident.
In a press statement issued here he directed police to arrest those responsible for the heinous crime.
He observed that those who want to take law in their own hand will be punished and no one will be allowed to create law and order situation in the district.

4,Irresponsible disposal: Medical waste threatens public health,"In the absence of an incinerator, public and private hospitals dispose of toxic waste outside their facilities","As novel outbreaks continue to jeopardize public health across the global, the mismanagement of medical waste across major hospitals in the northern-province, risks instigating a bigger health crisis.
Despite international standards of medical waste disposal, mandating the use of an incinerator to safely burn hazardous materials such as used needles, syringes, removed organs, bodily fluid samples and contaminated equipment, a large number of hospitals across K-P continue to operate without the essential waste management machinery.
“So far we have issued legal notices to 35 public and private hospitals, including the Lady Reading Hospital, which are currently functioning without an incinerator and are disposing off their waste unsafely out in the open,” revealed an inspector from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), on the condition of anonymity.
Hasan Khan, a student of Environmental Science at the University of Peshawar, seconded the inspector from EPA, as he reported personally witnessing huge amounts of medical waste lying around various hospitals in Peshawar.
“Not only are these piles of medical waste polluting the environment, but they are also spreading diseases among the children who scavenge through infected organs and tissues, in search of items like syringes and needles,” informed Khan.
According to Dr. Muhammad Nafees, Chairman of the Department of Environmental Science at the University of Peshawar, when hospitals throw invasive equipment like needles and other diseased organs recklessly outside their facilities, the children who collect these toxic materials for sale, can easily contract life threatening diseases like HIV/AIDS.
“In order to tackle the problem and prevent a possible epidemic, the K-P Health Department must join hands with EPA, in order to arrange for an incinerator immediately,” urged Dr. Nafees.
Speaking to the Express Tribune, Anwar Khan, Director General of EPA, addressed the growing health and environmental concerns raised by the unavailability of incinerators for a safe disposal of medical waste in hospitals.
“Even though we have sent legal notices to numerous public and private hospitals, urging them to use an incinerator, we cannot seal a medical facility on these grounds. The EPA has started working on allocating a designated area for waste disposal in partnership with the Water and Sanitation Services Company (WASA),” elucidated Anwar Khan.
