0,"Judges, AGP weigh merits of ‘full court’",Apex court orders top law officer to submit parliament’s record,"Grilling the state’s top law officer over his request to form a full court, the top court has once again ordered Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Awan to submit the record of parliament and a standing committee with regard to the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023.
An eight-judge larger bench of the Supreme Court on Monday resumed hearing of the petitions filed against the piece of legislation that seeks to ‘regulate’ powers of the chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) with regard to forming benches and initiating suo motu proceedings.
AGP Awan told the bench led by CJP Umar Ata Bandial that the federal government has submitted an application for the formation of full court to hear the petitions. The counsel for the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) said the party has also moved an application for forming a full court.
The SC bench on May 2 also sought record of the parliament’s proceedings with regard to the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act 2023. Taking up some petitions filed against the bill, the SC on April 13 stopped the enforcement of the bill in what was described by some as a preemptive move.

However, despite the SC’s order, the bill became a law on April 22 as the National Assembly Secretariat formally asked the Printing Corporation of Pakistan (PCP) to publish it in the official gazette.
In his arguments on Monday, the AGP said the law deals with formation of benches and the right to appeal in suo motu cases. He said the law deals with matters which are administrative in nature.
“The Supreme Court rules were approved by a full court and only a full court can amend these rules.
“A case related to independence of judiciary and the SC rules should also be heard by a full court as the law will also be applicable to the SC judges who are not part of this bench,” he said.
Justice Ijazul Ahsan remarked that the question is about the parliament’s power to legislate in this matter and not about amending the SC rules. “Different SC benches have been regularly hearing cases related to [a legislature’s] power to make laws,” he said.
Justice Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi asked if the parliament had ever made such a law. “How can such legislation take place despite Article 91 [of the Constitution}?” he said.
The AGP conceded that the case is unique in its nature and “that is why it is necessary to form a full-court to hear this matter.”
Justice Ayesha Malik observed that the cases that are the first of their kind often land in courts and any bench of the apex court can hear any case. “Does the government want to take advantage of a full court? Does the government want to highlight the court’s internal differences?”
She said every case is important. “Then how can it be determined which case should be heard by a full court and which by regular benches? Has every case related to independence of the judiciary been heard by a full court in the past?”
The AGP agreed that all cases related to independence of judiciary have not been heard by a full court.
The CJP remarked that apparently the case does not warrant formation of a full-court.
Justice Ayesha Malik asked if the government wanted to imply that people only trusted a full court. “How can the court regulate its proceedings on the wishes of petitioners?”
Justice Shahid Waheed asked if the bench was supposed to order the CJP to form a full-court.
Justice Munib Akhtar said a full court is entitled to make rules related to administrative matters. “What if a petition with regard to interpreting some rules is listed before a three-judge bench? Should this matter be also heard by a full-court? The full court has made the rules.”
The AGP said the petitioners have challenged the parliament’s power to legislate in this matter.
Justice Ayesha Malik said the logic of the AGP is unsound. “Verdict passed by a full-court is good but a verdict passed by a three-judge bench is not good.”
Justice Munib Akhtar said the parliament has given an answer to the question of forming a full court in the Supreme Court Practices and Procedure Act, 2023. “The law says a five-judge bench of the apex court will hear matters related to interpretation of the Constitution.”
The AGP said the court has suspended implementation of the law. Justice Akhtar asked if the government still sought formation of a full-court if the court had not suspended the law.
“The parliament says there should be a five-judge bench; the AGP says there should be a full court. It seems the government is weak in math.  Can you tell us how many judges are hearing this case?”
The AGP said a request can be made for formation of a full-court. “The law says there should be at least 5 judges on the bench hearing such cases.”
When Justice Akhtar asked the AGP whether the parliament allows having a five-judge bench to hear cases related to interpretation of the Constitution, the AGP replied in the affirmative.
Justice Ayesha Malik said courts regularly hear petitions filed against pieces of legislation. Even high courts, she said, hear such matters.
“Has the government ever asked any high court to form a full court to hear such petitions? Will 60 judges of the Lahore High Court (LHC) and 40 judges of the Sindh High Court (SHC) hear such cases?”
Justice Munib Akhtar repeated Justice Malik’s question if the LHC and the SHC would respectively form 60- and 40-judge benches to hear petitions against pieces of legislation.
The AGP said the Supreme Court Practices and Procedure Act, 2023 has not been challenged in a high court and therefore he would not answer that question. Justice Ijazul Ahsan said if the SC formed a full-court to hear the case the high courts will also have to form full courts to hear such matters.
The CJP said the SC formed full courts while hearing appeals against presidential references filed against former CJP Iftikhar Chaudhry and SC senior judge Qazi Faez Isa.
“Full courts were formed in view of the seriousness of the matter. In both the cases, the full courts dismissed the presidential references. Did the SC form a full court to hear any other case?”
After hearing arguments of the AGP and the counsel for the PML-N, the CJP ordered the AGP to present the record of the parliament and the relevant standing committee with regard to the law. He adjourned the case for an indefinite period in view of the unavailability of a bench member in coming weeks.

1,"Muttaqi makes Pakistan, TTP talks pitch","Says Pakistan and Afghanistan have to jointly invest in infrastructure, especially railways, corridor projects","Acting Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Muttaqi on Monday suggested to the government of Pakistan and the outlawed Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) to sit down for talks to resolve their issues.
Speaking at the Institute of Strategic Studies, Muttaqi stressed that the government in Kabul had fulfilled its responsibility vis-à-vis the TTP and Islamic State by initiating a dialogue between Islamabad and the TTP.
“The issue of TTP and ISIS [Da’ish] is not just two years old. The propaganda about the presence of terrorists in Afghanistan has been going on since the past 20 years. No-one has any proof of the presence of terrorists in Afghanistan,” he said.

“Pakistan has lost 80,000 lives at the hands of the TTP. We do not want any more bloodshed or unrest on the Pakistan soil,” he continued. “We have initiated talks between the government of Pakistan and the TTP and request both the sides to hold dialogue.”
Muttaqi said that after 44 years of instability, Afghanistan was on the path to improvement. “During the foreign occupation, first by the then Soviet Union and then by the United States, seeds of misunderstanding and suspicion were sown in both countries.”

Muttaqi stressed that security-related issues could be resolved through dialogue. He added that in the tripartite talks over the last weekend, it was decided that no country would allow the use of its land against anyone.
The Afghan minister emphasised that the relationship between Pakistan and Afghanistan went beyond neighbourliness, as the two countries were bound by historical, religious, social, geographical and public bonds.
Therefore, he said, both the countries would have to move jointly towards a bright future by showing flexibility to solve the problems. “The people of Pakistan and Afghanistan have made sacrifices. Now we have to take advantage of the available opportunities.”
The Afghan foreign minister pointed out that both countries faced similar problems of poverty, climate change, health, energy and other challenges. He proposed joint investment in infrastructure projects, especially railways and corridor projects.
“Both countries are facing severe energy crisis. Pakistan’s investment in Afghanistan’s energy sector could increase bilateral growth 10-fold,” he said. “There are many more opportunities for our Pakistani and Afghan brothers in joint ventures,” he added.
He revealed that trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan had increased from $1.1 to 1.4 billion and expressed the hope that the Pak-Afghan trade would exceed $3 billion in the next few years.

He also proposed various other initiatives to increase the bilateral trade and facilitate the people-to-people contacts. “Customs system has to be digitised for the Pak-Afghan trade,” Muttaqi said.
The minister admitted that international sanctions were a major challenge in Afghanistan’s economic relations with other countries. However, he added, that Afghanistan’s economy had improved despite these challenges.
Referring to a World Bank report, Muttaqi said that connectivity with Pakistan and Central Asian countries was very important. He praised Pakistan’s efforts for the regional connectivity.
Muttaqi made it clear that the Taliban government had never stated that women’s education was unislamic or prohibited. He added that the government only stated that educational activities would be suspended until further orders.
“We, currently, have 1 million students at the primary level, including girls up to the sixth grade. Thousands of Afghan women are working in various fields, including health workers. Afghan women are currently studying in different schools,” he added.
He also added that the entire leadership of the Islamic Emirate was present in Kabul. “There are 500,000 civil servants who are working in various institutions of Afghanistan,” he said.
Muttaqi is currently on a four-day visit to Pakistan. Besides holding bilateral meetings, he has also participated in the 5th China-Pakistan-Afghanistan Trilateral Foreign Ministers’ Dialogue on Saturday.

2,NZ win deprives Pakistan of top ranking,Pakistan loses ODI series final match by 47 runs,"New Zealand trounced Pakistan by 47 runs in the fifth and final One-Day International match of the series in Karachi on Sunday, not only avoiding being given a complete whitewash in the five game series but also depriving the hosts of the top ODI ranking.
New Zealand opener Will Young and captain Tom Latham cracked solid half centuries in the team’s total of 299 in 49.3 overs. In reply Pakistan were all out for 252 in 46.1 overs despite the heroics of Iftikhar Ahmed (94 not out) and Agha Salman (57).
The consolation win of the Black Caps also deprived Pakistan the clean sweep. The hosts won the series 4-1. The 4-0 lead in the series on Friday brought Pakistan closer to the position of top ODI team.
However, Sunday’s defeat relegated Pakistan to the third position on the ODI team rankings with 112 points. In the new ranking, Australia occupies the first position while India takes the second place.
Earlier, Iftikhar led Pakistan’s fightback from 66-4 as he added 97 for the fifth wicket with Agha Salman who scored run-a-ball 57 but New Zealand held their nerve to get last man Haris Rauf run out for one. His fiery knock contained eight fours and two sixes.
A holiday crowd of around 20,000 had come in anticipation of Babar Azam making his 100th ODI memorable but they were left disappointed when Pakistan skipper was caught off a miscued shot off Shipley for a five-ball one.
Before that opener Shan Masood had fallen for seven. Fakhar Zaman managed a laborious 64-ball 33 and Mohammad Rizwan fell for nine, leaving Pakistan struggling on 66-4. Usama Mir scored 20, Shadab Khan 14, Shaheen Shah Afridi nought and Mohammad Waseem six but could not offer enough to support Ahmed.
Fast bowler Shipley took 3-34 and spinner Ravindra his career best 3-65 as New Zealand survived a brilliant 72-ball 94 not out by Iftikhar Ahmed to dismiss Pakistan for 252 in 46.1 overs.
New Zealand’s innings was built around Young’s 91-ball 87 and a 58-ball 59 from Latham after the visitors won the toss and opted to bat at the National Stadium. New Zealand lost Tom Blundell for 15 and then Henry Nicholls for 23 before Young steadied the innings in a 74-run third wicket stand with Latham.
Young hit eight fours and two sixes and was looking set for a hundred but was smartly caught by wicketkeeper Rizwan off leg-spinner Shadab in the 30th over. Then Mark Chapman upped the tempo with a breezy 33-ball 43 with two sixes and five fours, adding 56 for the fourth wicket with Latham.
Chapman was unlucky to be caught behind off the glove as he tried to sweep Shadab to leg side. He took 22 off one over from spinner Agha Salman. Latham also holed out off-spinner Mir in the 42nd over after hitting five boundaries.
Ravindra (28) and Cole McConchie (26) added useful runs before New Zealand were bowled in 49.3 overs. For Pakistan, Shaheen took 3-46 while Mir and Shadab claimed two wickets apiece.

3,Govt to hold investment conference in Scotland,"Shehbaz, Scottish first minister agree to strengthen bilateral ties in diverse areas","Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Sunday that an investment conference would be convened to enhance cooperation between Pakistan and Scotland in diverse fields, including trade, investment, education, water management, wind, and solar technology.
Talking to the media after a meeting with Scottish First Minister Humza Yousaf in London, Shehbaz said that he held productive talks with a “young and energetic” first minister.
“We have agreed to enhance cooperation between Pakistan and Scotland,” he said. He added that around 80,000-strong Pakistani diaspora was significantly contributing to the development and progress of Scotland.
To a question that the UK’s National Crime Agency cleared his name in a money laundering case, Shehbaz said that NCA investigated this matter for two years, and with the blessing of Almighty Allah, he emerged innocent.
“[Former prime minister] Imran Khan used all tactics and wasted state money as well as precious time to defame me,” he said. “The NCA found nothing against me and now the British investigation agency has given me a clean chit in this matter,” he added.
Shehbaz said that Imran Khan was a fraud, who had the habit of harming his own benefactors. He termed the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chairman a “liar and a hypocrite from head to toe”, who showed “ingratitude” to even his own benefactors.
Earlier, Shehbaz met Humza Yousaf, who called on him in London. Shehbaz felicitated the first minister on his election, which, he said, underscored the positive contribution of the British-Pakistani community to the development of the UK.

During the meeting, both sides held talks on strengthening the bilateral relations. They agreed to strengthen the bilateral ties in the domains of trade, investment, education, water management, wind and solar technology and the people-to-people contacts.
The two sides also agreed to promote joint ventures in various fields, as they explored ways to leverage the Scottish-Pakistani entrepreneurs, to promote investment in Pakistan. They also agreed to cooperate in addressing the challenge of climate change.
The prime minister suggested the holding of an investment conference in Scotland and separately arranging a road show to showcase Pakistan’s renewable energy potential in Scotland.
The prime minister thanked the Scottish government for its generous contribution to floods relief last year. Shehbaz invited Yousaf to visit Pakistan, which he accepted. Yousaf is the first British national of Pakistani heritage to hold this coveted position.
Separately, in a tweet, Shehbaz said the 5th Trilateral Foreign Ministers’ Dialogue held in Islamabad on Saturday underscored the unwavering consensus of Pakistan and China to work for a peaceful, stable and prosperous Afghanistan in the interest of Afghan people.
“Unlocking economic potential of the region remains contingent on restoration of regional peace and stability. Investing in peace & stability through a collective & sustained focus will ensure win-win outcomes, including the success of initiatives aimed at greater regional connectivity & socio-economic progress,” he wrote.

4,"PTI calls for fair, independent investigation",Party leaders call for a transparent and independent investigation into Imran’s allegations,"Responding to the statement of the military’s media wing, some key leaders of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) came to the defense of former prime minister Imran Khan, calling for a transparent and independent investigation into the allegations leveled by Imran against a military official.
“In my view, the way the ISPR [Inter-Services Public Relations] issued a press release is not right,” said PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry in a TV interview.
The ISPR on Monday lashed out at the PTI chief for leveling ""highly irresponsible and baseless allegations against a serving senior military officer without any evidence.""
""This fabricated and malicious allegation is extremely unfortunate, deplorable and unacceptable. This has been a consistent pattern for the last one year wherein military and intelligence agencies officials are targeted with insinuations and sensational propaganda for the furtherance of political objectives.

""We ask the political leader concerned to make a recourse to legal avenues and stop making false allegations."" The ISPR further added that the institution reserves the right to take legal course of action against patently false and malafide statements and propaganda.
ISPR نے حیران کن پریس ریلیز جاری کی ہے، اگر عمران خان سمجھتے ہیں کہ ان پر قاتلانہ حملہ میں کوئ آفیسر ملوث ہیں تو آزادانہ اور شفاف گتحقیقات کے ذریعے ان کو مطمئن کیا جانا چاہئے کہ ایسا نہیں ہے، لیکن الزام کی تحقیقات سے انکار اور ایسی پریس ریلیز سے آپ بتا رہے ہیں کہ پاکستان میں آپ…
Responding to the statement, Fawad said: “Imran Khan tried to file an FIR [against the official after an assassination attempt on him in November 2022] but it did not happen, he went to court in 22-A, he was not investigated, the record of JIT [Joint Investigation team] disappeared.”
میری نظر میں ISPR نے جیسے پریس ریلیز جاری کی یہ طریقہ ٹھیک نہیں، عمران خان نے FIR کروانے کی کوشش کی لیکن وہ نہیں ہوئی، 22A میں کورٹ میں گئے وہ تحقیقات نہیں ہوئی، JIT کا ریکارڈ ہی غائب ہوگیا۔ اس سے پہلے بلاول کے ایک فون پر سٹار آفیسر، نواز شریف کی تقریر کے بعد DGC کو ہٹایا… pic.twitter.com/kyR8qzY1Pt
The denial of investigations and such a press statement suggest a belief that some individuals are above the law in Pakistan, which is destructive to the nation, he wrote on Twitter.
Prior to this, he claimed, a ""star officer"" was removed from his post after former prime minister Nawaz Sharif's speech on Bilawal Bhutto Zardari's phone call.
“It is being repeatedly said why Imran Khan said a major general should be impeached. When Maryam Nawaz [and] Bilawal complained about a serving brigadier, he was removed … if you are accused, it does not mean that it should not be discussed,” he added.

Another senior leader of the former ruling party, Asad Umar, said: ""Totally agree with [the] ISPR that a legal recourse should be taken to resolve the allegations. Imran Khan has tried to do that by filing an FIR and approaching the Supreme Court.""
He said the institution supporting that legal recourse would be a very positive step forward.
Totally agree with ISPR that a legal recourse should be taken to resolve the allegations . Imran khan has tried to do that by filing an FIR and approaching the supreme court. The institution supporting that legal recourse would be a very positive step forward #BehindYouSkipper
PTI leader Hammad Azhar also spoke out on the current state of law and justice in the country, expressing his concerns about the situation.
""There are no sacred cows in the realm of law and justice. In the past 12 months, citizens have been abducted, tortured, blackmailed and shot at. The victims have been unable to lodge FIRs nominating their accused. The whole country is now seeking answers,"" added the PTI leader.
There are no sacred cows in the realm of law & justice. In the past 12 months, citizens have been abducted, tortured, blackmailed & shot at. The victims have been unable to lodge FIRs nominating their accused. The whole country is now seeking answers.
Earlier, former premier Imran responded to a tweet of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif by posing him four questions. In the tweet, posted on May 7, the premier had condemned Imran Khan’s attempts to malign and threaten the Pakistan Army and an intelligence agency for the sake of petty political gains.
“His leveling of allegations without any proof against Gen Faisal Naseer and officers of our Intelligence Agency cannot be allowed and will not be tolerated,” he said.
Responding to the social media post, Imran wrote if he could ask the premier to answer questions of a person who has faced two assassination attempts in the last few months.
“Have I, a citizen, the right to nominate those I feel were responsible for assassination attacks on me? Why was I denied my legal and constitutional right?
“Can SS [Shehbaz Sharif] answer why the ISI [Inter-Services Intelligence] took over ICT Judicial Complex evening before my appearance there on 18 March? Why were [the] ISI personnel in the CTD [Counter Terrorism Department personnel] and lawyers’ dress?
“What was the motive and what business did [the] ISI have in the complex? When SS can truthfully answer these questions, all will point to one powerful man and his accomplices all being above the law.
“Then it is time for us to officially declare that in Pakistan there is only law of the jungle where might is right,” added the former premier.
