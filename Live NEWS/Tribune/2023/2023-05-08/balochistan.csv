0,App launched to address citizens’ municipal grievances,"Move aimed at improvement of environment, facilities in cities","The Baldiya App has been launched for the immediate registration and redressal of complaints regarding municipal services, improvement of the environment and social facilities in major cities across Punjab.
According to the officials, citizens can also file complaints through the web portal in addition to the mobile phone app. Urban development experts say that launching such services is a good move, but citizens can only benefit if complaints are addressed promptly. The app was launched by the Punjab Municipal Development Fund Company (PMFDC) under Punjab Cities Program and can be downloaded on both iPhones and Android devices.
Managing Director PMFDC Syed Zahid Aziz said that the Complainant Tracking System (CTS) was already launched under Punjab Cities Program (PCP) for complaint management. He added that the Grievance Redressal Mechanism (GRAM) has been upgraded to allow citizens to use the mobile app to register their grievances.
Aziz further said that citizens also face problems during the provision of municipal infrastructure services, such as the construction of roads, streets and the installation of sewage systems, observing that the environment and the transportation system are both affected. Institutions have been mandated under the PCP to enact safety measures during infrastructure projects, however if they fail to do this, residents of the affected area will be able to file a complaint.
He further said that currently 16 municipal committees, including those in Daska, Hafizabad, Jhelum and Burewala among others, have been included in the Punjab Cities Program to strengthen local government bodies through better governance and planning.

1,Clearing science exams eased,"Passing marks set cumulatively at 33% in theory, lab tests","Punjab government has decided to revise the criteria for passing the matriculation and intermediate exams in science subjects from the next academic year.
Under a decision of the Inter-Board Committee of Chairmen (IBCC), the students will have to secure overall 66 out of the total 200 marks to pass each science subject in the annual exams.
Earlier, the students had to secure 33 per cent marks each in the theory and practical examinations for passing in the science subjects.
According to officials, the provincial government has also decided to revise intermediate and matriculation exam schedule. From the next academic year, the annual exams will begin in March in the province.
The decision to revise the criteria for passing the exams in the science subjects was taken in an IBCC meeting held in the provincial capital.
The chairpersons of all the nine boards of intermediate and secondary education of the province discussed the factors behind an increasing ratio of failure of students in the science subjects.
An IBCC official told The Express Tribune that the committee had discussed in several meetings a review of the marking criteria for the science subjects because of the high rate of failure in all the boards.
As the students had to clear both the theory and practical exams separately, in many cases those securing high marks in theory were declared unsuccessful because of failing in the practical.
It has now been decided that the students will have to secure only 66 aggregate marks in both the exams of a science subject for clearing the matriculation or intermediate level even if they fail in the practical test.
It was also decided that the matriculation and intermediate exams in the province would begin in March because of the hot weather in the later months, the official added.
Commenting on the decision, Punjab Teachers Union president Allah Rakha Gujjar said there were thousands of the schools and colleges in the province that lacked good laboratories for preparing the students for the practical exams.
He said the schools and colleges in the remote districts particularly lacked the infrastructure and laboratories.
There was also a shortage of science teachers in the educational institutions, he pointed out.
The teachers’ union leader said the students were helpless because of the situation and the decision to make thing easier for them should be welcomed.
He said the decision would also provide financial relief to the students and their parents as they used to pay heavy fees to private academies for preparing for the practical exams.
Lahore BISE Public Relations Officer Qaiser Virk said the decision to set the new passing marks criteria had been taken to provide relief to the students.
He said the annual exams of intermediate and matriculation used to be scheduled in March before the COVID-19 pandemic, but the dates had been changed to May and June during the health crisis.
“We have been trying since last year to restore the schedule and now it has been decided that the matriculation and intermediate exams next year will begin in March,” Virk added.

8,"Departmental tussle: WCLA, Punjab Archaeology at odds over control of heritage sites","Caretaker cabinet has decided to hand over Shalimar Bagh, Jahangir’s Tomb to Walled City of Lahore Authority","It seems that the years-old tussle between Punjab Archaeology and Walled City of Lahore Authority (WCLA) is heading to the courts once again as the incumbent caretaker government has decided to give control of some historical buildings to the authority.
The Chief Minister Mohsin Naqvi led caretaker cabinet of Punjab has decided to transfer control of the ancient Shalimar Bagh, Jahangir’s Tomb, and Noor Jahan’s Tomb to the WCLA, whose mandate is to maintain and conserve the heritage sites in the walled city or Old Lahore, as it is colloquially referred to.
However, employees of Punjab Archaeology have made it clear that any such transfer of control will be without any legal backing as the caretaker government does not have the authority to hand over heritage sites owned by the federal government. “Such an effort was also made back in 2019 by an elected government, which transferred the control of Jahangir’s Tomb to WCLA. However, we took them to the Lahore High Court and got an injunction against the transfer,” informed Rana Irfan Ali, Spokesman of the Punjab Archaeology Clerks Association (APCA), the body which challenged the transfer on behalf of the provincial archaeological department.
Maqsood Ahmed Malik, an archaeologist and former director of Punjab Archeology, concurring with Ali, further said that even an elected Chief Minister is not authorised by law to provide any authority control over sites that are national or international heritage. “The sites that the caretaker cabinet is trying to transfer have been looked after by our department for years,” said Malik.
Whereas, Dr Muhammad Hameed, Head of the Department of Archaeology at Punjab University, was of the view that even though the provincial department might have looked after heritage sites for years did not mean they were well-suited enough to continue doing so. “Although the department has experts and a cutting-edge lab for studying and conserving historical sites in the province, sadly it is understaffed and underfunded,” said Dr Hameed, adding that the department had a measly four or five specialists, which was not enough. “On the other hand, the WCLA has both resources and personnel and their conservation work has garnered much attention,” he said. However, in light of the tussle between Punjab Archaeology and WCLA, Dr Hameed suggested that perhaps both departments could work together. “Punjab Archaeology could continue to have control and the WCLA can assist in conservation and revenue generation efforts.”
However, it remains to be seen whether the caretaker government’s decision to transfer the heritage sites is concrete. The Secretary for Tourism and Archaeology Punjab, Zaheer Hasan, when asked about the matter, said that he had not received any written directives or even heard of a decision being taken by the caretaker cabinet in this regard. “However, I am bound to carry out whatever decisions a cabinet takes, therefore if they decide to transfer the properties to WCLA, then I will have to oblige,” informed Hasan while talking to The Express Tribune.
