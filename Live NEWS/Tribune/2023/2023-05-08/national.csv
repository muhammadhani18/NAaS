0,SOE policy is bound to fail,Idea of reforming state-owned units has taken precedence over will to privatise,"Since the Supreme Court’s rejection of Pakistan Steel Mills’ privatisation in 2006, the privatisation programme has practically come to a halt.
While each government included privatisation proceeds in its non-tax revenues, the realisation of proceeds has been zilch.
It seems that in bureaucratic circles, the idea of privatisation has lost its appeal. This is partly because of parallel developments in trade liberalisation and technological advancements, and partly due to political factors.
The idea of reforming state-owned enterprises (SOEs) has taken precedence over the will to privatise, and it comes in various forms. SOE reforms also provide multilateral agencies with an excuse to loan out “technical assistance” to the government.
In a bid to sidestep the challenging process of privatisation, the PTI government embarked on the Malaysian-inspired Sarmaya Pakistan Limited, with the aim of reforming and restructuring the government of Pakistan’s SOEs.
As of now, there are around 212 SOEs (including subsidiaries, trusts, and funds) incorporated by the federal government.
Over the last 10 years, SOEs of a commercial nature (84 out of the total 212 SOEs) have collectively inflicted a loss of over Rs1 trillion on the national exchequer.
While there are certain functions of national importance being performed by some SOEs, by and large SOEs are a burden on the state, and the need to be either deeply restructured, privatised, or liquidated.
In 2021, the government published State-Owned Enterprises Triage: Reforms & Way Forward, led by Dr Ishrat Husain. The SOE triage provides a roadmap for retention, privatisation, or liquidation while laying out a criterion justified on the basis of “national economic interest”, “strategic importance” and commercial significance.
The triage foresaw the SOE Act 2023 and now the draft SOE policy. A central monitoring unit will now be established to assist the process of reforms and restructuring.
The draft SOE policy might be well-meaning. Like other policies, it is built on the assumption that there exists efficient government machinery with the capacity to run complex business operations. It is bound to fail on these grounds alone.
A careful reading of the policy unveils several lacunas, some of which are described here for public knowledge.
Section 7 of the draft policy explains that the SOEs identified specifically in the SOE Triage report would be retained.
Para 7 also refers to monopoly service providers as strategic in nature but fails to clarify whether a monopoly is defined as a 100%, 50%, or 25% of market share.
Instead, a commercial loss-making monopoly should be treated under anti-trust laws, and the federal government should consider disintegrating the functions of large SOEs into separate smaller entities during the course of privatisation.
Para 8 of the policy lays out the conditions for the creation of new state enterprises. It says that an SOE can be created when no private firm is operating in a particular sector, regardless of whether the sector is of strategic significance.
It does not clarify whether the government should consider an international private enterprise as part of the relevant sector.
It states that an SOE can be created when the government is trying to establish a market, but its ambiguity leaves room for the bureaucracy’s authority to define new sectors and markets in a self-serving manner.
Para 8 also appears inconsistent with the limitations put forth by the policy itself, when it states that the government will only retain “strategic” SOEs.
By allowing the creation of a commercial SOE, specifically in a non-monopolistic market context with private sector players, the policy leaves loophole for government expansion into the private sector yet again.
Despite the completion of the SOE Triage, para 10 of the policy appears to create space for each division of the federal government to contest the categories set forth in the triage.
Para 11 vests the initiative of transformation of SOEs to line ministries. This process would be an unnecessary burden and experiment with taxpayer funds.
There is also no guarantee, nor track record of private sector reform under a public sector setting. We propose that privatisation must occur first and restructuring later when new owners can lead that process.
The draft SOE policy does not spell out transformation or reform in the area of human resources.
One of the greatest barriers to privatisation is the judicially, and legislatively protected status of permanent government employees. Downsizing will play a major role in successful SOE reform but no provision in the policy exists to streamline it.
Para 12 is all about rescuing the SOEs facing financial and operational problems. This entire passage creates ambiguity about the privatisation of commercial SOEs.
It indicates that the government does not intend to even privatise sick commercial units. The emphasis of the policy remains on repeated rehabilitation, reconstruction, and reorganisation of sick commercial SOEs.
The threat of delay in privatisation due to the strategic interest of political governments, most notably union appeasement and the middle-class vote, will limit the transformation potential.
The proposed CCoSOE (Cabinet Committee on SOEs) implies that the mandate of the Privatisation Commission may be in danger of being violated eventually.
The entire proposed process under the policy is highly centralised. CCoSOE will continue to rescue sick SOEs until political mileage from SOEs can be curtailed.
The idea of creating a central monitoring unit to oversee the SOE reforms process is a non-starter.
The triage report itself acknowledges the complexity of markets in which SOEs perform and a centralised unit can never have the capacity to advise these SOEs, which are operating in distinct market and bureaucratic conditions.
The federal government would be well advised to privatise highly indebted loss-making commercial SOEs at market offers without going into a transformation phase. All other roads lead to more losses, more corruption, and more uncompetitive markets.

1,Is country ready to adopt electric vehicles?,"ADB says country needs to install 25,000 charging stations to support adoption of EVs","Electric vehicles (EVs) are transforming the global automotive industry, and Pakistan is no exception. The adoption of EVs in Pakistan is expected to have a significant impact on the economy, environment, and public health.
The adoption of EVs has the potential to reduce dependence on imported oil, which currently accounts for a significant portion of the country’s import bill.
According to the annual report of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), the country spent $10.589 billion on crude oil and LNG imports in FY2021-22, which is almost 13.5% of the total import bill.
This will lead to a significant reduction in trade deficit, which will have a positive impact on the balance of payments.
Moreover, the adoption of EVs will create new employment opportunities in the manufacturing, sales, and service sectors. The production of EVs and their components will require a skilled workforce, and the growth of the sector will create new jobs in related industries, such as charging infrastructure, battery production, and software development.
According to a report of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the renewable energy sector, including EVs, is expected to create over 100,000 jobs in Pakistan by 2030.
However, the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that the global EV market will support 14 million jobs by 2030. This includes direct jobs in the manufacturing, maintenance, and operation of EVs, as well as indirect jobs in the supply chain and service sectors.
According to a report published in 2021 by the World Health Organisation (WHO), air pollution caused an estimated 64,000 premature deaths in Pakistan in 2019. Transport sector is a significant contributor to air pollution in urban areas, and the adoption of EVs can help reduce this impact.
EVs emit significantly fewer greenhouse gases than traditional gasoline-powered vehicles, and they produce no tailpipe emissions. As such, the adoption of EVs will help reduce air pollution in urban areas, which is a major public health concern in Pakistan.
According to a report of IEA, the adoption of EVs could reduce global CO2 emissions by up to 1.5 gigatons by 2030. In Pakistan, the adoption of EVs could help the country reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and meet its commitments under the Paris Agreement.
According to the World Resources Institute, Pakistan is one of the most water-stressed countries in the world, with only 1,017 cubic metres of water available per person per year.
The production of EVs requires less water than traditional vehicles, which will help conserve water resources in a country that is facing acute water scarcity.
Despite the potential benefits of EVs, several hurdles need to be overcome to ensure the continued growth of the sector. One of the biggest challenges is the lack of charging infrastructure.
EVs require a network of charging stations that are conveniently located and easily accessible to users. However, in Pakistan, the availability of charging infrastructure is limited, and most EV owners have to rely on home charging or slow public charging stations.
The lack of charging infrastructure is a significant barrier to the adoption of EVs, as it limits the range and usability of EVs.
According to a report of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Pakistan needs to install 25,000 charging stations by 2030 to support the adoption of EVs. The report suggests that the government should develop a comprehensive plan for the deployment of charging infrastructure and work with private sector companies for investment.
EVs have higher fuel efficiency, with an average range of 300-400 km per charge and require less maintenance, with maintenance costs being 50-70% lower than conventional vehicles.
They have lower operational costs, with an average charging cost of Rs400 for a 100km distance, which is 70-80% lower than the fuel cost of conventional vehicles. EVs have the potential to reduce emissions by 90% and improve air quality in cities.
Another hurdle to the adoption of EVs is the cost. EVs are generally more expensive than traditional gasoline-powered vehicles, and this can be a significant barrier to adoption in a country where a majority of the population falls in the low to middle-income category.
The cost of EVs is expected to decline in the coming years as battery technology improves and economies of scale are achieved. According to a report of IRENA, the cost of lithium-ion batteries used in EVs is expected to decline by up to 66% by 2030.
Finally, the adoption of EVs requires strong government support. The government must provide incentives and policies to promote the growth of the EV industry, such as tax exemptions, subsidies, and public procurement programmes.
The government must also work with the private sector to develop a comprehensive strategy for the deployment of charging infrastructure and support research and development in EV technology.

2,The future of IMF and sovereign wealth funds,"Geopolitics, Sino-US rivalry mar IMF’s mission as emergency lending arm","The IMF in its latest World Economic Outlook (WEO) report calls the trajectory for 2023 economic recovery as ‘rocky’ – with pronounced global inflation, poor growth and lower investments levels, and an increased risk of flaring up of international financial system.
With global inflation figures expected to peak at 5.1%, Pakistan’s average inflation numbers will be around 27.1% but with a near-zero GDP growth per capita.
However, what the IMF didn’t discuss in its report is that how geopolitics and Sino-US rivalry has marred its mission as an emergency lending arm to support countries in distress.
Despite raising $51 billion since Covid, it has approved a mere 9% of that capital for new lending. Seven countries that defaulted have been waiting for more than a year for a deal.
Countries like Ethiopia had to wait for a couple of years to get a restructuring deal from the IMF while many countries, including Pakistan, who have secured a deal, are still struggling to get the bulk of funds.
The main reason for this is the emergence of sovereign wealth funds in countries and regions with global surplus such as China and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).
Peoples Bank of China (PBOC) and other state-backed banks have become direct competitors of the IMF in global emergency lending as in the past six years Beijing’s emergency loans have exceeded that of IMF’s.
Moreover, when a country who is a beneficiary of Chinese loans approaches the IMF, the IMF takes the application with a pinch of salt as it must ensure fiscal sustainability before borrowing.
The IMF has the mandate to restructure debt on behalf of the Paris Club, but it is not on the same page with Chinese banks. So, if the IMF proceeds with a bailout without a similar debt restructuring assurance from China, the IMF’s dollars will simply flow to PBOC or Exim Bank – something that the IMF’s creditors are wary of.
In fact, statistics show that every penny borrowed from China reduces the odds of a deal with the IMF.
Similarly, thanks to high prices of crude oil, sovereign wealth funds in the Gulf including Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) are flushed with cash.
The GCC in the past has allowed countries like Pakistan and Egypt to defer payment for oil purchases but now they want their debtors to bring in economic and fiscal reforms. This is where the IMF comes in as Gulf creditors have made their future commitments conditional with adherence to the IMF programme.
It provides the IMF with a lot of leverage, and we saw in the case of Egypt that IMF’s contribution was a mere 10% of the total bailout package.
Same is the case with Pakistan where the IMF will chip in with a paltry $1.1 billion while China and the GCC are contributing over $6 billion in total.
However, this is not just an equation of geopolitics but more of convenience for the fund as countries like Egypt, Pakistan and Argentina have been on an IMF programme half of the time and have never fulfilled their commitments to reform.
In fact, these three countries account for more than 50% of the fund’s account. It appears that the IMF deliberately wants China to take up the role of emergency lending for the troublesome middle-income countries such as Pakistan and Turkey.
But there is a small catch. Recently, more than 90% of China’s emergency loans were remitted in renminbi – a geo-economic move directly challenging the US dollar. Being world’s biggest exporter of consumer items, it helps to retain demand and keep Chinese factories running amid Sino-US trade wars.
In fact, China is doing what the US did in the last century – using their surplus income for lending heavily to end the dominance of pound sterling and the demand for European products, and then systemising this process using the IMF and the World Bank.
In a nutshell, we see that the landscape of emergency lenders in future will see the IMF on one side of the spectrum financing pro-West and pro-democratic nations while Beijing will be on the other end.
The GCC too will swing a little more towards growing Asian economies, ie, China, India, and Asean where there are prospects to sell more oil.
These geopolitical tensions and resulting fragmentation will result in economic friction, reduced cross-border investments and increased stability risks.
For Pakistan, it is becoming crystal clear that Islamabad will be forced to pick a side and that too soon, unless it goes through extensive structural reforms and builds capital buffers.

3,Harmonisation of sales tax laws – a ray of hope,Rules put emphasis on location where service provider resides or place from where services are rendered,"The National Tax Council (NTC) was established back in March 2020 by the federal government of Pakistan with the federal and provincial finance ministers as its members.
The NTC was formed with several terms of references (TORs), amongst them the most important was to create ease of doing business for taxpayers. One of the significant ways in which ease can be brought is to harmonise the sales tax laws on services of all provinces and the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT).
It doesn’t portray a good image of Pakistan in general when the investor sitting outside of the country in particular, while considering the feasibility of investment in the country, sees the conflicting provisions of sales tax on services laws and when more than one tax authority demands sales tax on a single service just due to the dispute between them, which could ultimately result in excess cash outflow for the potential investor.
The primary and most important dispute that mainly prevails is whether the jurisdiction from where the service has originated would be collecting the sales tax on that service or the jurisdiction where that service is being terminated, ie, based on the destination principle.
This not only consumes a lot of time of the taxpayer and the tax administrator but also increases the compliance cost for the taxpayer and administrative cost for the tax administrator, as in case of disputes, the taxpayer will go into a legal battle and incur more legal costs to avoid paying double tax on the same service while the tax administrator will need more staff cost to enforce the same.
Not only there have been immense pressure from different tax bars and business associations to resolve these issues, but it also came from our main lender, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), to sort it out to complete the checklist for required financing.
Therefore, the NTC, considering the economic position of Pakistan, has finally started to bring about long-awaited harmonisation between the sales tax laws of services, which is evident from notifying the “Place of Provision of Services Rules, 2023” (the Rules) through consensus between all four provinces and ICT.
The Rules aim to provide clear guidelines on the situations in which sales tax will be charged based on origination and the circumstances under which the tax will be levied based on destination.
Initially, the services which have been covered through these rules include advertisement, advertising agents, insurance, insurance agents, franchise, transportation or carriage of goods, and electric power transmission services.
For other services, the provisions of relevant Act or rules of the respective province or ICT are to be applied.
Whereas in case the specified service of these rules is to be provided in more than one province, the service provider shall claim the attributable input tax in the same proportion attributable to the amount of declared taxable values of the service by the relevant Act or rules of the province/ ICT.
The Rules are applicable from May 1, 2023 to all the specified services except for electric power transmission services, on which they would be applicable from July 1, 2023 after the federal government brings necessary changes in the Sales Tax Act 1990 to exclude them from the definition of goods.
The Rules put more emphasis on the location where the service provider resides or the place from where services are rendered.
For instance, in case of an advertisement on a website or webpage or internet, the location of the person owning or managing such website or webpage or internet and in case of life insurance and health insurance services office, the branch of the insurance company providing the insurance service is considered as the place of provision of service.
However, the rights for taxation have been given to the destination jurisdiction. For instance, in case of franchise services and intellectual property services provided or rendered by a person, whether a resident of Pakistan or otherwise, the place of provision of service is the location of the resident person receiving or procuring such services.
Interestingly, in case of services of transportation or carriage of goods by road or, through a pipeline or conduit, both origination and destination jurisdiction would share the tax equally, thereby solving this dispute by settling it administratively.
Although the current initiative is something that should be appreciated, there is a lot more to be done, which could include similar sales tax rates across the country, similar principles and definitions of levying sales tax on services, data-sharing and access between different tax authorities and most importantly, what exactly should be covered in goods and what in services should be specified leaving behind no ambiguity for the taxpayers.

4,Green hydrogen and Pakistan,"Key challenge in establishing viable value chain is capital, operating cost","The media recently reported signing of an MoU among five energy companies of Pakistan, mostly PSEs, for pursuing “green hydrogen” opportunities.
Apparently, the step seems quite revolutionary, especially, when the given energy source is yet to secure any sizeable foothold in the energy mix of even the developed world and hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels hardly account for 0.1% of the total global energy consumption.
This article is a humble attempt at a brief review of the option and its possible relevance to Pakistan.
Definitions
As it does not release any greenhouse gases when burnt, therefore, hydrogen gas is the cleanest fuel for transportation and power generation.
When the source for the electricity used to produce this gas is a fossil fuel, the product is called ‘grey hydrogen’, which currently accounts for 98% of the aggregate annual global production of hydrogen. Generation of each ton of the same releases 11 tonnes of carbon dioxide.
If the process also involves capture and storage of this carbon dioxide,, instead of its release into atmosphere, then the product is called ‘blue hydrogen’. So far, hardly 0.1% of the globally emitted volume of 37.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide is being captured.
As to green hydrogen, it is obtained through electrolysis by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen by passing electric current through the same. The said current is sourced from renewable sources, ie not involving greenhouse gas emissions at any stage.
Major challenges
The foremost challenge in establishing a viable value chain of green hydrogen is the associated capital and operating costs. The production cost of green hydrogen currently ranges between $3 and $6 per kilogramme while that of grey between $0.5 and $1.7 per kg.
To reduce it to around $1.5/kg, amongst other steps, the pertaining industrial-scale electrolysers’ cost is required to be reduced by four times.
Also; a) In electrolysis, 9 kg of water produces one kg of hydrogen. Hence, arrangement of this water can also be a challenge.
Furthermore, based upon the currently available commercial electrolysis process efficiency, the power requirement for producing 1 kg of hydrogen would at least be 50 kilowatt-hour (kWh). Thus, economical generation of electricity from alternate sources is also pivotal for the given business case.
b) Another major cost adder is the enormous infrastructural cost. For example, hydrogen pipelines can be 10-50% more expensive than those for natural gas while storage tanks can even cost higher.
The factor which plays no mean role in the same is the low energy content by volume of hydrogen. Thus, it takes about 3.3 CF of hydrogen to deliver the same energy as 1 CF of natural gas.
This makes hydrogen’s storage, transportation and especially compression far more cost intensive. Compression alone requires almost thrice the energy to compress the same quantity.
In addition, the associated safety aspects alone should suffice for us to avoid any experimentation along this avenue at this stage.
Hydrogen, having a much wider flammability band than natural gas, is prone to ignite much more easily when mixed even in small amounts with ordinary air, which mandates very stringent safety requirements for associated equipment and operations, both.
Furthermore, in lieu of its around 10 times lesser specific gravity viz-a-viz natural gas, its storage requires very stringent sealing philosophy including specialised cost-intensive sealing materials and leak detection systems, especially when its flames mostly remain undetected with naked eye.
What further complicates the scenario is that exposure of certain materials to hydrogen, such as steel, iron, etc, can cause their embrittlement and failure.
What is to be done
Thus, at present, hydrogen is a luxury which only countries equipped with deep pockets, a rigorous industrial safety regime, proven commitment to environment and a penchant for R&D, can afford.
As to Pakistan, our circular debt in the energy supply chain, T&D losses and abject lack of any strategy for oil and gas reserves’ replacement should be sufficient to define our priorities.
Thus, instead of venturing into any exotic avenues, keen focus on the following seems essential:
1)We are targeting to be producing 60% of our aggregate electricity through renewable sources by 2030. Actually, so far out of the 39,722MW installed capacity, 63% is contributed by fossil fuels. In hydel alone, while the potential is at least 60,000MW, we have reached only 9,000MW over the past 76 years.
As to solar, which is targeted to be 8% of the aggregate be 2030, the currently installed capacity is 430MW. All signs are there that we will miss all the targets even on this conventional front by big margins, which needs immediate intervention.
2)Around 4 tcf of proven low to medium BTU natural gas lies stranded in various fields in Pakistan since long. Efforts need to be undertaken to harness these reserves for economic development.
Various options can be considered for the same including establishing mini-processing and LNG plants and then transporting this gas to industrial outlets through trucking or mixing it with high BTU gas in the grid. Trucking would not only save infrastructural costs but also the enormous T&D losses.
3)Pakistan’s daily requirement of HSD is around 120,000 bpd and the requirement is mostly fulfilled through imports, whereas, based on the availability statistics of edible oil waste, we can extract 20% of our HSD requirement from the same as biodiesel.
4)Our major challenge lies in execution and the associated failure is driven by the lethal mix of two culprits, ie incompetence and poor governance. Its impact on the energy sector can be immediately quantified by the ever-soaring energy imports.
Though PSEs are a living example, with few exceptions, the sickness appears quite rampant in the private sector too.
Probably due to the all-encompassing stranglehold of feudalism and associated ethos, sycophancy, cronyism, mediocrity, subservience and conformance, in various shades, largely appear to be holding sway in this sector too.
Such cultures may occasionally produce task masters, but they mostly fail to produce leaders imbibed with the required entrepreneurial spirit and capacity. If this country has to progress, then, this anomaly needs to be addressed on priority and, of course, in a holistic manner.
Thus, it is evident that the subject option, which may take another few decades even for the developed world to assume the shape of a sustainable value chain, is definitely not an option for us.
