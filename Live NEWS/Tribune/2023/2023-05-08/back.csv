1,PAC seeks details of SC judge’s assets,Chairman Noor Alam expresses displeasure over absence of provincial chief secretaries in the meeting,"The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) on Monday sought details of the income and assets of Justice Mazahar Ali Naqvi from the relevant ministries, government departments and institutions within 15 days.
During a meeting, PAC Chairman Noor Alam Khan expressed his displeasure over the absence of a number of government officials, including the provincial chief secretaries and heads of the institutions. He warned that he could issue arrest warrants against the officials who ignored the committee meeting.
During discussions, 13 out of 14 committee members, who were present in the meeting, allowed the investigation into Justice Naqvi's assets. The only opposition came from the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Senator Mohsin Aziz.
The chair directed that the auditor general should investigate the categories of plots of Justice Naqvi and submit a report. He also directed for the provision of tax returns, data of household members, travel details and complete details of the plots within 15 days.
Khan said that if the chief secretaries and the heads of the institutions, who had been invited to the meeting, did not come to the next PAC meeting, he would issue warrants against them. “How can I preside over a meeting in which officers do not want to come,” he said. He asked whether the government officials were intimidated.

Earlier, Noor Alam Khan told the committee that the matter of Justice Naqvi's assets had been “referred to us by the National Assembly”. Committee member Birjis Tahir suggested that first the record of the assets beyond income should be sought from Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).
Another committee member, Rohail Asghar, said that it was an important matter, which had been discussed in the National Assembly and PAC. Senator Mohsin Aziz said that in the current situation in the country, the members should cool down the situation.
He pointed out that the Supreme Court had the Supreme Judicial Council to look into such matters. “So why has this matter been referred to PAC?” he asked. Noor Alam Khan replied that under the Constitution, PAC could hear such matters. “I follow the Constitution,” Khan stressed.
The law secretary said that the appointment of judges was made by the Supreme Judicial Commission, therefore, the ministry did not have any records of judges. The chair directed the FBR chairman to provide the judge’s tax returns and wealth statement. He also directed the housing secretary to provide details of the plots.
Committee member Shahida Akhtar Ali said that the auditor general and the law ministry should guide the committee on carrying the matter forward. Committee member Syed Tariq Hussain Shah said that the law ministry should also make it clear whether or not PAC could look into the matter.

2,Book Imran only if he is guilty: LHC,Court summons JIT head on May 12 with details of cases in which the PTI chief is nominated,"The Lahore High Court (LHC) has directed the police to discharge former prime minister Imran Khan from cases in which he is not guilty and to issue him a challan only if his guilt is established.
A larger LHC bench, led by Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, on Monday also asked the head of the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) probing various allegations against the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief to appear in person by May 12 along with a comprehensive report.
It said the report must contain the current status of the investigation, including details of first information reports (FIRs) in which the PTI chief is nominated.
The bench was hearing the PTI chief’s plea seeking direction to the concerned quarters to not take any coercive measures in connection with the 121 FIRs registered against him.
During the proceedings, Justice Najafi observed that if Imran Khan’s guilt is proven then he must be challaned but he must be discharged from cases if he is innocent.
The law officer argued that the JIT had complied with the court's order by visiting the petitioner’s Zaman Park residence, where he joined the investigation. However, he said, it is a rare occurrence as there is no provision for an accused to summon the police to their residence for investigation.
Justice Anwaarul Haq Pannun and Justice Aalia Neelum remarked that everything is visible and that police officials had claimed that the accused had not joined the investigation before the court order.
Imran Khan's counsel Barrister Salman Safdar informed the court that police had recently registered ten cases against Imran in Lahore and two in Islamabad. He asked how a person could appear before investigators in all cases simultaneously.
 Safdar said irrelevant FIRs were being registered against his client on a daily basis. He requested the court to allow Imran to appear in the court through video link. “Your plea will be heard if found maintainable,” said Justice Tariq Saleem Sheikh, another member of the bench.
Imran Khan’s counsel argued that there were precedents for the appearance of an accused in court through video link. He urged the court to also permit the PTI chief to do so.
Justice Najafi advised Safdar to move applications for video link attendance in trial courts and urged him to avoid burdening the courts with unnecessary matters.
 “We do not want to see this system become hostage,” Justice Najafi said. “Five judges are hearing this matter, and there are other matters in our courts which need to be heard. Avoid burdening the courts.”
 The bench further ordered authorities to submit a comprehensive report and discharge Imran Khan from cases in which he is innocent.
 “We are giving you another opportunity to submit a comprehensive report and discharge Imran Khan from those cases in which he is not guilty and challan him if found guilty,” he said.

3,G-20 urged to boycott sitting in Srinagar,Mushaal Mullick says supremacist RSS-inspired regime has turned IIOJK into a killing field,"Peace and Culture Organization Chairperson Mushaal Hussein Mullick urged the G20 countries on Sunday to boycott their meeting India was holding in the UN-designated disputed area of Srinagar of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK).
In a statement, Mushaal, who is the wife of incarcerated senior Hurriyat leader Yasin Malik, said that it was high time the world powers and UN bodies showed solidarity with innocent Kashmiri people.
She urged the international community to send a clear and unequivocal message to blood-thirsty Hindutva regime and expose the brutality of the notorious Narendra Modi government and press it to give the Kashmiris their birth right of self-determination.
“The G-20 states must remember that they will be seen as siding with the oppressor if they accepted Modi’s invitation to the event in IIOJK,” Mullick said, adding that the supremacist RSS-inspired regime had turned IIOJK into a killing field.
The Hurriyat leader told the G20 nations they should not forget that India was crossing all limits of barbarism and terrorism by committing worst crimes against humanity in the occupied territory.
She recalled that India’s ulterior motives behind holding the bloc’s meeting in Srinagar was to create false impression of normalcy in the region and try to legitimise its unlawful and illegal occupation of the area.
Therefore, she suggested that the world powers should boycott the meeting in Srinagar to foil India’s nefarious designs. She also urged them to take notice of India’s continued denial of the Kashmiris’ right to self-determination.

4,Sharif brothers conspiring against judiciary: Elahi,PTI leader says he hasn’t forgiven those who attacked his house,"Former Punjab chief minister and PTI Central President Chaudhry Parvez Elahi has said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif went to London to take fresh instructions from PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif against the Supreme Court.
Addressing a news conference along with Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) President Ishtiaq A Khan and Advocate Amir Saeed Rawn on Sunday, Elahi alleged that the Sharif brothers are sitting in London and forging conspiracies against the judiciary.
He mocked Shehbaz’s presence during the coronation ceremony of Britain’s King Charles, saying that the crown had been saved with great difficulty. “The participation in the coronation was just an excuse,” he jibed.
He claimed that the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) government is playing with the country’s fate. Except for Islamabad, the entire country has been turned into a prison, he added.
“If anyone wants to stay in this country, they should get bail; we pay tribute to the judiciary which has saved the system of this country till now. If there is no judiciary in the country at this time, it is difficult to live here,” he remarked.
Calling Nawaz an absconder, the PTI leader said that Khawaja Asif does not speak himself, but his friend Nawaz speaks through him.
“Mohsin Naqvi and his cabinet’s term has expired but they are still drawing salaries and perks from the public treasury,” he went on to say.
He also said that the court has pardoned the illegal attack on his house, adding that he has not forgiven those involved. “The policemen robbed our house and took the mobile phones, wallets, and motorcycles of the guests who came here. 20 of our people are still in jail and more than 17 cases have been registered against me,” he added.
Elahi said that more than 127 “false cases” have been made against Imran, like the false case made against Chaudhry Zahoor Elahi for buffalo theft, which is still famous today. He added that if they get a chance, they will come up with a system of retired judges who will not allow such heinous acts to happen. “Yet those who do so will be truly punished,” he said.
He added that the decisions of the Supreme Court (SC) based on the supremacy of the Constitution have destroyed Nawaz’s plans to return to Pakistan.
His desire to humiliate Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Atta Bandial will never be fulfilled, he declared.
The PTI leader also said that his son, Chaudhry Moonis Elahi, will return to the country when Nawaz comes back.
Elahi said that Pakistan has been kept united by the Constitution and Imran, and the Chinese foreign minister’s statement that the political forces in Pakistan should come together for stability is enough for the incompetent government if they understand it.
He added that Abid Zuberi is the constitutional president of the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) while the PDM punished him for speaking in favour of the judiciary.
His restoration is a victory for the Constitution, he added.

5,Imran censured over anti-army tirade,"PM, ex-president say attacks on army cannot be tolerated anymore","Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and former president Asif Zardari blasted Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan on Sunday for hurling baseless allegations against a military officer, terming such a tirade an “actual attack on the Pakistan Army”.
In their separate statements, the two leaders said that levelling allegations for “petty political gains” was highly condemnable, and accused the former prime minister of “crossing all limits” in trying to defame institutions.
“Imran Niazi's act of routinely maligning and threatening Pakistan Army and Intelligence Agency for the sake of petty political gains is highly condemnable,” Prime Minister Shehbaz said in a tweet.
“His leveling of allegations without any proof against Gen Faisal Naseer and officers of our Intelligence Agency cannot be allowed and will not be tolerated,” the prime minister wrote further on the microblogging website.
The prime minister’s tweet came on the heels of a statement from Zardari, who also lambasted Imran for repeatedly levelling allegations against the Maj-Gen Faisal Naseer, saying that allegations against the army officials were actually an attack on the army.
Zardari said that attacks on the military could not be tolerated. “The allegations against the brave and distinguished officers of the Pakistan Army, including Maj-Gen Faisal, are actually an attack on the institution with which the whole of Pakistan stands,” he said.
“This is the country where we all have to be buried; we will not allow one person to play with our values and our country,” he added. “A person is bent on destroying my ancestors, my children and my country, which we will not allow.”
Calling Imran a “foreign agent” and predicting his downfall, Zardari said that “a person is fooling his innocent workers” with lies and deceit, adding: “I see the downfall of this person.”
“Enough is enough,” Zardari said, referring to Imran’s speech on Saturday. “Especially, after listening to the ‘foreign agent’ s speech yesterday, no patriot can even think of following him.”
He then said that “one person has crossed all limits to defame institutions, which will not be tolerated anymore,” the former president said. “The attempt to discredit institutions has exposed the true face of that man.”
After an assassination attempt on Imran, a relative of the PTI chairman had moved an application to register an FIR against Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah and Maj-Gen Faisal Naseer.
In the attack at Wazirabad, Imran had suffered a bullet wound to his leg. Following the attack, PTI leader Asad Umar had said in a video statement that party chairman had named three suspects who could be behind the attack.

6,90 days have already passed: Marriyum,Information minister says majority of SC judges already dismissed polls plea,"Federal Minister for Information Marriyum Aurnagzeb on Sunday said 90 days have already passed since the dissolution of provincial legislatures in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) provinces.
“What 90 days? 90 days are over. It is already late,” the minister told The Express Tribune, while commenting on Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial’s statement about timely elections.
Speaking at an event in Lahore on Sunday, CJP Bandial said: ""If the Constitution states that elections will be held within 90 days [after dissolution of an assembly then] we have to implement it. We have no other way.""
Marriyum said now political parties will hold a dialogue as the 90-day period has already passed.
The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party dissolved the provincial assemblies of the two provinces in mid-January and 90 days since dissolution of the legislatures completed in mid-April.
Referring to the general election for the National Assembly, she said these elections will be held on time once the assembly completes its five-year term.
She claimed that PTI chief Imran Khan does not want an election. “He just wants to come back into power. He had dissolved the Punjab and the K-P assemblies just because he wanted to return to power.""
The minister said Imran Khan has been changing his statements.
She said Supreme Court’s judge Athar Minallah also raised questions about the intention behind the dissolution of the assemblies.
She claimed that the suo motu case about delay in announcement of date for the provincial assemblies’s elections had been dismissed with a vote of 4-3.
“Justice Minallah had categorically stated in his judgment that the intention behind dissolution of an assembly should be looked into. Assemblies can’t be dissolved at the whims of someone.
“Imran Khan was not even empowered to dissolve the assemblies as it was the chief ministers' job. [One of the chief ministers has]  admitted that he did not dissolve the assembly,” she added.

7,Will delaying Punjab polls help PML-N?,A number of local leaders believe govt should immediately go to polls if it can’t fix economy,"If no financial turnaround is in sight then the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) led government should immediately head towards elections to save itself from further political damage, several former PML-N MPAs believe.
As the PML-N led coalition government in the Centre has decided to delay elections in Punjab by denying funds and security to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), the chances of elections taking place in Punjab on May 14 on the order of the Supreme Court are very slim.
A number of local PML-N leaders, however, do not view it as a prudent move.
They feel the rising inflation is fast eroding the popularity of their party and the specter of a whitewash at the hands of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) is looming large.
They believe that the PML-N’s base of political support is still pretty much intact.
However, the worsening financial situation that has made eking out a living difficult for most people of the country is eating into the said support base.
A former MPA from Lahore who requested not to be named said people do not say anything to his face, but he is getting the feedback of his constituents indirectly.
He said his constituency largely comprises rural areas, where the PTI was non-existent a few years ago. However, now its popularity is on the rise.
Though the PTI’s popularity does not pose any real threat to him for now but if inflation is not reined in, then the tables could turn. Nothing should be ruled out in politics, he added. “We just cannot blame the PTI for everything after a year. People don’t buy it.”
“The PML-N has always delivered on its promises and always managed to bring down prices of food items; so hopes were very high when we took over. However, given that thus far we have failed to fulfill our promises, people are losing faith in us,” he conceded.
He said the party should do a cost benefit analysis. If there is nothing it can do for whatever the reason to fix the economy then it should take the country towards general elections, or at least allow elections in Punjab to take place.
He said if damage control was not possible, then the policy of damage containment should be adopted. The only way to contain the damage is to allow elections.
He said the MPAs from Lahore have been asked to complete party reorganization by next week.
“We have been advised to propose names of provincial constituency presidents, union council presidents and ward presidents. There has been no word from the party leadership regarding general elections.”

Two former MPAs—both of which belong to areas regarded as the party strongholds—said in their respective areas—Gujranwala and Narowal—the party's base of political support is completely intact. In fact, they feel they are in a better position now than they were in 2018.
Both party leaders concurred that people are not saying much to their faces but there has been chatter amongst the workers about the PML-N’s failure to deliver.
The MPA from Gujrawala said Pakistan is at that cusp of a disaster.  “We should leave aside our personnel differences and work for the country. Pitting one institution against another is creating chaos.”
He said if there is no workable plan for fixing the economy then the party should not impede elections.
He said the prices of essential commodities are going through the roof, and this was something that was out of their control. Mere assurance would not assuage the suffering of people.
He said if people take to the streets against our government, things will spiral out of anyone’s control at an astronomical pace. He said the government and the PTI should sit across the table from each other if they have any roadmap to ameliorate the economic conditions.
“We don’t need our chief justice, our establishment and our president to win elections. We need public support, and this is something the party is forgetting.”
The MPA from Narowal said blaming one’s predecessor is an ugly practice. He said every government which has been in the saddle for over three months should be held responsible for its own actions.
He said their government blaming the PTI may work on TV but it does not work in his constituency.
“People don’t buy it anymore. The PML-N will not be able to win close to 170 seats that it had won in 2018. However, all is not lost.”
He warned that if the trend continues, then the damage could take more than five years to repair. He said the party should not adopt a pro-establishment stance.
Another MPA from southern Punjab said the PTI’s politics is actually benefiting the PML-N and the PML-N’s politics is benefiting the PTI.
He said his party by obstructing elections is only making things more difficult for itself.
He said the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), despite being the PML-N’s coalition partner, is trying to use the situation to its advantage by blaming the financial mismanagement on the PML-N.
He said the PPP is creating an impression that they are a party in waiting. “The PML-N needs to tread carefully, as it is beset on all sides by foes.
He said since the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is not ready to release the $1.2 billion tranche, the financial woes are just going to get worse which will without a doubt impact the party's popularity.
“If the government has a plan to deal with this crisis then delaying will at least be good for the country, and if the said plan brings prices considerably down, the PML-N may even undo the damage the PTI has afflicted onto it, if otherwise, the PML-N should brace for a turbulent future.”
Former MPA Colonel (retd) Ayub Gadhi defended the party's decision to defer elections saying the people should decide if they need Pakistan or elections.
“Elections are not possible until the economic situation improves. Early elections will push Pakistan towards chaos. If the IMF deal is not working out then the government should look for other avenues to plug the gaps,” he added.

8,No grounds for contempt of court: Tarar,Says it was crucial for the PTI workers to uphold the law and must demonstrate respect for it,"Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) Attaullah Tarar on Sunday said that there were no grounds for contempt of court against the government as all decisions have been made by the parliament.
SAPM further said that there was still hope for a constructive resolution as the government and PTI have reached a significant milestone by agreeing to hold simultaneous elections in the country.
""However, it is now impossible to proceed with the Punjab elections scheduled for May 14.”
To a query regarding the protest of PTI, he said that it was crucial for the PTI workers to uphold the law and must demonstrate respect for it.
