1,New primary exam system introduced in Central district,System implemented even though Sindh govt has not approved it,"A centralised examination system has been introduced in hundreds of state-run primary schools in a Karachi district without the Sindh government approval as thousands of students of Grade IV & V have sat their annual exams in the board-style system. Surprisingly, the District Education Officer (DEO) of Central District has arbitrarily taken the decision and introduced this system even though it is not in place at the primary level anywhere in Sindh.
It has been done in such a clumsy manner that on Saturday the Urdu paper was suddenly withdrawn without any prior notice for Grade IV & V exams in the entire district. The students had already attempted their Urdu papers, but on Saturday as soon as they were done with their last paper, they were told to stay back in their classrooms because they would have to also retake their Urdu paper due to some unexplained reasons. The decision was no unexpected that the managements of some schools could not even arrange print-outs of the Urdu paper and instead wrote the questions on the blackboard.
Under the centralised system, question papers are prepared and sent to the schools by the DEO and answer-sheets of students are sent back to the DEO by the schools or to an assessment centre for evaluation. On the contrary, state-run primary schools in other six districts of Karachi conduct their own exams, including preparation of papers and assessment of answer-sheets. As per the centralized system, teachers were barred from staying in their own schools as teachers from other schools would conduct the exams. However, when the DEO got to know that some teachers were present in their own schools at the time of Urdu paper, she ordered a re-take of the paper. The decision was abrupt and unexpected for both the teachers as well as students, but they had no option except compliance. Despite repeated attempts, DEO Tahseen Fatima did not share her version with The Express Tribune.
It is said that Fatima is a close relative of a senior officer in the Sindh government. She has been holding her current post for about seven years. She is so powerful that even School Education Secretary Ghulam Akbar Leghari cannot do anything against her. When contacted, Deputy District Officer Central Arshad Ali told The Express Tribune that the Urdu paper was retaken following complaints of ""violation of some rules during the conduct of the paper for the first time."" He refused to answer when asked if the centralized examination system was in practice in other districts of Karachi, saying that ""you better go and check with officers in other districts as I am responsible for my district"". Again he evaded a direct answer when asked if the decision to introduce the new system has been approved by the department. ""Only madam can answer your question, please go and ask her,"" he said while referring to the DEO.

7,Hyderabad traders support MQM-P on census issue,Party says it would not remain silent if urban Sindh's population not counted correctly,"The Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM-P) has organised a large gathering of representatives of different schools of thought in Hyderabad under the title of ""Shehri Sindh ka Muqaddima"" (Urban Sindh's case) on the issue of the ongoing digital census, in which the MQM-P leadership participated in large numbers.
Addressing the audience, Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, Mustafa Kamal and Dr Farooq Sattar described the next eight to ten days as extremely important regarding the census and said that if the population was still not counted correctly, then their struggle would take a new turn.
The Hyderabad Chamber of Commerce and the Hyderabad Chamber of Small Traders supported the demands of the MQM-P and demanded that Karachi, Hyderabad be counted properly so that there was a fair distribution of resources and development of high revenue generating areas.
A large number of businessmen, industrialists, representatives of commercial organisations, lawyers, dignities, and women of Hyderabad participated in the gathering held at a banquet in Latifabad, Hyderabad. Speaking at the event, former president of Hyderabad Chamber of Small Traders and Industries Altaf Memon said that the citizens of Hyderabad were tired of their problems not being solved.
Earlier, there was no electricity in the city, then polluted water started coming in the city and now gas load-shedding has been started in the city, whose timing was from eight o'clock at night to eight o'clock in the morning, and in some places gas load-shedding was carried out for 14 hours.
""We see that members of the MQM-P elected from Hyderabad are raising their voice to solve these problems in the national and provincial assemblies, but no one is listening, so now it is time to take strict action and if the MQM-P takes any strict step, then the business community will stand by them.""
Hyderabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry President Adeel Siddiqui said that the ""real problem is to count us correctly"".
He said that Hyderabad is a large city for which funds of Rs500 million have been allocated in ADP, while Khairpur is not a bigger urban area than Hyderabad, but more than Rs1 billion have been set aside in the ADP for it.
""This is injustice.""
He said that the Chief Commissioner of FBR informed him that this year, FBR received Rs50 billion from Hyderabad in terms of income tax and sales tax, while Sindh Revenue Board received Rs5 billion in taxes from here.
Thus, the city which gave Rs55 billion in taxes to the federation and the province does not get even one billion. Zafar Siddiqui, the in-charge of MQM-P District Hyderabad, said that MQM-P would not remain silent when every person is not counted.

8,Social protection of agriculture workers sought,Floods pose risk to Pakistan’s status of major cotton producing country,"Activists, government bodies, growers, and women cotton workers are concerned about the poor working conditions of agriculture workers and demand effective social protection and safety nets schemes for them.
The speakers at the dialogue organised by the Sindh Community Foundation (SCF) on the status of agriculture workers in Sindh, in line with Generalised Scheme Preferences Plus (GSP+) challenges and the way forward, in cooperation with Feed The Minds foundation at a local hotel resolved that agriculture sector should be given the status of an industry and its workers should be included in a broader labour welfare framework.
Sindh Human Rights Commission Chairperson Iqbal Detho shared that agricultural women are facing many problems, including malnutrition and health hazards.
He also highlighted that the government firmly believes in the implementation of labour laws in connection with the international commission as a bridge between civil society and the government.
He further said that the European Union's GSP+ gives Pakistan a special incentive to pursue sustainable development and good governance.
He said that the Commission will play an active role in overseeing the implementation of existing labour laws and human rights in line with GSP+ for the protection of labour in the province.
SCF Head Javed Hussain said that climate is an emerging challenge to the livelihoods and labour rights security of agriculture workers.
""As the temperature increases, the working conditions of women cotton workers become more and more difficult, and they work in a harsh environment"", Hussain said.
He stated that Pakistan is one of the vulnerable countries in the world exposed to extreme climate events, while existing labour policies and labour laws are silent about adapting to climate change.
He said that women cotton workers are the forefront climate victims and need to be protected through various social protection and decent work interventions.
On the occasion, Dr Ismaeel Kumbhar said that recent heavy rainfall in the province had a devastating impact on the loss of standing cotton crops, as they were in the stage of harvesting.
He said that Pakistan's status as the fourth-largest cotton-producing country may be lost as a result of the low yield of cotton, which may reduce income generation for the cotton pickers.
He added that according to International Labour Organisation (ILO) data, 65% of women are employed in the agriculture sector, which contributes 23% to the nation's gross domestic products (GDP).
Recent floods also resulted in the loss of 4.3 million workers in Pakistan, with the largest portion coming from Sindh.
Civil society activist Zulfqar Halepoto said that the labour rights debate has been shrunk, so there is a need to emphasise inclusive labour policies with the true spirit of constitutional guarantees.
Present at the event, Sindh Abadgar Board representative Syed Nadeem Shah said that growers also suffered losses due to damaged crops and land fertility because of heavy rainfall.
Therefore, the government should also support the growers in initiating crop compensation and insurance schemes.
Civil society activists Zahida Detho, Shahnaz Sheedi, Marvi Awan, Taj Maree Abdul Samad Sommro, Dr Aslam Memon and women cotton workers from Matiari were also among the speakers.
