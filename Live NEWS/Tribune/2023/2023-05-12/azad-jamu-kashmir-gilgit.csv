0,Call for protecting minorities’ rights,Speakers ask parliamentarians to overcome crises that threaten democracy,"Political leaders, parliamentarians and experts on Thursday emphasised the importance of Pakistan's Constitution in establishing democracy, protecting minority rights and promoting social justice.
They were speaking at the International Parliamentary Convention being organised by National Assembly Secretariat in connection with Golden Jubilee Celebrations of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan.
The speakers stressed the role of parliament as the people's representative and the need to prevent non-constitutional forces from interfering. The UN Charter and international laws were cited as means for resolving disputes.
Discussions included the need to learn from past mistakes, and to promote teachings of Islam, which encourage tolerance and non-discrimination. The session focused on threats to the Constitution, including its suspension and abrogation, and the impact of emergency rules on democracy and the rule of law. 
It also discussed ways to navigate and overcome crises that threaten democracy, such as national security threats, social unrest, and political and economic instability, and the role of constitutional principles and institutions in promoting resilience and stability during times of crisis.
Senior leader of Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) Mohsin Shah Nawaz Ranjha said that the Constitution of Pakistan guaranteed rights to people of all religions and had taken into account all future challenges. Chairing the first session titled Constitution in the age of Crises: Navigating Challenges,” in the International Convention as part of Pakistan's Golden Jubilee of the Constitution, he also highlighted that parliamentary discussions assist in comprehending the Constitution. 
Moreover, he emphasised that it was imperative to practice tolerance, and social justice, and protect the rights of minorities in accordance with Islamic teachings and the Constitution of Pakistan to ensure effective democratic governance.
According to the Constitution of Pakistan, there is a significant link between the fundamental rights of people and the Holy Quran. The Constitution is designed to encompass and address all situations.
The Kyrgyzstan representative expressed gratitude to the Speaker of the National Assembly, Raja Pervez Ashraf, for organising the convention. Kyrgyzstan and Pakistan are both interested in boosting cooperation in tourism, healthcare, trade, and the economy. They have recently signed the Charter of Operation to strengthen their collaboration. The representative also welcomed new investment prospects between the two nations.
Speaking on the occasion, Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed emphasized the significance of the Constitution in establishing a functional democracy in Pakistan. 
He highlighted the parliament's role as a representative of its country and people and warned against constitutional violations and non-constitutional forces. He also mentioned the provisions for resolving disputes between countries under the United Nations Charter and international laws.
The senator also emphasised the importance of the Constitution in forming the basis for a functioning democracy in Pakistan. He said that parliament served as a representative of its country and people, and there was consensus among political parties based on the Constitution. 
This democratic process was the purpose of Pakistan's creation, and it relied on the foundation of democratic rule and the Constitution, he added. However, Pakistan has a history of constitutional violations, such as judicial activism, military coups, and amendments targeting specific individuals. Similarly, other countries, like the United States and India, have also violated their own Constitutions. For example, the US violated its Constitution by going to war in Iraq in 2003 without proper validation from Congress, and the Supreme Court's decision in President George Bush vs. Al Gore presidential election was a violation of the Constitution as it declared Bush the winner by a 5-4 majority. India has also had various violations, including the promulgation of emergency by Indra Gandhi and blatant violations in Indian Illegally Occupied Kashmir.
Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, a member of the Mutahidda Quomi Movement (MQM), said the current crisis in Pakistan is largely due to the fact that the country's Constitution has failed to safeguard the rights of its citizens. He believes that this failure has led to the emergence of a troubling phenomenon known as the ""doctrine of necessity,"" which allows the ruling elite to purge themselves of any opposition, thereby consolidating their power and undermining democratic institutions. 
Siddiqui also made a comparison between Pakistan and India, stating that the people of Pakistan have never elected any extremist as their ruler, unlike India, where religious bigots have been elected as leaders. He went on to suggest that the dangers to world peace come from India, rather than Pakistan.

2,Protests disrupt court proceedings,"Backlog of cases rises to 9,063 in twin cities","The ongoing turmoil stemming from the arrest of former prime minister and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan has severely disrupted court proceedings in the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad.
Due to security measures, none of the accused could be presented in district sessions and civil courts of the twin cities from the Adiala Central Jail in the past four days.
According to judicial sources, hearing of approximately 9,063 cases were affected by the unrest. They said hearing dates for the cases have been fixed without any hearing.
Sources said that until today (Friday), no accused will be brought to court from the jail due to the unavailability of prison vehicles.
Currently, these vehicles are being used to shift protesting workers of PTI.
Police personnel assigned to bring the accused from the jail to the court have also been assigned duties to arrest protesters.
According to the officials, only a few accused charged in terrorism and sedition cases are being brought to anti-terrorism courts. However, the situation is likely to return to normalcy by Monday, May 15.
Also in other districts of the Rawalpindi division, under-trial prisoners could not be presented before courts due to the unavailability of police personnel.
The hearing of all cases where the accused have been arrested and locked up in jails has been suspended. Additionally, the closure of roads due to protests has further impeded the mobility of people to reach the courts on time.
Judicial sources have stated that civil magistrate courts normally hear 100-120 cases daily, while session courts hear 40-60 cases. The suspension of hearings of thousands of cases has created a major backlog that will take time to clear.
The District Bar Association President Faisal Khan Niazi stated that the situation has persisted since May 9. He expressed his hope that the situation will improve and return to normal on Monday. He said the situation has also caused severe problems for lawyers.

The presided over a meeting on “Improving Community Policing in Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) under the governance innovation lab initiative. Legal experts, civil society representatives, law enforcement officers and various stakeholders participated in the meeting to the future of policing in the capital.

7,"Flour crisis hits Rawalpindi, Islamabad yet again",Sources say shortage likely to persist for another week,"Due to the persistent closure of all 144 flour mills, the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad have been gripped by a fresh crisis of wheat flour.
Despite the Rawalpindi division commissioner, food secretary, and deputy commissioner’s intervention, the mills across the division could not be made operational on Thursday.
The shortage of wheat flour has pushed the price of the commodity beyond the poor man’s reach.
Flour mill owners have fixed the price of flour at Rs180 per kg. Meanwhile, in the open market, the price of an 80kg bag of red flour climbed to Rs13,500, fine flour Rs14,500, and the price of a bag of wheat flour with a more fine quality reached Rs14,850.
According to sources, the flour crisis is likely to continue for another week.
In a bid to control the situation,  authorities concerned had announced an allocation of 35 tonnes of wheat to each flour mill after detailed discussions with the leaders of the mills association and owners of the mills.
The high officials had also ordered to make the mills functional immediately.
Commenting on the situation, the spokesperson for the Flour Mills Association Raza Ahmad Shah told The Express Tribune that they need to procure the wheat from Bahawalnagar and the transportation cost of the commodity will further impact flour prices. He said the wheat quota allocated by the high officials in Rawalpindi has not yet been approved by the Bahawalnagar deputy commissioner.
As of now, the Bahawalnagar DC has not accepted the allocated quotas for other districts that were approved 10 days ago, he said.
The allocation is meaningless until Bahawalnagar DC accepts it, he added.
“During the talks, we asked the food secretary and commissioner to provide us with the first tranche of 100 bags of wheat each. This will make the closed mills functional till more wheat arrives from Bhawalpur.”
He further said our demand is not being accepted and no flour mill in the twin cities can be made operation until the wheat from Bahawalnagar arrives.
