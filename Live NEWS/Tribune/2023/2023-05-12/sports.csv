0,Sindh Assembly amends law to pave way for unelected mayor,New mayor will have to get elected within months from respective Union Council,"Sindh Assembly on Thursday passed a law to elect mayor and deputy mayor, chairman and vice chairman of the metropolitan corporation, town committee, district council and municipal committee even without being a member of any council. It means, the non-elected member of the council can also become a mayor with majority votes of the house. Earlier, for the election of mayor, it was mandatory that the aspiring candidate for the mayor must be a chairman of any union committee.
According to the latest amendment to Local Government Law that was moved by parliamentary affairs minister Mukesh Kumar Chawla, the newly elected mayor will have to be elected from the respective council within six month of taking oath of the office.
Sources privy to the development told The Express Tribune that this all exercise is being done to elect PPP’s Barrister Murtaza Wahab as mayor Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC). Wahab has served as KMC Administrator and currently works as the advisor to the chief minister on law.
Earlier, Sindh Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution and condemned the violence perpetrated by PTI workers at the behest of their leaders and demanded of the Sindh government to ensure complete protection of people and their properties. The government was also urged to take strict against anyone one who violates the law. 
The resolution was moved by Pakistan People’s Party MPA Ganhwar Isran. As he moved the resolution, the MQM lawmakers suggested an amendment to book Imran Khan under Article 6, and file a case of high treason against him. But it was turned down by the Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah who advised Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) come forward and move a high treason resolution under Article 6 of the Constitution against party chief Imran Khan at the Sindh Assembly as it was done by the MQM lawmakers against Altaf Hussain. 
In his policy statement, the CM also assured the House that all perpetrators involved in Karachi violence will be arrested.
“We have taken footage and other evidence,” he said, adding that not a single person involved in the attacks will be spared.
However, he shied away from sharing further details of the government’s strategy and further details but said that the government has asked police and law enforcement agencies to initiate a crackdown against the party.
During the session, all PTI seats were empty as no one from the party’s camp attended the session.
The CM while pointing at the deserted PTI seats said, “For me, it’s very difficult to lodge a high treason case against a political leader, but we will support if it comes through PTI lawmakers.”
Chief minister also took note of PTI protestors’ attack on Lahore Corps Commander Lt-Gen Salman Fayyaz Ghani’s residence and other military’s installations including General Headquarters (GHQ).
“After TTP and Al Qaeda, PTI has done the same thing by attacking the public places and private properties,” he said adding that the attack on People’s Bus in Karachi and burring vehicles were the acts of terrorism. 
Later, the deputy speaker Rehana Leghari adjourned the session till Friday.

1,"Facilities missing, students drop out","Schools with issues like lack of drinking water, restrooms have seen enrollment numbers drop dramatically","At a time when the inflationary crunch is actively pushing children out of schools, issues like lack of infrastructure are not doing Karachi’s educational institutions any favours either.
According to internal documents of the provincial education department made available to The Express Tribune, out of 1914 government schools in Karachi only 749 are properly functional — a staggering 39 per cent.
The documents, which offer a comparative review of the school census conducted by the Department of School Education in 2021-2022 against the 2019 school year, reveal that out of 1,914 government schools 1,657 do not have drinking water, 542 are without electricity, and 380 have no toilets. The damning comparative review documents further show that 1,710 of the total schools have no library, 1,588 schools have no science laboratories, and 1,528 do not have a computer laboratory.
Consequently, as per the report, Karachi’s school enrollment numbers which stood at 459,000 in 2019 have dropped to 395,522 in 2021 and 2022 - a 13 per cent drop in enrollment in the economic hub of a country, which already happens to be marred with high dropout rates. Moreover, it is pertinent to mention that given the present double-digit inflation and the poor economic forecast for the next year, the enrollment numbers are expected to drop even further.
In this regard, a teacher from the renowned Allama Iqbal School in Sohrab Goth, told The Express Tribune under the condition of anonymity, that there was no doubt in his mind that poor infrastructure was leading to children dropping out of schools. “Damaged furniture, broken windows, and absent teachers and support staff, have become the hallmarks of Karachi’s government schools. Who would want to study in such an environment?”
Dr Muhammad Memon, an educationist and former chairman of the Hyderabad Education Board, agrees. “There is barely any use of the monitoring mechanism employed in Sindh’s schools. Our decisions and policies vis a vis education are ill-informed and all over the place,” criticised Dr Memon. The educationist was of the view that the monitoring mechanisms should be used to make decisions backed by data which would help increase enrollment rates.
The Express Tribune also contacted the Secretary Department of School Education, Ghulam Akbar Laghari, to confirm the veracity of the internal documents, who conceded that the census results were true. “As much as 85 per cent of the department’s budget is going towards salaries of teaching and non-teaching staff. It is difficult to provide facilities with the remainder,” said Laghari, adding that they are trying to do their best. The Secretary further explained that whenever they receive reports of missing facilities, they try to address the problems on a first come first serve basis to ensure that funds are distributed equally amongst all schools. “We are aware of the problems but there is not much we can do with the current budget,” remarked Laghari, while talking to The Express Tribune.
