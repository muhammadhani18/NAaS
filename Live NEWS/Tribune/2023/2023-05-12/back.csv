1,China completes warship deliveries to Pakistan,The vessels will be used to safeguard the seas of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC),"China has delivered two frigates to Pakistan Navy, completing a four-warship deal inked in 2018, Chinese media reported, amid deepening military cooperation between the two nations in one of the world’s most complex geopolitical regions.
The vessels -- two Type 054A frigates -- will be used to safeguard the seas of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), state-backed Chinese newspaper Global Times reported late on Wednesday.
CPEC is an ambitious infrastructure project that links Xinjiang in west China to Pakistan aimed at offering an alternative transportation route in the future for goods including gas. Part of the network is Gwadar port, located on a key waterway in the Arabian Sea.
Economic and military ties between the two neighbours have deepened against a shifting geopolitical backdrop, evident from Pakistan's increasing military procurement from China and joint military exercises to safeguard assets and trade routes.
For China, Pakistan and its access to the Arabian Sea is key in the event of a maritime blockade in the Strait of Malacca. China delivered the first batch of six J-10 fighter jets to Pakistan in March last year. Eight Hangor Class submarines that Pakistan ordered from China are expected to be delivered before 2028.
Earlier this week, China's defence minister told Pakistan's navy chief that their militaries, including their navies, should ""expand into new fields of cooperation"" to bolster their capability in safeguarding regional security. ""The prospects for cooperation between the two sides, in my opinion, is getting stronger and stronger,"" Song Zhongping, a military commentator with Phoenix TV, told Reuters.
In South Asia, China's ties with India, with whom Pakistan has frosty relations, have deteriorated in recent years, and the withdrawal of US troops in nearby Afghanistan has raised geopolitical uncertainty in the region, pushing China and Pakistan to seek a stronger alliance. ""Maintaining the peace and stability of South Asia fits with both countries' actual interests,"" Song said.

2,Pakistan defends Bilawal’s Goa visit,FO says Islamabad will continue raising voice against HR abuses in IIOJK,"The Foreign Office on Thursday defended the visit of Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari to Goa where he attended the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Council of Foreign Ministers’ meeting.
The foreign minister became the first Pakistani foreign minister to visit India in almost 12 years, flying into Goa to attend a SCO meet last week.
“We believe that Pakistan made the right decision to participate in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Council of Foreign Ministers’ meeting,” FO spokesperson Mumtaz Zehra Baloch said during her weekly press briefing.
To a question, the spokesperson said, “This shows our commitment to the SCO.
You may have seen the statement that foreign minister made. He highlighted Pakistan’s viewpoint on all aspects of our concern about security, economic development, and connectivity in this region. He also underlined that terrorism should not be weaponised as a tool of foreign policy. You may have also seen the interactions that foreign minister had with the Indian media and the Pakistani media.”
She remarked, “Our position was consistent with our long-standing position on the various issues, including weaponisation of terrorism and the situation in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir. It should not have come as a surprise to anyone. Any statements that have been made in that respect criticising our foreign minister’s statements are just unfortunate and baseless.”
To another question, she said, “Pakistan unequivocally condemns all terrorist acts, including acts against foreign nationals in Pakistan. The Chinese nationals are our guests. Chinese companies in Pakistan are contributing to Pakistan’s development. The government of Pakistan will continue to provide them with all the best possible facilitation and best possible security so that they are able to function in Pakistan without any fear or hindrance.”
The spokesperson said, “We will also continue to extend political, diplomatic, and moral support to our Kashmiri brothers and sisters for the just and peaceful settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with the UN Security Council Resolutions.”
She said, “The oppression in IIOJK continues unabated. Since our last news briefing, the occupation forces killed at least six Kashmiri youth in Rajouri, Kupwara, and Baramulla districts. They continued their cordon and search operations in Rajouri and Poonch districts, harassing the local population. Six shops of a pro-freedom activist, Fayaz Ahmed Magray, were attacked by India’s National Investigation Agency in Pulwama district. Two Kashmiri youth, Shahid Ahmad Lone and Waseem Ahmad Ganai, were arrested in Shopian district. Reportedly, 193 more Kashmiris have been identified, whose properties will be demolished as a punishment for their support to the freedom movement. These human rights violations must end.”

4,Crackdown on PTI shows no sign of let-up,"PTI leader Shireen Mazari, ex-minister Yasmin, Balochistan minister rounded up","ISLAMABAD/LAHORE/QUETTA: The police crackdown against the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leaders showed no sign of let-up on Friday, as senior PTI leaders Dr Shireen Mazari and Dr Yasmin Rashid, as well as Balochistan Minister Mubeen Khilji, were arrested by police in raids carried out in Islamabad, Lahore, and Quetta.
According to officials, the Islamabad police raided Shireen Mazari's house during the wee hours of Friday. Her arrest came after a series of arrests of several other PTI leaders, including Imran Khan, Asad Umar, Fawad Chaudhry, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Omer Cheema, Ali Mohammad Khan, Senator Ejaz Chaudhry and others.
All of these leaders other than Imran were arrested under Section 3 of the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO).
According to a statement issued by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, former Punjab health minister Dr Yasmin Rashid has also been arrested.

PTI leader Andaleeb Abbas said that the former minister had gone into hiding to avoid arrest.
""The police had taken her close family members into custody two days ago but her husband was released after his health deteriorated. Her brother-in-law is still in police custody.”
There are a number of cases filed against Dr Yasmin, including that of an attack on the Lahore corps commander's residence.
Balochistan Minister for Industries Khilji was rounded up for inciting violence among the public against the arrest of Imran.
A senior police official said Khilji was shifted to Quetta district jail. So far in Balochistan, police have arrested 72 workers and leaders of the PTI for damaging public and private properties.

Meanwhile, sources said that PTI leaders Khusro Baktiar, Afzal Sahi and Bilal Basra had also been rounded up and shifted to Lahore's Sarwar Road Police Station.
As Imran appeared before the Islamabad High Court for the hearing of the Al-Qadir Trust case, police and Rangers personnel tried to stop the PTI supporters from reaching the court which turned G-11 and G-13 of the Srinagar Highway leading to the court a battleground.
The PTI workers arrived not only from adjacent areas of Islamabad but also from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and pelted stones at the police from 11am to 8pm.
Heavy vandalism was reported as well as a private vehicle was set ablaze at G-13.
The police fired heavy tear-gas shells to disperse the PTI workers. However, they regrouped again and again and pelted stones at the police so that they could reach the IHC building to express solidarity with their leader, but the Islamabad police, Rangers, and Punjab police continued tear-gas shelling at the workers, keeping them from reaching the court.
The Islamabad police spokesperson said that police were fired upon at G-11 and G-13.
Except for Faizabad Flyover, Srinagar Highway and No 26 Chongi, the situation in the entire city remained normal and no roads were blocked.
Further, more than 190 leaders, activists and protesters, including the central leaders of PTI, who were arrested from the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad, were detained at Adiala Jail.
The detainees included Shah Mahmood Qureshi Shireen Mazari, Asad Umar and others.

5,"PM, Fazl discuss current political situation",Discuss future strategy in the wake of PTI chief’s release,"JUI-F chief and Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) President Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Thursday called on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and discussed with him current political situation in the country in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision to release PTI Chairman and former premier Imran Khan and declare his arrest in the Al-Qadir Trust case illegal.
During the meeting at the PM House, both the leaders strongly condemned the attacks on state institutions and damage caused to the government property after the PTI chief was taken into custody on Tuesday.
They deliberated on the apex court’s decision and discussed the future strategy.
Later, addressing a news conference, the JUI-F chief maintained that the Supreme Court had “facilitated” the PTI chief despite knowing about his “crimes”.
He said an emergency meeting of the PDM had been called on Friday (today).
We interpret Supreme Court’s decision as “facilitating” a criminal like Imran Khan, he added.
Fazl said India could not humiliate the state institutions the way PTI did.
“The nation cannot call this decision a decision of the court,” he said.

“Who will be responsible if their (PTI) goons set [properties] on fire?”
 The former premier was taken into custody on May 9 by the paramilitary Rangers force on orders from the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) from the Islamabad High Court (IHC), over allegations of having looted Rs50 billion along with a property tycoon from the national treasury and getting the Al-Qadir University Trust registered on 450-kanal of land.
Riots broke out in several parts of the country with protesters allegedly belonging to the PTI attacking state institutions and causing damage to the government property.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said that causing damage to public and private property amounted to a terrorist act, warning that these “terrorist and anti-state elements” would be dealt with sternly while terming Imran’s arrest legal.
The army while declaring May 9 as “black day” warned that any further attack on it or state institutions or any law enforcement agency would be dealt with full force.
Earlier, violent protesters ransacked the residence of Corps Commander Lahore and broke the gates of General Headquarters in Rawalpindi.

6,Speakers call for scrutiny in judicial system,"Minister says Constitution outlines the role of every institution, including judiciary","Speakers at the Breakout Session-II of the two-day International Constitutional Convention on Thursday stressed the need for a proper scrutiny process for the appointment and promotion of judges in the courts to ensure transparency in the judicial system, like in the rest of the world.
Chairing the Breakout Session-II on ""Constitution of and the Courts-Interpreting Constitution, Protecting Rights and Freedoms,"" Minister for Poverty Alleviation and Social Safety Shazia Marri said that chaos was detrimental to the development of the country. She added that the 1973 Constitution clearly defined the role of every institution, including the judiciary.
Marri stated that the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) in Pakistan was authorised to investigate any judge of the superior judiciary. However, she added that there was a need for public scrutiny of the judges to ensure transparency.
Recalling her party's struggle for the democratic process, the minister said that credit went to the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) and its founder Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who passed the constitution unanimously despite ideological and political differences with other parties.
She emphasised that she took an oath to follow, protect, and preserve the Constitution in its letter and spirit. Although there were interventions in the democratic system several times, the struggle for the democratic process continued, she added.
The minister observed that unfortunately, the founder of the constitution, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was murdered through a judicial order. She said that a leader like Benazir Bhutto could not be replaced, and the vacuum created after her death would not be filled. Benazir Bhutto was an iconic leader who lived in the hearts of millions of people, Marri remarked.
Speaking on the occasion, Dr Joseph Kizito Mhagama, member of parliament, United Republic of Tanzania, said that courts were responsible for interpreting the law in his country. There was a clear procedure for the appointment and promotion of judges, he added. He said that in Tanzania, people enjoyed freedom of speech and assembly, but special permission was required for holding processions, and the courts had no right to intervene in such matters.
Former Senator Safdar Abbasi said that three attempts were made to abrogate the constitution in Pakistan, including in 1977 and 1999, where elected governments were removed. Unfortunately, the judiciary validated the acts of dictators under the doctrine of necessity, he added. He said that after the landmark 18th amendment, they were forced to pass the 19th amendment.
Only the constitution was sovereign and supreme, and some kind of settlement was required between the judiciary and parliament to resolve various issues, including holding free, fair, and transparent elections in the country, he further said.
Zafarullah Khan said that the 18th constitutional amendment passed by the parliament was scrutinised twice. Appointment of judges was an important matter, and in the USA, Senate members used to scrutinize judges, he added.
