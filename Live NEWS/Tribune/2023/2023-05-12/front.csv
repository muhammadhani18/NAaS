0,PML-N leaders fume at Imran’s release order,Maryam Nawaz asks CJP to ‘resign’ and ‘join PTI’; ministers decry double standards of judiciary,"Senior leaders of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) decried what they described as the double standards of the judiciary on Thursday after the Supreme Court declared the arrest of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chairman Imran Khan as illegal.
PML-N Chief Organiser Maryam Nawaz, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif and Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, in their separate statements and media talks, criticised the apex court judges, accusing them of favouritism.
In a scathing critique on Twitter, Maryam Nawaz went on to say that Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial had become a shield for this “miscreant fitna” [mischief] therefore, the chief justice should “step down from his post” and “join the PTI”.
چیف جسٹس صاحب کو آج قومی خزانے کے 60 ارب ہڑپ کرنے والے وارداتیے کو مل کر بہت خوشی ہوئی اور اس سے بھی زیادہ خوشی انھیں اس مجرم کو رہا کر کے ہوئی۔ ملک کی اہم ترین اور حساس تنصیبات پر حملوں کے سب سے بڑے ذمہ دار چیف جسٹس ہیں جو ایک فتنہ کی ڈھال بنے ہوئے ہیں اور ملک میں لگی آگ پر تیل…
In his media talk, Khawaja Asif said that there was no suo motu notice or the sense of justice, when the senior politicians, like Nawaz Sharif, Maryam Nawaz, Shehbaz Sharif Asif Zardari, Faryal Talpur and he himself faced cases during Imran Khan’s government.
Earlier in the day, a three member bench of the Supreme Court led by Chief Justice Bandial, declared Imran’s arrest in the Al-Qadir Trust case as illegal and ordered his immediate release.
The former prime minister was arrested on May 9 by the paramilitary Rangers on orders of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) from the Islamabad High Court (IHC) over allegations Rs50 billion corruption.
In her tweet, Maryam Nawaz, the senior vice president of the PML-N claimed that the chief justice seemed exceedingly pleased with meeting an individual who was accused of embezzling Rs60 billion from the national treasury.
“And he was even more delighted in releasing this alleged criminal,” the PML-N leader said. She went on to accuse the top judge of becoming a shield for this miscreant and adding fuel to the fire in the country.
Maryam referred to the violent protests in the wake of Imran’s arrest in which several public and private properties, including some sensitive government installations, were damaged or destroyed.
She accused the chief justice of being responsible for the attacks on “crucial and sensitive institutions” in the country. “The chief justice of Pakistan should leave the post and join the Tehreek-e-Insaf,” she stated on the micro-blogging website.
During the press conference in Islamabad, Asif decried the double standards of the judiciary. “Why did politicians, including Nawaz Sharif, Shahbaz Sharif, Asif Zardari, Maryam Nawaz and me not get this kind of treatment from the Supreme Court?”
Referring to the NAB references against the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and the PML-N leaders during the tenure of the PTI government, Asif recalled that in those days the graft buster was allowed 90-day remand.
“In those days no one thought of ending our detention. Now the facilities of the rest house are allowed [to Imran Khan]. Why are there two standards in this country?” he asked. “There are two standards everywhere, normal life, law, the Constitution.”
Asif said that 90-day remand period was reduced to 15-day through the amendments to the NAB laws by the present government, while Imran Khan was its first beneficiary. “There is a question why there are double standards.
He also fired a broadside against the PTI chief. He said medical report of Imran in police custody and the medical report of his charity hospital were way different. “The nature of his injuries is different,” he said about the leg injury of Imran from the Wazirabad attack.
“Even today Imran Khan walked by himself in the corridors of the Supreme Court. He did not need a wheelchair, nor did he showed pain or signs that his leg was injured,” Asif claimed. “For how long will the nation be fooled?”
Asif referred to an alleged audio conversation, purportedly between Imran Khan and PTI leader Musrat Jamshed Cheema. He also mentioned that an audio had surfaced in which a lawyer was saying what would be the court decision.
Asif condemned the violence after Imran’s arrest. “What happened in this violence? Martyrs’ memorials, defence installations, corps commander’s house were attacked but the courts did not take suo motu notice,” he said.
“The kind of siege and the language used in Punjab and K-P [Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa] is not hidden from anyone. Was that not an attack on the integrity of the country? Had any other party or organisation done this, I don’t know what would have happened by now.”
Asif pointed out that previously the General Headquarters of the army (GHQ) was attacked by the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban and now by the Tehreek-e-Insaf. “Even Indian media is saying that what they could not do in 75 years, the PTI did it,” he added.
“There are other people’s houses in Lahore, but the corps commander’s house was targeted. Imran Khan is targeting the institution of the army. The attackers and those giving instructions to them have been identified from the social media [posts].”
In response to a question, Asif said that the cabinet had not yet decided to impose emergency, but added that if the situation persisted, emergency could be imposed. In response to another question, he said there was no chance of martial law in the country.
In a separate press conference, Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb also said that during Imran Khan premiership, the opposition politicians were arrested from the court premises but no notice was taken.
The minister said that those who had encouraged terrorists and armed groups would also be called criminals, adding: “If the fastest relief is given to the criminals like Imran, then nobody will be safe from their evil”.
Providing relief to a “terrorist and anti-state person” would encourage and incite others to terrorism,” she added. “Who will provide justice to patients, police, martyrs and armed forces veterans who were attacked by the PTI goons,” she asked.
While referring to Nawaz Sharif, Asif Zardari, Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, Rana Sanaullah, Suleman Shehbaz, Hamza Shehbaz, Miftah Ismail and others, the information minister said that Imran was not the first politician arrested by NAB.
“Imran himself used NAB for witch-hunt of political adversaries. He even did not spare sisters and daughters of his opponents,” she said, adding: “All his opponents were arrested in fake cases but no court took notice of the political vengeance.”
Aurangzeb said that the “Ladla” [favourite] had been continuously given special treatment since 2014 and no action was ever taken against him by any court. She added that the courts should have taken notice of Imran’s threats to a respectable female judge.
Meanwhile, talking to The Express Tribune, former Punjab minister Mujtaba Shujaur Rehman said that the way the PTI chief was given “exceptional relief” by the Supreme Court, it seemed that he would also be granted “blanket immunity” in all cases.
PML-N’s National Assembly member Syed Javed Hussain took a different view of the situation, saying that the PTI chief had thus far not been extended any relief. “The final decision rests with the Islamabad High Court, which will decide about his bail plea.”

1,SC order on Imran's arrest to set legal course,Legal experts weigh in on far-reaching impact of ruling on every court of the country,"The 'extra ordinary' bail relief granted to former prime minister Imran Khan by the Supreme Court has stirred a legal debate, with experts seeing it as a victory for the battle-hardened PTI chief.
Though the Islamabad High Court will decide about the PTI chief’s pre-arrest bail today (Friday), Imran is lucky to grab the attention of the apex court.
A lawyer believes that the PTI chief has emerged victorious as the apex court proceedings will have a far-reaching impact on every court of the country, adding that now all the lower courts, including the high courts, will stand up against state institutions that have been active against Imran since April last year.
The lawyers agree with the court order wherein it is stated that the manner of execution of the arrest warrant issued by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) chairman dated May 1, 2023 in the Al-Qadir Trust case within the premises of the IHC against the petitioner is invalid and unlawful.
The execution of the said warrant violated the petitioner’s right of access to justice and the sanctity and safety of the court as he had already surrendered to the court for seeking judicial relief.
“In this regard, the fundamental rights of the petitioner under articles 4, 9, 10-A and 14 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan have been infringed"", says the written order.
However, one section of the lawyers has strong reservations over the manner wherein the bench addressed Imran during the hearing.
Imran who was produced before the bench was visibly “down”.
The judges wanted him to deliver a message to his party supporters through the media for restoring peace in the country. Imran, however, said that he is totally aloof about the happenings all over the country after his arrest.
Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial who welcomed him on the rostrum also urged Imran to resume political dialogue in national interest.
The government, especially the establishment's, position has weakened after the relief given to Imran at this critical time.
It is learnt that the government functionaries are in shock over the outcome of the SC hearing. They were not expecting that the SC will go too much in favour of Imran.
The hearing will also affect the sentiments of military officials who are being targeted by the PTI supporters since the arrest of their leader on May 9. However, it is not clear what kind of reaction can come now.
The SC hearing will also affect the working of the IHC wherein controversy has already started over the release of two judges’ ruling in the Tyrian White case without the permission of the chief justice.
The lawyers appreciate the SC for discontinuing the precedent wherein accused persons could have been arrested within the court premises without getting access to justice.
They, however, say that now the SC should compel Imran to sit for dialogue in order to set the rules of the game before the elections.
Likewise, the judges should end the perception that they are shaping national politics in order to secure judicial politics.
The inclusion of Justice Athar Minallah in the special bench has also made a difference in Thursday’s hearing.
Justice Minallah is consistent in providing relief to the accused persons in matters related to civil liberties.
He has also an emotional attachment to the IHC wherein he worked as the chief justice for almost four years.
Justice Minallah, through judicial orders, had restored the confidence of every political party in the capital’s high court during his tenure.
A lawyer believes that the sanctity of the IHC premises was violated by arresting Imran from there, therefore his involvement in this matter was understandable.
If the IHC grants pre-arrest bail, the government has various options to deal with Imran as it can arrest him under Section 3 of the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) from Islamabad.
Section 3 MPO stated: “The government, if satisfied that with a view to preventing any person from acting in any manner prejudicial to public safety or the maintenance of public order, it is necessary to do, may, by an order in writing, direct the arrest and detention in such custody power to arrest and detain suspected persons.”
CJP Bandial was firmer during the hearing. It also reflects how the unity of the court gives a powerful impact on the public.

2,Govt action to arrest Imran backfires,SC orders to release PTI chief serve major blow to ruling coalition,"Imran Khan’s release following a brief detention on Thursday is seen as a major blow to the ruling alliance which was hoping to use the arrest to bolster its political capital but found itself on the defensive again, lamenting that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party once again got preferential treatment.
In a dramatic turn of events, the PTI chairman was arrested on May 9 from the premises of the capital’s high court only to be released on May 11 by the Supreme Court.
Rangers on orders from the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) had arrested Imran from the Islamabad High Court (IHC), over allegations that he looted Rs50 billion from the national treasury along with a property tycoon and got the Al-Qadir University Trust registered on 450-kanal of land.
In between, protesters took to the streets, and key government and military buildings were attacked, ransacked and torched, at least six people lost their lives, dozens of others were injured and hundreds of PTI supporters were detained, including key PTI leaders.
Though the period between the arrest and release has highlighted the deepening political polarization in the country, some experts believe that the events of May 9 – which was declared as history’s dark chapter by the army – will have a negative impact on the PTI-establishment relationship.
Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat) President Ahmed Bilal Mehboob feels that “the events of 9th May following the arrest of Imran would have profound and adverse impact on the future relationship of the establishment and the PTI.”
The Pildat chief said the rampage of PTI supporters and their attack on military installations and properties will eventually harm the public standing of the party.
The inability of the security agencies for whatever reason to protect the symbols of the military might such as the GHQ, the Lahore Corpse Commander’s residence and other properties has also dented the image of the military’s invincibility.
 “Unless the perpetrators are quickly identified, prosecuted and punished, the wounds inflicted on May 9 will not heal,” he said.
Commenting on the arrest of Imran, Mehboob said the manner of arresting the PTI chief was inappropriate and it was correct on the part of the IHC to initiate judicial enquiry against the police and other agencies responsible for that.
However, he added, the SC decision to release Imran would give an opportunity to the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PMLN) and other ruling parties to claim that courts are applying double standards.
Abdul Moiz Jaferii, a lawyer and political analyst, said the government has been given an excuse to keep delaying elections. The development has also allowed the government to pit the establishment against Imran Khan directly.
Jaferii said the recent events have also proven to “the anti-Khan team” that they have very little options to shut him out of the political process because he is too popular to take a risk against.  “If polls were held tomorrow, the PTI would make a clean sweep.”
Though the government has lost much of its political capital after coming into power by ousting ex-premier Imran Khan through a vote of no-confidence in April 2022, it is still struggling to take advantage of the situation by undermining Khan’s credibility.
As the country heads to the next polls, the power politics-based brutal struggle among the political forces has raised questions about the future of democracy in the country.

3,Military quashes ‘baseless hearsay’ about martial law,ISPR says army united under command of COAS,"The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Maj-Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry refuted on Friday the rumours of imposition of martial law in the country, as mere “baseless hearsay”.
Talking to a private TV channel, the military spokesperson also rejected the rumours that several officers had resigned. He assured that the army was united under the leadership of Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Gen Asim Munir.
“There is no question of martial law,” Maj-Gen Chaudhry said. Army chief Gen Asim Munir and senior military leadership “wholeheartedly support democracy and will continue to do so,” he added.
The ISPR director general emphasised that “the army was, is and will remain united” under the leadership of Gen Munir despite the internal and external propaganda. “The dream of dividing it will remain a dream,” he said.
Maj-Gen Chaudhry categorically stated that no one in the army had resigned nor had any orders been defied. He reiterated that the army chief and the entire military leadership believed in democracy.
The army spokesperson’s statement has come at a time when the country is facing extreme polarisation coupled with political, economic and constitutional crises.
Meanwhile, amid speculations about martial law, talks of imposing a state of emergency have once again resurfaced, causing concerns among different sections of society that the government may be considering the option in order to gain control of the situation.
However, before the speculation could go any further, Federal Minister for Information Marriyum Aurangzeb rebutted the news regarding emergency. “The reports circulating in the media regarding the imposition of emergency in the country are baseless,” she said.
“No such decision was taken in the federal cabinet meeting,” the minister said in a statement. She urged the media to verify the facts before airing or publishing any news.
Despite the rebuttal, however, some observers pointed out that the information minister had only stated that “no decision regarding the imposition of emergency was taken in the cabinet meeting” but she did not rule out if the cabinet actually discussed the matter.

Later on, sources revealed that the cabinet, in fact, did discuss the option of emergency but several cabinet members opposed the idea. The ministers also opposed the idea of suspending mobile data service after the protestors took to the streets on May 9.
The discussion about the emergency is in line with the statements of several government ministers, who had stated that the option could be considered keeping in view the internal situation, as the army had to be called in to aid the civil administration the other day.
The army was called in to help the local administration and police in maintaining law and order in Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Islamabad, where protestors had attacked, ransacked and torched several government buildings after the arrest of Imran Khan.
Political observers said that article 232 of the Constitution allowed the president to declare state of emergency in case the country was threatened by war or external aggression, or by internal disturbance beyond the power of a provincial government to control.
They said that Article 232 (proclamation of emergency on account of war, internal disturbance, etc.) deals with governor’s rule but fulfilling its condition were not an easy task.
Article 232(1) states: “If the President is satisfied that a grave emergency exists in which the security of Pakistan, or any part thereof, is threatened by war or external aggression, or by internal disturbance beyond the power of a Provincial Government to control, he may issue a Proclamation of Emergency.”
It adds: “Provided that for imposition of emergency due to internal disturbances beyond the powers of a Provincial Government to control, a resolution from the Provincial Assembly of that Province shall be required.”
It continues: “Provided further that if the President acts on his own, the Proclamation of Emergency shall be placed before both Houses of Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament) for approval by each House within ten days.”
Though the army and the government spokespersons have refuted the speculations about imposition of martial law or the emergency, the situation remained tense in the country. The last time Pakistan was under a state of emergency was in 2007, during the tenure of former military dictator Pervez Musharraf.
From November 3 to December 15, the Constitution remained suspended and several judges, including the then chief justice of Pakistan Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry were detained.

4,Internet crawls as service restored after global outcry,Telecom firms suffer loss of Rs2.46 billion in revenue,"Despite the government’s claim of restoring mobile broadband across the country on Friday, the users faced difficulty in accessing social media platforms, including YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority had taken down the service on Tuesday night for security reasons after violent protests erupted following the arrest of PTI Chairman Imran Khan.
The shutdown resulted in a loss of economic productivity and digital services, including digital payments.
Owing to the suspension of the internet services, the telecommunication companies in Pakistan witnessed a loss of Rs2.46 billion in revenue, which also means a decrease of Rs861 million in tax revenue for the government as well.
According to an official of a telecom company, the mobile broadband services constitute around 60% of their total revenues. Therefore, on a daily-basis, they earn approximately Rs820 million. Additionally, the government receives around 35% of the revenue.
This calculation is based on the fact that the telecommunication companies earned roughly Rs500 billion from cellular services in the previous year. However, this is just an estimate from one industry. The overall economic loss to the country is likely to be massive.
The sudden suspension of the internet services, without a well-thought-out process, has caused life in the country to come to a standstill. The move has drawn widespread criticism from organisations like GSMA and Amnesty International. Many argue that this suspension is tantamount to a violation of fundamental rights.
The GSMA, a body that represents the interests of global mobile operators, etc., said that “alarmingly, the government has announced that the mobile internet shutdown is ‘indefinite’ which is a clear violation of the people’s right to access information and free expression”.
“The ban on the social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube also creates a permissive environment for other human rights violations under the darkness of the internet shutdown. The restrictions must be lifted immediately.” Rimmel Mohydin, regional campaigner at Amnesty International stated.
Today every aspect of the life in the country is connected with the online world. Businesses run their operations through online Enterprise Resource Management systems.
While the southern region, Sindh and Balochistan, and the side areas of the northern part of the country were relatively calm, they still experienced internet blockages.
The directive to halt the internet that came from the Ministry of Interior to the PTA was in violation of the law. The PTA comes under the Cabinet Division so any other authority should request the Cabinet Division to get the such job done.
""This was an important and big decision and therefore it should have been taken under a collective wisdom and not on the whims of a single minister,"" said an industry expert.
Experts in the ICT sector argue that law enforcement authorities, instead of working hard to control the situation, showed laziness by resorting to easy solutions that harmed the economy.
Under PTA Chairman Maj-Gen (retd) Amir Azeem Bajwa, the PTA has been functioning more like an extension of a law enforcement agency rather than a technology-related institution that should promote and encourage internet, technology, and innovation.
IT Minister Aminul Haq, in several speeches and media interviews, had disagreed with the PTA's behavior of restricting everything. He also expressed his disagreement when the PTA blocked Wikipedia and during a TV interview about the blanket internet blockage.
Head of Asia Pacific for the GSMA Julian Gorman wrote in a letter to the Minister of IT that they were concerned about the impact that the current restrictions are having on citizens and businesses in Pakistan.
“In today's digital societies, individuals and businesses rely on connectivity for their livelihoods and access to essential services and information.”
“Prolonged restrictions can also have far-reaching effects on citizens' health, education social and economic welfare,” Gorman said.
“In addition to the harm imposed on businesses, restrictions can have a knocked on credit and investment plans, ultimately damaging the country's reputation for managing the economy and foreign investment,” he said.
Rimmel Mohydin, a regional campaigner at Amnesty International, called for urgent action to de-escalate the situation in Pakistan following violent protests, multiple deaths, and mass arrests.
Mohydin stated that the authorities should aim to defuse the situation and use no more force than necessary and proportionate. “Amnesty International urges Pakistani authorities to use minimum force and avoid the use of firearms to disperse protestors.”
Mohydin also expressed concern over the indefinite ban on mobile internet, which violates people's right to access information and free expression. The ban on social media platforms creates a permissive environment for other human rights violations. Therefore, the restrictions must be lifted immediately.
Meanwhile, the Sindh High Court (SHC) issued notices to the PTA, federal government and others on a petition against suspension and restriction of internet services across the country. A two-member bench headed by SHC Chief Justice Justice Ahmad Ali Shaikh heard the petition against suspension and restriction of internet services across the country.
On Thursday, the head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee also urged the Pakistani government to immediately restore internet services across the country and reduce tensions.
“I support de-escalation efforts and call for the immediate restoration of public access to internet services,” Senator Bob Menendez, on behalf of the committee, wrote in a statement issued on the body’s officials social media accounts.
“These shutdowns dangerously suppress the Pakistani people’s freedoms, including access to information,” he continued.
The committee expressed its concerns over the recent developments in Pakistan, saying that it was “closely monitoring” them.
Earlier on Thursday, US State Department spokesperson Vedant Patel, in response to a question during a press briefing, termed the shutdown of the internet in Pakistan as a violation of the right to access information.
He added that the issues of human rights and press freedom were taken up with Pakistan. Responding to a query about the ongoing unrest in Pakistan, Patel said the US was closely monitoring the situation in the country.

5,Police-PTI workers clash,Police say protestors set vehicle ablaze; clashes reported as security personnel fire tear gas to disperse crowd,"Clashes broke out between police and the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) supporters at several places on the Srinagar Highway during the appearance of former prime minister and party Chairman Imran Khan at the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Friday.
Several PTI workers, who had come out to express their solidarity with Imran, were arrested by the police from the Srinagar Highway and from outside the IHC for violating the Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC).
The PTI workers were stopped by the police at different locations, leading to the clashes. The police prevented them from gathering in the wake of the imposition of the Section 144 in Islamabad, which banned the gathering of five or more people.
To disperse the PTI workers around the high court, the police fired tear gas shells and detained several workers from outside the court. They also arrested a number of activists who had gathered near the Srinagar Highway in G-10 Sector of the federal capital.
The PTI had called on workers from different cities across the country to gather at Highway in G-13 sector to welcome Imran following his release from the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) custody on the order of the Supreme Court.
On the instruction of the apex court, Imran appeared in the IHC to seek bail. When the police arrived reached the spot on the highway, a large number of workers started throwing stones, leading to clashes with the police that continued for seven hours.
During the clashes, police shells hit residential buildings, causing tear gas to enter various houses and affected civilians. According to an Islamabad Police statement, miscreants damaged government properties in the G-13 sector.

6,Imran gets blanket IHC bail relief,Court bars arrest of PTI chief in any case till May 15,"The Islamabad High Court on Friday stopped the authorities from arresting PTI chairman and former prime minister Imran Khan in any case, including undisclosed ones, filed against him anywhere in the country till May 15 (Monday).
The IHC bench also granted protective bail to him in three terrorism cases filed against him in Lahore and the murder case of PTI activist Zillay Shah alias Ali Bilal.
Earlier in the day, a separate IHC bench granted the PTI chief interim bail for two weeks in the Al-Qadir Trust case.
The development comes a day after the Supreme Court termed his arrest in the Al-Qadir Trust case as “invalid and unlawful”.
On Tuesday this week, dozens of troops of paramilitary Rangers broke into an office of the IHC and whisked Imran away in an armoured vehicle in a whirlwind raid while executing the arrest warrant issued against the former premier by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) in the Al-Qadir Trust case.
IHC CJ Aamer Farooq formed a two-judge bench -- comprising Justice Miangul Hasan Aurangzeb and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz -- to hear Imran’s bail plea in the Al-Qadir Trust case.
As the hearing commenced, a lawyer stood up and chanted slogans in favour of the ousted premier. Expressing its displeasure, the division bench noted that there should be complete silence, with Justice Miangul warning that the case would not be heard if such acts continued.
The court then took a break for Friday prayers.
When the hearing resumed, Imran stood up and requested everyone to listen to the proceedings quietly.
He alleged that an individual “had been planted” to disrupt the proceedings earlier.
Reacting to his remark, Advocate General Islamabad Barrister Jahangir Khan Jadoon raised an objection and questioned why the PTI chief was levelling allegations.
“Jadoon sb, I am sorry but I did not say anything about you,” replied Imran.
Khwaja Haris, representing the PTI chief, came to the rostrum and said  his client had written to NAB for a copy of the inquiry in the Al-Qadir Trust case.
“We came to know through the media that the inquiry has been converted into an investigation,” Haris maintained.
The lawyer added that the manner in which the inquiry was converted into an investigation, the aim was to “arrest Imran immediately”.
Haris continued that NAB could convert an inquiry into an investigation only if there was sufficient evidence.
“A notice was sent to me on March 2 to which I replied,” he said, adding that in his response, he informed the anti-graft body that the notice was not sent as per the requirements of the National Accountability Ordinance, 1999.
Haris further argued that NAB had to inform the individual whether the summons was as an accused or as a witness.
He added that if a person had been summoned as an accused, the bureau was supposed to explain the charges.
The court then inquired if NAB had sent a questionnaire to the PTI counsel.
To this, Haris replied that he had not received a questionnaire.
However, he told the bench that had sought further information.
He added that in the Toshakhana (gift depository) case, a notice was sent to him in the same manner and he had challenged it in the same court.
“This court declared these notices illegal,” said Haris.
The lawyer maintained that Imran was arrested, and an inquiry report was  provided later.
However, on April 28, the inquiry was converted into an investigation.
Advocate General Islamabad Jadoon then commenced his arguments and said that he would not discuss the merits of the case, but read Article 245 of the Constitution instead.
“The high court cannot hear a case in an area where the army has been summoned under Article 245,” he added.
Expressing its displeasure, the bench asked the AG Islamabad if the court should do away with all writ petitions because of Article 245.
Justice Aurangzeb then questioned if martial law had been imposed.
To this, Jadoon replied the army was called to aid in the restoration of law and order following violent protests.
The court then summoned NAB Prosecutor Sardar Muzaffar Abbasi to the rostrum.
Abbasi informed the bench that Imran had never appeared before the bureau.
The NAB prosecutor further informed the court that former accountability czar Shahzad Akbar was also sent a notice but he did not join the inquiry.
The court then granted the PTI chief two weeks interim bail and barred NAB from arresting him.
The NAB prosecutor tried to talk further but was told by Justice Aurangzeb to remain quiet as the court had announced the order.
The court in its order also stated that the ousted premier should not be arrested in any case, registered in Islamabad after May 9, till May 17.
It also said that it would decide whether the PTI chief's bail should be cancelled or extended at the next hearing.
Later, IHC’s Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri granted Imran protective bail in three terrorism cases filed against him in Lahore for 11 days against surety bonds worth Rs50,000 each.
Justice Jahangiri also granted protective bail to the PTI chief in the murder case of Zillay Shah – a PTI activist who was killed during a party rally in Lahore earlier this year -- against surety bonds worth Rs50,000 until May 22.
The judge barred the police from arresting the ousted premier and directed him to appear in the relevant court in Lahore after a period of 11 days.
The IHC also halted the proceedings of the Toshakhana case against Imran in the trial court till June 8.
IHC CJ Farooq heard the case filed by the former prime minister in this connection.
At the outset of the hearing, Imran  lawyer Haris argued that the complaint was filed in the trial court by an unauthorised authority.
The case was filed by the district election commissioner while the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had not authorised anyone to file the case.
Therefore, Haris contended that the case was not maintainable.
The IHC CJ asked him whether or not there were more identical applications against the interim order and if the instant case should be heard as the main one.
Haris replied the PTI legal team had also raised the objection that the matter should be heard first by a magistrate.
After hearing the arguments, the court halted the proceedings in the Toshakhana case till June 8 and adjourned the hearing.
The trial court has already indicted Imran in the Toshakhana case. The ECP had disqualified the former prime minister for not disclosing the details of gifts retained from the Toshakhana and a criminal case was lodged against him before a lower court.
During the recess, Imran told the media that this was his country and people, as he advised them to remain peaceful.
He assured the media that he had obtained bail “in all cases” and could not be arrested.
The former prime minister further said he had full confidence in the chief justice of Pakistan.
Recalling his arrest earlier this week, the PTI chief said he was assaulted with a baton but maintained that NAB’s “behaviour was fine” during his detention.
“I had warned of a reaction,” said Imran referring to his arrest. “How can I be held responsible [for the violence] if I was under custody,” he added.
Elaborating further, the PTI chief said he was inside the premises of the IHC when he was rounded up and “they [Rangers personnel] had no justification” for the act.
Imran maintained that he was “abducted” and was shown the warrant for his arrest while in custody. “This is the law of the jungle,” he continued.
It looks as if martial law has been declared,” said the former premier.
“Who will control the people if I am imprisoned? If I remain outside, I will be able to control the people,” Imran maintained.
Prior to the start of the hearing, the PTI chief said that he could be arrested again, adding that he was allowed to talk to his wife Bushra Bibi.
When asked for confirmation that he had reached a ‘deal’, Imran smiled but stayed silent.
The former premier reached the IHC amid tight security. On his arrival, a large number of lawyers gathered outside the IHC premises and raised slogans in support of the PTI chief.
The hearing in Courtroom No. 1 commenced after the premises were checked by the Bomb Disposal Squad (BDS) and cleared by security officials.
Imran’s counsel, Babar Awan, talking with the media outside the IHC, said that the PTI chief’s “life is in danger”.
He maintained that there were certain people who feared that if Imran was released, their jobs would be at risk. “That is why the Punjab police have come from Lahore,” he added.
The PTI chief finally left the IHC premises for his Zaman Park residence in Lahore following hours-long delay because of “security concerns”.
The deposed premier faced an unexpected delay in his departure from the IHC as shelling outside the court’s premises created a tense atmosphere.
However, Imran had issued an ultimatum to the administration, demanding the immediate clearance of the route.
Inside the courtroom, the Director General of Security approached Imran  and informed him about the ongoing shelling on Srinagar Highway, emphasising that the route was not safe for him to leave at that moment. The DIG security requested the PTI chief to remain inside the court for his own safety.
In response to the warning, Imran Khan expressed his view, saying: “If you take me out, the intensity of the shelling will decrease. The longer you keep me waiting here, it will only escalate. Once the news spreads that I have left, the situation will naturally come to an end.”
As tensions rose outside the IHC, the Rangers personnel swiftly positioned themselves after the gunfire. The police reported that the protesters also resorted to throwing a petrol bomb, further escalating the already volatile situation.
Earlier, Imran had raised concerns about the presence of a significant number of Rangers  personnel within the court premises. Following his objections, the paramilitary force was subsequently removed from the area.

7,Rs3.93 electric shock for Karachiites,NEPRA jacks up K-E tariff on account of FCA for March this year,"The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Thursday notified a Rs3.93 per unit increase in the power tariff for K-Electric consumers on account of fuel cost adjustment (FCA) for the month of March 2023.
K-Electric had sought an increase of Rs4.49 per unit. The Nepra decision would reflect in the power bill of May 2023. The power regulator noted that a power purchase agreement was signed between the National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC) and K-Electric on January 26, 2010 for five years for the sale or buying of 650MW on basket rates.
Subsequently, a decision was made by the Council of Common Interests (CCI) in its meeting on November 8, 2012 in connection with the modalities for the withdrawal of electricity from the NTDCL by the petitioner, wherein it was decided to reduce the supply of energy by 300MW from the company to K-Electric.
However, the decision of the CCI had been impugned by the way of suits and petitions by K-Electric in the Sindh High Court in Karachi.

No new agreement had been signed between K-Electric and the NTDCL till date.
K-Electric was continuing to draw energy from the national grid, which at present was around 1,100MW.
The city’s power utility, in its adjustment requests, had certified that it despatched as per economic merit order from its own generation units -- with the available fuel resources -- and import from external sources.
It also certified that the cost of fuel and power purchase claims did not include any amount of late payment surcharge, mark-up or interest.
Tanveer Barry, a commentator, raised concerns about the high FCAs during the summer of 2023.
K-Electric responded that with the inclusion of Bin Qasim Power Station 3 (BQPS-III), the overall generation cost would reduce.
Imran Shahid, another commentator, submitted that K-Electric should not be operating inefficient plants, which had outlived their lives and were resulting in higher generation cost.
K-Electric, while responding to the comments, maintained that it had improved its overall generation fleet efficiency to 48% over the last 15 years.
It claimed that BQPS-I unit 1 and unit 2 would be decommissioned after three months and units 5 and 6 would only be operated if they fell in the economic merit order to meet the load requirement.
While going through the information provided by K-Electric about the fuel cost from its own power plants, the power regulator observed that the cost of BQPS-III had been worked out using an auxiliary of 2.047% based on higher heating value (HHV) combined cycle efficiency of 6,381 British thermal unit (BTU) per kilowatt hour (kWh) at 100% load.
This resulted in a total cost of Rs5,543.23 million for the operation of BQPS-III on re-gasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG) in the current month and that was accordingly being allowed.
The cost was being allowed strictly on a provisional basis, subject to final determination of price, etc.
The power regulator observed that K-Electric was being directed to provide CV test reports for two power plants.
K-Electric submitted CV test report of Tapal and Gul Ahmed from the Hydrocarbon Development Institute of Pakistan (HDIP) and SGS laboratories to Nepra.
It used the average of the two reports in the FCA request.
The authority had considered the higher of the two CVs, which resulted in negative adjustment of Rs748,353 and Rs1,799,057 for Tapal and Gul Ahmed power plants, respectively.
On the cost of energy purchased from the Central Power Purchasing Agency-Guarantee (CPPA-G) during the current month, K-Electric used the rate of Rs9.8860 per kWh.
However, the authority’s approved fuel cost component, in the matter of XWDISCOs for the current month, was Rs9.5039/kWh.
K-Electric had claimed a negative impact of Rs.242.43 million on account of billing correction made by the Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) in connection with the quota of indigenous gas and the RLNG delivered during the month of February 2023.
The power regulator adjusted the cost in the decision. It said any further adjustment on that account would be made subsequently.
The power regulator carried out an in-house analysis of the data provided by K-Electric for the month to work out the financial impact because of the deviation from the economic merit order..
About the financial impact because of the underutilisation of efficient plants, including the Korangi Combined Cycle Power Plant (KCCP), Korangi Gas Engine Power Station (KGTPS) and Site Gas Engine Power Station (SGTPS) on account of low gas pressure, a letter was issued to K-Electric on September 16, 2021.
It was directed to resolve its low gas pressure and quantity issues within 30 days.
In response, K-Electric informed the regulator that it was in the process of resolving the low gas pressure issue. However, it added that certain meetings with stakeholders would take place in due course of time.
As of now, no gas supply agreement had been finalised between K-Electric and the SSGC despite the directions of the authority.
Furthermore, an amount of Rs1.42 million had been provisionally withheld for out-of-merit despatch given to Lotte on March 15 and 16, 2023.
