0,Rs975b power subsidies proposed,Energy ministry had demanded Rs1.54 trillion - 70% more than this year’s revised budget,"The Ministry of Finance has refused to pay for the cost of inefficiency or for clearing arrears of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) energy projects and has instead proposed subsidies worth over Rs975 billion for the power sector, 37% less than the money demanded.
Sources say, after a meeting between the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Energy, the Q-Block has recommended over Rs975 billion in power subsidies for fiscal year 2023-24, starting from July. The recommended funds will mostly cover the cost of difference between consumer price and generation cost, and subsidies for Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).
At this point in time, the finance ministry has not entertained the Power Division’s demand for Rs200 billion in CPEC arrears, said the sources, adding that the ministry has, however, agreed to give Rs48 billion to clear up to 87% of the current power generation bills of the CPEC power plants.
It is to note that the outstanding CPEC dues are one of the irritants in the way of smooth Pak-China economic relations.
Additionally, the finance ministry did not allocate any funds to bear the cost of inefficiency witnessed in Quetta Electricity Supply Company (QESCO) and in the AJK areas. Funds for the Kissan package, exporters subsidies and to compensate for the inefficiencies of the energy ministry, due to its failure to collect due electricity bills from the federal and the provincial government, have also not been proposed.
The Ministry of Energy had demanded Rs1.54 trillion in power subsidies for the next fiscal year, a colossal amount that is 70% more than this year’s revised budget. The demand was surprising since the government has twice increased electricity tariffs in the outgoing fiscal year in order to reduce subsidies and control circular debt.
The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) led coalition government has already increased electricity tariffs twice; first in July last year and then in February this year.
The proposed subsidies are Rs563 billion, or 37%, less than the initial amount demand by the energy ministry. The offered amount, however, is still Rs70 billion or 8% higher than the upward revised power sector subsidies for the current fiscal year.
Sources have said that the Rs975 billion figure is not yet final, as the matter is expected to be taken up with the finance minister and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
There are, however, transparency and accuracy related concerns about electricity subsidy claims for the erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and the domestic and agricultural consumers of Balochistan. The Power Division had demanded subsidies worth Rs48 billion for the ex-FATA areas but the Ministry of Finance has offered Rs25 billion, with another Rs14 billion is committed to clear electricity arrears.
Since the federally administered areas have been merged with Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) there is a need to end unlimited power subsidies. The federal government has also been picking up the additional cost to end any disparities in the economic development of the area.
The Ministry of Energy had demanded Rs164 billion as price differential subsidy for the government-run power distribution companies but the finance ministry has indicated fund worth Rs150 billion.
Apart from that, Rs170 billion is being indicated to pick up the cost of subsidies for K-Electric consumers. Similarly, Rs7 billion has been indicated to settle the arrears of the prime minister’s Industrial Support Package for KE consumers in the next fiscal year.
The finance ministry has not committed Rs195 billion requested as a special subsidy for QESCO on account of tube-wells. It has also not indicated any funds for the cost of inefficiency of the distribution company. The power division has demanded Rs65 billion as the price differential subsidy on account of less recoveries from the consumers.
The federal government has been paying its share of agriculture tube-well subsidies but the Ministry of Energy is unable to instil efficiency in the distribution company.
The ministry also sought a staggering Rs102 billion to clear arrears of AJK consumers who are already availing highly subsidised electricity. The energy ministry seems reluctant to implement a decision to charge the electricity tariffs from the AJK consumers applicable in other parts of the country. The finance ministry, however, has proposed only Rs55 billion. Against another demand of Rs62 billion for the AJK subsidy -an amount of Rs25 billion has been proposed by the finance ministry.
Strangely, the Ministry of Energy had demanded a subsidy worth Rs47 billion to clear the backlog of the federal government and the provincial governments’ bills. The finance ministry has refused these funds.
Subsidies worth Rs262 billion has been indicated to pay the dues of private power producers under a three-year-old deal.

1,Malaysia migrants in limbo as promised jobs fall through,"Vulnerable to fake recruiters, South Asian migrants stranded without work for months","Stranded without work for months, hundreds of South Asian migrants in Malaysia say they are losing hope after failing to find jobs promised to them by recruitment agents in exchange for thousands of dollars in fees.
At a students’ dormitory about 40 km (25 miles) from the capital, Kuala Lumpur, about 500 migrants – mostly young men from Nepal and Bangladesh who had arrived in Malaysia since December – spend their days in crowded rooms or at an open-air cafeteria.
They say they arrived in the country on a three-month work visa that was meant to be upgraded to a work permit, but never was. Because their legal status is unclear, they are afraid to leave the premises, the workers told Reuters at the facility where they are staying.
Many say recruitment agents took their passports and continue to promise them jobs.
“We are all depressed and helpless. We already paid a huge amount for the job. How can I pay that back if I do not have a job?” a Nepali migrant at the dormitory told Reuters.
The 23-year-old, who declined to be identified for fear of backlash from recruitment agents, signed a two-year contract with a Malaysian cleaning company but has not started work. He said he, like others there, had borrowed 300,000 Nepali rupees ($2,300) to pay an agent for the job. He was promised a monthly salary of 2,062 ringgit ($464.94) per month.
The workers at the facility all tell similar stories: upon arriving in Malaysia, recruiting agencies told them no jobs were immediately available and took them to accommodation facilities to wait. They were then told they would eventually be employed; in the meantime, they must pay for their own food without a salary.
It is unclear how the workers ended up without jobs despite arriving in Malaysia with employment contracts and promises that their temporary work visas would become permanent on arrival. Malaysia last month launched an investigation.
Puncak Jupiter Management Services and Star Domain Resources, listed as employers on some of the workers’ travel documents, did not respond to requests for comment. Amial International, one of the recruitment agencies the workers used, did not respond to requests for comment.

2,Businessmen reject politics of violence,"Pakistan’s business community has already been suffering due to a ban on imports, including raw materials","The business community has spoken out against the politics of violence in Pakistan, warning that such actions by “disgruntled, unscrupulous elements” will inflict further harm on the economy.
Talking to a delegation of industrialists and traders, Coordinator to Federal Tax Ombudsman, Meher Kashif Younis said the prevailing poor state of the economy cannot afford political instability. Younis emphasised that political stability is crucial for sustainable economic growth and development, stating that “politics of confrontation and violence” will only give birth to chaos and serve the nefarious designs of foreign masters. He urged the country’s mainstream political parties to resolve their differences through peaceful means for the sake of the nation.
Pakistan’s business community has already been suffering due to a ban on imports, including raw materials, which has slowed down economic growth, he said, stressing that the country cannot afford any more economic setbacks caused by political instability.
“Our duty is to protect the geographical frontiers, fortify solidarity and cement sovereignty,” said Younis. He emphasised the importance of upholding the rule of law, the supremacy of the constitution, and the promotion of a democratic system of government.

3,"SMEs critical to economy, food security","LCCI for shifting focus to SMEs, which account for 90% of industries","Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of the economy and the engine of growth, but they need support and facilitation to become game-changers in the transition towards economic stability of the country. This was the central message of the seminar on “Empowering SMEs with Sustainable Business Solutions,” jointly organised by the Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) and Scalling up Nutrition (SUN) Business Network Pakistan (SBN).
The event provided a platform for stakeholders to share the findings of a study recently conducted by GAIN and SBN on mapping, connecting, and strengthening relevant SMEs and entrepreneur support organisations.
LCCI President Kashif Anwar emphasised the need to shift the focus to the SME sector, which accounts for over 90% of industries and SMEs in Pakistan. He said that SMEs not only form the backbone of the economy but also help the large-scale manufacturing sector to play its due role.
The seminar highlighted the significance of the private sector in the food value chain and discussed the Enabling Business to Advance Nutrition Index (EBANI), an innovative advocacy tool designed by GAIN and SBN to enable the private sector to contribute to advancing positive nutrition outcomes. The event also presented the findings of the “Map, Connect, and Strengthen SMEs” study that assessed the technical and financial needs of the SMEs and SME Service Providers.
The co-chair of SBN and country coordinator mentioned that SBN Pakistan supports businesses to produce and increase the access and availability of affordable, safe, and nutritious foods to consumers, especially low-income consumers.

4,PSX poised to launch new trading system,"New system is expected to boost stock market, attract investment","The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) is set to launch a new technologically advanced trading system on Monday, May 15, 2023, according to a notification released by PSX Company Secretary Dr Fakhara Rizwan on Thursday. The new system is expected to improve security features to better safeguard investors’ data and resolve complaints about data leakages and theft.
The first version of the new trading and surveillance platform, called Designated Time Schedule (DTS), was launched one-and-a-half years ago in October 2021 but was quickly replaced by the old trading platform (KATS/Karachi Automated Trading System) due to hardware and software mismatch. Since then, PSX has been working to improve the infrastructure, hardware, and software to successfully launch the new system this time around.
The new trading system, which was purchased from the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE) for $2.85 million, has a built-in surveillance system capable of preventing and detecting data leakages and theft attempts. It can also conclude trading sessions (the full-session calculations and compilation of trading data at the end of the session) in just 30 seconds, compared to 30 minutes required with the current KATS/Karachi Automated Trading System.
The new system will now fully replace KATS – a system that has remained in operations since 1997. While PSX kept updating the older system, it has now become outdated and requires replacement. PSX’s former chairman Sulaiman S Mehdi had previously stated that the new system would connect PSX with three Chinese international stock markets, including the SZSE, Shanghai, and Hong Kong exchanges.
“The linkage will allow cross-listing of companies and attract foreign investment in each other’s stocks,” hoped Mehdi.
In Jan 2017, a Chinese consortium, which included the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange, acquired a 40% stake in PSX at Rs28 per share.
PSX had shortlisted two global stock markets to buy the new trading and surveillance system, including the London Stock Exchange. However, the SZSE was selected for the purchase due to its competitive pricing and advanced features. The new system is expected to further boost stock market and attract foreign investment.

5,Point-of-sale transactions plunge following protests,"Slump due to mobile broadband suspension, lower footfall at stores","Point-of-sale (POS) transactions routed through the main digital payment systems in Pakistan fell by around 50% the day after former prime minister Imran Khan’s arrest ignited countrywide protests and prompted authorities to shut down mobile internet services, data showed on Thursday.
The reason for the slump was primarily the mobile broadband suspension, in addition to lower footfall at the limited number of stores opened due to the political turmoil, the two largest payments system operators, 1LINK and Habib Bank Limited (HBL), told Reuters.
The violent protests that followed Khan’s arrest on Tuesday by the anti-graft agency have hit commercial activity hard.
Mobile data services have remained shut since Tuesday night on the orders of the interior ministry – the longest such continuous shutdown in the country.
Data shared with Reuters by 1LINK on POS through its platform showed international payment card transactions were down on Wednesday by 45% in volume, from a daily average of 127,000 during the week from May 1 to 7 to approximately 68,000 on May 10.
The daily value of transactions using international payment cards was down 46%, from Rs606 million ($2.14 million) to Rs330 million ($1.16 million) on May 10.
1LINK is the major facilitator of POS digital payment transactions for international platforms such as Visa and Mastercard.
Transactions on the domestic payment scheme, PayPak, were down 52% in volume to 18,000 transactions on Wednesday, and 56% down in value to roughly Rs62 million ($218,775).
Ali Habib, spokesperson at HBL, said that it had seen a decline of 60% in the throughput of POS machines. “HBL processes over 30% of the entire throughput of the POS machines in Pakistan. This is the largest share in the market,” he added.
Many retailers and industrialists have also said their activities had ground to a halt since the protests started on Tuesday.
On Tuesday, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) suspended mobile broadband services across the country.

6,Auto sector posts lowest sales since Covid,"PAMA reports car sales of only 4,500 units, down 52% MoM and 80% YoY","Pakistan’s automotive industry has suffered yet another setback as the country recorded its lowest monthly car sales in April 2023 since the Covid lockdown. With the ongoing economic meltdown, the decline has been attributed to a combination of seasonal slowdown during the month of Ramazan, lower working days due to Eid holidays, and non-availability of Completely Knocked Down (CKD) parts owing to Letters of Credit (LCs) issues.
According to Topline Research Auto Analyst Sunny Kumar, “Pakistan has recorded the lowest monthly car sales in April-2023 since the Covid-19 lockdown.”
Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers Association (PAMA) reported car sales of only 4,500 units, down 52% month-on-month (MoM) and 80% year-on-year (YoY). This marks the lowest monthly sales since May 2020 during the Covid-19 lockdown. Including non-PAMA members’ car sales, it clocked in at around 5,500, down 47% MoM.
“The MoM decline is primarily due to a seasonal slowdown witnessed in Ramazan, shorter working days amid Eid holidays, and the non-availability of CKD parts due to LC issues,” said Kumar, adding that this takes the ten months of FY2023 sales to 114,868 units, down 50% YoY, primarily attributable to the non-availability of CKDs, escalating car prices, expensive auto financing, and the low purchasing power of consumers.
“Sales volumes decreased significantly across all segments, with the passenger car segment showing the largest decline,” said Maaz Azam, auto analyst at Optimus Capital Management. The primary reason for this sharp decline is due to depleted demand and order book, rather than import restrictions, as inventory levels increased despite non-production days (NPDs) being observed by auto players. The only segments that remained stable were tractors and two-wheelers, with a MoM change of 8% and -2%, respectively, he said.
Honda Atlas Car (HCAR) has recorded the highest decline of 75% MoM to 207 units in April 2023, led by a decline in sales of the City and Civic by 74% MoM. Similarly, Pak Suzuki (PSMC) also posted a decline of 74% MoM to 1,474 units primarily due to the reasons mentioned above. Hyundai sales were also down 13% MoM, where the Elantra was down 37% MoM to 119 units and Tuscon down 17% MoM to 315 units in April 2023. However, Indus Motors recorded an increase of 2% MoM to 1,948 units in April 2023 due to the availability of CKD parts.
Amongst tractors, Millat Tractors (MTL) recorded a decline of 55% MoM to 1,206 units in April 2023, while Al Ghazi Tractors (AGTL) recorded a six-fold jump in its sales to 2,005 units in April 2023. This takes the total tractor industry sales to 24,444 units in ten months of FY2023, down 47% YoY due to the floods, plant shutdown, lower consumer buying power, and higher prices. 
akistan bike sales were down 3% MoM and 46% YoY in April 2023. Atlas Honda (ATLH) recorded sales of 73,500 units, up 2% MoM while down 36% YoY. Trucks and buses sales were down 51% MoM and 68% YoY to 152 units in April 2023. This takes sales for the first ten months of FY 2023 to 3,534 units down 35% YoY primarily due to a drop in transportation activity and a slowdown in the economy.
The current situation in the auto industry is worrisome, and the stakeholders are looking for ways to address the issues. The non-availability of CKD parts due to LC issues is a significant concern that needs to be resolved. The escalating car prices and expensive auto financing have also contributed to the decline in sales, and the low purchasing power of consumers is another factor.
“The automobile industry will remain under pressure amidst a challenging business environment, skyrocketing inflation and higher financing rates – all of which are further exacerbated by the shortage of CKD kits,” said Asad Ali, Auto Sector Analyst at Insight Securities.

7,Forex reserves fall by $74m to $4.4b,SBP cites external debt repayment as reason for decrease,"The foreign exchange reserves held by the central bank fell by 1.7% on a week-on-week basis to $4.4 billion, according to data released by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Thursday.
On May 5, 2023, the SBP’s foreign currency reserves stood at $4,383.4 million, down by $74 million as compared to $4,457.2 million on April 28. The central bank attributed the decrease in foreign exchange reserves to external debt repayment.
Overall, the liquid foreign currency reserves held by the country, including the net reserves held by banks other than the SBP, stood at $9,990.4 million. The net reserves held by banks amounted to $5,607 million.
Ismail Iqbal Securities Head of Research Fahad Rauf has said that any significant improvement in Pakistan’s foreign currency reserves depends on the revival of International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) loan programme and inflow of fresh financing from other multilateral and bilateral creditors.
“They (FX reserves) are projected to rise to around $7-8 billion by the end of current fiscal year on June 30, 2023,” he said.
