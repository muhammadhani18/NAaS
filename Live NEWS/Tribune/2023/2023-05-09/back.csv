1,PM calls out Imran for 'maligning state institutions',"Shehbaz says PTI chief’s politics is defined by lies, U-turns and using religion for political gains","Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Tuesday the politics of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman and former prime minister Imran Khan, was defined by his blatant lies, maligning the army without proof and using religion for political gains.
Shehbaz took to the twitter in response to a social media post of Imran, in which the PTI chairman sought answers to his questions from the prime minister. Shehbaz said Imran should answer his questions.
“I have no doubt that your [Imran Khan’s] politics is defined by blatant lies, untruths, U-turns, and vicious attacks on institutions,” Shehbaz said in his tweet, posing counter-questions to Imran.
I have no doubt that your politics is defined by blatant lies, untruths, U-turns, and vicious attacks on institutions. Bending the judiciary to your whims and behaving as if rules don’t apply to you. What I said about you in my tweet is established by facts over the past few… https://t.co/SEi3HRj19m
He added that Imran, while on a trial for corruption, was claiming legitimacy to overturn the legal and political system. “Bending the judiciary to your whims and behaving as if rules don’t apply to you,” he said.
On Monday, Imran said in his tweet that he was asking the prime minister to answer his questions in the wake of “two assassination attempts” on him “in the last few months”.
He asked whether he [Imran] had the right to nominate those, he felt, were responsible for assassination attempts, and why the country’s premier intelligence agency took over the Judicial Complex in Islamabad on the eve of his appearance there on March 18.
Shehbaz said on the microblogging website that maligning the Pakistan Army as an institution was a recurring pattern in Imran’s politics following his removal from the government in April last year.
Referring to the gun attack on Imran in November last year, Shehbaz asked: “Did you not resort to constant mud-slinging of the leadership of the army & intelligence agency much before the Wazirabad attack?”

He pointed out that the PTI chief refused the government’s offer of cooperation and boycotted the legal proceedings, adding that Imran was never interested in finding the truth about the attack but used the condemnable incident for petty political objectives.
“What legal route did you adopt other than hurling threats & making baseless allegations almost on a daily basis?” the prime minister posed another question to the former prime minister.
“At whose behest a savage social media campaign against the martyrs of the armed forces was launched after the helicopter crash [last year]. Which party did the troll brigade belong to that mocked the martyrs,” he asked.
Continuing, the prime minister said that maligning the martyrs was a new low and “unimaginable in our politics” and culture. “With these subversive and treacherous acts on your part, do we need an enemy?” he said.
Shehbaz asked: “Who used religion for political purposes by describing the political agitation in religious terms, a cunning and self-serving attempt at exposing political opponents to violence at the hands of your supporters.”
He said that PTI leaders “condoned, justified, and even celebrated” the harassment and intimidation of an official delegation, including a female minister, in the courtyard of Prophet’s Mosque (Peace be upon Him) by “disregarding all norms of reverence”.
In response to Imran’s assertion that “it is time … to declare law of the jungle”, Shehbaz said: “I advise you not to go there, for the facts are often bitter and disastrous. Let us keep this for another day,” he said.

3,Tariq Afridi case lands in SC,Justice Minallah asks how NA committee rejects JCP nomination based on intelligence reports,"A case related to rejection of the nomination of a judge to a provincial high court by the Parliamentary Committee on Judges’ Appointment has landed in the Supreme Court.
The committee in July 2019 rejected a proposal of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) to appoint Advocate Tariq Afridi as an additional judge of the Peshawar High Court (PHC) allegedly on the basis of the reports submitted by intelligence agencies.
Afridi had later approached the apex court against the decision of the committee and a three-judge Supreme Court bench led by Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial took up the petition on Monday.
Justice Athar Minallah, a member of the bench, asked how intelligence agencies could control the process of appointment of judges. “This will affect independence of the judiciary,” he noted.
“The parliamentary committee, instead of looking at the professional expertise of the judge, relied on the reports of intelligence agencies,” Justice Minallah said.
The CJP observed that the court will discuss the legal aspects of the matter. He asked if the Parliamentary Committee on Judges’ Appointment could reject the recommendations of the JCP.
The bench later asked the Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) to assist the court in the matter as it adjourned the hearing till next month.
The JCP is a commission responsible for appointing judges to the Supreme Court and provincial high courts. The CJP heads the commission.
According to the SC website, the recommendations of the JCP with regard to appointing judges to the superior courts are sent to the parliamentary committee.
“The committee after receipt of [the JCP] nomination…may confirm the nominee by majority of its total membership within 14 days, failing which the nomination shall be deemed to have been confirmed.”

In a bid to offset the impact of the rupee devaluation on Pakistan’s foreign missions, the ECC approved Rs8.4 billion supplementary grant in favour of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to meet its shortfall in the annual budget for the current financial year 2022-2023.
After the fresh approval, the budget of the ministry will jump to Rs35.8 billion for the current fiscal year. The original budget estimates were based on an exchange rate of Rs186 to a dollar.
The ECC approved Rs13.2 billion supplementary grant for the Pakistan Mortgage Refinance Company Limited (PMRCL) equivalent to $50 million to be obtained from the World Bank as the first tranche of credit line of $85 million.

The WB provided $225 million loan to the PMRC at a concessional rate of 3%. In order to release the $50 million loan tranche, Rs14.2 billion local rupee cover was needed but only Rs1 billion had been allocated in the budget.
The ECC also approved a rupee cover of Rs7.84 billion against an amount of $33.1 million for the WB funded Financial Inclusion and Infrastructure Project (FIIP) project.
It approved Rs5 billion grant for the erstwhile Fata area projects. The Ministry of Planning had approved additional allocation of Rs5 billion under the 10-year development plan, which will be utilised for solar and tube-well schemes in areas recommended by the coalition government parties.

Speaking to the media outside the Supreme Court (SC), he said the apex court was hearing a case regarding a law which had not yet been adopted by parliament.
""The parliament is the supreme law-making authority and all other state institutions derive their power from it. It is unconstitutional to stop it from framing the law,"" he added.

8,Rabbani questions PAC’s authority,Senator raises objections against committees power to investigate SC judge's wealth,"Former Senate Chairman Raza Rabbani of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) raised objection on Monday to the decision of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) to investigate the wealth of a Supreme Court judge.
In a statement, the PPP senator said that PAC would be out of its jurisdiction if it inquired into an individual judge’s wealth. He added that the committee could take up other matters related to finances of the institution of the Supreme Court.
“Parliament ought not to do what the law or the Constitution, 1973, does not permit it to do. It must guard strongly that it has primacy over institutions functioning under the Constitution, 1973, and it’s right of legislation and control over the purse strings,” je said.
He emphasised that parliament must stand up to defend its territory and guard its constitutional rights while all institutions functioning under the Constitution must adhere to the concept of trichotomy of power.
