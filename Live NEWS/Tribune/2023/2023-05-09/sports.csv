1,CTD nets arms smuggler,Arrested man suspected of aiding gangs active in riverine area,"Punjab Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) arrested a key member of the network supplying arms to suspected criminals during the ongoing operation in riverine areas.
During an operation on Sunday night, CTD teams detained the suspected arms dealer and also recovered a large cache of arms and ammunition, including two rocket launchers. The network was reportedly involved in arming the Lund and Dulani gangs, two of the notorious criminal gangs operating in the area. 
A CTD spokesman said that the arrested accused was identified as Abdul Khaliq and he worked as the secondary carrier of prohibited and sophisticated arms from Balochistan. During the initial investigation, concrete evidence for the supply of arms and ammunition to riverine areas was collected. 
Referring to the 'modus operandi' of the gangs, the spokesman further alleged that the Lund and Dulani gangs recruited Ramzan Bugti and Sattar Patafi to procure weapons. The accused Sattar Patafi, his brother Javed Patafi and Khan Musuri Bugti have been identified as major smugglers operating out of Balochistan. 
Bugti reportedly brokered a deal for the purchase of rocket launchers and ammunition, which were moved from Rukni to Hajipur and Rajanpur. These were further transported by bike with the help of two local accused.

3,Unregistered student hostels face action,Facilities offered in houses for pupils from areas around Bahawalpur,"At least 34 hostels for boys and girls operating illegally in Bahawalpur are facing action by the district administration.
According to sources, the district police officer has written a letter to the officials concerned to take legal action against the unregistered private hostels.
Among the hostels, four are located in the Kotwali area, two in Cantonment, 17 in Civil Lines and 11 in the Baghdad Jadeed police station's jurisdiction.
Two girl students had died and two others had been severely injured after the roof of a hostel collapsed in Riyadh Colony last week.
The police have registered a case against the hostel owner, but have not arrested him so far.  Bahawalpur city is the hub of education in the region and many students from other towns live in the private hostels despite inadequate facilities.
An official said while speaking to The Express Tribune that it was estimated that about 40 per cent of the thousands of students of the government and private schools, colleges and universities in the city were from the suburbs and other cities.
A local official said at least 34 hostels had been set up in Bahawalpur without seeking approval from the deputy commissioner and other relevant institutions.
Accommodation of five to seven students in a room is offered after acquiring a house on rent for Rs25,000 to Rs50,000 per month and partitioning the rooms. 
The owners reportedly charge about Rs7,000 per month from each student. Thus manifold profit is earned from the rented buildings.
Keeping the facilities unregistered results in evasion of taxes, lack of need for commercial use of residential property and consumption of electricity and natural gas at domestic rates.
A parent of a student said while speaking to The Express Tribune that most of the private hostels had been set up in dilapidated buildings because they were not checked for registration.
He said most of the buildings were more than 50 years old with additional portions built in them. Wallpaper is used to hide the dilapidated condition of the buildings and thousands of students were living in such conditions, he added. Most of the unregistered private hostels are operating at the Islamia University Road, Faisal Colony, Bagikhana, Jail Road, Riaz Colony, Noorul Haq Colony, Garden Town, Gohar Town, Qasim Town and Darbar Mahal Road.

6,Slain man dragged around town,Victim allegedly killed by maternal uncle over property dispute,"A man allegedly gunned down his nephew with the help of his accomplices over a land dispute in Dogran Khajurwala village in Okara on Monday, police said. 
After the murder, the accused tied the victim’s body to a motorcycle and dragged it around the area, they said. 
The suspects escaped, and police were conducting raids to arrest them.
The incident occurred in Dogran Khajurwala, where Abdul Razzaq had been allegedly killed by his maternal uncle, Saye Khan, police said. They said the main suspect, along with Hakim Ali, Javed and others, had had a land dispute with Abdul Razzaq. 
The police from Hujra Shah Muqeem Police Station arrived at the crime scene and shifted the body to the hospital for a postmortem examination.
Taking notice of the incident, DPO Mansoor Aman issued an order for the immediate arrest of the suspects. He said that there had been a dispute between deceased Abdul Razzaq and his maternal uncle over an inherited land.
Both the parties had been previously dealt with as per the law. The DPO also revealed that the accused had been released on bail a day earlier, and another scuffle had occurred between the parties on the following day, in which the suspect opened fire on his nephew. 
Last month, a woman, Abida, and her mother were shot dead allegedly in the name of honour in the area of Shergarh Police Station in Okara. Police had arrested the suspects, who happened to be the slain woman’s husband and his father.
A case had been registered by the Shergarh Police Station on the complaint of slain Abida’s aunt.
According to DPO Mansoor Aman, the police received information that two women had been shot dead in 23/D area of Shergarh.
ASP Munnaza Karamat, along with a heavy contingent of police, was dispatched to the crime scene to get a first-hand account of what had transpired.
According to the FIR, the women had been murdered due to a property dispute, but SHO Hakim Jahanzaib said that police’s initial investigations showed that the women were allegedly killed in the name of honour.
Police said that Abida had married Arshad who worked as a security guard. They had had three children. They said Arshad and Abida both worked in Lahore.
Arshad somehow began suspecting his wife of having an affair. With the passage of time he became more and more paranoid. Until he could take it no more, he decided to send Abida back to the village.
Complying with her husband’s wishes, Abida went back to the village and started living with her stepmother, Ashran Bibi.
Meanwhile, Arshad learnt from a source that his wife was still “having an illicit relationship with someone” and his mother-in-law fully supported Abida.
Police said that this was the motive that prompted Arshad to allegedly kill his wife “in the name of honour” while she had been busy working in the fields.
Later, he also allegedly killed his mother-in-law Ashran Bibi and escaped.
DPO Mansoor Aman, taking notice of the killing of the two women, had formed a team headed by the ASP of Renala Khurd, Munnaza Karamat. On the instructions of ASP Munnaza Karamat, the SHO of Shergarh, Jahanzaib Hakim, along with a police party, managed to track down the suspect and arrested him along with his father.

7,Police to abolish ‘illegal check posts’,"Decision taken over allegations of illegal detention, torture","Punjab Police has decided to abolish illegal police posts, allegedly being used for illegal detention and torture centres, other human rights abuses, throughout the province.
Like police stations, new Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for police posts ask for the installation of CCTV cameras linked to the IG's office in lockups and the setting up of front desks.
In this regard, the Inspector General of Police Punjab (IGP) Dr Usman Anwar issued orders directing to dismantle all the unapproved police posts in Punjab and submit a compliance report to the central police office within two days.
He also asked the DIG Operations Lahore, all CPOs and DPOs not to establish any police post without obtaining the prior formal approval of the IG Punjab and the respective RPOs of their district.
Furthermore, he said that, for setting up checkpoints in all districts, the concerned RPOs will have to take permission from the IG Punjab by May 9.
The IG Punjab said that the establishment of a front desk and the installation of CCTV cameras would be ensured at all police check posts established after the approval.
He said there shall be no lockups in the police check posts, but if the police station concerned is 50 kilometres away, then the RPOs concerned may establish lockups with the installation of CCTV cameras after approval of the IG Punjab.
He said that CCTV cameras installed in lockups should be fully functional for effective monitoring.
He also directed that all arrests and investigations would be undertaken in the respective police stations.
He further added that the establishment of a front desk and the installation of CCTV cameras at the approved police posts should be completed by May 10.
Commenting on the issue, Dr Anwar said the purpose of police checkpoints is to ensure a quick response against criminal activities.
However, despite being aware of their duty, police should not be involved in any sort of human rights violations.
He added that he had received a few complaints that since the CCTV cameras were installed in lockups and police stations, such illegal police posts were being used for illegal detentions and as torture centers. He said that the police top brass did not approve of any such measure.
AIG Operations on behalf of Dr Usman Anwar has issued a notification of the above instructions to DIG Operations Lahore, all CPOs and DPOs. Front Desk and CCTV cameras in police stations, lockups:
Punjab Police has introduced a semi-autonomous complaint registration and management system using front desks at police stations.
Prior to front desks, the complaints were supposed to be recorded by the Moharar of the police stations. A large number of the complaints were not recorded and not made a part of the police record, lest any sort of initiation of legal action.
To deal with the issue, a front desk was introduced on which civilian IT, computer literate staff was engaged. Front Desks were set up right at the entrance of police stations. Any complainant could lodge the complaint, it was recorded and uploaded on the computer with an e-tag number. 
Once an e-tag was marked on a complaint, it could be tracked by senior police officers, including the IG's office. This way an effort was made to slash the monopoly of police staff to discard, putting under the rug of the complaints.
Front desks had been set up at police stations. However, these were missing at police check posts popularly called as ""Police Chowki"". For the surveillance and monitoring purposes, CCTV cameras had been installed in lockups and police officers' rooms.

9,PHA eyes digitisation to curb graft,PITB to develop revenue management and monitoring system,"The Lahore Parks and Horticulture Authority (PHA) has launched a digitalisation programme aimed at curbing corruption, beautifying the city and providing recreational facilities to citizens. 
The programme was launched following an agreement between the Punjab Information Technology Board (PITB) and the PHA to help the authority overcome its financial crisis.
Under the agreement signed by both organisations, the PITB will develop a ‘revenue management and monitoring system’ for the PHA to ensure oversight and transparency in administration. 
The PITB will create an android web application for all PHA matters, as well as provide staff training on using the app for the project’s timely completion. It will also provide software, technical support and services for the digitisation of the PHA.
An official said then online application was expected to help the PHA reduce embezzlement, increase revenue and streamline efforts for beautifying Lahore and providing a recreational environment to citizens. 
More than 850 parks in the city are in disrepair due to unavailability of funds, he added. 
The Lahore PHA receives most of its income from the marketing department, which includes earning from signboards and canteens. 
The official said corruption in the department during 2019-20 and 2020-21, resulting in a loss of around Rs500 million had been reported.
The digitalisation system is being introduced to curb corruption.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, PHA Director General Muhammad Tahir Wattoo said the purpose of the agreement with the IT board was “to run the PHA in a modern manner and to establish transparency in all sectors”.
“Under the programme, the entire system of awarding billboard and canteen contracts, collecting dues and arrears will be digitised. Codes will be displayed on all the boards installed in the city. The booking, timeframe, rates and all the information about them will be computerized,” the director general added.
Initially, bookings of parks and canteens for commercial functions and weddings will be digitised, while the authority’s vehicles will be monitored through the online system in the second phase of the plan.
When asked about the financial situation of the PHA, the DG said, “There are currently 502 VVIP, VIP and A, B, C and D category advertising boards in Lahore city. But the PHA is facing a financial crisis due to the expenditure on salaries and stationery.”
To overcome these challenges, the PITB will develop a revenue management and monitoring system. 
Initially, contracts for commercial functions, weddings, and canteens will be digitized, followed by digitising information about of all PHA vehicles, he said. 
Wattoo added, “As part of PHA’s efforts to raise funds, initially more than 120 parks will be revamped and beautified. Other parks will be improved in the second phase.”
He said that despite the financial challenges, the PHA had been decorating Lahore’s green belts and various intersections with flowers. “Our aim is to beautify Lahore and provide entertainment facilities to the citizens,” the Lahore PHA director general said.
