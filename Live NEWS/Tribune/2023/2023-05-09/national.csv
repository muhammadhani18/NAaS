0,Businessmen demand end to fine on export proceeds,"Urge govt to simplify policy to encourage exporters, fetch foreign exchange","Businessmen have called on the government to take immediate action and discontinue the collection of 3-9% penalty by commercial banks, or authorised dealers of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), in foreign exchange for delay in realisation of export proceeds.
They claim that this fine is discouraging exporters from bringing their earnings back home, causing unbearable financial losses.
Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) President Irfan Iqbal Sheikh, in a statement, emphasised that the SBP should immediately bar commercial banks from charging exporters the 3-9% penalty.
“There are genuine reasons beyond the control of exporters which lead to delay in realisation of export proceeds,” SITE Association of Industries (SAI) President Riazuddin told The Express Tribune.
These include disruption in global commercial transactions due to the Russia-Ukraine war, extreme volatility in rupee-dollar parity, delay in settling Letters of Credit (LCs) for import of raw material used in industrial production and the emergence of three simultaneous foreign exchange markets – formal banking channels, open market and grey market, he added.
It is pertinent to note that the authorised dealers are deducting 3% fine or marking lien on the export proceeds delayed by up to 30 days, 6% on delay of 30-60 days and 9% on delay of more than 60 days, the FPCCI statement cited.
Though the SBP has issued a circular on April 30 instructing commercial banks to accept and accommodate the genuine cases of delay in export proceeds and exempt them from fines, the directives have not been implemented in true letter and spirit, Sheikh maintained.
“It is surprising that the documentation of exporters or their foreign buyers are not given due weightage and ADs are making undue deductions on export proceeds of the already distressed exporters,” he noted with concern.
Foreign exchange is the lifeline of Pakistan’s economy and exporters need to be facilitated and incentivised for bringing dollars to the country, the FPCCI chief added.
“The SBP must offer an easy policy to welcome export proceeds and should not impose any fines or penalties for unavoidable delays,” suggested Union of Small and Medium Enterprises (UNISAME) President Zulfikar Thaver.
“Most of the time the delay is due to the credit crunch in countries from where export proceeds have to be remitted,” he elaborated.
However, some exporters wait for the rupee to depreciate more to get more Pakistani currency. The SBP must ask trade bodies to get their members end this practice. Besides, it can introduce a scheme of reward for bringing remittances timely, suggested Thaver.

1,Indian airline seeks urgent bankruptcy order,Aviation regulator orders airline to stop issuing new tickets,"Go Airlines on Monday called on India’s company law tribunal to urgently grant its request for bankruptcy protection, as the aviation regulator stepped up pressure on the carrier to stop issuing new tickets and lessors sought to repossess planes.
The airline, widely known as Go First, filed for bankruptcy protection last week, blaming “faulty” Pratt & Whitney engines for the grounding of about half its 54 Airbus A320neo. In all, it has 57 planes.
While the National Company Law Tribunal heard Go First’s bankruptcy plea last week, it has yet to pass an order. This has given lessors a window to secure their assets. Leasing companies including GY Aviation Lease, SMBC Aviation Capital and Pembroke Aircraft Leasing, submitted requests to India’s aviation regulator to take back at least 20 planes.
Lawyers representing cash-strapped Go Airlines said at Monday’s court hearing that the lessors’ actions could further impair its operations.
Separately, India’s aviation regulator ordered Go First to stop issuing new tickets, a government source with direct knowledge of the matter said.

2,Pension funds boost fossil fuel investment,It comes despite commitments to net zero carbon emissions,"Australia’s 30 biggest pension funds increased their investments in key coal, oil and gas producers by 50% in 2022 despite the funds’ long term commitments to net zero carbon emissions, environmental activist group Market Forces said.
Superannuation or retirement funds raised their investment to more than A$34 billion ($23 billion) in companies most responsible for expanding fossil fuels, Market Forces said.
“Super funds are making a mockery of their own commitments to net zero by buying up wholesale in companies expanding fossil fuels and letting them get away with trashing our climate,” Market Forces campaigner Brett Morgan said in a statement.
Some funds have committed to achieve net zero carbon emissions in their investment portfolio by 2050.
Commonwealth Super Corp, AustralianSuper, Australian Retirement Trust, Aware Super and AMP Ltd, operators of the five largest funds cumulatively managing more than A$1 trillion ($675 billion), did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Market Forces only named AustralianSuper, which increased its stake in Woodside Energy Group Ltd, Australia’s top independent gas producer, by about 19 times in 2022.
In an emailed response, AustralianSuper said it had raised its stake as gas was a key part of an “orderly energy transition” ahead.
“As an active and responsible owner, we will continue to proactively engage with Woodside to understand how the company plans to transition its operations to deliver long-term value to members in a low-carbon environment,” a spokesperson said.

3,Women empowerment plan on cards,Secretary says economic situation demands active participation of women,"A concrete plan for women’s economic empowerment will be drawn up in a joint meeting of female parliamentary secretaries, which will be held in Islamabad soon.
It was disclosed by Federal Ministry of Industries and Production Parliamentary Secretary Dr Shahida Rehmani during a visit to the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Authority (Smeda) head office on Monday. 
Rehmani observed that Pakistan’s critical economic situation demanded active participation of women in its mainstream business and economy. She said that the female artisans working in different sectors of the economy must be provided support so that they could become formal entrepreneurs.
She underlined the need for providing assistance for the development of women entrepreneurship at the gross-roots level but lamented that the skilled women working in different professions were not being paid a fair remuneration.
“The government wants to establish a fool-proof support mechanism to help women set up their own enterprises,” the secretary said.

4,PSX demands review of tax policies,"Says high taxes hurting growth, capital formation","Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) has called on the government to review its taxation policies for capital markets as double and triple tax are negatively impacting growth and penalising capital formation.
In its budget proposals for fiscal year 2023-24, submitted to the Ministry of Finance, the PSX recommended aligning the rates of capital gains tax (CGT) on sale of stocks with the rates of CGT on immoveable properties. It also called for giving tax relief to foreign investors to attract investment from around the globe.
The proposals include enhancing tax credit for listed small and medium enterprises (SMEs), documenting the real estate sector, eliminating the minimum tax regime for listed companies, rationalising taxes on dividends and introducing registered saving and investment accounts (RSIA) as well as individual saving accounts (ISA) to channelise “savings towards productive investments.”
Going into details, the bourse stated that profits of corporate businesses were taxed twice, “once at company levels at the rate of 29% and again at the rate of 15% at the time of dividend distribution. This is in addition to the super tax of up to 4%.”
As compared to 44% tax in case of companies, unincorporated businesses are taxed 0% to 35% in different slabs.
“This inequality in taxation is discouraging corporatisation and documentation as unincorporated businesses are subject to substantially lower taxes.”
Therefore, “restoration of exemption for inter-corporate dividend between companies eligible for group taxation under Section 59B of the Income Tax Ordinance 2001 is proposed.”
PSX emphasised that the listing of companies at the bourse helped increase their profit and prop up economic growth. To encourage listings, “there should be reduced rates of corporate tax for listed companies compared to unlisted ones.”
The average corporate tax stands at 19.52% in the Asian region compared to 29% in Pakistan. Besides, super tax of 4% has also been imposed through the Finance Act 2022.
“To encourage documentation of the economy, the corporate tax rate should be permanently lowered for listed companies, by giving tax credit of 20% of tax payment to those companies that meet the prescribed requirements including a minimum free float of 25% throughout. This will have a long-run positive effect on tax revenue,” the PSX proposed.
It recalled that during discussions regarding the federal budget for 2022-23 with the then finance minister and the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) chairman, a consensus was developed that the tax on capital gains on listed securities should be at par with that on real estate and other asset classes to create a level playing field.
The government had adopted the mechanism in the Finance Bill 2022. “However, the Finance Act 2022…has again created such tax disparity between the securities and immovable properties.”
Currently, carry-forward losses are allowed up to the period of three years under the CGT regime. Last year and the year before, the CGT collection was a mere Rs5.6 billion and Rs8.8 billion, respectively.
“Moreover, brought-forward losses amounting to Rs281 billion are to be adjusted against future capital gains, therefore the CGT collection will continue to be negligible.”
PSX also proposed the removal of the flat CGT rate of 12.5%, applicable to the disposal of securities acquired on or before June 30, 2022.
The CGT rate for all derivatives and future contracts is proposed at 5% in line with the tax rate for commodities futures at the Pakistan Mercantile Exchange.
Furthermore, in order to attract foreign investment and to support the foreign exchange reserves, the government has recently announced a major relief for the non-resident banking companies making investment in government debt securities including treasury bills and Pakistan Investment Bonds, whereby profit on debt and capital gains from such debt instruments shall be exempted from tax for these non-resident banking companies, it stated.
The bourse also suggested that a similar incentive for the capital market would not only benefit the struggling economy, but would also help restore the local investors’ confidence, which would eventually yield a positive impact in terms of tax revenue.
“In order to attract foreign investors into the capital market, it is proposed to exempt income derived from such foreign investment from tax,” it wrote.
To recall, foreign investment has declined to $300-400 million compared to the investment of billions a few years ago.

5,OICCI proposes abolition of WHT on telecom,Recommends 8% WHT as high taxes threaten digitalisation drive,"The Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) has proposed the abolition of withholding tax (WHT) on telecommunication to promote the affordability of internet and data services for low-income segments of society.
According to the OICCI, the overall 34.5% tax on telecom users, including 15% WHT and 19.5% general sales tax (GST), makes Pakistan one of the highest taxed telecom markets globally. “Such exorbitant taxation is detrimental to the digitalisation drive and overall economic growth.”
It said while WHT was reduced from 12.5% to 10% for FY 2021 with a commitment to 8% onwards vide Finance Act 2021, it was reversed six months later without due consideration of its long-term ramifications. “Now, it should be reversed to 8% for fiscal year 2022-23.”
Through the Finance (Supplementary) Act 2022, the WHT rate was raised from 10% to 15%, taking the overall tax on 195 million telecom users to almost 35%.
Besides, WHT on telephone and internet services is a contentious tax revenue, as it hampers the affordability of mobile ownership and internet services, which are critical for the entire population and the economic growth.
With more than 70% of Pakistan’s population living below the poverty line, the majority of the subscriber base falls below the taxable limit, the OICCI highlighted. In addition to abolishing the tax, the OICCI urged the government to encourage the use of alternative energy resources in the telecom sector, such as solar, by reducing the customs duty on batteries and scrapping the additional customs duty and regulatory duty.
These batteries are core assets for telecom infrastructure service providers.
The chamber also proposed the abolition of advance tax on auction/ renewal of licences, as “spectrum is not sold, but only the right to use the spectrum for a specified term is granted to telecom operators, and licences too are granted for a specific term only.”
The telecom sector has already paid a significant amount in advance taxes beyond its tax liability.
It called for the harmonisation of federal and provincial sales tax laws and the drafting of a uniform service tax law agreed upon by the tax authorities of provinces and the federal government for implementation in their respective jurisdictions.

6,Gold continues to break records,"Hits all-time high at Rs226,900 per tola partially due to rupee fall","Gold maintained its record-breaking spree on Monday as it hit a new all-time high at Rs226,900 per tola (11.66 grams), partially due to a downtick in rupee’s value against the US dollar in inter-bank market.
In another development, the government revised up profit rates for a few national saving schemes up to 100 basis points (bps) to encourage savings by people at a time when inflation was skyrocketing. Gold pricing body All Pakistan Saraf Gems and Jewellers Association (APSGJA) revised up the bullion price by Rs1,400 to the record high at Rs226,900 per tola.
The precious metal’s price rose after the rupee depreciated by 0.09%, or Rs0.26, at Rs283.85 against the US dollar in the inter-bank market. The bullion pricing body takes the exchange rate into account while determining the price of the metal.
An increase in gold price in the global market also encouraged the body to raise the commodity’s price. APSGJA said gold rose by $5 to $2,022 per ounce (31.10 grams) in the international market.
The latest drop in the rupee came after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said that Pakistan was yet to meet the condition of acquiring financial commitments from friendly countries.
Previously, the IMF recommended the government to ensure financing arrangements of $6-7 billion for the revival of its loan programme. So far, the government has arranged $3 billion only.
A research house reported that the government increased the rate of return on three saving schemes. Of these, the profit on Savings Account was increased by 100 bps to 19.50%.
The government increased the rate by 98 bps to 20.80% for Short-Term Savings Certificates and raised the rate by 27 bps to 17.40% for Special Savings Certificates.

7,Crackdown on diesel smuggling planned,"Petroleum Division writes letter to interior ministry and FBR, seeks action","The government is gearing up to launch a crackdown on supply of smuggled Iranian diesel that has flooded local markets and posed a threat to the survival of Pakistan’s oil industry.
Earlier, local refineries had warned of shutting down their plants due to the smuggled Iranian oil, which was also causing a revenue loss of around Rs10 billion per month to the national exchequer on account of tax evasion.
The Ministry of Interior, Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and Petroleum Division have joined hands to tackle the threat posed by the smuggled oil, which is fast replacing the locally produced fuel.
Oil refineries, especially Pak Arab Refinery Limited (Parco), had taken up the matter with the state minister for petroleum. Parco said it was forced to reduce oil refining to 75% of capacity owing to demand and supply issues in the market.
Oil marketing companies (OMCs) have also refused to lift petroleum stocks from Parco and other refineries as consumer demand for local products went down.
The Petroleum Division, in a letter written to the interior ministry and the FBR, has sought action against the supply of smuggled oil.
Separately, the interior ministry has sent a letter to the FBR chairman, seeking a report on fuel consumption in Pakistan and action against the elements involved in oil smuggling.
Meanwhile, the FBR chairman has directed all the Customs departments concerned to initiate action and submit a report.
In its communication, the Ministry of Petroleum voiced concern that the smuggled diesel was fast replacing local fuel in the market. Smuggled Iranian diesel is largely meeting consumer needs in the current crop harvesting season as demand for diesel from formal sources, ie OMCs, has plunged massively, the ministry said.
It pointed out that the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) verified reports that legal sales of OMCs had dropped significantly.
Last year, average diesel consumption from March to June remained in the range of 23,000-30,000 tons per day. However, from mid-February 2023, average sales started to decline and remained around 12,770 tons per day in March.
As informed by Ogra, “diesel sales have declined more than 40% as compared to last year owing to the entry of cross-border product”.
The Petroleum Division added that smuggling had badly affected the formal oil business in Balochistan as well as other parts of the country for a long time due to a huge price gap.
According to data given by Ogra, cross-border smuggling volumes have reached approximately 4,000 tons per day, which ultimately results in a loss of about 120,000 tons (143 million litres) per month in legal sales.
This loss translates into lesser imports by a similar amount and a corresponding loss in customs duty. Because of the decrease in sales, total revenue loss in terms of petroleum levy, customs duty, etc is estimated at around Rs10.2 billion per month.
Apart from that, smuggling has led to a significant drop in lifting of petroleum products from local refineries, forcing them to reduce production, which “leads to supply insecurity for products other than diesel”.
At present, oil refineries are operating in the range of 50-70% of their production capacity. They are carrying diesel stocks of around 675,000 tons, which can meet about 44 days of demand.
“Anti-smuggling enforcement falls in the domain of Ministry of Interior/ law enforcement agencies besides the FBR/ Customs authorities and the provincial government of Balochistan,” the Petroleum Division said, adding “it is, therefore, requested that appropriate stern action may be taken in order to curb the menace of oil smuggling across the Iranian border areas.”

8,Govt seeks to break IMF gridlock,Asks board member to persuade IMF management to resume programme,"Pakistan on Monday sought the support of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) board to break the deadlock over revival of the $6.5 billion loan programme as the delay is costing dearly in the shape of economic and reputational loss to the government.
Finance Minister Ishaq Dar held a virtual meeting with IMF Executive Director Bahador Bijani. Dar sought his support to persuade the IMF management to sign a staff-level agreement with Pakistan, sources in the Ministry of Finance told The Express Tribune.
Bahador inquired about Pakistan’s intentions to enter into a new IMF programme, responding to which the finance minister said that he was open to discuss it, according to the sources.
They said that Dar was of the view that it was the responsibility and the obligation of the IMF to support Pakistan at this point in time with urgent signing of the agreement, followed by the board’s meeting.
Pakistan has publicly been blaming the IMF for the delay while claiming that it has met all prior conditions.
Bahador, an Iranian citizen, represents Pakistan, Algeria, Ghana, Iran, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia on the IMF board.
Sources said that Dar requested Bahador to play his role to break the gridlock with the management and staff of the IMF.
The meeting with the IMF executive director was held four days after IMF Mission Chief Nathan Porter issued a statement and negated Islamabad’s claim that it had met all prior conditions for ninth review of the Extended Fund Facility.
Porter said that the deal could only be reached once the necessary financing was in place.
The meeting with the board member also came almost a month after Dar virtually held discussions with IMF Deputy Managing Director Antoinette Monsio Sayeh and requested her to sign the deal.
For the past four months, Pakistan has remained unable to meet some of the critical conditions set by the IMF staff for reaching a deal, although it had met the conditions related to implementation of a mini-budget, increase in electricity, gas and petrol prices and leaving the exchange rate with market forces.
However, the government has not met the most crucial condition of arranging $6 billion in additional loans aimed at bridging the gap.
Sources said that Dar told the executive director that Pakistan had met all the prior actions including external financing commitments of $3 billion.
Saudi Arabia has promised to give $2 billion while the United Arab Emirates has committed $1 billion in fresh loans.
According to the sources, the finance minister informed the executive director that the remaining $3 billion can only be arranged once the IMF announces the staff-level agreement and the board approves the ninth review along with the $1.2 billion tranche.
Read IMF negates govt’s claim of meeting loan conditions
Pakistan had informed the IMF that it would comfortably arrange the remaining $3 billion from the World Bank, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), European and Gulf-based commercial banks and out of Geneva pledges.
However, the government could not arrange those funds. The World Bank is not ready to approve the budget support loans until the IMF reaches a deal and Pakistan also meets conditions related to renegotiation of energy deals with China.
After assuming office in September last year, the finance minister was upbeat about bringing down the rupee-dollar parity to Rs180 to a dollar, reach a win-win deal with the IMF and bringing the spiraling inflation under control.
However, none of these objectives have so far been achieved and instead economic activities have come to a grinding halt, inflation is at a six-decade high of 36.4% and the rupee-dollar parity has jumped to Rs290 to a dollar in the open market.
Sources said that one of the concerns of the multilateral institutions and foreign investment banks was the country’s economic viability post-IMF programme that is ending on June 30. In this background, Bahador asked about Pakistan’s future plans.
They added Dar stated that the country was open to discuss the issue.
Deepening political uncertainty has also played a role in getting foreign loans and reaching a deal with the IMF, as the world does not know in which direction Pakistan’s politics and the economy will move.
Dar reiterated in the meeting the commitment to completing the IMF programme.
Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves have depleted to a critical level of $4.5 billion and the government has started completely choking imports to delay the looming default.
It increased the interest rate to 21% in the hope of containing inflation and attracting foreign inflows – the two objectives that it has failed to achieve.
