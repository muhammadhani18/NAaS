0,Govt keeps pressing for full court formation,Legal experts urge CJP Bandial to make efforts to end perception of a divided apex court,"Despite the Supreme Court’s reluctance, the PDM-led federal government has been consistently pressing it to form a full court to hear petitions broaching a clutch of sensitive matters, including one challenging Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial’s discretionary powers.
Since the ouster of Imran Khan from the PM’s office through a vote of no-confidence in April last year, several requests were made by both sides – government and PTI – for the constitution of a full court in several matters.
After the in-house change, the PTI had moved an application requesting the bench to constitute a full court hearing presidential reference regarding the interpretation and scope of Article 63A of the Constitution.
However, the PTI did not press that application before the bench.
The PDM had requested a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court led by CJP Bandial to form a full court hearing the matter regarding the interpretation of Article 63A of the Constitution after then Punjab Assembly deputy speaker Dost Mazari discarded 10 PML-Q MPAs votes in the provincial chief minister election. However, their request was turned down.
Subsequently, the PDM and others boycotted the court proceedings.
The issue regarding the constitution of a full court was raised again by the ruling political parties when CJP Umar Ata Bandial had taken suo motu notice regarding the delay in the announcement of elections for Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa assemblies. But the top judge did not form full court on the matter.
Even Justice Athar Minallah in his judicial note had said that the interpretation of the Constitution was the prerogative as well as the duty of this Court.
“It is also an onerous duty to protect, preserve and defend the Constitution. It has been observed by this Court that the Constitution is an organic document designed and intended for all times to come. Interpretation of the Constitution by this Court has a profound impact on the lives of the people of this country, besides having consequences for future generations.
“The framers of the Constitution have conferred an extraordinary jurisdiction on this Court under Article 184(3). The manner in which this power is to be exercised is in itself a matter of immense public importance. While invoking the jurisdiction great care has to be exercised. Article 176 of the Constitution describes the constitution of this Court.
“I am of the opinion that it is implicit in the language of Article 184(3) that the conferred extraordinary original jurisdiction must be entertained and heard by the Full Court. In order to ensure public confidence in the proceedings in hand and keeping in view the importance of the questions raised for our consideration, it is imperative that the matter regarding the violation and interpretation of the Constitution is heard by a Full Court. The interpretation of Article 184(3) of the Constitution in this context, therefore, also requires interpretation,” Justice Minallah, who is not included in the larger bench hearing SC (Practice and Procedure) Act 2023, said.
Senior lawyers believe that the controversy regarding the holding of elections could have been handled well if a full court was formed.
Since a presidential reference was filed against Justice Qazi Faez Isa in May 2019, the apex court had been divided along two ideological lines.
One section says that discretionary powers of CJP should be regulated while the other section while passing judicial orders held that the chief justice was the master of roster in the formation of benches.
It is believed there is a need to form a full court to hear the matter when there are diverse opinions among the top court judges.
It has been witnessed that the judges who evolved jurisprudence in favour of parliament's supremacy and secured the legislation, are not part of the eight-member larger bench.
There is no representation of the K-P and Balochistan in the larger bench whereas out of eight, five members belong to Punjab.
This composition of the bench strengthens the argument that the discretionary powers of CJP should be regulated.
Legal experts are of the opinion that CJP Bandial should make efforts to end the perception that the apex court is divided into two factions and that one section of judges is being sidelined on important politically sensitive matters.
During CJP Bandial tenure, two senior-most judges Justice Isa and Justice Sardar Tariq Masood have not been included in any bench hearing politically sensitive cases.

Taking to Twitter, PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry appealed to the people to come out of their homes, terming the arrest an attack on the judiciary.
PTI Sindh President and former federal minister Ali Zaidi also tweeted that the arrest of the former prime minister from the court premises was a clear violation of the Constitution.
“This country can no longer afford this kind of fascism. The nation has to rise up. It’s time to shut down this country,” he wrote.
On the call of the PTI leadership, party activists staged protests in many cities.
In various cities in Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, the activists blocked the roads, causing problems to the commuters.
The PTI activists staged protests in Islamabad and Rawalpindi. They marched and entered the federal capital’s Red Zone.

The Anti-Riot Force officials used batons, tear-gas shells and water cannons to disperse the protesters.
The protesters at Liberty Chowk had also started moving to Mall Road outside the Governor House and Punjab Assembly building through Main Gulberg Boulevard.
As they reached near Sherpao Bridge, reports of police crackdown on the PTI activists were received.
On social media, a few horrific visuals of looting, damaging and partying by distribution of sweets by the PTI activists also surfaced.

“We will sacrifice our lives, but we will free Imran Khan,” he added.
The PTI activists in Peshawar gathered at Committee Chowk and broke the door of the Radio Station, marching towards the K-P Assembly.
Despite facing resistance from the police, the PTI activists managed to enter the K-P Assembly.
The enraged PTI activists also attacked a van of Express News and broke its windows. The van was covering the protest live through its digital satellite news gathering (DSNG) unit. The mob also pelted stones at the vehicle.

2,Sana gives details of Imran’s arrest,Says £190m belonging to national kitty was laundered in Al-Qadir Trust case,"Minister for Interior Rana Sanaullah on Tuesday said the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) had arrested former prime minister and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan in the Al-Qadir Trust case.
""NAB is an independent institution which is neither under the control of the government nor the latter tries to control it,"" Sanaullah said while addressing a news conference.
The minister categorically clarified that he did not meet the NAB chairman or any official and that the government had nothing to do with the arrest of Imran as the bureau had already issued several notices to the PTI chief in the Al-Qadir Trust case.

There were “dozens” of other cases of corruption registered against Imran, which were under trial in courts, he added.
The minister said in the Al-Qadir Trust case, about £190 million (approximately Rs60 billion) of a ""property tycoon"" transferred through money laundering were caught in the United Kingdom.
The UK government contacted the Pakistani authorities regarding the amount's return.
He said as per law, the amount belonged to the Pakistani nation and should have been deposited in the national exchequer. “Instead [the then adviser to the prime minister] Shahzad Akbar acting as a front-man, got formed the Al-Qadir Trust under a deal executed by him,” he claimed.
The minister said some 458-kanal of land in Sohawa and another 240-kanal in Bani Gala were registered in the name of Al-Qadir Trust.
Sanaullah said some seven to eight months ago, he had provided details of the two properties and had challenged the PTI chief to clarify if Al-Qadir Trust was not established by Imran himself to hide his corruption.
Sanaullah said the PTI chief and his wife Bushra Bibi were the only two trustees of the trust.
He said the 240-kanal of land in Bani Gala, worth around Rs5-7 billion, was registered in the name of Farah Gogi, a close friend of Imran Khan's wife, while Akbar had also taken Rs2 billion for his services.
He said instead of depositing Rs60 billion into the national treasury, the amount landed in the bank account of the Supreme Court, where the accused property tycoon was under trial. The amount was, in fact, returned to the accused in a complex manner to hoodwink the masses, he added.
Even the apex court, he said, also did not question the source of the amount and why it was returned to Pakistan by the UK.
""It is regrettable that at that time when this corruption was committed and permission was taken for Shahzad Akbar to go to the UK court and give a statement on behalf of the Pakistani government for the amount to be adjusted in the property tycoon's account, Imran Khan was instituting false corruption cases against opposition leaders, including Nawaz Sharif, Maryam Nawaz and all family members of Shehbaz Sharif,"" he added.
On impediments to the arrest of Imran, he said lawyers had attempted to condemn the PTI chief’s arrest. “It did not befit them to try to become an obstacle in a legal process,” he said, adding that the security forces personnel present at the Islamabad High Court (IHC) had executed the arrest warrants of the PTI chief in a befitting manner.
Read Imran asks PM if military officers 'above law'
Regarding the Toshakhana (gift depository) case, the minister said it was also proven that he (Imran) committed theft when false cases were being filed against former premier Nawaz Sharif and his family.
He said NAB had issued notices to the PTI chief regarding the corruption cases registered against him, directing him to appear before the bureau and become a part of the investigation.
Talking to the media, Minister for Law and Justice Azam Nazeer Tarar on Tuesday the law should allowed to take its course and legal matters should not be settled on roads, warning that nobody would be allowed to damage public or private property.
He said Imran was arrested as per law by executing the arrest warrants issued by NAB chairman.
He said a seven-member medical board had examined Imran, who would be produced before the court to seek his remand.
It was up to the court to either reject or accept the request for the remand and also to determine the remand period.
On reports of protests by the PTI supporters in various parts of the country, Tarar said holding protests was a fundamental right of citizens, but civilised nations kept them peaceful. He urged the people to keep their conduct as per law and the Constitution.
The law minister said Imran’s arrest was not unlawful confinement while on the contrary, the opposition leaders during his government tenure faced the worst kind of political vindictiveness.
He said during the PTI rule, opposition leaders were arrested in one case and prosecuted in another one.
The minister said the PML-N led coalition government had nothing to do with NAB. It had not interfered in its affairs rather it had streamlined the NAB laws to safeguard the rights of accused persons, he added.
Addressing a news conference, Special Assistant to the PM on Interior and Legal Affairs Attaullah Tarar said Imran was arrested in the Al-Qadir Trust case, the biggest corruption case in the history of Pakistan.
He alleged that the PTI chief indulged in corruption and corrupt practice during his government, besides misuse of power and his arrest was not a surprise move rather it was the result of months-long investigations by NAB.
The trust deed of Al-Qadir Trust had the signatures of Zulfi Bukhari, Babar Awan, Bushra Bibi and Imran, he added.
The SAPM expressed his doubts about the nature of the social services rendered by the trust, which received a total of Rs180 million in its different accounts, in addition to the precious land transferred in its name.
The SAPM warned the PTI protestors of strict action for indulging in unlawful activity. Only a few PTI supporters were protesting over the arrest of their leader, and vandalising public and private properties, and they would be treated as per the law, he warned.
Separately, earlier in the day, Minister for Information and Broadcasting Marriyum Aurangzeb claimed that the masses would not come out in support of Imran if he was arrested.
However, her claims proved false as protests broke out in most of the cities across the country after his arrest.
Reacting to Imran’s statement on her official Twitter handle, she said, “Imran will be arrested in connection with the prohibited funding case, Toshakhana gifts theft case and for not revealing his daughter [Tyrian White].”
Many cases against Imran were registered and he was guilty in all of them, she maintained.

3,Imran’s arrest spells chaos,Former prime minister taken into custody from court premises in Al-Qadir Trust case,"In a startling development on Tuesday, PTI Chairman and deposed premier Imran Khan was arrested in the Al-Qadir Trust case from the premises of the Islamabad High Court, where he was present for two hearings.
Video clips broadcast on TV channels showed Imran – who had been using a wheelchair since being shot during an assassination attempt last year – being manhandled by dozens of security personnel into an armoured vehicle inside the court premises.
The Islamabad police issued a statement quoting the federal capital’s police chief Akbar Nasir saying that the PTI chairman had been arrested in connection with the Al-Qadir Trust case, which alleged that Imran and his wife, Bushra Bibi, acquired billions of rupees from a real estate company for legalising a laundered amount of Rs60 billion, which was identified and returned to Pakistan by the UK while the former premier was in power.
“[The] situation is normal. Section 144 is in place and violations will result in police action,” he added.
In a related event, the IHC reserved its verdict on the legality of the PTI chief's arrest.
IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq observed that if Imran was arrested illegally, he would have to be released.
The PTI chief's arrest came a day after the military warned him against making “baseless allegations” after he again accused a senior officer of plotting to kill him.
The rebuke late Monday underscored how far the PTI chief's relations have deteriorated with the military, which backed his rise to power in 2018 but withdrew its support ahead of a parliamentary vote of no confidence that ousted him last year.
“As we reached the court’s biometric room to mark the attendance, dozens of Rangers [personnel] attacked us,” Ali Bukhari, a PTI lawyer, said.
“They beat him [Imran] and dragged him out,” he told AFP.
According to the Islamabad IGP, Imran had been taken to the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) office in Rawalpindi.
The former premier was arrested from within the premises of the IHC, where he had appeared for the hearing of two cases pertaining to inciting mutiny as well as violence against PML-N leader Mohsin Shahnawaz Ranjha.
A Reuters witness said shortly after Imran entered the gate of the IHC, contingents of the paramilitary force and armoured personnel carriers entered after him.
The gate was blocked by the armoured vehicles while Imran was whisked away shortly after under heavy security, the witness added.
Imran’s arrest warrant was dated May 1 and signed by NAB Chairman Lt-Gen Nazir Ahmed.
It read that Imran was accused of corrupt practices under Section 9(a) of the National Accountability Ordinance, 1999.
Earlier in the day, the IHC CJ summoned the Islamabad IGP, interior secretary and additional attorney general within 15 minutes after learning about Imran’s arrest.
The judge observed that he was exhibiting “restraint”, adding that he would summon Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif if the Islamabad IGP did not appear before the court.
Justice Farooq issued directions to inform the court immediately about who was behind the PTI chief’s arrest and in what case had he been rounded up.
The judge added that action would be taken, “even if it has to be against ministers”.
As the hearing resumed, the Islamabad police chief, accompanied by the interior secretary and additional attorney general appeared before the court.
The judge expressed his displeasure that they had reached the court after 45 minutes – a delay of half an hour.
The Islamabad police chief told the court that he had found out about the PTI chief’s arrest from the media.
He added that Imran had been rounded up in connection with corrupt practices, and submitted the PTI chief’s arrest warrant to the court.
Justice Farooq noted that as far as he knew, the PTI chief was not arrested by NAB.
He continued that he would issue an appropriate order if the arrest was in violation of the law.
Barrister Gohar Khan, who was with Imran at the time of the arrest, told the court that he was present with the PTI chief when he was rounded up by the security personnel.
He added that Rangers personnel were trying to arrest the PTI chief before he even entered the biometric room.
He claimed that Rangers personnel had broken down windows and used pepper spray.
The lawyer maintained that the paramilitary force had hit Imran with a rod and he was willing to give his statement to the IHC for this purpose.
Gohar also claimed that Rangers personnel had also struck the PTI chief’s injured leg.
PTI lawyer Khawaja Haris argued that the arrest was nothing less than an attack on judicial independence.
Haris contended that the law did not allow NAB to arrest a person while an inquiry was still under way.
Faisal Chaudhry, also a PTI lawyer, said the party wanted the IHC to form a full court to hear the case.
He added that the court belonging to the IHC CJ as well as him was attacked. He requested the judge to “restore the dignity” of the court.
The IHC CJ observed that the court was exercising “restraint” throughout the matter and asked that his patience should not be tested.
Justice Farooq noted that he never knew that NAB could carry out an arrest in such a manner.
Raising the question about the incident being an attack on judicial independence, the judge inquired was the arrest legal.
“Lawyers have been attacked. My court has been attacked. I have been attacked,” the IHC CJ noted.
Justice Farooq took strong exception over the arrest taking place inside the IHC premises.
The additional attorney general argued whether the parking lot and other areas of the IHC could be considered the same as the courtroom.
The IHC CJ later summoned the NAB Rawalpindi director general and its prosecutor general, ordering them to appear before the court within 30 minutes.
As the hearing resumed at around 6pm, the NAB officials appeared before the court.
The IHC CJ asked NAB Rawalpindi DG Sardar Muzaffar if Imran’s arrest warrants, which were earlier submitted to court by the Islamabad IGP, were actually issued by the anti-graft body.
The NAB official replied in the affirmative, saying it was issued on May 1.
Justice Farooq sought details of the NAB investigation officer. The NAB official identified him as Umar Nadeem.
The judge also asked if NAB had deployed Rangers to execute Imran’s arrest warrant. He further inquired whether or not the Islamabad police were informed about the Rangers’ deployment.
The Islamabad police chief replied in the affirmative, saying that he was aware about the arrest warrant.
The judge inquired if similar arrest warrants had also been issued for Fawad Chaudhry and other PTI leaders.
To this, the NAB official replied that he was unaware of any such warrants.
The IHC CJ remarked that if Imran’s arrest was illegal, he would have to be released.
However, he added that if the arrest was legal, the proceedings would continue as per the law.
Later, the judge reserved the verdict. He elaborated that an appropriate order would be issued soon.
Prior to his court appearance, Imran told the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) to “listen carefully” as he once again held a senior military official responsible for the assassination attempts on his life.
The former premier lambasted the military’s media wing a day after Pakistan Army lashed out at Imran, saying that he levelled ""highly irresponsible and baseless allegation"" against a serving senior military officer without any evidence.
""Before I leave, I want to say two things. First, the ISPR issued a statement saying that the institution has been disrespected and the army has been disrespected by naming an officer that has tried to have me killed twice,"" Imran said in a video message prior to his court appearance today.
""ISPR sahib, listen to me carefully. Respect is not only reserved for one institution, respect should be for every citizen."" (With input from agencies)

4,"Imran’s arrest is legal, rules IHC","Court issues contempt notices to Islamabad IGP, secretary interior","The Islamabad High Court (IHC) termed the arrest of former prime minister Imran Khan in Al-Qadir Trust case “legal” but issued notices to the Islamabad inspector general police (IGP) and secretary interior for contempt of court.
The court also ordered its registrar to complete an inquiry into the incident—which involved manhandling of lawyers and court staff and damaging of court properties— by May 16 and get a first information report (FIR) registered against people responsible for it.
Officials of paramilitary Rangers and police arrested the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief from the IHC premises on Monday afternoon while implementing an arrest warrant issued by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), the country’s top graft buster.
The arrest was followed by countrywide protests by the PTI supporters. IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq also took notice of the matter and summoned the Islamabad IGP, the interior secretary and the additional attorney general (AAG) to appear before the court in “within 15 minutes”.
The judge also ordered the AAG to immediately find out who was behind the arrest.
“If an inquiry has to be conducted, action will also be taken against the prime minister and ministers,” the judge warned. He subsequently also ordered the NAB director general (DG) and prosecutor general to appear in person in 30 minutes.
When the court resumed the hearing after a break, NAB Deputy Prosecutor General Sardar Muzaffar Abbasi told the court that the graft buster had asked the Ministry of Interior to implement its arrest warrant issued against Imran on May 1.
When Justice Farooq asked Abbasi if authorities could make an arrest from court premises, he replied that any action could be taken if an accused put up resistance.

The deputy prosecutor, however, admitted that court property was damaged and lawyers were manhandled. The IHC chief justice noted that an appropriate method should be adopted when authorities implement an arrest warrant.
The NAB prosecutor told the court that Imran Khan resisted arrest on many occasions in the past and that he did not appear before the NAB during its inquiry into the scandal. He said NAB issued arrest warrants for the former premier as per law.
The chief justice, however, stated that his primary concern is to determine whether the arrest was made in accordance with law or not. The deputy prosecutor said there is no restriction on arresting an accused from a court premises.
“In view of the court’s sanctity, the former PM was not taken into custody from the courtroom,” he said.
 IHC Bar Association President Naveed Malik who was present in the courtroom contented that the court compound was attacked and lawyers were injured.
Imran’s counsel Khawaja Haris asked the court to inquire NAB as to when it changed the inquiry in the Al-Qadir Trust case into an investigation. He said a copy of the investigation must be provided to Imran’s legal team if any changes are made to the inquiry of the case.
 “I wrote a letter to NAB in this connection which is attached,” he said.
The counsel said they responded to NAB’s summons. He said the anti-corruption watchdog’s own records show that the arrest was a malicious act.
Haris said NAB could issue an arrest warrant during the investigation and added that before amendments to the National Accountability Ordinance (NAO), 1999 warrants could be issued during the inquiry.
He said the PTI chief had found out about the NAB inquiry being turned into an investigation through newspapers. “We were preparing to file a bail application and Imran Khan had come to the court for biometric verification which is needed for bail application.”

He said Imran’s arrest was a violation of fundamental rights and an attack on the independence of the judiciary. He requested the IHC order his client's release. “The arrest is illegal, orders should be issued for the release of Imran Khan,” he said.
The NAB deputy prosecutor said the inquiry was turned into an investigation on April 28, adding that the former PM did not appear before the bureau for investigation. “NAB carried out a detailed investigation in the case,” he added.
Justice Farooq observed that Imran’s release order would be issued if any illegality was committed in the compliance of arrest warrants and reserved the verdict on the matter, which was later unveiled.
Earlier in the day, an anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Islamabad granted interim bail to Imran Khan in seven different terrorism cases. Imran Khan also approached the IHC, showing his willingness to join investigations into different cases registered against him.
The PTI chief told the court that he had written letters to Islamabad IG, advocate general and additional attorney general, communicating his desire to join the investigation but the officials did not reply. He requested the court issue instructions to the officials in this regard.
Meanwhile, the IHC ordered police not to arrest eight Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leaders including former information minister Fawad Chaudhry while hearing their bail applications.
