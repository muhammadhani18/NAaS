0,Magistrates fail to control soaring prices,Fresh spike in the prices of essential food items in the open market leaves district admin helpless,"With the fresh spike in the prices of essential food items in the open market, the Rawalpindi district administration and price control committees are finding themselves helpless to do anything about the situation.
Due to the shortage of wheat, a new crisis of wheat flour has loomed large over the district.
In the open market, the cost of wheat, tea leaves, bread, white gram, and sugar has skyrocketed once again, however, the prices of vegetables have been brought down a little bit.
A survey of the open market has revealed that the prices of fruits have remained unchanged.
On the other hand, the Sunday bazaars that offer minor relief to the inflation-stricken public have indulged in profiteering and selling substandard food items.
The price of live chicken is stated to be at around Rs230 per kg while chicken meat is being sold at Rs655 per kg. Similarly, a dozen eggs are available at Rs280, sugar at Rs110 per kg, wheat flour at Rs180 per kg, and white gram is being sold at Rs420 per kg.

1,"Hearing, speech impaired persons to get driving licences",Prominently visible stickers to be provided to vehicles of special needs persons for three months,"For the first time in Pakistan, the process of issuing driving licences to speech and hearing-impaired persons has started from the protection centre of the Rawalpindi Police.
Initially, prominently visible stickers will be provided to the vehicles and bikes of special needs people for three months. The Punjab IGP will issue driving licences to speech and hearing-impaired persons.
In-charge Protection Centre, ASP Anum Sher, told The Express Tribune that the speech and hearing persons were already driving their cars and bikes but neither were they provided driving licences nor were there any prominent marks on their vehicles which showed that the person driving the vehicle was suffering from a speech or hearing disorder.
“We selected more than 10 students with the help of a local NGO who will take training on traffic rules in the protection centre,” she said and added that the lectures would be imparted in sign language. “We will issue blue stickers for the vehicles or bikes of the special people.”

2,Students to receive funds instead of free textbooks,Teachers' union strongly condemns stopgap arrangement,"The Punjab School Education Department has decided to stop the distribution of free textbooks to all deserving students from grade I to matric in the new academic year starting from April 1, 2024.
Sources said the students, who are studying in the schools run by the Punjab Education Foundation, receiving education under the Benazir Income Support Programme and the government’s special free voucher education scheme will no longer be receiving free textbooks.
According to sources, instead of getting free textbooks, all such students will be given funds to buy textbooks. However, free textbooks will continue to be provided to the students of all government-run primary, middle, high and higher secondary schools as usual.
According to sources, at present 600,000 male and female students are studying in all the 8,500 primary, middle and high schools run by the Punjab Education Foundation across the province, about 200,000 under the special free voucher education scheme of the Ministry of Education and 196,000 students are studying under the Benazir Income Support Programme.
Meanwhile, the Punjab Teachers' Union strongly condemned the stopgap arrangement and demanded to make the free textbook system regular.
Rana Liaquat, the union central secretary general, said heavy expenses are incurred on loading and unloading of textbooks and their delivery from Lahore to all 36 districts in addition to the rent of warehouses.
“If the government wants to give money instead of free books to deserving students, they should be paid the total cost of all the books of each class so that their parents can buy books from the open market at their will instead of waiting for the free textbooks,” he said.
“This will save the government millions of rupees in heavy rent of warehouses and transportation,” he added. “Warehouses have been set up at every tehsil level, while schools also pay additional transport charges and loading and unloading fees to bring their share of books from the warehouses.”
There are a total of 52,000 schools across Punjab in which 1.2 million male and female students are studying.
Last month, the Punjab School Education Department distributed free textbooks among students from grade 1 to matriculation in all government schools of Rawalpindi, Chakwal, Jhelum, and other districts during the Eid holidays.
The move came after the department abolished Urdu medium from government schools.

The gunshot severely injured his brother whereas the accused managed to flee the scene. He added that both of them were rushed to the nearby hospital but succumbed to their injuries.
According to police, while the first investigation revealed that the shooting happened due to personal animosity, it was originally believed that the shooting in the house resulted from resistance to an attempt at robbery.

4,UK’s Pakistan Network celebrates Coronation,Events themed around ‘Year of Youth’ campaign,"The UK’s Pakistan Network, supported by the British Council and the GREAT campaign, marked the Coronation of their Majesties King Charles III and Queen Camilla in style with a series of events this weekend.
On Saturday, the British High Commission in Islamabad hosted a black-tie ball, whilst the Deputy High Commission in Karachi held a traditional garden party. To reflect King Charles’s passion for youth development, both events were themed around the Commonwealth’s ‘Year of Youth’ campaign and aimed to shine a spotlight on the many opportunities on offer to young Pakistanis via the ‘Commonwealth Youth Programme’.
Acting British High Commissioner, Andrew Dalgleish, noted in his speech that: “Over 60% of the Commonwealth’s population are under 30, some 1.5 billion people. In Pakistan around 63% of the population is between 15 and 33 years of age. For future stability and sustainable growth, we need to ensure that these young people are properly engaged with decision-making processes that will affect their futures, and are equipped with the skills and the opportunities to make a difference.”
Commonwealth Athletes, Commonwealth Correspondents, Commonwealth Youth Council Members, individuals from the Queen’s Commonwealth Trust Pakistan Chapter and young entrepreneurs from the Prince’s Trust, amongst others, attended the events.
The weekend also saw members of staff from the British High Commission and British Council in Islamabad as well as the Deputy High Commission in Karachi, take part in the ‘Big Help Out’. A UK initiative designed to mark the Coronation by encouraging people to get together and volunteer to bring benefit to their local communities.
In Islamabad, UK staff, supported by Chevening Alumni and members of the City Development Authority, volunteered to beautify a section of the Rose and Jasmin Garden, now named ‘Commonwealth Corner’, by installing two new park benches and planting 56 trees – one for each Commonwealth Nation.

5,Experts call for premarital tests,Urge to do away with cousin marriages to curb spread of inherited blood disorder,"Health experts and social activists demanded legislation for premarital thalassemia tests and awareness campaigns to control the spread of the genetic blood disorder.
They also called for avoiding cousin marriages as these were a major cause of thalassaemia disease spread in the country. These views were expressed by the participants of an event organised in the garrison city on World Thalassemia Day 2023.
Meanwhile, the Punjab government, which provides only free blood screening facilities to thalassemia patients, has indicated to provide 100% free treatment.
Due to the rapid growth of the hereditary and contagious disease of thalassemia and the most expensive treatment and the distressing situation of blood transfusions every month, the government has not been able to do much to get the patients and their parents out of this situation, however, the blood donation work for thalassemia patients in the private sector is ongoing on a large scale.
According to health experts, there are three levels of thalassemia, the first level is thalassemia minor, the second is intermediate, and the third is major. The body stops producing blood when children suffer from thalassemia between the ages of seven months and one year. The only treatment for thalassemia is a bone marrow transplant, which must be done at an early age.
Asad Azam, project director of Pakistan Sweet Home for Thalassemia, says that there are currently 100,000 children suffering from thalassemia in Pakistan and every year it is increasing by 15,000.
“In order to end this, we have to make legislation like Iran, Maldives, Cyprus so that marriage is not allowed if the girl or boy is diagnosed with this disease before marriage and treatment of the patient may be started,” he said.
“In this regard, the government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa made a formal legislation in 2009 where a thalassemia test is mandatory for marriage,” he explained. “However, this important law has not been implemented there in letter and spirit.”
Earlier, addressing the event, Punjab Health Minister Dr Jamal Nasir said: “At present, the Punjab government is providing free screening facility to thalassemia patients.” He claimed that efforts were being made to make the vaccination and complete treatment 100% free for thalassemia patients. “The lifeline of a thalassemia patient is blood and donating the blood protects the donors from cancer, heart attack and stroke diseases.”
On the other hand, while talking to a state-run news channel, Professor Hassan Abbas Zaheer, an expert on thalassaemia, explained that families with a history of thalassaemia must screen their children before marriage to help control the spread of the disease in the country.
The main objective of celebrating World Thalassaemia Day was to draw the attention of the general public, patient associations, public authorities, and healthcare professionals to promote actions on prevention, management, or treatment of the disease in a patient-centred manner.
He said thalassaemia is a genetic blood disorder and called upon philanthropists to play an active role in providing relief to the patients.
Replying to a question about the control of thalassaemia, he said, it is a difficult task, it can easily be achieved via the assistance of prenatal diagnosis and prevention programmes only.

6,Senate body seeks report on drug supply,Minister hints at making anti-narcotics fusion centre functional by July,"The Senate Standing Committee on Anti-Narcotics has asked the Islamabad police to furnish a report on the operations conducted against the menace of drugs throughout the year in the federal capital including educational institutions.
A meeting of the committee was held on Monday under the chairmanship of Senator Ejaz Chaudhary, in which Federal Minister for Anti-Narcotics Shah Zain Bugti, Ministry of Anti-Narcotics Secretary Humaira Ahmed, Senator Shafiq Tareen, Senator Naseebullah, ANF DG Major General Aniqur Rehman, and others participated.
During the huddle, Federal Minister for Anti-Narcotics Shah Zain Bugti hinted at using modern technology to prevent drug smuggling from abroad.
Bugti announced the establishment of a modern fusion centre while giving a national-level road map to prevent drug trafficking.
He said that the fusion centre to be established in Pakistan will be more sophisticated as compared to the six fusion centres established by the United States around the world. He said it will help the country get rid of the scourge of drugs.
He said state-of-the-art scanners and machines will be installed at the country's airports and borders to detect drugs and explosives in a modern way.
In the meeting, the chairman of the committee expressed anger at the representatives of the Federal Education Department on the sub-standard briefing on the measures to prevent the use of drugs in educational institutions and issued instructions to submit a report to the committee in the next meeting.
Meanwhile, DIG Operation Shehzad Nadeem Bukhari claimed to make Quaid-e-Azam University completely drug-free and assured that no drug complaint would be received from the university for the next six months.
ANF DG Major General Aniqur Rehman said in a briefing that after receiving a request from the Islamabad police, they have started the screening process at the time of admission to the university.
On this occasion, Minister Shah Zain Bugti also told the committee that synthetic drugs used to be smuggled by Africans are now being smuggled into the country by Pakistanis working abroad, which has made detection very hard.
Despite the lack of resources in the Ministry of Anti-Narcotics, 17 per cent of the drugs seized worldwide during a year were caught by the ANF and other agencies, he said.
The minister and Anti-Narcotics Secretary Humaira Ahmed told the committee that to prevent drug smuggling, it has been decided to equip airports, seaports, and borders with the latest machines.
Bugti while talking to The Express Tribune said at the proposed fusion centre, senior officers from the federal, and provincial ministries, health departments, FIA, ANF, and maritime security agencies will work under one roof to tackle the menace.
“The centre will monitor all issues from policy making to the implementation of measures to prevent drug trafficking and spread.” The federal minister further said that the fusion centre at the federal level will be completed in July and the inauguration will be held by the end of the same month.
