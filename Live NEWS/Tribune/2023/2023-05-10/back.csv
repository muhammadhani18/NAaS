0,SCBA condemns manner of arresting ex-PM,Urges govt to refrain from using state institutions as tools for political persecution,"The Supreme Court Bar Association on Tuesday strongly condemned the manner in which former prime minister Imran Khan was arrested from the Islamabad High Court that sparked widespread concerns regarding the state of democracy and rule of law in the country.
According to a statement issued by the SCBA, President Barrister Abid S Zuberi and Secretary Muqtedir Akhtar Shabbir urged the “government and law enforcement agencies to uphold the rule of law, adhere to the principles of democracy, and provide a fair and unbiased judicial process to the former prime minister and refrain from using state institutions as tools for political persecution and instead focus on fostering an environment of inclusivity and respect for human rights and law.”
They said that they stand with the rule of law, supremacy of the Constitution and independence of the institutions.
“The arrest, which occurred from inside the premises of the Islamabad High Court, has raised serious questions about the respect for fundamental rights and the impartiality of NAB (National Accountability Bureau)/law enforcement agencies.”

They also condemned the assault and torture perpetrated by the law enforcement agencies on lawyers during the entire episode and violated the sanctity of the court.
The SCBA denounced “this arrest from the court premises in the strongest possible terms over the charges that are widely perceived as politically motivated”.
They said that such arrest represented a clear infringement of the principles of democracy, freedom of expression, and the right to dissent.
“Being a citizen of this country, ones rights are protected under Article 4 read with articles 9, 10-A, 14 and 19 of the Constitution,” they opined.
They also condemned the violence being perpetrated and asserted that it was a fundamental right to a peaceful protest but no one should take the law in their hands.

1,Qureshi hints that he may be arrested next,PTI vice chairman says he’ll announce party’s next move keeping in view Imran’s instructions,"PTI Vice Chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi on Tuesday said he would announce the party’s next course of action keeping in view the instructions from its chairman, Imran Khan.
“If I am also arrested, someone else will take over the leadership of the party,” the former foreign minister told the media in Karachi.
Earlier in the day, Imran, who was ousted from the post of the prime minister in April last year, was arrested by Rangers personnel from the Islamabad High Court’s premises – a move that was later in the day declared legal by the court.
He was rounded up in connection with the Al-Qadir Trust case, wherein the PTI chief and his wife, Bushra Bibi, faced charges of  acquiring billions of rupees from a real estate company for legalising a laundered sum of Rs50 billion that was identified and returned to Pakistan by the UK during the former premier’s tenure.
Qureshi, in his media talk, continued that he condemned the party chief’s arrest.
“This move is unethical, illegal and unconstitutional.  Imran Khan's arrest is linked to London,” he maintained.
The PTI vice chairman said Imran had already recorded a video in his vehicle while travelling for biometrics and expressed his concerns that he might be arrested.
“In fact, he had asked [the authorities] himself to arrest him,” he added.
Qureshi maintained that Imran was the former prime minister and the head of the largest party in the country.
“After his arrest, people started protesting in different parts [of the country],” he continued.
The PTI leader maintained that it was up to the people to bring an end to the ongoing lawlessness in the country and they should stand up against it.
“Only then will the country be able to become stable and prosperous,” he added.
Qureshi explained that he had arrived in Karachi to inquire after the health of his wife, who was admitted to a hospital in the city.
He added that he would now return to Islamabad.
“If it’s my turn to get arrested, the flag of leadership will go to someone else,” he said.
“Like in the morning, it was with Imran Khan and now it is with me. Perhaps by night, it might be with somebody else,” he concluded.

2,Arrest hinders Imran’s path to second Pakistan innings,"With general elections due by October, PTI chief's political future plunges into uncertainty","Since being ousted from office by a vote of no confidence last year, former prime minister Imran Khan has vowed he will captain the country a second time.
But on Tuesday, the one-time international cricket star was arrested as he appeared at the Islamabad High Court to face one of a slew of cases levelled against him.
Since he was turfed out, 70-year-old Khan had successfully dodged detention and fought off dozens of charges which analysts say are a common tactic to quash dissent in Pakistan.
He also survived a November assassination attempt which saw him shot in the leg -- an attack he blamed on incumbent Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and a senior army officer.
The political drama has played out against a backdrop of economic freefall and dramatically increasing militant attacks, ahead of general elections due no later than October.
With the charismatic Khan now locked away and his legion of supporters being called out on the streets to violent protests, his political prospects -- and those of Pakistan -- are unclear.
Imran enjoyed genuine popular support when he became premier in 2018, but critics say he failed to deliver on promises to revitalise the economy and improve the plight of the poor.
His Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party was voted in by millions who grew up watching him play cricket, where he excelled as an all-rounder and led the nation to World Cup victory in 1992.
PTI overturned decades of dominance by the Pakistan Peoples Party and Pakistan Muslim League-N -- two usually feuding groups that joined forces to oust him in April 2022.
Imran’s vision was for Pakistan to become a welfare state modelled on the Islamic golden age of the seventh to 14th centuries, a period of cultural, economic and scientific flourishing in the Muslim world.
But he made little headway in improving Pakistan's financial situation, with galloping inflation, crippling debt and a feeble rupee undermining economic reform.
A deteriorating security situation, particularly since the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021, also happened on his watch.
The Oxford-educated son of a wealthy Lahore family, Khan had a reputation as a playboy until his retirement from international cricket.
For years he busied himself with charity projects, raising millions to build a cancer hospital to honour his mother.
He tiptoed into politics and for years held the PTI's only parliamentary seat.
But the party grew hugely during the military-led government of General Pervez Musharraf, becoming a genuine force in the 2013 elections before winning a majority five years later.
Running the country proved more difficult than sitting in opposition, however.
Double-digit inflation drove up the cost of basic goods, and Pakistan had to borrow heavily just to service foreign debt. Khan also fell out with the military -- key to political power in Pakistan.
Married three times, his current wife Bushra Bibi comes from a conservative family and wears a veil in public.
Often described as being impulsive and brash, Khan draws frequently on cricket analogies to describe his political battles. ""I fight till the very last ball,"" he said in one TV interview. AFP

3,SC rules PEMRA can’t suspend media licence,"Judgment comes in favour of PBA, upholding SHC decision","The Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled that the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) chairman did not have the authority to suspend licences of media channels.
“Pemra chairman’s authority to suspend the broadcast media licence is not legally valid therefore, it is declared null and void,” a nine-page judgment authored by Justice Muneeb Akhtar said.
“Section 13 of the Pemra Ordinance makes it clear that the chairman or any other person cannot suspend the licence,” the court said. “There are conditions for suspending a broadcast media licence,” it added.
According to the judgment, it was not clear as to who in Pemra had the authority to suspend the broadcast media licence.
In the 156th meeting, Pemra delegated powers, including suspension of licence, to its chairman. The Sindh High Court (SHC) had ordered Pemra to frame rules for suspension of licence.
The Pakistan Broadcasters Association (PBA) had challenged Pemra chairman's authority. The Supreme Court decided in favour of the PBA and upheld the decision of the SHC.

5,"NA panel to call SC registrar, ex-CJP’s son on 12th",Members question under which law SC seeks record of assembly proceedings,"A special committee of the National Assembly formed by its speaker has decided to call the Supreme Court registrar and former chief justice of Pakistan Saqib Nisar’s son to attend a meeting on Friday.
During the meeting, headed by its Chairman Aslam Bhootani, the matters of summoning the SC registrar and having the investigation of the purported audio leak of former CJP’s son, Najam Saqib, conducted by the Federal Investigation Agency were discussed.
Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz members Sheikh Rohail Asghar and Barjees Tahir insisted on summoning the SC registrar, while other members were divided.
The committee chairman said that the apex court asked for the record of the assembly proceedings and the committee should decide on this matter.
Asghar said, “Under which law the record of the proceedings is being sought?”
The committee chairman also said that the registrar would be asked why the top court needs the record and under which law?
The committee made the matter of summoning the SC registrar subject to the opinion of the Ministry of Law.
However, due to non-participation of the officials of the Ministry of Law in the meeting, the matter was postponed.
Bhootani decided to send the matter of non-cooperation of the Ministry of Law to the speaker and the prime minister.
On the issue of the alleged audio leak of former CJP’s son, Najam Saqib, the committee decided to write a letter to the Ministry of Interior to have the matter investigated by the FIA.
The committee will issue instructions to the Ministry of Interior regarding the investigation of the matter by the FIA.
The committee also sought a report from the FIA within 10 days after having the instructions passed from the interior ministry.
The members then decided to call Najam to attend the committee’s meeting.
In this regard, Chairman Bhootani said that Najam and the ticket holders should come to the committee’s meeting and give their stand on the matter.
However, at one point, the committee members were divided whether Najam should be called first or after the FIA conducted its investigation.
The chairman said, “The investigation will fulfil the requirements of justice.”
He appeared confident that the investigation would go in their favour.
“We are not against any organisation or person. We are against buying and selling [of tickets],” Bhootani said.
Towards the end, the committee members decided to call the SC registrar and Najam to attend a special meeting on Friday at 11am for further consideration on both the matters.

6,"A, O levels papers cancelled",It said that the decision to cancel the papers was taken while considering the country’s current situation," 
The A and O levels exams scheduled for Wednesday (today) in Pakistan were cancelled because of the current situation, according to a Cambridge Assessment International Education announcement on Tuesday.
It said that the decision to cancel the papers was taken while considering the country’s current situation. However, since these papers would still be conducted around the world on the same day, the cancellation would only apply to Pakistan.
A spokesperson said that the O-level physics examination and the A-level mathematics paper were scheduled for Wednesday, but they would not be conducted. Instead, the results would be marked on the basis of the result of the other papers in the same subjects.

7,"SCBA, PBC decide to bury hatchet",SC disposes of petition as both lawyer bodies reach an agreement to end dispute,"The ongoing dispute between the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) and the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) has been resolved thanks to the efforts of some lawyers.
Both the bar associations will undo the steps they had taken against each other and Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Awan will play a role in this regard.
This was decided during the hearing of a petition filed by two SCBA officials— SCBA President Abid Zuberi and Secretary Muqtedir Akhtar Shabbir—against the PBC’s decision to remove them from their posts on allegations of misconduct.
The counsel for the SCBA officials, Hamid Khan, contended that the PBC exceeded its authority when it issued notices to Zuberi and Shabbir.
The PBC counsel, Ahsan Bhawan, however, raised objection to the maintainability of the SCBA petition.
“The SCBA should have approached the relevant high court. However, the SCBA even hid the fact from the SC that it had already submitted a petition in high court,” he said.
Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar said the PBC should use its authority according to the law.
“Did the PBC issue any notices to the SCBA president, secretary and additional secretary? Did it give them a chance to present their view? If they were given a chance to present their views then why did it refer the matter to the disciplinary action committee?”
Bhawan said the disciplinary action committee will decide about the licenses of these office-bearers.
Justice Mazhar asked Bhawan where an appeal could be filed against the decision of the PBC. Bhawan replied that the committee that issues an order also hears appeals against its order.
The judge asked if there was any possibility of an agreement [Razinama] between the lawyers of the two lawyers’ forums.
A lawyer, Hasan Raza Pasha, informed the court that some office-bearers and members of the two bodies had held a meeting just then and the two sides had agreed to undo the measures they had taken against each other.
He said the SCBA president will take all members into confidence before taking any decision in future.
Upon assurances of both the PBC and the SCBA, the court incorporated the agreement between the two bodies into its order and disposed of the petition.

8,PMD predicts rise in temperature,"Farmers should adopt appropriate measures for the weather conditions while irrigating crops, they said"," 
The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Tuesday issued a warning to all citizens of the country to adopt precautionary measures from May 10 to 13 as there was a possibility that the temperature would increase by up to five degrees Celsius.

9,Contempt of parliament bill tabled in NA,Speaker refers ‘the Contempt of Majlis-e-Shoora Bill 2023’ to relevant house committee,"The treasury and the opposition in the National Assembly joined ranks on Tuesday to prevent the contempt of parliament through legislation proposed by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) member Rana Qasim Noon.
During the session, chaired by Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, Noon moved ‘The Contempt of Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament) Bill 2023’, aimed at punishing those involved in the contempt of parliament or a committee or breach of privilege of a house or a member.
The government and opposition members, including Law Minister Azam Nazir Tarar, opposed the immediate approval of the bill and asked the chair to send it to the Standing Committee to Law and Justice for further deliberations.
“Only parliament has the power to amend the Constitution and enact legislation,” Tarar told the house. “While interpreting the Constitution, the institutions must keep into consideration the authority of parliament,” he added.
Minister of State for Law and Justice Shahadat Awan said that the house must adopt a proper procedure to unanimously pass this important bill. “The standing committee will further fine-tune the bill and remove any lacunae,” he added.
Appreciating the opposition lawmaker for introducing “such an important bill in the house”, the minister of state said that it would help establish the writ of parliament. He urged other state institutions to work within their constitutional domains.
Opposition Leader Raja Riaz said that as it was a matter of parliament’s prestige and supremacy therefore, there was no need for referring the bill to the committee. However, the mover agreed to calls for sending the bill to the committee.
Later, speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf referred the bill to the house Standing Committee on Law and Justice for further deliberation. The speaker directed the committee to report back to the house within seven days.
Meanwhile, several lawmakers from both sides of the divide expressed their views on the bill. Shaikh Rohale Asghar of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) proposed to the speaker to take consent of the house instead of forwarding it to the committee.
PML-N’s Javed Latif said the bill was the voice of the house and sought the speaker’s ruling on it. He said that the policy of “forget and move ahead” would no longer work. He urged the institutions to seek guidance from parliament.
Mir Ghulam Ali Talpur of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) said amendments to the law was the need of the hour. “The bill should be passed without any further delay. There is no logic in sending it to the committee,” he added.
Independent member Aslam Bhootani termed the bill a historic one. Abdul Akbar Chitrali of the Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) said, “We must keep our house in order instead of inviting a third party to get involved in the affairs of Parliament”.
Sabir Kaimkhani of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), Muhammad Hashim Notezai of the Balochistan National Party (BNP) and the PPP’s Nafisa Shah and the PTI’s Sardar Riaz Mazari supported bill.
PTI’s Mohsin Leghari. PML-N’s Mehnaz Akber Aziz and Sheikh Fayyazud Din opined that the bill should not be given a blind approval and it should be sent to the committee for further consideration.
