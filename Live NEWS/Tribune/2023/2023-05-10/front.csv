Britain’s Foreign Secretary James Cleverly told a joint news conference in Washington with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken that they wanted to see peaceful democracy in Pakistan.
Cleverly noted that Britain enjoyed “a longstanding and close relationship” with Commonwealth member Pakistan. “We want to see peaceful democracy in that country. We want to see the rule of law adhered to,” Cleverly said. “I’m uncomfortable to speculate any further without having a detailed briefing on that,” he added.
“We just want to make sure that whatever happens in Pakistan is consistent with the rule of law, with the constitution,” Blinken said. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said: “As we have said before, the United States does not have a position on one political candidate or party versus another.”

1,Power struggle: Another ex-PM joins ‘illustrious’ arrest list,Experts say political and other forces haven’t learnt from the past,"Power politics based on unprincipled and brutal struggle among politicians as well as some members of the state institutions finally led on Tuesday to add another former prime minister’s name to the so-called “illustrious list” of those arrested.
The arrest of former prime minister and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan not only triggered protests in different cities but also led to unprecedented attacks on some sensitive installations.
Some experts had no doubt that the political as well as other forces haven’t learnt anything from the past as the desire to keep running the country without having a “non-partisan state structure” was evident in such arrests.
“It’s all about power politics,” said eminent scholar Prof Dr Hassan Askari. “The only difference this time around is that the state institutions have come into it,” he added.
Currently, the professor continued, one side is going against some judges of the Supreme Court, while the other side is going against some officials of the military. However, he said, all these things had nothing to do with the real issues of the country and its people.
At the moment, Prof Askari said, “an unprincipled and brutal struggle” was going on in Pakistan. “It has two dimensions: power struggle among the political elite and political parties versus the state institutions,” he added.
Askari opined that Imran’s arrest might satisfy some leaders or some people in the institutions but it sent a negative message to the world. Pakistan, he continued, was faltering in respect of effective functioning of the state while the economy was being undermined the most.
Commenting on Imran’s joining the “illustrious list” of the arrested politicians, including Nawaz Sharif, Asif Zardari, Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and Maryam Nawaz and others, Askari said that “we haven’t learnt any lessons from the past.
“We do not want a non-partisan state structure; we want action against the rivals,” Askari said, citing the example of the PTI going after the PML-N during its tenure, and the PML-N going after PTI even when it was at the “fag end” of its rule.
“This bad trend of arresting top political leaders continues,” Askari said. He noted that the ruling alliance felt that Imran’s arrest would weaken the PTI. “It might happen but simultaneously, chances are that it will increase PTI’s popularity.”
In both the PTI and the PML-N tenures, he said, those in power continued to justify action against their rivals.
Abdul Moiz Jaferii, a lawyer and political analyst, said that the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) had remained a tool of the establishment for several years and it was being used against Imran, the same way Imran had used it against his rivals when he was in the government. “NAB has no credibility. We all know, who is behind Imran’s arrest.”
Jaferii, who also writes for different publications, said that the trend of arresting key political leaders would continue unless the “usurpers” are properly dealt with, adding that arresting Imran forspeaking against some army officials was incorrect.
Listing different reasons for someone’s arrest, Jaferii said that a person was arrested if he had been danger to the society; if he could influence his/her case or witnesses; if he/she was a flight risk; and if he was not cooperating at the investigation stage.
“He [Imran] can be called a misogynist, but he is not going to flee abroad,” Jaferii said, adding that his name could be placed on the Exit Control List (ECL) if one felt that he was a flight risk.
In fact, Jaferii continued, the concept of arresting under the NAB law was questionable but this is what Imran used to do, and the same was happening to him now. “Arresting someone just to harass him is wrong,” he said.
Commenting on the attacks on sensitive installations, Jaferii said that people were responding in an unprecedented way because they felt that the unelected people were usurping their rights.
When asked where this situation could lead, Jaferii said that martial law would long have been imposed in the country had the country’s economy could bear the brunt of it or had any foreign powers were happy to see it happening. “Who would want to impose martial law just for announcing bankruptcy in a few months’ time,” he said.
Prof Askari, however, did not rule out the possibility of martial law, especially, after attacks on key buildings. He said that blame would be on all political parties as everyone was contributing to the ongoing chaos.

2,"Army called out in Punjab, K-P as 6 die in violence","PTI leaders Asad Umar, Omer Cheema among over 1,000 arrested","Army troops were called out in Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) on Wednesday, as authorities sought to quell the deadly unrest following the arrest of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan.
In the two provinces, at least six people died in violence which continued for the second consecutive day on Wednesday. Authorities arrested nearly 1,500 PTI workers and leaders in Lahore, Islamabad, Peshawar and other parts of the country.
Government buildings and assets were attacked and set ablaze by protesters in many cities in the two days. The authorities said that scores of policemen were severely injured in clashes with the protesters.
In view of the unrest, the federal cabinet approved the deployment of Pakistan Army under Article 245 of the Constitution in Punjab, K-P, and the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) on the recommendation of the interior ministry.
The cabinet meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, took stock of the overall situation in the country and strongly condemned violent incidents leading to damages to properties in different cities.
According to the PM Office’s Media Wing, the ministers berated the PTI and its Chairman Imran for a non-stop diatribe against the national institutions and their leadership.
According to a notification issued by the interior ministry, ""the exact number of troops or assets, date and area of deployment will be worked out by the provincial governments in consultation with"" the military officials.

""The exact number of troops or assets, date and area of deployment will be worked out by the provincial government in consultation with"" the military officials, the orders stated.
""The date of de-requisitioning of said deployment will be decided subsequently after mutual consultation among the stakeholders,"" it added.

The military issued a separate statement saying it had shown restraint during earlier violence but any further attacks on the military or law enforcement agencies, state installations and properties ""will be met with severe retaliation"".
Meanwhile, violent clashes continued in multiple cities for the second consecutive day on Wednesday. Officials at the Edhi Foundation reported two deaths in Lahore, while another four were reported from Peshawar.

The protesters closed down markets in Peshawar and other parts of K-P. Multiple petrol and CNG stations were also closed. The BRT service was restored but the number of commuters was low.
Colleges across the province had been closed until May 14 while all government and private schools until May 13. The matriculation exams had also been postponed, officials said.
At least four people were killed and 84 sustained injuries in Peshawar. The PTI supporters led by former K-P minister Shaukat Yousafzai blocked the main GT Road near Hashtnagri.
Later, a mob clashed with the police and vandalised the Radio Pakistan building.
“Hundreds of miscreants stormed the Radio Pakistan building and wreaked havoc in the newsroom and various other sections,” Radio Pakistan Director General Tahir Hassan said.
“In today's attack, the protestors vandalised the building and tortured the staff, including women. They set fire to Chagai Yadgar and Radio Auditorium. Records and other materials, including parked vehicles, were destroyed in the arson,"" he added.
The four bodies and at least 27 injured were taken to the Lady Reading Hospital (LRH), while another seven injured were transferred to the Khyber Teaching Hospital (KTH). Medics said that many injured had sustained bullet injuries.
In Punjab, where two people died in violence, police said that over 14 government buildings were attacked, looted, and seriously damaged by the protestors, while more than 25 vehicles were also destroyed or burned.
Officials said that more than 130 police officers were severely injured during the violent clashes. ""Those who injure citizens, police officers and personnel, damage property will be brought to justice,"" Punjab police chief Usman Anwar warned.
According to the Islamabad police, Srinagar Highway had been shut for traffic with diversions placed on both sides.

In neighbouring Rawalpindi, protesters set metro bus stations on fire during clashes with the police.
Meanwhile, of the 1,500 held in a countrywide crackdown, at least 1,380 were arrested on charges of rioting in Punjab, 33 in K-P, and 44 in different parts of Balochistan.
Prominent among those who were arrested were PTI Secretary General Asad Umar, former Punjab governor Omer Sarfraz Cheema, PTI Sindh President Ali Zaidi, and senior party leader Fawad Chaudhry, according to the officials and PTI office-bearers.
Fawad was arrested from the Supreme Court, where he had gone to challenge the arrest of Imran. Fawad stayed inside the building for hours, knowing that the police had come to arrest him. He was taken into custody, when he came out at night.
Umar was arrested from the IHC premises – from where Imran was arrested on Tuesday.
Confirming the arrest, PTI leader Shireen Mazari said that Umar was ""arrested by [the] anti-terror squad from IHC"".
According to PTI lawyer Faisal Chaudhry, the former minister was arrested from the “small gate” of the court.
The lawyer stated that he did not know under which case the arrest was made.
Former Punjab governor Cheema was arrested during a raid at his house in Lahore by the Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE).
PTI leader Hammad Azhar confirmed in a tweet that Cheema was arrested in the wee hours of Wednesday.
The PTI said that in Karachi, its Sindh President Zaidi was taken into custody on Tuesday evening. Officials said raids were conducted to arrest PTI's Khurram Sher Zaman and other leaders, however they were not found at their residences.
In Quetta, where one protester was killed during clashes on Tuesday, police conducted raids at the houses of former Balochistan governor Syed Zahoor Agha and arrested his younger brother.
The police also conducted raid at the residence of former National Assembly deputy speaker Qasam Khan Suri but no arrest was made. PTI Balochistan President Munir Baloch said 11 PTI workers had been injured in the clashes.
There were also rumours about the arrest of senior party leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi.
However, the PTI vice chairman rejected such rumours, saying that all kinds of tactics were being used to create panic and spread misinformation.
Meanwhile, in response to the escalating protests in Sindh, the authorities banned the gathering of more than four individuals and all kinds of demonstrations, protests, and rallies.
According to a notification issued by the provincial government, Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) had been invoked to maintain law and order and prevent further unrest.

3,May 9 is history’s dark chapter: army,ISPR warns miscreants of consequences,"Declaring May 9 as ‘black day’, the army on Wednesday warned that any further attack on it or state institutions or any law enforcement agency will be dealt with full force.
A day after violent protesters ransacked the residence of Corps Commander Lahore and broke the gates of General Headquarters in Rawalpindi, the army, through its media wing, issued a stern warning to those creating law and order situation in the country.
“May 9 will be remembered as a dark chapter,” read the statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
The statement said PTI Chairman Imran Khan, as per the statement of National Accountability Bureau (NAB), was taken into custody on Tuesday “legally” from the Islamabad High Court. “Immediately after his arrest, there were organised attacks on army properties and installations and anti-army slogans were raised,” the statement said.
The ISPR said that on the one hand, “these miscreants evoke the nation’s emotions for achieving their limited and selfish objectives and on the other hand, they deceive people, continuing to highlight the army’s importance”.
“This is an example of hypocrisy,” it stated.
The military’s media wing said that “this group wearing a political cloak” has done what enemies could not do in 75 years, all “in the lust for power”.

“The army showed patience and restraint and exercised extreme tolerance, not even caring about its reputation, in the larger interest of the country,” it said.
“With this situation created under a nefarious planning, a heinous attempt was made to make the army give an immediate reaction, which could be used for nefarious political purposes.
“The army’s mature response thwarted this conspiracy. We are well aware that behind it were orders, directives and complete pre-planning by some sinister party leadership,” the statement added.
“Facilitators, planners and political activists involved in these operations have been identified and strict action will be taken against them as per the law and all these evil elements will now be responsible for the consequences.”
The significant part of the statement was that the army clearly warned that any further attack on the army, including all law enforcement agencies, military and state installations and properties will be severely retaliated against the very group that “wants to push Pakistan into a civil war”.
The statement further noted that one could be allowed to incite people and take the law into their hands. The strongly-worded reaction from the army suggests that the battle lines have been drawn and it seems the situation has reached a point of no return.
Following the storming of the corps commanders residence and the GHQ, there is a talk of banning the Tehreek-e-Insaf.

4,ATC acquits ex-cops in Model Town tragedy case,"Court allows acquittal plea of former IG, Mushtaq Sukhera, former DIG Abdul Jabar and DPO Kasur Tariq Aziz","An anti-terrorism court on Wednesday acquitted former Inspector General (IG) of Punjab Police Mushtaq Sukhera, former DIG operations Abdul Jabar, district police officer (DPO) Kasur Tariq Aziz and others in the 2014 Model Town tragedy case.
The accused police officials had submitted applications before the ATC for their acquittal, contending that false allegations had been levelled against them and that they had nothing to do with the case.
The Model Town tragedy was a violent clash between the Punjab police and the Pakistan Awami Tehreek (PAT) activists on June 17, 2014. As a result of the clash, 14 people were killed, while more than 100 sustained injuries.
During the case hearing in the ATC, PAT counsel had argued that substantial evidence established the involvement of the accused persons in the incident. The counsel had requested the court to dismiss the acquittal pleas.
Previously, the court had acquitted the former district coordination officer of Lahore Capt (retd) Muhammad Usman in this case. The court had observed that the plaintiff, PAT, could not establish the allegations against the accused.
ATC judge Ejaz Ahmad Buttar said in the judgment that the role of the accused police officials in the alleged conspiracy could not be established. The court concluded that there was no probability of the conviction of the accused in this case.

In the case, the court had indicted more than 120 persons, including 116 police officials, on a private complaint filed by Idara Minhajul Quran for seeking their trial on charges of killing its workers.
In 2017, the court had partially admitted the complaint against 125 officials of the police and the district government, but it declined to include former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, then chief minister Shahbaz Sharif and federal and provincial ministers.
 Those, who were excluded from the case, included Hamza Shahbaz, Rana Sanaullah, Khwaja Saad Rafiq, Khwaja Asif, Pervaiz Rashid, Abid Sher Ali, Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, Syed Tauqir Shah Azam Suleman and Rashid Langrial.

5,Imran handed in NAB custody for eight days,PTI chief indicted in Toshakhana case despite 'boycotting' proceedings,"Announcing its reserved verdict, an anti-graft court on Wednesday granted the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) eight-day physical remand of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan in the Al-Qadir Trust case.
In a separate case, a sessions court also indicted the PTI chief in the Toshakhana case even though the PTI chief and his legal team boycotted the proceedings.
Both the hearings were held at the Islamabad Police Lines, which was given the status of a court venue as a “one-time dispensation” late on Tuesday night, amid tight security.
During the hearing of the Al-Qadir Trust case, Judge Muhammad Bashir conducted the hearing of the case at the New Police Guest House earlier in the day, where NAB presented the reasons behind the former prime minister's arrest, and sought his 14-day physical remand.
However, Imran's legal team opposed the NAB's request. His lawyer Khawaja Harris maintained that the PTI chief will cooperate in the investigation and that there was ""no need for a physical remand"".
Deputy Prosecutor General NAB Sardar Muzaffar Abbasi, Special Prosecutor Rafi Maqsood, NAB investigation officer Mian Umar Nadeem and NAB Prosecutor Sardar Zulqarnain were present at the hearing.
The PTI chief was represented by Khawaja Harris, Barrister Ali Gohar and Advocate Ali Bukhari.
During the hearing, the NAB prosecutor told the accountability court that the arrest warrant was shown to Imran Khan at the time of his arrest.
However, the PTI chief maintained that he was shown the warrant when he reached the NAB office.
In his arguments, the NAB prosecutor told the court that “this is a case of corruption which was investigated by National Crime Agency (NAC) of the UK.”
“The money in this case was to be transferred to the government of Pakistan,” he added.

Haris argued that, “My client was illegally arrested.” “Proper method was not adopted to arrest Imran. [The] NAB sent a notice, but when did it convert the complaint into a reference?” he questioned.
The lawyer maintained that “Imran is also being dragged in many other cases”, adding that “my client will join the investigation and cooperate in it”. The court later reserved its verdict.
During the proceedings, PTI chief Imran Khan told the accountability court that he was fearful for his life.
“I have not been to the washroom in 24 hours,” the former prime minister said during the proceedings of the Al-Qadir Trust case.
The PTI chief requested the court to grant his personal physician Dr Faisal Sultan access to him. ""I am afraid I will meet the same fate as 'Maqsood Chaprasi',"" Imran said in reference to an alleged key witness in Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's money laundering case who passed away due to a cardiac arrest last year. The PTI had termed the witness' death 'mysterious'.
""They give [you] an injection, and [you] slowly die,"" the ex-premier said.
Toshakhana case
Additional and District Sessions Judge Humayun Dilawar indicted the former prime minister Imran Khan on charges of selling state gifts during his four years in power.
The former prime minister's indictment followed a decision by the Election Commission of Pakistan in October, which found him guilty of illegally selling state gifts between 2018 and 2022 and barred him from holding public office until the next election due in November.
He has denied any wrongdoing. Speaking to the media after the hearing of the case, Imran’s lawyer Sher Afzal Marwat said that the former prime minister and lawyers boycotted the indictment proceedings.

He maintained that the court indicted the PTI chief despite him expressing lack of confidence on the judge hearing the case.
“We are going to the Supreme Court against the high court’s yesterday's decision,” Marwat said while referring to the IHC ruling that Imran’s arrest was legal.
Mohsin Shahnawaz Ranjha, a lawmaker from the ruling coalition who was a plaintiff in the case against Khan on state gifts, confirmed his indictment and said the former premier had put the ""country's peace at stake"".
PTI moves IHC, SC
Hours after the location of Imran's hearing in the anti-graft case was changed, lawyer Faisal Chaudhry filed a petition challenging the move in the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
In the plea, he requested the court to declare the notification of ""forming a police line court illegal"", adding that Imran's legal team should be allowed to meet him.
Advocate Chaudhry also maintained that ""not making the legal team meet with Imran Khan will affect the fair trial"".
In a separate development, the former ruling party has challenged Imran Khan’s arrest in the Supreme Court (SC).
The PTI has filed a constitutional petition in the top court through lawyer Khawaja Haris, pleading “Imran Khan's arrest is illegal.”
The petition has also requested the apex court to annul IHC’s order declaring Imran’s arrest as legal and to order to produce the deposed premier before the court.
Abrupt change in hearing venue
In a notification dated May 9, the government announced that Imran's court hearings location has been changed.
In a notification issued late on Tuesday night, however, the office of the Chief Commissioner Islamabad Capital Territory said that the venue for the hearing had been changed to the police guesthouse in Islamabad.


As part of a ""one-time dispensation"", the local administration declared ""New Police Guest House, Police Lines Headquarters H 11/1, Islamabad, the venue for hearing of case titled 'District Election Commissioner Vs Imran Khan Niazi' and for the appearance of Mr Imran Khan Niazi before Honorable Judge Accountability Court - I, Islamabad on 10th May 2023, instead of F-8 Court Complex, Islamabad and Judicial Complex G 11/4, Islamabad.""
Imran was also scheduled to appear before a local court in the federal capital set to indict the former prime minister on May 10 in the Toshakhana case, filed by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
PTI lawyers allowed access
Amid strict security measures, three of Imran's lawyers, namely, Khawaja Haris, Ali Bukhari and Barrister Gohar were allowed to enter the police lines headquarters.
Notably, the PTI had provided a list of 20 lawyers, but only three of them had been permitted to enter the premises.
Meanwhile, the PTI leadership has been barred from the venue of the hearing.
These include senior party leaders Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Asad Umar, and Chief Minister Gilgit Baltistan Muhammad Khalid Khurshid Khan.
Several PTI leaders, including Ali Nawaz Awan, have been stopped at the Kashmir Highway and only authorised persons are being permitted to enter police lines.
Why is @ImranKhanPTI not being allowed legal representation?

Why are his lawyers and senior leadership not being allowed to meet him?

Why has a police line house been converted into a temporary court.

Why are you hiding Imran Khan?#ReleaseImranKhan
Qureshi took to Twitter to question why Imran was “not being allowed legal representation?” and “why are his lawyers and senior leadership not being allowed to meet him?”.
