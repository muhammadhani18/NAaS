0,Aramco’s first quarter profit down by 19%,Saudi oil giant’s net profit was 3.75% higher than in the fourth quarter,"Saudi oil giant Aramco’s first quarter net profit dropped 19% from a year earlier to 119.54 billion riyals ($31.88 billion), it said on Tuesday, due to lower crude prices.
Profit still beat analysts’ median forecast of $30.8 billion, according to Refinitiv data, and Aramco said the decline was partially offset by lower taxes including in the zakat Islamic tax and a rise in finance and other income.
Net profit was 3.75% higher than in the fourth quarter.
Yousef Husseini, head of materials at EFG Hermes Research, said there was no material surprise in Aramco’s results, “with the company performing in line with its ability at prevailing oil prices and taking into account production cuts.”
“But, the real positive surprise, which we think will be well received by the market, is that Aramco finally decided to up its dividend policy and include a clear link to its performance.”
Aramco’s shares closed the day up 3.2% at 33.6 riyals a share after rising as much as 7.2% earlier in the session.
Aramco said it will pay $19.5 billion in dividends for the first quarter, in line with the previous quarter.
CEO Amin Nasser said in a statement that Aramco was looking at introducing performance-linked dividends, in addition to its base distribution.
The additional payouts would target 50%-70% of annual free cash flow, net of the base dividend and other amounts including external investments, the company said.
The world’s top oil exporter made a record profit of over $161 billion for 2022 on higher energy prices and production.
Last month, Saudi Arabia and other OPEC+ producers announced surprise oil production cuts from May, initially driving up prices, but global economic uncertainty and an unclear demand outlook continue to weigh on prices.
Crude petroleum and natural gas contributed 32.7% of Saudi Arabia’s gross domestic product last year, with petroleum refining making up another 6%.

1,"Pakistan, US to develop green energy roadmap","State petroleum minister, US officials discuss ways to enhance energy productivity","Minister of State for Petroleum Musadik Masood Malik on Monday discussed with senior US officials ways to enhance productivity in the energy sector, help Pakistan make inroads into the global value chain and establish cross-border networks that bring a product or service from conception to market.
During a meeting with US Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) Regional Director for Indo-Pacific Verinda Fike and USTDA Country Manager for Indo-Pacific Region Tanvi Madhusudanan, Malik discussed various ideas to ensure energy security, affordability and sustainability in the wake of challenges like climate change and its socio-economic impact on Pakistan, according to a statement issued by the Pakistani embassy.
The two sides agreed to develop a roadmap for pursuing new businesses in the green and renewable energy sector, both in public and private sectors. The US side would provide financial and technical expertise for undertaking feasibility studies for mutually agreed projects.
“A delegation of Pakistani businessmen would be visiting the US along with their counterparts from Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand to study methane abatement technologies and conversion of bio-methane into fertilisers in the first quarter of next year,” the statement said.
The US side showed “great interest” in pursuing projects related to green ammonia, green hydrogen and renewables in Pakistan.
Malik emphasised that Pakistan in collaboration with the US would like to trailblaze the transition towards clean and green energy in the developing world.

2,Minister lays stress on skill development,Says IT ministry has set 100% growth target for exports,"Federal Minister for Information Technology and Telecommunication Syed Aminul Haque has said that Google’s programmes of skill development in emerging technologies and soft skills are aligned with the vision of IT ministry.
“In this era of digitalisation, limited skills are never enough; young people need to stay updated with the fast-paced trendy world,” he remarked.
Addressing the Google Career Certificates 2.0 launch ceremony on Tuesday, the minister pointed out that with more than two-thirds of the population under 30 years of age, Pakistan boasted of an enormous potential of its young people.
“This demographic presents a unique opportunity for growth and development, if we can harness their talents and channel them in the right direction.”
Haque said that in pursuit of the objective of increasing IT exports, the IT ministry collaborated with both public and private-sector stakeholders to set a goal of 100% export growth in the coming years.
“Achieving this target requires skilled youth trained in latest technologies to meet demands of the market.”
Discussing the programme, the IT minister said that the good thing about the Google Career Certificate Scholarships for skill development courses “is whether you are new to some field or don’t have a relevant academic background, you can still enroll for the course”.
He highlighted that Google in collaboration with partners IRM and Tech Valley would give a total of 44,500 scholarships to Pakistanis this year.
Google have announced three highly demanded courses which include business intelligence, advanced data analytics and cyber-security.
“These programmes will ensure that Pakistanis are ready for the future of job economy,” he said.
“Our focus is on women and urban youth, both of which are underrepresented and in need of these skills and certifications.”

3,Men’s garments export to China rises 29% in Q1,Commercial counsellor attributes growth to strong manufacturing capability,"Pakistani men’s garment exports to China showed a significant growth of 29% in the first quarter of 2023.
“This growth can be attributed to Pakistan’s strong manufacturing capability and high quality of its garments,” said Ghulam Qadir, Commercial Counsellor of Pakistan Embassy in Beijing, on Tuesday.
“In the first three months of 2023, men’s garment exports from Pakistan to China reached approximately $6 million compared to $4.27 million in the same period in 2022, representing a 29% increase.”
Exports of men’s or
boys’ trousers fetched $3.47 million as compared to $1.67 million in January-March 2022.
Qadir shared that Pakistan was preparing to host the largest textile exhibition in the current month, China Economic Net (CEN) reported.
Over 70 top fabric enterprises have already confirmed their participation and it is anticipated that more than 100 Chinese textile enterprises will also take part in the event.

4,More Iranian fuel being smuggled to Pakistan,Dealers say 35% of diesel sold in country has reached markets illegally,"Petroleum dealers have flagged a surge in the smuggling of Iranian fuel to Pakistan, saying that up to 35% of diesel sold in the country has arrived illegally from Iran, the Pakistan Petroleum Dealers Association (PPDA) told Reuters on Tuesday.
The association said that in the past, the smuggling of fuel was limited to the province of Balochistan, but it has now spread to the rest of the country.
In April, the energy ministry asked security forces to clamp down on fuel smuggling from Iran, according to an official memo seen by Reuters. The memo said diesel sales have slumped “more than 40%” due to smuggled products.
Pakistan mostly meets its demand for fuel from the Middle East, but it is also smuggled in through its western border with Iran.
The minister of state for petroleum was not immediately available for comment.
The country is facing a balance of payments crisis with barely enough foreign exchange reserves to cover a month’s imports. It is undertaking several measures, including raising fuel prices, to unlock a $1.1 billion tranche of aid from the International Monetary Fund.
Fuel prices have jumped Rs143, or nearly 100%, in the last 12 months.
Oil product sales have dropped 46% to 8.8 million barrels in April compared to last year, according to the Oil Companies Advisory Council. A breakdown shows diesel sales have slumped 50% year-on-year. This excludes smuggled fuel.
According to an S&P Global Commodity Insights report, Iranian fuel is around Rs53 cheaper than the official retail price per litre.
“Private dealers have been able to make decent profits by selling Iranian diesel Rs35-per-litre cheaper than local dealers,” it added.
The energy ministry said that according to the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra), around 4,000 tonnes per day of fuel smuggled into Pakistan was causing a total revenue loss of around Rs10.2 billion a month.
PPDA said that Iranian fuel smuggled into Pakistan was further hurting the industry, already reeling from low sales.

5,Food security at risk without R&D,"PFVA demands Rs3b for research to increase crop yield, produce quality fruits","Pakistan’s food security is at risk due to the lack of investment in research and development (R&D) in the horticulture sector, warn experts. The country’s crop yields are decreasing, and the quality of produce is poor, making it vulnerable to pests and diseases.
The Patron-in-Chief of Pakistan Fruit and Vegetable Exporters Association (PFVA), Waheed Ahmed, has suggested allocating a fund of Rs3 billion for R&D in the horticulture sector.
“Horticulture is an essential subsector of agriculture and has a significant impact on improving human nutrition,” said agriculture sector analyst Waqas Ghani Kukaswadia while speaking to The Express Tribune. He emphasised the importance of R&D, which influences farm productivity and output, food costs, and poverty reduction.
The Pakistan Horticulture Development and Export Board was established to promote the sector as it has export potential. However, there are challenges with regard to traceability, compliance with international standards, capacity to manage perishables, cold chain management and storage, and marketing.
To assist producers in efficient harvesting, packing, shipping, and marketing the produce, the government must provide horticulturists and extension personnel with the necessary training. Pakistan must focus on high-value crops to enhance horticulture exports, said Ahmed.
The market for citrus fruits in the world is worth $300 billion, of which Pakistan’s share is only $20 million. Similarly, in the export of value-added products of horticulture, Pakistan is also behind with a ratio of only 3%.
To increase fruit exports, Pakistan should focus on value-added crops rather than quantity, including seedless Kinnow, production of table-grade varieties of dates, production of oranges for juice, and tomatoes, said PFVA patron-in-chief.
Production of paste-specific tomatoes, ginger, saffron, blemish-free bananas, production of starchy potatoes, varieties of cherries, and new varieties of onions, including berries, are included.
“We are already facing the consequences of the lack of quality research in horticulture. Our yields are one of the lowest. For example, mango yields in Pakistan are about five tonnes per acre, internationally it’s between 15 and 25,” said Mahmood Nawaz Shah, Senior Vice President of Sindh Abadghar Board (SAB). Although our food security paradigm is just around wheat, the horticulture sector is likely to bring about employment generation, forex, and can stand on its own feet, he said.
Pakistan is at the top of the agricultural regions being the most affected by climate change, where agricultural production is likely to decrease by 50% by 2025 in case of a 3% increase in global temperature. Pakistan already has 16 to 62% less per hectare production of fruits than the leading countries. “There is a dire need to replace outdated farming and horticultural practices with modern methods, including insect-resistant planting materials and modern nurseries, modern climate change management methods, including recycling of resources at the farm level, and adopting methods for water-efficient use, including drip irrigation,” said Ahmed.
Speaking to the Express Tribune, President of Concave Agri Services Muhammad Ali Iqbal said, “Pakistan is facing serious challenges in farming, especially horticulture, due to the lack of R&D in germ plasm, breeding, and seed development.” The country needs coded development according to international standardisation. Unfortunately, the focus has remained on staple food, and horticulture is ignored, leading to the import of hybrid seeds for vegetables causing outflow of forex reserves. No new varieties of seeds of horticulture are discovered with disease-free attributes. This has now caused serious issues related to Food Security.
“Some Rs3 billion R&D fund may be a starting point again, as many similar projects have been run to support the R&D in horticulture sector in other countries, and it has proven to be a successful investment,” said Iqbal. He emphasised the need for the government and private sector to collaborate and invest in R&D to bring about a positive change in the horticulture sector.
Without investment in R&D, Pakistan’s food security remains at risk, and the horticulture sector will continue to struggle with decreasing crop yields, poor quality produce, and vulnerability to pests and diseases. The government needs to focus on high-value crops and provide necessary training to producers to efficiently harvest, pack, ship, and market the produce.

6,"Oil, gas firms post profits in face of debt",Circular debt has been piling up for years and has now crossed a staggering Rs1.6 trillion,"Pakistan’s state-run oil and gas companies are facing a serious challenge of circular debt that is putting the oil and gas supply chain and their future investment plans at stake. Despite witnessing growth, the companies are struggling to cope with the mounting debt that could collapse the entire industry. Circular debt has been piling up for years, and all governments have failed to find a solution to the problem. It has now crossed a staggering Rs1.6 trillion.
According to industry experts and officials, circular debt has the potential to bring down the entire oil and gas supply chain if the government fails to clear it. Pakistan’s economy is already grappling with high inflation, regressed growth, and increasing financial vulnerabilities in FY23. Large-scale manufacturing declined by 4.4% (Jul-Jan) compared to the same period last year, and vehicle sales dropped by 35%. The petroleum industry has also witnessed a significant decline in white oil sales due to a slowdown in economic activities and inflating fuel prices.
Pakistan State Oil (PSO), the country’s largest state oil company, is facing the brunt of circular debt. Despite posting a net profit in the recent financial results, the company is struggling to manage its receivables from various sectors. PSO receivables against different sectors continue to balloon up at Rs731 billion as on May 8, 2023. SNGPL has to pay Rs457 billion on account of LNG supply, while the power sector has to pay Rs179 billion to PSO. State-run Gencos, Hubco, and Kapco are also defaulting on their payments, with PSO to pay Rs67 billion to local oil refineries.
Despite these challenges, the three public sector petroleum companies, namely PSO, Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL), and Oil and Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL), have posted strong financial results for the nine months ended March 31, 2023. PSO reported a net profit of Rs10.3 billion for the period, while PPL’s net profit surged by 58% YoY to Rs81.35 billion. OGDCL reported a profit after tax of Rs159.638 billion, with net sales of Rs309.148 billion.
Despite the overall decline in white oil sales by 19.6%, PSO outperformed the sector and continued to dominate the country’s white oil market, selling around 51% of the industry volume. The company’s market share in diesel increased by 4.1%, closing the period at 54.4%. However, circular debt remains a major concern for the industry, with PSO’s receivables from SNGPL increasing by 65% from March 31, 2022. As a result, the company’s average borrowings increased by 157%, and finance cost surged by 995 basis points compared to the same period last year.
The strong financial results of the energy companies reflect their resilience and proactive business strategies. Despite the economic challenges and reduced demand for oil products, PSO continued to invest in infrastructure development and rehabilitated 42 thousand tonnes of existing storage capacity, with another 90 thousand tonnes of new storage capacity currently under construction. The company also added 22 retail outlets at key locations.
Industry officials have praised the resilience of PSO, PPL, and OGDCL, stating that these companies have demonstrated their ability to navigate through difficult times and deliver strong financial performance. The petroleum sector in Pakistan continues to face challenges, but companies like PSO, PPL, and OGDCL remain committed to keeping the wheels of the country’s economy in motion. The companies expect to deliver even better business performance in the remaining part of the year.

7,"Currency dips, gold shines","Rupee drops to Rs284.84 vs dollar while gold surges to Rs230,100 per tola as Khan arrested","The Pakistani currency has once again come under pressure against the US dollar amid further delays in the revival of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan programme. The currency dropped 0.35% to Rs284.84 against the dollar in the interbank market, moving by almost Re1 after a prolonged period. However, the surge in gold prices in the global market has supported the precious metal, which hit a new all-time high in domestic markets on Tuesday, soaring by 1.41% to Rs230,100 per tola.
The ongoing uncertainty surrounding the IMF loan programme has been a major contributing factor to the drop in the rupee. Speaking to The Express Tribune, Tahir Abbas, the Head of Research at Arif Habib Limited, said that the rupee may continue to fluctuate in the short term. He also stated that political upheaval, such as the recent arrest of former Premier Imran Khan, is adding to the existing uncertainty and negatively impacting the economy and the rupee.
IMF has required Pakistan to acquire financial commitments worth $6-7 billion from friendly countries to resume the loan programme, and the country has yet to fulfill this condition. Although Pakistan’s Finance Ministry has claimed to have acquired remaining financial guarantees from friendly countries, analysts are doubtful whether the ministry has made full financial arrangements for the loan programme.
The uptick in gold prices in the global market and the depreciation of the rupee have allowed the local billion pricing body to increase the commodity price for local markets., Director of AA Gold Commodity, Adnan Agar noted that the yellow metal would continue to maintain its upward trend in both global and local markets. He also predicted that gold would spike to $2,150 per ounce over the next couple of months.

However, Agar added that the outcome of the US job data announcement and the scheduled meeting between US President Joe Biden and the opposition leader would significantly impact gold prices. If the meeting ends on a positive note, it would likely result in a correction in gold prices in global and local markets. On the other hand, if it ends negatively, it would likely result in a further uptrend in gold prices.
Moreover, the ongoing banking crisis in the US and the move to de-dollarise global trade through the introduction of an alternative global currency could keep the dollar under pressure and support gold over the next couple of months.
As Pakistan remains uncertain about the revival of the IMF programme, the currency may continue to face pressure. While the surge in gold prices may provide some support to the country’s economy, the ongoing political upheaval and the uncertainty surrounding the loan programme may continue to weigh down the economy.

8,Funds arranged for debt repayment,"Finance ministry rules out default, says $3.7b will be repaid in two months","Pakistan on Tuesday said that it had made arrangements for repayment of $3.7 billion in principal debt, maturing in two months, ruling out any possibility of default despite thin prospects of reaching a staff-level agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
In a statement, the Ministry of Finance confirmed that $3.7 billion of debt was maturing between May and June this year.
Out of that, a debt of $3.2 billion will mature in June, according to sources. The total amount appears exclusive of interest payments which are around $475 million.
Pakistan is also required to make major interest payments on Eurobonds before the end of June.
“This should not be any cause of concern as arrangements have been made for the rollover and repayment of this debt,” the finance ministry emphasised.
The total repayment of over $4 billion from now till June is equal to 90% of the gross foreign exchange reserves held by the central bank.
Pakistan is scheduled to make a repayment of $2.3 billion to China. This includes $1 billion in SAFE deposit and two commercial loans totaling $1.3 billion, according to the sources.
It is expected that China will timely roll over the $1 billion SAFE deposit. However, the commercial loans extended by the China Development Bank and the Bank of China have to be repaid before these are refinanced by Chinese authorities.
It may take some time and the repayment will temporarily dent the foreign exchange reserves of $4.5 billion.
The finance ministry stated “during this period (May-June), significant inflows are also in the pipeline.”
The coalition government has averted default and the economy is now on course to stability and growth, it claimed.
Sources said that China had advised Pakistan to cool down political temperature and bring normalcy to the economic situation. It is not clear whether China will timely refinance the commercial loans after a fresh wave of political instability and law and order disturbance, caused by the arrest of former prime minister Imran Khan.
Read The future of IMF and sovereign wealth funds
Pakistan cannot keep its foreign exchange reserves at current levels without active support from Beijing. The increasing political temperature may also trigger an economic meltdown.
The finance ministry issued the statement a day after Pakistan reached out to IMF Executive Director Bahador Bijani and requested him to play his role in convincing the lender to soften its stance.
Sources said that mistrust between Pakistan and the IMF had increased significantly and there were very thin chances of clinching a staff-level agreement. The $6.5 billion IMF bailout is going to expire by the end of June with three reviews still pending involving undisbursed loans of $2.6 billion.
The IMF has lately questioned some of the information shared by the Ministry of Finance and sought further clarification. The lender is also seeking details of next fiscal year’s budget.
Moody’s credit rating agency said on Tuesday that Pakistan’s financing options beyond June were highly uncertain and without an IMF programme, Islamabad could default given its very weak reserves.

For the next fiscal year, Pakistan’s gross external debt repayments are estimated at $25 billion, including the $11 billion maturing between July and December.
Finance Minister Ishaq Dar met on Tuesday with Chinese Embassy Charge d’affaires Pang Chunxue. The minister requested the Chinese diplomat to expedite the rollover of $1 billion deposit and refinance the commercial loans.
Pakistan had also earlier made similar requests to the Chinese authorities.
Dar underscored the need to deepen bilateral relations further in economic, trade and financial sectors, according to the Ministry of Finance.

The two sides discussed various avenues, especially available for both countries to enhance the existing cooperation to unprecedented levels. They also talked about the progress on CPEC projects and programmes in Pakistan.
Pang said that China wished to work together with Pakistan to bring economic prosperity to the region. The finance minister added that Pakistan, with the support of China, was confident to make the South Asian nation a growing economy in the region as well as the world soon.
