Gas flaring 
During the session, the assembly adopted a unanimous resolution recommending the provincial government to approach the federal government to devise a mechanism for utilizing the gas burnt during oil excavation.
Moving the resolution, GDA MPA Nand Kumar Goklani said that there are many oil wells in Sindh that burn flare gas.

Flaring is a common practice existing for decades. It involves burning natural gas existing in small underground pockets while operating the oil wells. At times when the natural gas pricves have escalated the practice has been called a waste of resources and there are international calls to utilize this gas, instead of simply burning it off in the air.
