0,Court order surprises all,"Political analyst says rescuing Imran in difficult times is a big setback for establishment, govt","The Islamabad High Court )IHC) has surprised the PDM-led government by granting extraordinary relief to Imran Khan who himself and other party leaders were not expecting it.
Consequently, experts believe that with the help of superior judiciary, Imran has emerged victorious in this round of clash with powerful circles.
One political analyst says that rescuing Imran in difficult times by the superior courts is a big setback for the security establishment as well as the civil government, which is already unpopular among the masses on account of inflation.
The first relief was given by the Supreme Court led by Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial declaring that execution of the arrest warrant issued by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) chairman dated May 1, 2023 in the Al-Qadir Trust case within the premises of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) against Imran was invalid and unlawful.
The manner in which the bench dealt with Imran during the hearing had profound implications on every court of the country, including the IHC.
Likewise, extra courtesy shown to Imran by CJP Bandial has also invited the government functionaries’ criticism.
One federal minister believes that issuance of orders in favour of Imran by the IHC is the outcome of the SC proceedings.
The IHC held that Imran would not be arrested in criminal cases registered against him on or after May 9 or MPO etc.
However, there are several other reasons of granting extraordinary relief to Imran, which cannot be overlooked.
Firstly, the IHC is known to grant relief in matters related to civil liberties for the last four years.
One section of lawyers say that arrest of Imran was also mishandled by the government authorities.
One lawyer refers former CJP Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry case wherein the police had manhandled him on the road.
On account of that incident, the judiciary united against that establishment led by General (retd) Pervez Musharraf.
Similarly, the law enforcement agencies arrested Imran within the IHC premises without the permission of the registrar.
Friday’s IHC order in favour of Imran may be the outcome of the manner in which he was arrested from within the court premises.
The IHC judges’ remarks also suggest that they were visibly annoyed the way sanctity and dignity of the court was violated by Rangers.
A lawyer says that the IHC judges through judicial orders in favour of Imran on Friday sent a message to those who violated the sanctity and dignity of the court.
Even IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq had stayed the trial court proceedings against Imran in the Toshakhana case.
Earlier, the two judges’ judicial order was uploaded on the IHC website in the Tyrian White case.
Despite the IHC orders, the PDM leadership has decided to protest against the SC led by CJP Bandial on Monday.
Political analysts say that the purpose of this protest is to put pressure on the SC which may pass an order regarding the violation of April 4 order to hold elections on May 14.
However, sources revealed to The Express Tribune that senior PTI leaders are also uneasy over Imran’s anti-establishment stance, especially his statement against the incumbent army chief.
It is learnt that Imran has limited the consultation process with senior leadership on such issues.
Even senior party leaders were surprised when Imran had asked the negotiation team to leave the dialogue process, if the government did not dissolve the National Assembly on May 14.
Even the government side was willing to dissolve the assembly in the first week of July.
Special Assistant to Prime Minister Jawad Malik says that it’s a triumph for mob violence and arson and a loss for law and order.
""The state and establishment properties and personnel were brazenly targeted. Imran Khan’s swift release reinforces the PDM stance that the judiciary is partisan"", he adds.
Senior lawyers say that the game is not yet over.
“If SC delays the Punjab Assembly elections for any reason, the PDM government as well as the establishment will not have been defeated.”

1,PM wants May 9 rioters arrested in 72 hours,Shehbaz holds Imran responsible for torching of Lahore Corps Commander’s House," 
Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif on Saturday gave the relevant authorities 72 hours to identify and arrest all those involved in rioting after Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Chairman Imran Khan’s arrest this week sparked deadly violence.
The prime minister said the cases would be tried by anti-terrorism courts. ""All available resources including technological aid and intelligence are being deployed to chase down these elements. Bringing these people to justice is a test case for the government,"" the prime minister said while chairing a meeting at the Punjab Safe City Authority Headquarters in Lahore.
The PTI chairman’s arrest in a land fraud case on Tuesday, which the Supreme Court ruled ""invalid and unlawful"" on Thursday, sparked violent protests by his supporters. They stormed military establishments, set ablaze a state broadcaster building, smashed buses, ransacked a top army official's house and attacked other assets, resulting in the army being deployed in multiple cities.
More than 2,800 arrests were made, while 152 police officers were injured, 74 police vehicles vandalised and set on fire, and 22 government buildings, including police stations and offices, were damaged, said the Punjab police. At least eight people were killed in the violence.
Following the prime minister's announcement, the Punjab caretaker government released pictures of unidentified protesters involved in an attack on a military official's residence on Wednesday.
The prime minister said that it was a “critical task that requires swift action to ensure the safety and security of our citizens”. “I am setting a target for all responsible culprits, planners, instigators, and attackers to be apprehended within the next 72 hours.
During the meeting, the prime minister said that the “law will take action against those who have made plans and attacked the police"". “The law will take action against them so that an exemplary precedent is set, demonstrating that those who act against the cherished homeland and the institutions that constantly risk their lives to defeat enemies will face consequences,” he added.
The prime minister further said that any attempts to disrupt peace and stability of our nation was ""absolutely unacceptable"", adding that this is a critical moment that required our unwavering commitment. “We must act decisively and without delay. It is a matter of utmost urgency, and failure is not an option,” he maintained.
The premier added that the culprits will be apprehended and cases will be filed against them in Anti-Terrorism Courts (ATCs) in accordance with the law and Constitution.
“I have requested an increase in the number of ATCs to ensure swift and efficient proceedings. We are determined to take all necessary measures, even if it means conducting proceedings at night, to ensure justice is served and the rule of law prevails.”
The prime minister stated that the ATCs should begin work immediately without any delay. “It is crucial to set an example that no terrorist or enemy will dare cast an ill eye upon Pakistan’s institutions until the day of judgement,” he said.
The prime minister added that he has also requested caretaker Punjab chief minister Mohsin Naqvi to ensure that those responsible for the unrest were arrested and brought to court.
On his Twitter handle, the prime minister said that he had given the law enforcement apparatus, a target of 72 hours to arrest all those involved in facilitating, abetting and perpetrating the disgraceful incidents of arson, ransacking, sabotage and damaging public and private properties.
He said all available resources including technological aid and intelligence were being deployed to chase down these elements.
“Bringing these people to justice is a test case for the government. Their cases will be tried by the anti-terrorism courts,” he further posted in his tweet.
Also, the prime minister said Imran Niazi was responsible for the barbaric act of torching of Corps Commander House in Lahore as he planned and instigated the act of arson.
Talking to media during his visit to Jinnah House, he said the planners, instigators and abettors behind this attack will not be given any relief.
He said Jinnah House was the home of Corps Commander Lahore which on May 9 was tragically and cruelly burnt.
The rioters attacked and set the house on fire, he said, adding the arsonists did not care that it was a historical building and the army officer and his family were living there.
Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif visits CMH Lahore and meets officers and soldiers injured on 9th May during the violent protests. Lahore, 13th of May, 2023.The building was inhabited by the son who was on duty to protect his motherland, he remarked. “This was a cruel and anti-state act which never happened before in the 75 years history of the country.”
The prime minister said he was saddened while talking about the incident and said nobody thought that such an incident could happen.
The head of the nation was bowed with shame and it was grieving after this episode, he added.
He said those who perpetrated this act would be brought to justice and they would be dealt with the iron hand of constitution and law and would be given exemplary punishment according to law and the world would remember their fate for a long time to come.
Shehbaz said the barbaric act was committed against those sons of the soil who were eradicating terrorism for maintaining peace in Pakistan.
It was an act against those who sacrifice their lives to protect our borders and their wives become widows and their children become orphans, he added.
While during his visit to Combined Military Hospital and Services Hospital Lahore, he inquired after the well-being of the officers including DIG Operations Ali Nasir Rizvi and jawans who were wounded while performing their duties during rioting.
Caretaker Chief Minister Mohsin Naqvi and senior army and civil officers accompanied the prime minister.

2,"Facebook, Twitter, YouTube still not accessible",PTA spokesperson denies purposeful slow speed of internet," 
The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) has claimed to have restored internet access following the release of former premier Imran Khan, but many people have reported slow or non-existent internet connections.
The government has not given any clear reason for this, leading to confusion and frustration among citizens. The PTA spokesperson denied purposeful slow speed of the internet.
However, the recent events surrounding the arrest and subsequent release of Imran had an adverse effect on the country’s internet and social media platforms.
While the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) claimed to have opened up the internet, it has not been fully restored, leading to complaints from people struggling to access the internet and social media.
Even though the internet resumed on Friday, social media sites are still not working properly on both mobile phones and desktops, startup investment specialist Kapeel Kumar said.
“This situation is still creating chaos and leading this nation towards disappointment,” he said. Right now, most of the apps are not accessible without VPN and the internet is very slow on mobile data and fiber as well, he added.
Imran’s arrest on corruption charges caused a massive uproar in the country. The arrest led to protests, clashes with law enforcement agencies and attacks on military installations. To control the situation, the interior ministry directed the PTA to shut down broadband, causing an unforeseen impact on the country’s economy and general life.
As of now, the internet situation in Pakistan remains sluggish, and many people are still unable to connect to social media or other sites.
Internet speed has been reported to be as slow as 3G, with frequent disconnections, making it difficult for people to carry out even the most basic online tasks.
In today’s age, businesses rely on the internet to manage their operations, ICT analyst at JS Global, Waqas Ghani Kukaswadia said.
The burgeoning startup and freelance industries in Pakistan are also dependent on a stable internet connection.
“Such small businesses and freelancers suffered greatly from internet outages during the outgoing week,” he said.
Due to the lack of internet access in Pakistan, Fiverr, a renowned global marketplace for freelancers, temporarily disabled the accounts of Pakistani freelancers, which does not present a positive image in front of the world, he said.
Internet users are still complaining of limited bandwidth when trying to access social media, despite not officially being blocked anymore.
The slow internet speed had a considerable impact on people’s daily lives. Many students rely on the internet for online classes, which have become a norm since the start of the pandemic. It has been a significant hurdle for those who need to study for exams or access educational materials.
The slow internet speed has also severely impacted business and the economy. Online businesses have been hit hard, with some unable to operate at all due to slow internet speeds. Those who can still operate are experiencing severe disruptions, which have resulted in lost revenues and customers.
The government has been criticised for its handling of the situation, with many people accusing it of not doing enough to address the isue.
There has been widespread frustration and anger at the lack of clear communication from the authorities, which has left people in the dark about what is going on.

3,Imran seeks SC-led probe into rioting ‘set off by his arrest’,Censures establishment for ‘jumping into politics’; suggests it should form its own political party," 
PTI Chairman and former premier Imran Khan on Saturday demanded an independent investigation into the vandalism and violence that broke out during the protests in the aftermath of his arrest by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) in the Al-Qadir Trust case on May 9, under the supervision of the Supreme Court.
The PTI chief also urged his supporters to come out of their homes and gather at a spot in their neighbourhood from 5:30 pm to 6:30 pm on Sunday (today) with placards inscribed with “Save Constitution, Save Country” and once again announced to kick off a series of public rallies from Muridke, Punjab from May 17 (Wednesday).
In in his first address to the nation from Lahore after his release from NAB’s custody, the former premier called for an investigation into the protests and vandalism that occurred following his arrest on May 9, asking Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial to lead the investigation and ""personally"" chair the panel.
“I want an independent and complete investigation into the burning of state buildings and firing at unarmed youth protesters. I want CJP Umar Ata Bandial to constitute a panel under him for this purpose.”
Imran denied the involvement of his party workers in the nationwide violent protests and attacks on the military installations, including the Lahore Corps Commander House and the General Headquarters (GHQ).
He asserted that those who provoked violence during PTI protests were not “their people”, claiming that “these miscreants” instigated the people to act violently.
He reiterated that his supporters always remained peaceful during their 27-year struggle.
The PTI chief recalled that he had called off sit-in in Islamabad last year, as he wanted to avert violence. “When I was shot [in Wazirabad], should not there have been vandalism? This did not happen, because I do not believe in violence. PTI is the only political party in the country where families, including children, attend public gatherings and why they would ever want anarchy in the country?” he asked.
“I was told to set up a militant wing for my party if I wanted to build PTI in Karachi, as the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) and other parties had armed wings. This was 25 years ago. I told them (powers that be) the day you include armed men in your party, its nature changes, and thus, I refused,” he said.
The former premier accused the coalition government for mayhem, saying those who feared elections wanted anarchy in the country and not his party. “And those who fear [polls] will be destroyed in elections. They want chaos,” he added.
While extending gratitude to the judiciary for “saving him” from going to jail, he castigated PML-N Quaid Nawaz Sharif for “destroying” the judiciary’s independence in the past. “When an independent judiciary is destroyed, your independence comes to an end with it, because the judiciary protects your fundamental rights.”
The PTI chairman observed that democracy was hanging by thread and only the judiciary could save it, adding that “this mafia is going all out in attacking the judiciary”.
He urged the nation to stand with the judiciary and the Constitution.
Imran condemned the manner in which he was arrested from the Islamabad High Court on May 9, saying the army, which should not have come to apprehend him, assaulted him.
He noted that on Friday the police stopped him for leaving the IHC premises despite the court granted him bail in multiple cases.
“The police wanted to arrest me under MPO (Maintenance of Public Order) outside the courtroom,” he claimed.
In his defence against the NAB case, Imran claimed that he did not reap any personal benefit from Al-Qadir Trust, saying that a “trustee never gets any monetary benefit”.
He said the decision to establish a university was taken in November 2018 and that its groundbreaking ceremony was held when he was the premier in May 2019.
“The UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA)’s case surfaced seven years after that and it was taken up in the cabinet in December 2019. At the time, the funds for the university had already been allocated,” he said.
“The case was quite simple. We were given a choice that Pakistan would receive $170 million from NCA and its details regarding the agreement would remain confidential or otherwise we [would] have to file a case in the UK. We were also told that we had already wasted $100 million on foreign litigations and if we file a case, it will take years to conclude. Hence, we decided that if $170 million come to the Supreme Court or to the government, it would come to Pakistan. Instead, the government made a corruption case against me over this,” he said.
Imran said the aim to establish Al-Qadir University was to produce leadership for the country, which was acquainted with Islamic teachings.
He lambasted the recently sacked NAB chairman as well as the “handlers” for incorporating his wife’s name in the case.
Imran fired broadside at the country’s military establishment for ""jumping into politics"", suggesting that it should form its own political party.
He vented out his frustration over what he called “baseless allegations” levelled by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) against him and his party.
""Never has ISPR said such things. You should be ashamed of yourself. You have jumped into politics. Why don't you make a party for yourself,"" he said.
""I am trying to restrain myself [here] as I am very angry at your allegations since you don't know what you are talking about.""
“DG Sahib, I had represented my country and brought prestige to it when even you were not even born,” he said while addressing the DG ISPR and added, “you should know who defended the Pakistan Army at the international forums during the war on terror”.
The PTI chairman went on to say that he did not use derogatory words for the army chief, asking “how could you (DG ISPR) level allegations against me”.
He averred that he was not responsible for the economic meltdown in the country. “If I criticise someone, it means I want reforms.”
Imran continued that the army was maligned because of the former army chief’s actions who not only “stabbed him in the back but also imposed a corrupt mafia on the country”.
“The nation is not a herd of animals that acts as the army chief desires,” he said.
“The DG ISPR does not have the right to call me a liar or deceptive person.”
Imran stressed that nobody could eliminate a political party by force and put them in jail.
“I know you (army chief) would not listen to me but my suggestion for you is to come out of small, closed rooms and see how you could save the country from destruction.”
The PTI chief also claimed that he knew the names of all those who planned his assignation last year.
“I know that a plan was devised to kill me. I know the names of all the actors involved in it, from top to bottom. I know who gave the green light and colluding with them were two civilians: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Federal Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah,” he added.
