0,Govt plans to borrow Rs9.4tr in three months,"Financing from domestic banks will help repay maturing debt, meet expenses","The cash-strapped government of Pakistan has announced that it will borrow a record Rs9.44 trillion from domestic commercial and Shariah-compliant banks, an amount needed to repay some of the maturing debt and finance expenditures over three months ending July 2023.
According to the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) data, the government will acquire massive funds to repay old debt of Rs8.05 trillion. As a result, it will add a net Rs1.38 trillion over three months to the total domestic public debt, which has grown to “unsustainable levels.”
Market talk suggests that Rs9.44 trillion is the single largest bank financing being availed of by the government but it cannot be confirmed officially till the filing of this report.
Arif Habib Limited economist Sana Tawfik said the government set such a huge borrowing goal in the wake of growing reliance on domestic debt following the choking of foreign loans due to the stalled International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan programme since November 2022.
She said the latest addition to net debt would widen the government’s fiscal deficit. “Fiscal account is facing mounting pressure for two major reasons which include continuous piling up of domestic debt and the surge in interest payments after a hike in key policy rate to record high at 21%.”
Both things – domestic debt and interest cost – “have grown to unsustainable levels over a period of time.”
Total domestic debt soared to Rs38 trillion as of December 31, 2022, which constituted 45% of Pakistan’s gross domestic product (GDP) and 53% of total public debt (including external liabilities).
Debt servicing (mark-up cost) on domestic debt is estimated at close to Rs5.6 trillion in the current fiscal year 2022-23, which is equal to 76% of the tax revenue collection by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).
According to Tawfiq, at present the government has two options: to create some fiscal space to give a significant push to the national economy or restructure the public debt. “It can cut non-development expenditure and enhance tax revenue receipts by increasing the number of taxpayers.”
The restructuring, however, is difficult. It carries high solvency risks for some domestic banks. Moreover, there should be the option of liquidity supplies from the central bank and the IMF must be on board as well.
The third option would be to pay off debt through printing new currency notes but it would further increase inflation in the country, she added. Inflation is already running at a six-decade high at 36.4%.
At present, banks are offering financing at a historically high mark-up of 22% in the backdrop of the surge in central bank’s key policy rate to 21%.
Moreover, the breakdown of central bank data shows the government has targeted to borrow Rs7.50 trillion by selling three to 12-month treasury bills (T-bills) during May-July 2023. It aims to borrow another Rs1.49 trillion via auction of two-year to 30-year Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs) at fixed and floating rates.
Additionally, it intends to acquire financing of Rs450 billion by selling Sukuk to Shariah-compliant banks over three months.
The government is scheduled to pay Rs7.08 trillion for the maturing T-bills mainly in installments around June 2023. It also has to pay off Rs647 billion for the maturing long-term PIBs in May to July.

1,US default a concern for global economy,"Malpass points out rising rates, high debt choking investments","The risk of a US default is adding to problems facing the slowing global economy, with rising interest rates and high debt levels already choking back investments needed to fuel higher output, World Bank President David Malpass said on Friday.
Group of Seven (G7) finance officials meeting in Japan discussed the “very high importance” of raising the US debt limit and averting the negative repercussions of a potential default on US government debt for the first time ever.
“Clearly, distress in the world’s biggest economy would be negative for everyone,” he told Reuters on the sidelines of the G7 meeting. “The repercussions would be bad to not get it done.”
US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Friday reiterated that failure by Congress to raise the $31.4 trillion debt limit would result in economic and financial catastrophe, and urged the Republican-controlled House of Representatives to agree to lift the federal debt limit.
Malpass said there had been discussion during the G7 meetings about the need to boost productivity and growth, and also deal with a high debt overhang.
Global growth was slated to fall below 2% in 2023, and could stay low for several years, he said. One of the big challenges was that advanced economies had taken on so much debt that it would take a lot of capital to service it, leaving too little investment for developing countries, he said.

2,Investment plans under threat,Global body asks govt to carefully exercise powers to restrict internet services,"The Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA) has cautioned the government of Pakistan that restrictions on internet services can have a knock-on effect on credit and investment plans, ultimately damaging the country’s reputation.
Powers to restrict services should be exercised carefully solely in exceptional and pre-defined circumstances, and only if absolutely necessary and proportionate to achieve a specified and legitimate aim that is consistent with relevant laws, internationally recognised human rights conventions and the ITU constitution, it said.
In a letter written to Minister of IT and Telecom Syed Aminul Haque, GSMA Head of Asia-Pacific Julian Gorman raised serious concern over the restriction of connectivity and internet services in Pakistan.
GSMA, which represents the interests of mobile operators worldwide, was concerned about the impact that the current restrictions were having on citizens and businesses in Pakistan, GSMA said, adding that in today’s digital societies, individuals and businesses relied on connectivity for their livelihoods and access to essential services and information.
It said that prolonged restrictions could have far-reaching effects on citizens’ health, education, social and economic welfare.
The GSMA urged the government to restore access and it stood ready to engage constructively, wherever support required, to improve the process and ensure business continuity, Gorman added.
Freelancers and owners of e-commerce websites operating in Pakistan have faced a huge loss as they have not been able to connect to their clients due to internet connectivity issues.
Leading digital marketer Tanveer Nandla voiced concern over the suspension of internet services and requested the government to immediately lift the restrictions.
He said that prolonged internet disconnection would result in bad reputation for the freelancers working in Pakistan.
“Pakistani freelancers and digital marketers had built trust in the international market and were bringing billions of dollars into market. The distrust may result in losing the freelancing market,” he feared.
The nationwide suspension of mobile broadband has caused an estimated revenue loss of Rs820 million while the government has lost around Rs287 million in tax revenue. 
In a tweet, Jazz CEO Aamir Ibrahim said that shutting down the internet “is not a solution to anything. It creates more problems than it solves.” He stressed that the devastating effect on the economy was quantifiable but the inconvenience to people was incalculable.
Pakistan Software Houses Association ([email protected]) Chairman Muhammad Zohaib Khan said, “Internet is our lifeline, our office, our communications infrastructure and the IT industry can’t operate without it. IT & ITeS services are already under a lot of pressure on account of stagnation and experiencing a probable decline in the exports of IT services due to the bad governmental policies; and, now the political turmoil has completely stopped the IT industry’s operations.”

3,US could start buying oil for reserve after June sale,Oil prices fell as market balanced supply fears against renewed economic concerns,"US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told lawmakers her department could start repurchasing oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) after completing a congressionally mandated sale next month.
“That congressionally mandated sale of 26 million barrels will be completed by June, and it’s at that point where we will flip the switch and then seek to purchase,” Granholm told lawmakers in a hearing in the US House of Representatives.
The Biden administration last year conducted the largest ever sale from the SPR of 180 million barrels. That and other sales last year have pushed the reserve to about 372 million barrels, the lowest since 1983.
Granholm previously said the Energy Department could start buying back in the fourth quarter after maintenance on two of the reserve’s four sites on the coasts of Texas and Louisiana.
The administration has said it will buy oil when prices are consistently at or below $67 to $72 per barrel. US crude prices fell more than 2% on Thursday to settle at $70.87 a barrel.
Granholm’s comments “reflect an intense messaging campaign likely intended to mollify Republicans angry about the big SPR draws,” said Bob McNally an energy policy analyst at Rapidan Energy. Granholm’s comments also likely seek to dissuade OPEC+ from cutting supply again, he said.
OPEC+ last cut output in April, a surprise move of about 1.15 million barrels per day. Oil prices fell on Friday and were set to end the week lower for the third straight week, as the market balanced supply fears against renewed economic concerns in the US and China.

4,Industry’s help sought to steer out of crisis,Qamar says steps afoot to promote ease of doing business,"Minister for Commerce Syed Naveed Qamar on Friday declared that the government would take all possible measures to ensure ease of doing business for the business community.
Talking to business leaders, he emphasised that they could play an important role in steering Pakistan’s economy out of the current crisis, according to a statement.
“The government will take every possible measure to facilitate the business community with ease of doing business for economic development in the country,” he said.
Lauding the efforts of industrialists for establishing a new industrial zone and constructing an expo centre in the capital, he assured them of the government’s cooperation for materialisation of the two projects.
He called the schemes very important that would give a boost to industrialisation and improve trade and exports.
Qamar welcomed the plan and announced his assistance for launching an FM Radio for the business community to educate them about matters like trade laws, regulations and importance of exports.

5,IMF asks Pakistan to arrange $8b,Increases demand for additional financing to ensure debt repayment,"In yet another turn that has further eroded chances for revival of the $6.5 billion bailout package, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has asked Pakistan to now arrange $8 billion in fresh loans to back the external debt repayments during the next seven months.
The IMF’s demand to seek its approval on the upcoming budget for fiscal year 2023-24 has also not been met yet, further minimising the prospects of an early completion of the pending 9th review of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF), according to the government sources.
Sources say that the IMF has raised the demand for additional financing from an earlier unmet condition of $6 billion to $8 billion aimed at ensuring debt repayments coming up for the May-December 2023 period.
The lender has worked out the $8 billion needs by considering all projected inflows and outflows for this period.
Pakistan, however, has not accepted the new additional financing demand on the grounds that the Fund’s current programme will end in June 2023 and it should not put conditions beyond the programme period.
In February this year, the IMF had asked Pakistan to arrange $6 billion in fresh loans, excluding rollovers and refinancing to meet debt repayments until June 2023 and to stop the further depletion of foreign exchange reserves. Due to a delay in arranging these funds, the 9th programme review worth $1.2 billion remains incomplete.
On Monday, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar told the executive director of the IMF that Pakistan had met all the prior actions. Saudi Arabia has promised to give $2 billion while the United Arab Emirates has committed $1 billion in fresh loans.
According to the sources, the finance minister informed the executive director that the remaining $3 billion can only be arranged once the IMF announces staff-level agreement and the board approves the ninth review along with the $1.2 billion tranche.
The IMF resident representative did not respond to a query about whether Pakistan needs to arrange $8 billion from now until December this year to meet external debt repayment requirements.
In a scheduled press conference on Thursday, IMF spokesperson Julie Kozack, said Pakistan needed “significant additional financing” to successfully complete the ninth review. She said the economy was facing stagflation, had very large financing needs and had also been affected by a series of shocks, including severe flooding.
Obtaining commitments of “significant additional financing” is essential before the IMF approves the release of pending bailout funds that are crucial for Pakistan to resolve an acute balance of payments crisis, according to the IMF spokeswoman.
Sources have said that the IMF’s focus is now more on ensuring that Pakistan does not default by arranging funds to the extent of the external debt repayments. It is no longer emphasising on increasing the extremely low foreign exchange reserves.
Dar also said on Thursday that Pakistan would not default on any foreign liability, with or without an IMF programme. He said Pakistan had fulfilled all the prior actions of the IMF and it was now up to the lender to sign the agreement.
The finance minister argued that the delay in the IMF deal should not be linked to default.
“Pakistan will not default whether there is an IMF programme or no programme,” he asserted. He went on to say that additional tough decisions could not be taken at this stage.
Dar said that suspicions were being created as if to say that Pakistan is going to default on its international payments. He said an international rating agency talked about Pakistan’s $3.7 billion external payments due before June 30 and when he responded to the situation with a clarification, another rating agency came up with an assertion the next day that Pakistan would not be able to meet its foreign obligations from July to December.
The foreign exchange reserves held by the State Bank of Pakistan have fallen to $4.4billion.
The government has been trying to avoid default by putting the brakes on imports, as its debt-related financial inflows have almost dried up due to a delay in reaching a deal with the IMF.
Sources say that the government is also not inclined in meeting the IMF’s demand of sharing a draft of the next year’s budget. Senior officials from the finance ministry said that the draft budget can only be shared if the IMF is willing to merge the 10th review and give more than $1.2 billion financing tranche.
Of the $6.5 billion, $2.6 billion still remain undisbursed despite a nine-month extension in the IMF programme.

6,G7 debates reducing supply chain reliance on China,Washington pushing for targeted controls on investment to China,"Finance leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) advanced economies discussed the need to make global supply chains more resilient by reducing over-reliance on China, German Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Friday.
Japan, which is hosting a three-day G7 meeting to debate key global themes in the city of Niigata, has been leading fresh efforts to diversify supply chains away from China by building partnerships with low- and middle-income countries through investment and aid.
Countries such as Germany wanted to reduce its dependency on China, Lindner told a press conference. “Here, emerging and low-income countries come into play,” he added.
But while the G7 rich democracies are likely to agree on the partnership deal to beef up supply chains, they are not on the same page in terms of how far they should go in countering China - the world’s second largest economy that is not a G7 member.
The US is at the forefront in pushing for stronger steps. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has called for targeted controls in investment to China to counter what she saw as Beijing’s “economic coercion” against other countries.
While wary of China as a strategic rival, Germany is cautious, however, of being seen as forging a G7 front against Beijing given its heavy reliance on trade with the country.
Japan is also sceptical about the idea of investment controls due to the huge impact such a move could have on global trade and its own economy, government officials say.
British Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt told the Nikkei newspaper on Thursday the G7 must counter China’s economic coercion, though made no mention of investment controls.
Hanging over the meeting was a lack of progress in resolving a US debt ceiling stalemate.
The G7 nations can little afford further risks to their fragile economies and there were some voices of concern raised over the potential dire consequences if the US were to fail to resolve the impasse, which could tip its economy into recession.
A scheduled meeting on Friday between US President Joe Biden and top lawmakers was postponed until early next week
Germany’s Lindner said he hoped US politicians would come to a “grown-up” decision on talks to raise the $31.4 trillion debt ceiling - the maximum amount the US government is authorised to borrow.
World Bank President David Malpass told Reuters the risk of a US default added to problems already facing the global economy that was entering a prolonged period of slow growth.
“It looks like global growth will fall below 2% this year in 2023, but then, as you look at future years, it may stay low for several years,” due to rising borrowing costs and high levels of debt, Malpass said on Friday in Niigata.
The G7 finance leaders are expected to issue a joint statement after their three-day meeting ends on Saturday.

7,NTDC completes 500kv Thar-Matiari line,"New line to connect 1,320MW SECL Thar coal plant to Matiari converter station","The National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC) has completed the 500kV Thar-Matiari Transmission line in a record time of two and a half months, meeting the directive of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. The 220-kilometre-long transmission line was completed at a cost of approximately Rs15 billion using the company’s own resources.
This project is vital for future energy needs, as it will connect coal-fired power generation in Thar to the rest of the country. The transmission line will connect the 1320 MW SECL coal plant in Thar to the Matiari Converter station, improving the country’s power transmission system.
The completion of the Thar-Matiari transmission line marks the second project completed by NTDC this year, despite several challenges. The Polan-Jiwani transmission line, which aimed to import 100 MW of electricity from Iran for Gwadar, was also completed by NTDC in record time.
To ensure the project’s timely completion, 54 individual crews consisting of over 300 labourers worked relentlessly. A camp office of NTDC’s top management was also set up at Mithi (Thar) near the project site to monitor the pace of work.
The completion of this project is a significant step towards energy security and development. It will bring much-needed relief to the country’s power sector and help meet its growing energy demands. The NTDC’s successful completion of the project in record time reflects its commitment to delivering critical infrastructure to the country.
