2,"Varsity asked to return $11,270 to student",President says NUST committed maladministration by unjustly confiscating admission dues,"President Dr Arif Alvi has directed the National University of Science and Technology (NUST) to refund an amount of $11,270 as it committed maladministration by unjustly confiscating the admission dues of a student about 15 years ago who vacated the seat at the initial stages and joined another university.
He said that NUST, having been established/controlled by the federal government, fell under the definition of “Agency” of the government, was not a private commercial entity but a service provider in the public sector, and confiscating the dues of a student was tantamount to exploitation and malpractice.
The president gave these directions in a 15-year-old matter, referred to him in 2022. According to him, a student was admitted to MBBS on the Foreign SAT basis session 2007 in NUST and his father (the complainant) deposited the admission fee of $11,420. 
The complainant’s son got admission to another medical university in Pakistan and he applied to NUST for a refund. NUST refused his request on the basis of its Refund Policy. 
Feeling aggrieved, the complainant approached Wafaqi Mohtasib in 2008, which directed NUST to refund the amount.
NUST, then, filed a representation which was rejected on the ground that NUST did not explain how its policy was lawful and it failed to show that it suffered any financial loss due to the student’s decision to join another university. 
Hence, the decision of NUST to retain the fee was termed as unjustified.

4,Metro bus service remains suspended,Closure of service causes losses of millions of rupees to exchequer,"The metro bus service between Rawalpindi and Islamabad remained suspended for the fourth consecutive day after it was shut following the eruption of violent protests over the arrest of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf chief and former prime minister Imran Khan.
Protesters had set the Sixth Road metro bus station on fire.
The protesters had also attacked and vandalised Khatm—Nabuat and Faizabad stations where protestors break glass and CCTV cameras. The protestors also damaged the washrooms of the Committee Chowk station. Unknown people also looted almost Rs0.5 million from the ticketing booth of the Sixth Road station.
The suspension of the metro bus service has caused over Rs100 million in loses to the exchequer.
More than 1,60,000 people travel in metro buses between the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad daily. A one-way ticket from Rawalpindi to Pak Secretariat Islamabad costs Rs30. The metro bus facility is a big relief for the working class, labourers and public servants and private employees who daily commute in bus.
When Imran Khan was arrested from the Islamabad High Court premises on May 9, riots and protests started in Rawalpindi and Islamabad. The protesters vandalised property and installations including metro bus stations in the twin cities after clashes with the police.
Protestors also damaged infrastructure, railway tracks and stations of the metro bus after which the bus operation was suspended on May 5.
Police personnel have been deployed but angry protestors attacked and burned the Sixth Road station. The said station burned to the hill before the fire was put out. The whole station and ticketing booths were also destroyed.
Officials said that the metro bus service may be operational from Saturday but no decision has been made yet.
They said that if the local administration cleared the security, the service will be made operational immediately. Due to the suspension of the service, people who travel between Rawalpindi and Islamabad daily have to face a lot of problems as no direct bus service is available for them.
Saad said that he works in Islamabad and the metro bus is the best and easy way to reach his workplace on time. He said that due to the suspension of the service, he had to hire private transport which is making a big hole in his pocket.

5,Suspension of mobile phone internet service taking toll on users,"Online businesses, education and health set-ups face problems in service delivery","Millions of users are facing severe problems due to the closure of mobile phone internet service in the twin cities.
Due to the government’s decision to suspend mobile broadband and block access to social media apps, online businesses, classes and taxi and motorcycle services have suffered the most and thousands of people risk losing jobs.
After the arrest of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Chairman Imran Khan on May 9 and the following violent protests and vandalism, the mobile internet service has been suspended across the country including Rawalpindi, Islamabad and Azad Jammu and Kashmir. The prolonged outage of mobile internet service is taking a heavy toll on users.
Mohammad Younus, who is connected to the online taxi service in Rawalpindi, said that he has been unable to find customers for the last four days since the internet was shut down. He used to earn Rs2,000 to 3,000 a day by driving an online taxi, but due to the shutdown of the internet, no one is using the online taxi service anymore.
“I request the government to restore mobile internet as its use has now become a basic necessity. It should not only be seen that the violent protesters are using the internet but also the common man who has nothing to do with any political party, also uses it,” he said.
Maria Jabeen, a student taking online classes from a German university through mobile internet, said that she is getting an online post-graduation degree from Germany, but the internet is down for the last four days.
Zubaida, a working woman who earns money by doing online business from home, said that she sews different designs of clothes at home and posts them on Facebook, YouTube and other social media websites to make ends meet. But due to the shutdown of the internet, her online business has crashed and she could make no earnings for the last four days. She demanded the government immediately connect millions of users to the mobile phone internet so that they can carry out their businesses.
