1,K-P seeks NFC share to uplift tribal belt,CM Azam Khan says matter has been taken up with federal government,"Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) Caretaker Chief Minister Azam Khan has said that special efforts are needed to bring the newly merged tribal districts of the province on a par with the rest of the country.
He indicated that the matter concerning the allocation of the tribal districts’ share in the National Finance Commission (NFC) award, as well as other dues owed to the province, has been brought to the attention of the prime minister. It is expected that a resolution to this issue will be reached in the near future.
The chief minister announced that to resolve the public issues of the newly merged districts, he will reserve every Thursday for meeting with tribal people and to listen to their issues personally.
In this regard, the first session of meetings was held on Thursday at the Chief Minister House Peshawar in which a delegation of tribal elders from different merged districts apprised the chief minister of their issues related to health, education, communications, and other service delivery sectors. They also submitted written applications to him.
The CM on this occasion issued directives to departments concerned for immediate resolution of public issues in these districts and warned that no negligence will be tolerated in this regard.
The tribal elders expressed their gratitude for the decision and expressed optimism that it would bring about a swift resolution to their problems. 
They lamented that in the past, tribal districts had been consistently overlooked and neglected, resulting in the tribal belt being one of the most underdeveloped regions in the country, where basic necessities such as education, healthcare, and job opportunities were lacking.
The delegates said that this initiative of the chief minister is a proof of his interest and seriousness in solving the problems of the tribal people.
While talking to the delegation, the chief minister said that people of the merged districts have rendered numerous sacrifices during the last four decades, adding that the caretaker government is aware of public issues of the tribal people and steps would be taken to resolve them on priority.
Azam Khan said that every step would be taken to develop the education and health sectors and improve the road network in the region by allocating funds for the purpose.
The CM has acknowledged the longstanding issues faced by the people of the merged districts and has pledged to take swift action to address them. To this end, priority measures will be put in place, and special meetings will be convened with relevant departments to ensure timely resolution of these issues. Additionally, special attention will be given to completing ongoing development projects within their designated timeframes.
The CM said that he has taken up the matter with the PM to get the share of the merged districts in NFC and will raise this matter again with the federal government. The people of the merged districts should get their constitutional and legal rights at all cost.

4,Safety measures stressed in mines,PPP leader says inspectors should check mines regularly,"The provincial leader of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Shams Hamzazai on Thursday urged the mines and minerals department to ensure precautionary measures for avoiding tragic incidents in the mining sites.
Talking to APP, he said the government should take stern action against those mine owners who did not take precautions and safety measures in their mines. Shams said, “Mostly, the incidents occurred due to negligence of the labourers and mine owners without inviting any attention from the quarters concerned”.
He appealed to the government to bind inspectors to inspect the mines on a regular basis to overcome the rising disaster incidents and death ratio due to poor working conditions and awareness and impose a ban on those mines in the province which lack precautionary measures.
Hamzazai asked the labourers and mine owners to cooperate with the department in following safety and health protocols.
He urged the mine owners to instal safety equipment in mines for the protection of the coal miners.
“The department is responsible to create awareness among the workers and to organize training sessions for mine workers on a regular basis,” he added.
He said the main reason behind fatalities in the mining sector was a lack of oxygen and explosions due to methane gas.
Hamzazai urged the mine owners and workers to take the issue more seriously for making efforts to implement the law for overcoming coal mine incidents.
The mines and minerals sector of the province has witnessed a huge royalty collection and the potential to spur economic growth and job creation in Balochistan, he stressed.
The government should issue more licenses with the aim to trigger rapid growth of the mining sector and attract maximum investors, he maintained.
He added the government should establish new regional offices of mines and minerals at Muslim Bagh, Harnai, Mach and Gwadar to ensure good governance and facilitation of the mining companies.
Meanwhile expressing concern over the Duki coal mine accident that occurred last week, he said the coal miners were making efforts on their own to ensure the recovery of their companions who were trapped inside the coal mine.
At least two coal miners were trapped when a coal mine was suddenly filled with rainwater in the Duki mines area.
