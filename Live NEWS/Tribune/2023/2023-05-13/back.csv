0,China steps in to break stalemate over TTP issue,"Beijing pushes Islamabad, Kabul for ‘workable formula’ on militant group","China is trying to broker a ‘workable solution’ between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban to address the issue of banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), official sources familiar with the plan have revealed.
Foreign ministers of China and the interim Afghan government were in Islamabad recently for a trilateral meeting to discuss the current situation in Afghanistan. Among the issues on the agenda included terrorist sanctuaries in Afghanistan. While Pakistan is concerned over the presence of the TTP and its affiliates, China wants the Afghan Taliban to neutralise the threat posed by the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM).
The Afghan Taliban government is thought to be working on a plan to address the Chinese concerns as it has relocated ETIM militants believed to be in the hundreds from the border. But the issue of TTP still looms large. After the Taliban takeover, there were expectations in Pakistan that the issue of the TTP would be dealt with once and for all.
When Pakistan sought action against the TTP, the Afghan Taliban instead came with a proposal to broker a deal with the militant outfit. Islamabad reluctantly accepted the proposal and initially talks made progress, with the TTP announcing a ceasefire in return for Pakistan freeing certain militants.
As part of the confidence-building measures Pakistan allowed hundreds of TTP fighters to resettle in the country. However, the process soon went into trouble as returning fighters started targeting the security forces.
The surge in the TTP terrorist attacks compelled Pakistan’s civil and military leadership to abandon the peace process. The current civil and military leadership publicly acknowledged that the policy to seek peace with the TTP was wrong. The government decided that it would no longer seek peace talks with the TTP.

During the visit of interim Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, Pakistan once again raised the issue. However, official sources said that the Afghan foreign minister was adamant that Pakistan should talk to the TTP. He expressed his desire at the keynote speech he delivered at the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad.
But the sources said Pakistan did not agree. Pakistan wanted the interim Afghan government to find ways to deal with the TTP. The TTP issue has threatened to undermine bilateral ties between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban.
The sources said in order to break the stalemate, China was pursuing both sides to agree on a “workable solution”. The Afghan Taliban earlier proposed the relocation of TTP fighters from Pakistani bordering areas but asked Pakistan to bear the cost. It is believed that a similar plan was offered to China by the Afghan Taliban to address the issue of ETIM.
The sources said China was keen that both sides do not lose sight of the bigger picture while addressing the issue of TTP. Essentially, sources said, China doesn’t want the TTP issue to undermine bilateral ties between the two countries, something that would be detrimental to regional connectivity.
Last week at a press conference Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang hoped ""Pakistan and Afghanistan will bear in mind the larger picture and try to work out the issues between them through dialogue and consultation.""
His statement, according to officials, suggests that Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban must not take the issue of TTP to a point of no return.
The sources said Pakistan was using the good offices of China to press upon the Afghan Taliban on the TTP issue. China has leverage over the Afghan Taliban, according to sources. Pakistan is trying that China use that financial and economic leverage over the Afghan Taliban to address the issue of terrorist sanctuaries.

1,Plea against Imran’s nikah thrown out,Court in Islamabad says it cannot hear case as Imran-Bushra marriage took place in Lahore," 
A district and sessions court in Islamabad declared as inadmissible a petition that contented that former premier Imran Khan and former first lady Bushra Bibi cohabited despite the fact that their first nikah had taken place without completion of the latter’s mandatory iddat period.
The petitioner, a Muhammad Haneef, claimed that Bushra Bibi was divorced by her former husband in November 2017 and married Imran Khan on January 1, 2018 despite the fact that her iddat period had not completed “which is against the Sharia and the Muslim norms.”
The complainant submitted in the court the statements of Mufti Muhammad Saeed who conducted the marriage between Imran and Bushra and Awn Chaundhry—Imran’s close firend—who was one of the witnesses.
The court noted that the alleged nikah was solemnized in Lahore.  “Therefore, the offense, if any, was committed, [took place] within the jurisdiction of [the] learned court of competent jurisdiction [in] Lahore, which could have the cognizance thereof.”
The session court judge, Nasrumminallah, noted that the complainant if aggrieved of any act of the respondents should approach the court of competent jurisdiction in Lahore.
Describing the reasons for filing the petition in Islamabad, the petitioner said Imran and Bushra moved to the federal capital soon after their nikah and went into “valid retirement” at Imran’s Bani Gala residence. Therefore, he said, a court in Islamabad should hear the case.
When a husband and wife are alone together under circumstances that present no legal, moral or physical impediment to marital intercourse, they are said to be in “valid retirement” which is a translation of “khilwat-us-sahiha”, a term in Sharia law
The court, however, said it lacked jurisdiction to take cognizance of the matter as the nikah was solemnized in the territorial jurisdiction of a competent court in Lahore. “Hence the instant petition is not preceed-able within the territorial jurisdiction of this court,” it said.

2,Emergency: pros and cons,Legal experts see talk of extreme step as a means to extend govt tenure," 
As the government weighs the option of imposing emergency, in the words of federal ministers, to arrest the deteriorating situation in the country, legal experts question the actual motive behind the consideration of the extreme measure, stating that even if the approval of the president issue was dealt with, the circumstances requiring to impose emergency were ‘currently’ not there.
As the country gradually returns to normalcy after PTI Chairman Imran Khan was granted bail by the IHC, the talk of emergency re-emerges, with claims that the federal government had even discussed the option in Friday’s cabinet meeting.
Rebutting media reports in this regard, Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb in a statement said that the government has not taken any such decision. The statement, however, did not deny that the issue came up for discussion during the cabinet meeting. Two federal ministers have already indicated that the government was weighing the option of emergency.
Legal experts on the other hand questioned the actual motive behind the move, with some seeing it as a means to prolong the government tenure that is completing its five-year constitutional term in August. Former attorney general of Pakistan and former special assistant to Prime Minister of the incumbent government, Irfan Qadir while talking to The Express Tribune, said there was no substance to the debate. “Government ministers say such things for media consumption”.
He said the government requires the approval of the president or a provincial assembly’s resolution, and both the options were not available to it. He said that the president can be advised by the prime minister to impose a state of emergency under Article 232. However, when asked can the president not use his own discretionary powers under Article 48(2) and refuse to accept the prime minister’s advise, Irfan said that indeed, he could. He said that this in any way remain a very difficult option for the government.
Justice (retd) Wajehuddin Ahmad, while talking to The Express Tribune, said that the circumstances required to impose the emergency were not there, to begin with. He, lamenting the decision of calling paramilitary forces to control the law and order situation, said that no such circumstances had arisen requiring the need for paramilitary forces to be called out. “Police could have easily managed the situation.”
“The only reason for considering the imposition of emergency seems to be, to extend their (government) tenure,” he stated. He said in a situation, where two assemblies were not available, ninety days limit for conducting elections had exhausted, and only around two months are left to the expiry of the tenure of the National Assembly and the remaining provincial assemblies, the only beneficiary of this step would be the central government.
He said that considering the option was one thing, but imposing it would be tall order as it requires satisfaction of the president, which means that he can even refuse to act on the cabinet’s advice. He said that during emergency, the government had powers to suspend fundamental rights. He said that usually courts do not intervene in the event of imposition of emergencies, but in exceptional circumstances, courts can review any decision of the cabinet.
Former Justice and senior jurist Nasira Javeed said that the government and the party in power were saying and doing what they desire, disregarding the law and the Constitution at every step of the way.
She said that a coalition partner was planning to hold a dharna outside the Supreme Court. She said that the issue of imposition of the emergency might require the president’s approval, but the way it had used strong arm tactics with every institution, the government might even force the president to ascent to it.
Senior lawyer Hamid Khan, while talking to The Express Tribune, said that the government was in fact trying to create the necessary circumstances to impose emergency. He said that by delaying elections, the government has created the circumstances that are not covered under the Constitution.
He said that how they could impose emergency in Punjab and K-P where assemblies were not available. “Whose power will the government assume, if emergency is imposed?”
“The Punjab and K-P caretaker governments do not enjoy complete powers,” he said and added that by violating one article of the Constitution of not holding elections within 90 days, the government was pushing the entire country towards anarchy, as the Constitution was completely silent on problems that we today find the country in.
Article 232 of the Constitution, “Proclamation of emergency on account of war, internal disturbance, etc.,” reads “ (1) If the President is satisfied that a grave emergency exists in which the security of Pakistan, or any part thereof, is threatened by war or external aggression, or by internal disturbance beyond the power of a Provincial Government to control, he may issue a Proclamation of Emergency.
Provided that for imposition of emergency due to internal disturbances beyond the powers of a Provincial Government to control, a resolution from the Provincial Assembly of that Province shall be required: Provided further that if the President acts on his own, the Proclamation of Emergency shall be placed before both Houses of Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament) for approval by each House within ten days.

3,PDM condemns Imran's statement against COAS,Coalition claims 'problem' is PTI chief cannot offer 'extensions behind closed doors' anymore,"The Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) on Saturday condemned PTI Chairman Imran Khan’s statement against the army chief, calling him a ""terrorist disguised as a politician"".
According to a statement from the PDM, the former prime minister was a “terrorist” in the guise of a politician and was attacking the chief of the army staff (COAS) for standing by the Constitution and for their “refusal to interfere in politics”.
“The person who launched a dirty campaign against the martyrs of Lasbela, is now running a campaign against the army and COAS,” the statement maintained.
It claimed that the “American Jewish lobby” was concerned about him, thus the PDM could understand Imran’s qualms against an army chief who was a Hafiz of the Holy Quran (memorized the scripture), and was an “honest and professional” COAS.
The statement continued that the “problem” was that the “facility to offer extensions” [to those in power] behind closed doors and “in the president’s house” was no longer available to the PTI chief. It added that Imran could be “a degenerate” as much as he wanted, but the “selection facility” was closed.

4,Imran seeks details of all new FIRs,Requests LHC to order authorities not to arrest him without court’s prior permission,"Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief Imran Khan has approached the Lahore High Court (IHC) requesting it to direct authorities to provide him a fresh report containing details of all the criminal cases registered against him on or after May 9, the day when he was arrested from Islamabad.
The PTI chairman has also requested the court to order authorities not to arrest him in any case without prior permission of the court. He has nominated Punjab inspector general police (IGP) and the State through Punjab advocate general as respondents in the plea.
In the petition moved through Imran’s counsel Barrister Salman Safdar, the former premier has contended that more than 100 politically motivated and unlawful first information reports (FIRs) have been lodged against him alone.
“All [this] amounts to grave violation of the petitioner’s rights under Articles 4, 9, 10-A and others and consequently through the instant petition, the petitioner seeks the protection of this court from the most audacious assault on the fundamental rights launched by an executive of this country…
“[This assault is launched] in furtherance of the most constitutionally abhorrent objective: to prevent or delay elections required by the Constitution in order to ensure that the largest political party in Pakistan may be prevented from participating or winning such elections,” it said.

He said extraordinary nature of the attack on fundamental rights of the party workers and leaders—their rights to life and liberty, fair trial, dignity and privacy of home, movement, assembly, association, speech and equal treatment guaranteed under different articles of the Constitution means that the intervention of this court is required in order to protect and enforce the said rights and the rule of law.
“The petitioner’s [Imran Khan’s] political struggle has always been to establish democracy and equity of law in the country and to eliminate the menace of corruption,” he noted.
The PTI chief contended that he, his party’s top leadership and workers had been subject to victimization at hand of the ruling parties who registered false cases against them
He said he had been granted bails in all cases, while he had approached the Islamabad High Court (IHC) for a pre-arrest bail in a National Accountability Bureau (NAB) investigation when NAB authorities “attacked” the biometric office at the IHC and illegally and unlawfully arrested the petitioner.
“Around hundred security personnel attacked the biometric room vandalizing and ransacking the room in the court premises in order to execute a warrant of arrest reportedly issued by the NAB authorities.”
He requested the court to order authorities to submit a fresh report containing details of all the criminal cases registered against him on or after May 9, the day when he was arrested from Islamabad.
 “The petitioner has learnt that a number of criminal cases have been registered against the petitioner and there is a strong apprehension that [he] may again unjustifiably be arrested in mentioned undisclosed new criminal cases registered on or after May 9, 2023,” he added.

5,"LHC orders release of Yasmin, others",Also seeks report on a plea seeking recovery of former provincial minister Ali Afzal Sahi,"Suspending a detention notification, the Lahore High Court (LHC) has ordered release of eighteen women –supporters, workers and politicians of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), including former provincial minister Dr Yasmin Rashid
These women were detained on charges of vandalism, setting ablaze public properties and disturbing law and order after the arrest of PTI Chairman Imran Khan on May 9 from Islamabad High Court premises.
LHC’s Justice Safdar Saleem Shahid issued an order for release of these women while hearing a slew of petitions challenging their detention under Punjab Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance, 1960.
The judge also sought a report from the concerned authorities by May 15 on the disappearance of former PTI provincial minister Ali Afzal Sahi after police officials told the court that Sahi was not in their custody.
During proceedings, her counsel said Dr Yasmin Rashid is a senior citizen and a cancer patient. He said while false cases were registered against many PTI workers and leaders, a number of them were also detained under the Punjab Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance. 1960.
“The government imposed Section 144 to restrain political workers from exercising their democratic right,” he said. Justice Shahid asked the state law officer if Section 144 could be imposed after the announcement of the election date.
When asked for reasons for her detention, the law officer said Dr Rashid is the PTI’s central Punjab president and participates in every activity of the party. “If she had avoided participating in the political activities, the authorities would not have issued her detention order.”
He said there was evidence of Dr Rashid involvement in an attack on the residence of Lahore Corps Commander. Justice Shahid remarked that this incident occurred on May 9 but the detention notification was issued on May 12.
“You people should have registered an FIR rather than detaining the people,” he said.
The law officer argued the unpleasant incidents could not be stopped even if an FIR was registered. “Dr Yasmin Rashid was leading a crowd of thousands of people,” he said.
After hearing detailed arguments, the judge first reserved the decision. He later suspended the detention notification with direction to release Dr Rashid with immediate effect.
During the proceedings, counsels for the petitioners argued that the clients are respectable women—some of them are members of bar association while the rest are housewives.
They contended that the women are neither active members of any political party nor are involved in any anti-state activities;  they even have no connection with any political party nor their activities are prejudicial to the police safety and maintenance of public order.

Justice Shahid also sought a report by May 15 on a plea seeking recovery of the former provincial minister Ali Afzal Sahi. During the proceedings, the additional inspector general police told the court that neither the police arrested Sahi nor he was in their custody right now.
The petitioner’s counsel told the court that Ali Afzal Sahi was arrested from the district bar office but now authorities are hiding his arrest. Police officials told the court that they had formed a team to investigate the matter.

7,"No favourite political party, leader, says US","State dept emphasizes it prefers a ‘stable, democratic Pakistan’","A US State Department spokesperson on Thursday said “A prosperous and strong, democratic Pakistan is critical to US interests,” while reiterating that it did not have a position on any candidate or any political party.
“We continue to monitor the situation in Pakistan closely,” Deputy Spokesperson Vedant Patel told reporters at his daily press briefing in response to a series of questions about the latest developments in the South Asian country.
“Our interest is a safe, secure and prosperous Pakistan. That is in the interest of the US-Pakistan relations, and we call for the respect of democratic principles and the rule of law around the world,” he said.
The United States, he said, does not have a favourite candidate or a favourite political party; not just in Pakistan but anywhere around the world.
“On some of these areas such as press freedom, human rights and things of that nature, we have consistently raised these issues with our counterparts – not just in Pakistan – but also in other countries where we have a perspective to offer on that,” Patel said in response to a question.
The spokesperson said the US was looking to continue strengthening economic ties between the two countries with collaboration in areas of security, renewable energy, climate crisis and increasing agricultural trade.
“That’s what we mean by a strong, prosperous, and democratic Pakistan that is critical to US interests,” the spokesperson added.

8,"Vandalism, internet shutdown causes Rs3.5b loss","About Rs600 million tax revenue was lost due to the shutdown of telephone, internet, and social media","The vandalism and arson during protests by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) workers across the country and the government's shutdown of the internet for three days have taken a toll on the national exchequer as it suffered a loss of more than Rs3.5 billion.
As business activities have been affected, the Federal Board of Revenue also lost about Rs2 billion in terms of revenue, but the Pakistan Software Export Association (PSEA) said that a day's business of the information technology sector is $12 million. Therefore in three days, the PSEA said, the IT sector suffered a loss of Rs10 billion.
According to details, a loss of Rs1.14 billion has been incurred due to the vandalism and burning of government property during the protest of PTI workers, while the initial estimate of the loss to the telecom sector is around Rs2 billion.
About Rs600 million tax revenue was lost due to the shutdown of telephone, internet, and social media. Due to the protests, thousands of daily wage labourers lost their jobs across the country, while the business of transporters was also affected due to the shutdown of transport.

9,Top court to take up ECP poll plea on 15th,Electoral watchdog did not hold Punjab election on May 14 despite SC order,"All eyes will be on the Supreme Court on May 15 (Monday), as it will take up the Election Commission of Pakistan’s plea requesting the top court to revisit its order of holding Punjab Assembly elections on May 14.
A three-member bench comprising Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial and Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Munib Akhtar will hear the ECP’s plea.
On April 4, the same bench had quashed the ECP’s decision to extend the poll date from April 10 to Oct 8 and fixed May 14 as the new date for it.
The bench had also directed the government to release Rs21 billion funds for holding the elections in Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.
However, the ECP had apprised the court that the coalition government was reluctant to release the funds.
It contended that holding separate elections in Punjab and K-P would incur more expenses as compared to holding them on the same day.
On May 3, the ECP filed a plea asking the apex court to review its April 4 order.
Earlier during the month, the government and the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf developed a consensus on conducting elections across the country on one day but failed to agree on a date for holding them.
The ECP in its review plea said that changing the election schedule was its domain under Section 58 of the Elections Act 2017.
“All provisions of the Constitution are required to be read together in harmony to make the provisions effective, workable and meaningful,” the plea stated.

It explained that Punjab and K-P had 173 and 55 National Assembly seats, respectively, out of a total of 326 seats, which made the seats of both the assemblies around 72% of the NA’s total strength.
The plea stated that the general elections to the NA were due in the near future, as it was completing its term in Aug 2023, adding that the ECP required the government machinery which was non-partisan to conduct them fairly and in accordance with the law.
It urged the court to consider ground realities in true perspective because if the polls were held while permanent govenrments were in place in both the provinces, the sanctity, objectivity and fairness of the elections to 72% of the general deats of the NA would be compromised.
The petition emphasised that the courts interpreted the law but they did not rewrite it. As per the interpretation of the provision of Section 58, change of the election schedule or giving a fresh schedule, of which poll date was an essential component or stage, was the domain of the ECP.
“Under no provision of the Constitution or the law, the Supreme Court could have taken the exercise upon itself to appoint the poll date through the April 4 order. The Constitution is an organic document, it blossoms and evolves with time.”
It added that the appointing of a date or changing it was an executive exercise, and certainly not a judicial one.
The appointing of a date or changing it is an executive exercise, and certainly not a judicial exercise, the petition emphasised.
