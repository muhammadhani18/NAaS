2,‘Steps being taken to make all dams functional’,Rawalpindi commissioner says he will start visiting all the dams in the coming weeks,"On the special instructions of the Punjab chief secretary, steps are being taken on a war-footing basis to activate all the dams across the division, Rawalpindi Commissioner Liaqat Ali Chattha said on Saturday. Chattha formed a separate task force on all the dams in the division while initiating practical measures in this regard.
According to sources, the task force formed on each dam will include the Assistant Director of Agriculture, Assistant Director of Water Management, SDO Irrigation and four dignitaries from the area benefited by the dam under the supervision of the acting commissioner of the respective area. The Rawalpindi commissioner said he will start visiting all the dams in the coming weeks. He directed that the presence of the task force should be ensured on the occasion of the visit, which, after completing the homework, would inform the commissioner about the ground facts on the occasion. Chattha said that the government had spent billions of rupees on the dams built in the Rawalpindi division.
“Now, if these dams are not fully functional for the public due to minor problems or negligence of the department, then it is a matter of shame,” he said. He expressed these views while presiding over a meeting held in the Rawalpindi Commissioner's Office related to the Small Dams Project. Director Development Nazia Sadhan, Project Director Irrigation Tabraiz Elahi, Project Director Hamza Sheikh and other relevant officers participated in the meeting.
Chattha added that the construction of new dams and full functionalisation of existing dams was the urgent need of the hour. “Since Pakistan is an agricultural country, water is needed not only for drinking and general use but also for agriculture,” he said. “Unfortunately, Pakistan is one of the top countries that will face severe water shortage in the near future,” he added.
“Thousands of cusecs of water lost in rains every year can be stored by increasing the capacity of existing dams and constructing new dams. It can also reduce the risk of flooding.” On this occasion, during a detailed briefing on the existing dams in Chakwal district, it was told that there were 23 dams in Tala Gang and Chakwal, of which 19 dams were complete and functional while four were under construction.

4,Three water treatment plants approved,Work on project to treat Rawal Dam’s water will start in July 2023,"In order to address the existing water crisis being faced by Rawalpindi and Islamabad, approval has been granted to the project of installing three new stateof-the-art sewage treatment plants to treat the water of Rawal Dam, the largest source of drinking water in the twin cities.
According to sources, the work on this project will start in July this year while the estimated project cost will be around Rs6.07 billion. The project will be completed in nine months. Sources said the catchment area of Rawal Dam is around 106.25 square meters which are spread through Murree Hills and Bani Gala to Rawal Dam.
They said keeping in view the wide catchment area, it was decided to expand and increase the water treatment plants. The sources said that the project will be jointly completed by Capital Development Authority (CDA) and the Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA) Rawalpindi. The Central Development Working Party (CDWP), located at Planning & Development Division, Planning Commission, Islamabad, which is a clearing house for any provincial project, has also approved the project.
Meanwhile, WASA has also prepared a plan for further expansion of the Rawalpindi water supply sewage treatment plant, the study of which has been completed. The water storage capacity in Rawal Dam is 1,752 acre feet while at present the water storage in the dam is 1,748 acre feet. Rawal Dam was built in 1962. It supplies water to both Rawalpindi and Islamabad and is, in fact, the main source of water supply to the twin cities. The sources said the old water treatment plants have fallen short, hence, the installation of three new sewage water treatment plants will increase water purity. Tenders will be issued in the next month for the implementation of this project, they said.
Rawal Dam supplies 25 million gallons of water daily to the garrison city. The installation of a new water treatment plant will also increase this supply, while WASA has also planned to construct two large water tanks at Rawal Dam along with the WASA Colony Quarters. During the new financial year 2023-24, a smalldiameter steel pipeline will also be laid inside the old dilapidated cemented water supply line from Rawal Dam to Rawalpindi to make it usable. This will increase the 10 to 15 million gallons of water supply to the garrison city.
