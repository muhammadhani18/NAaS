0,Dubai moves to attract tourists,DET head says Schengen style unified single visa being considered,"In the first quarter of 2023, Dubai welcomed about 4.67 million international overnight visitors, compared to 3.97 million tourists during the same period in 2022, according to the latest data published by Dubai’s Department of Economy and Tourism (DET). In an effort to fortify its existing and emerging markets, as well as uncover fresh opportunities for growth both in the domestic and international markets, DET is ramping up its pursuit of nontraditional tourism avenues to attract visitors from Pakistan, with particular focus on pillars of sustainability, gastronomy, trade, and technology.
Speaking to a panel of journalists from Pakistan, DET Head of the South Asian region, Badar Ali Habib said, “Pakistan is a market that we’ve been heavily invested in for a while and can already tell you that Pakistan is a very important market for us. We’ve been ramping up our efforts for Pakistan since 2017.
Pakistan has been a market that has given us a lot of good numbers over the last couple of years. It’s been consistently in our top 10 source markets. Last year, it was on number 9.” According to Global Media Insights (GMI), the Pakistani population in Dubai makes up 12.69% of its population or nearly 1.28 million people. Data from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) confirms that the volume of remittances from the UAE to Pakistan in FY2022 was $2,555.22 million.
“We also are fully aware that Pakistan is a market that Dubai isn’t the only one after – other destinations are also after the Pakistanis including Turkey, Singapore, Malaysia, Baku, Sri Lanka as well as others,” said Habib, adding that proximity, historical ties and a brotherly relationship with Pakistan is what the DET hopes to build upon. Recently, the United Arab Emirates established Asia’s largest visa centre in Karachi. The centre will be equipped with 11 counters and will issue 200 UAE visas on a daily basis. “We realise that there’s so much more potential in Pakistan.
The idea of introducing the Golden Visas or the Entrepreneur Visas was to attract demographics like the Pakistanis,” said Habib. When asked if there were any restrictions on visas being offered to Pakistanis from different districts, the DET head of South Asia said there are millions of Pakistanis working in the UAE from all across and there is no restriction or demarcation regarding visas in any district. “For us, anybody who has a passport can apply for a visa,” said Habib. For a long time, Dubai has been considered the ‘transit hub’ of the world – with passengers stopping over before embarking on a flight towards the West or East. “
Pakistanis, Indians, Bangladeshis, Sri Lankans usually stop over enroute towards the West. What we’ve done this year is we’re looking at the ‘stopover’ more seriously.” At the Arabian Travel Market in Dubai, during a panel discussion on “The Future of Travel for the GCC”, Fatima Al Sairafi, the Minister of Tourism in Bahrain, stated that ministerial-level discussions have been taking place among regional countries regarding the implementation of a unified single visa, similar to the Schengen style.
She expressed confidence in this happening soon, citing the trend of people travelling to Europe and spending their time in multiple countries rather than just one. “We really saw the value this can bring not to each country but all of us,” highlighted Al Sairafi. Muzzammil Ahussain, CEO Almosafer, said, “Why would you come to just one country? Yes, Saudi is huge, UAE has a lot to offer to tourists. But if you’re actually in the region, you want to visit multiple countries. There is already a lot of work being done like UAE residents can go to Saudi and Saudis have done a good job by offering visas on arrival and e-visa. But the unified visa will make life much easier for tourists.” He further highlighted that visitors from Pakistan, India and other countries who are set to perform Umrah will also be able to visit other parts of the region as well.
Dubai is also providing alternative growth pathways that promote long-term affiliation with the city and enhance its position as a global livability hub. These initiatives have also strengthened Dubai’s pro-business environment, making it an attractive destination for multinationals, family offices, global talent, entrepreneurs, innovators, and investors, said a press statement issued by DET. “I know that a lot of Pakistanis understand Dubai, but somewhere there needs to be an alignment in terms of perception. Some people think Dubai is too expensive. Today, many of our stakeholders are offering free stay and entertainment tickets for children. We are doing this because we understand that Pakistan has its own challenges with its economic conditions and we want to give everybody the fair chance to come and enjoy Dubai. Some people think that they’ve seen Dubai many times and there’s no reason to come back – but Dubai keeps renewing itself almost every two, three years.
So, we promise Pakistanis that if you come now, you’ll have brand new itineraries with attractions that you haven’t visited the last time you were around,” reiterated Habib

1,"Pakistan, Afghanistan agree to remove trade hurdles","Will streamline trade processes, provide conducive environment","Pakistan and Afghanistan have underscored the need for streamlining and simplifying trade procedures to reduce bottlenecks and ensure a conducive environment for bilateral ties. The matter came up for discussion at a highlevel meeting co-chaired by Federal Minister for Commerce Syed Naveed Qamar and his Afghan counterpart Haji Nooruddin Azizi on Saturday.
Senior officials from both sides participated in the huddle. Detailed deliberations were held on various important aspects, including customs cooperation, border management, reduction in tariffs and issues related to pharmaceutical and meat industries. Each side expressed its commitment to strengthening trade ties and addressing the challenges emerging in the bilateral relationship.
The two ministers emphasised the significance of smooth customs processes and efficient border management to facilitate trade and enhance economic cooperation. They called for enhancing trade volumes and expanding the range of traded goods between Pakistan and Afghanistan. On the occasion, the importance of diversifying trade beyond traditional items and exploring new avenues of economic cooperation was acknowledged.
Officials of the two sides outlined the potential benefits of investing in transportation and logistics infrastructure, which would contribute to increased trade activity and economic growth. They pledged to work together to create a more favourable trade environment. Separately, a four-member Nigerian delegation, led by Minister for Aviation Hadi Sirika, called on Commerce Minister Naveed Qamar. They engaged in discussions on increasing people-to-people contacts, promoting cultural exchanges, boosting tourism and enhancing economic cooperation.

2,Pakistani textile attracts global buyers,"Sector needs to upgrade supply chain, maximise value addition","Business is good this time around. Our trade volume may reach $1 million for this phase,” said Gauhar Mustafa, owner of Gohar Textile Mills from Pakistan, a participant at the 133rd China Import and Export Fair held in Guangzhou. The exhibition, also known as the Canton Fair, concluded its third and final phase on May 5. Over the past five days, textiles, fabrics and clothes were showcased alongside other products to attract international buyers. It is Mustafa’s fifth attendance at the fair. This year, he had sustainable, recyclable home textiles with him. “We are getting many customers worldwide,” he said, adding that as China’s epidemic prevention and control has entered a new stage, it is easier for international traders like him to travel back and forth, and trade delegations find it better to fortify ties with their partners and peers and explore new opportunities.
For Tayyab Rasheed, Director Marketing (Towel Division) AI Textiles, Pakistan, the story is even longer as being the seventhtime participant. The textile sector in Pakistan has an overwhelming impact on the economy, contributing 60% to the country’s exports. In today’s highly competitive global environment, the sector needs to upgrade its supply chain, improve productivity, and maximise value addition to be able to survive. However, Pakistan’s textile group exports declined by 14.2% during the first 10 months (July-April) of current fiscal year 2022-23 and stood at $13.71 billion.

3,PSX ends second successive week in green,"KSE-100 index advances by 661 points, or 1.6%, and settles at 42,242","Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) continued its positive momentum and posted smart gains in the outgoing four-day trading week, buoyed by share buyback announcements, strong financial results and cherry-picking of stocks that had dropped to attractive valuations. The week began on Tuesday with a positive session on the back of share buyback announcements by Lucky Cement and Habib Bank sponsors coupled with robust corporate results.
Investor optimism continued on Wednesday as trade deficit shrank 39.6% year-on-year, giving a boost to buying activity at the bourse. However, the KSE-100 index endured mixed sentiment in a highly volatile session on Thursday when investors opted to book profits at attractive valuations. Things took a turn for better on Friday as the index gained over 100 points due to cherry-picking, though investor participation remained low. The KSE-100 index gained 661 points, or 1.6% week-on-week, and settled at 42,242 by the end of the week.
JS Global analyst Wasil Zaman, in his report, noted that the KSE-100 maintained its upward momentum during the outgoing week following dialogue between the government and the opposition on election date. Sector-wise, food (up 8% WoW) and cement (+6.6% WoW) stood out as the key outperformers while refinery (down 4% WoW) and fertiliser (-3.4% WoW) were the key underperformers. On the news front, Pakistan’s trade deficit data showed a further contraction of 43% month-on-month (MoM) to $829 million in April 2023 as administrative controls over imports remained intact. State Bank’s foreign currency reserves remained largely stable, declining by just $6 million to $4.5 billion and translating into an import cover of one month. Inflation numbers continued to climb up to 36.4% year-on-year in April 2023, mainly driven by food inflation. Cement dispatches touched a ninemonth low as they dropped 22% MoM to 2.95 million tons in April on the back of tough macro conditions.
Despite the sequential improvement of 6%, oil marketing companies’ sales were down 47% YoY in April and 24% YoY during 10MFY23. On the international front, the US central bank further raised interest rates, which touched a 16-year high, as it battled to contain inflation, the JS analyst added. Arif Habib Limited, in its report, said that the stock market commenced trading on a positive note on the back of robust financial results from major sectors. The announcement of share buyback by Lucky Cement (second buyback) and HBL’s sponsor further boosted sentiment, it said. Furthermore, the trade deficit reduced by 40% YoY at $24 billion in 10MFY23, which kept the bullish momentum in place. However, inflation for April 2023 came in at 36.4% YoY, a historic high. Moreover, Pakistani rupee appreciated by Rs0.25, or 0.01% WoW, and settled at Rs283.59 against the US dollar. The market closed at 42,242, gaining 661 points (or 1.6%) WoW.
In terms of sectors, positive contribution came from commercial banks (252 points), cement (247 points), fertiliser (67 points), food and personal care products (64 points), and paper and board (60 points). Negative contribution came from E&P (86 points), technology (51 points) and auto assemblers (36 points). In terms of individual stocks, positive contributors were Lucky Cement (167 points), Habib Bank (107 points), United Bank (94 points), Packages Limited (60 points) and Engro Fertilisers (53 points). Negative contribution came from Pakistan Petroleum (40 points), Systems Limited (34 points), Pakistan Oilfields (24 points), Indus Motor (22 points) and TRG Pakistan (17 points). Foreigners turned net sellers during the week under review as they sold stocks worth $6.1 million as compared to net buying of $14.2 million last week, the AHL report added.

4,SCODA to help enhance Pakistan’s exports,Counsellor for focusing on demand-driven products,"Pakistan’s pavilion at the Qingdao SCODA Pearl International Expo Centre has emerged as a great platform that will help enhance exports to China and other countries of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). “This kind of online platform is very important to enhance our exports but it has to be more demanddriven,” Pakistan Embassy Commercial Counsellor in Beijing Ghulam Qadir told APP. The international expo centre, located in the SCO Local Economic and Trade Cooperation Demonstration Area (SCODA), had been made operational in November 2022.
Pakistani products exhibited at one of the exhibition halls include clothes, rice and various food items besides an array of cultural traditions. “There is a need to see what kinds of products are being imported by China and what their preferences are,” the counsellor remarked. “We also need to know the nature of demand from other SCO countries, and based on that, we need to increase and diversify such products which are to be displayed here,” he added.
About the pavilion, the envoy said it was actually supported by the government of China, which also wanted Pakistan to enhance its exports to Beijing. Qadir pointed out that there was a huge trade deficit with China, which could be bridged by ramping up exports from Pakistan.

5,Traders hit out at govt’s incompetency,Demand fair share in policymaking and budget planning,"Traders are the backbone of the economy but unfortunately the country’s economy is stagnating due to the government’s poor policies and incompetency, said Pakistan Industrial and Traders Associations Front (PIAF) Chairman Fahimur Rahman Sehgal. He made the remarks when he, along with Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) President Irfan Iqbal Sheikh and other members, visited the office of the Pakistan Automobile Spare Parts Importers and Dealers Association (PASPIDA). Sehgal said due to the prevailing political instability, the government had lost the right direction, which was a cause of grave concern.
He urged the government to take the business community on board for suggestions on the next budget to achieve high economic growth. As the trade and industry are already under a severe burden of taxes, he called on the government to provide tax relief in the upcoming budget. Citing a report saying that the ban on auto parts imports has led to a shortage of replacement parts and an increase in smuggling, Sehgal said that import curbs were hurting the auto industry, and ultimately hindering the legitimate business.
Echoing similar views, the FPCCI president mentioned that there were a lot of taxes at the provincial and federal levels while there was no significant expansion in the industry. The meeting observed that the PIAF and PASPIDA had been maintaining a close liaison for the past two decades and would continue to raise their voice in support of the traders. “Many auto parts are not being imported under HS codes 84 and 85,” former PASPIDA chairman Arshad Islam told The Express Tribune. “This has caused a lot of friction.” At present, auto parts imports are allowed on a 360-day document approval (DA) basis, which means that the seller will be paid in 360 days instead of the instant payment mode of Letter of Credit (LC). However, “foreign companies are not comfortable with this arrangement as banks are not willing to issue guarantee that they will be paid in 360 days due to the fluctuating rupee value,” he lamented.
Moreover, smuggling of auto parts was accelerating owing to the high demand for replacement parts, Islam said, adding that Pakistan was a third-world country with old-model cars that required frequent parts replacement. The country’s trade deficit decreased to $0.83 billion in April 2023, the lowest since April 2011.

6,Temasek may invest $100m in BlueStone,Potential deal can boost BlueStone’s plans to expand aggressively,"Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings is considering investing $100 million in Indian jeweller BlueStone for a stake of about 20%, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The investment would value Bengaluru-based BlueStone, also backed by venture capital firm Accel and Indian industrialist Ratan Tata, at close to $500 million, said one of the sources, who declined to be identified. The potential deal could boost BlueStone’s plans to expand aggressively in India, the second-largest jewellery consuming nation behind China, as demand surges after the pandemic. The jeweller has previously disclosed plans to open 300 stores by 2024.
It has over 150 stores now, according to its website. BlueStone operates in a market that is dominated by thousands of small and large local independent jewellery stores, but also branded outlets like Titan Company-owned Tanishq and CaratLane, and Kalyan Jewellers. Unlike many traditional jewellers, companies like BlueStone and CaratLane also offer online sales.

7,OGRA opens up LNG market,Sets transportation tariff for liquefied natural gas shippers,"The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) has set a transportation tariff for liquefied natural gas (LNG) shippers in an attempt to open up the market for private sector. At present, public gas utilities have a monopoly in the LNG market. In a statement, Ogra said that under its Gas Third Party Access (TPA) Rules 2018, it determined the transportation tariff for Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) for financial years 2019- 20 and 2020-21.
Ogra has allowed a tariff of Rs29.58 per million cubic feet (mcf) for the transmission network and Rs101.75 per mcf for the distribution network. SNGPL, however, had claimed tariffs of Rs38.85 per mcf and Rs125.77 per mcf for the transmission and distribution network respectively. The transportation tariff has been determined for the shipper who transports gas through the SNGPL’s network.
The regulator observed that in the case of distribution, the petitioner (SNGPL) had shown its inability to calculate capacity of the system. It added that the present gap between supply and demand of natural gas coupled with reduced pressure was the major constraint to calculating the available capacity of the system. While calculating the throughput of distribution network, SNGPL excluded the volumes of gas carried to Pakistan Oilfields Limited (POL), Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) and Pak Arab Refinery as well as unaccounted-for-gas (UFG) volumes.
The regulator pointed out that the approach adopted by SNGPL based on throughput was not in accordance with the TPA Rules. “Rather it is the petitioner’s own misinterpretation.” It observed that a TPA regime had been implemented to proceed towards liberalisation of the gas industry to foster competition and reduce tariff, while improving energy supply through the injection of additional volumes by potential suppliers. “This scheme is a win-win situation for the petitioner and potential shippers as it will result in supply of additional volumes to customers, thus addressing issues of reduced pressure, volume curtailment, etc,” the statement said.
“The authority also considers it important to impress upon the petitioner to facilitate the TPA regime and avoid banging on non-convincing reasons for declaring supply to consumers on the distribution network by third parties as unfeasible.” It was highlighted during a hearing held earlier that the petitioner was enjoying a monopoly in the gas market and was not providing the opportunity to other shippers. United Gas Distribution Company Limited (UGDCL), despite a lapse of around eight years, could not bring even a single cargo owing to various hindrances in the system. “Such continued practice by the petitioner will result in collapse of the entire TPA regime, which will fail to achieve its objective,” the regulator warned.
SNGPL’s management was requested to provide details of shippers and their contracted capacity. Prospective shippers are in the market but restrictions have been placed by the transporter to prevent the shippers from supplying gas to the existing consumers, it said.

8,Debt restructuring carries risks,"In case of restructuring, most of domestic banks may face serious solvency issues","Pakistan is mired in a debt trap as its domestic debt and markup payments have grown to unsustainable levels. The government has the option to restructure the debt to create fiscal space to revive the economy. The exercise, however, carries a high risk of hurting domestic banks and the overall economy.
Debt restructuring could be in the shape of rescheduling timelines for debt (principal amount) repayment, deferring markup payments and/ or cutting the size of total domestic debt. A recent report titled “Pakistan Economy: Is Domestic Debt Restructure Viable?”, authored by Arif Habib Limited’s (AHL) analysts Sana Tawfik and Farhan Rizvi, stated that taking a closer look at some of the major domestic debt restructuring episodes globally over the past few decades, the median public debt-to-GDP level before restructuring was 70% while the share of domestic debt averaged 37%.
“Pakistan’s existing debt remains higher than the average on both of these key metrics.” Pakistan’s domestic debt as of December 2022 stood at Rs3.8 trillion (45% of GDP, or 53% of total debt), which more than doubled over the past five years. Total public debt stood at Rs52.5 trillion (73.5% of GDP). “The pace of public debt accumulation has accelerated over the past decade amid larger fiscal deficits and drying up of foreign direct investment (FDI) and foreign portfolio investment (FPI) inflows.”
Secondly, the volume of debt servicing (markup payment) on the total domestic debt is estimated at Rs5.6 trillion in the current fiscal year, which constitutes 76% of the collection of tax revenue. “Markup payments have risen to alarmingly high levels,” the analysts wrote, adding that a very little fiscal space was left with the government to run the economy after paying 76% of revenue in debt servicing. “Continued monetary tightening (a hike of 725 basis points in FY23) with record high interest rates has been a key driver behind the surge in markup payments,” the report mentioned.
Given the inability of the federal government to expand its revenue base, improve tax administration and recovery, and/ or reduce expenditure including on lossmaking state-owned entities (SOEs), the medium to long-term outlook for the fiscal account appears challenging. This, along with already high public debt levels, equates to a potential debt trap, which needs to be addressed sooner rather than later, the analysts said. Pakistan’s banking sector holds 66% of the total domestic debt, amounting to approximately Rs17 trillion of government securities (T-bills, PIBs and Sukuk) as of June 2022. The bulk of the holdings are in PIBs (53%), followed by T-bills (34%) and Sukuk (13%).
Besides, the balance sheet structure is highly skewed towards low-risk sovereign credit, which constitutes 45% of total assets with investment-deposit ratio (IDR) of 82%. A deep analysis suggests the domestic debt restructuring will push most of the banks to “face serious solvency issues in case of any…haircuts (cutting size of domestic debt) with the risk of bank run and liquidity challenges.” In such a scenario, the central bank will need to intervene to provide major liquidity support with a number of banks requiring restructuring themselves, Tawfik and Rizvi observed in the report. A debt restructuring exercise will result in both direct and indirect economic costs. While the direct impact includes capital loss for institutions and individual bondholders, however, there remains a set of indirect impacts such as pullback of lending by the banks facing capital constraints.
Moreover, banks with weaker capital position may face deposit run with spillover effects on other banks amid lack of confidence in the ability of the central bank to ensure deposit protection. Other risks include disruption in the interbank market due to heightened concerns over liquidity and solvency. This could lead to capital flight and impact the foreign exchange reserves, exchange rate and credit ratings, they said. The analysts argued that they drew three major conclusions from the possible domestic debt restructuring. “Weak capital position of the banking sector makes debt restructuring difficult to implement with major regulatory support. Therefore, an effective restructuring exercise will require the umbrella of a long-term International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme and additional taxation measures could be possible near-term alternatives.

9,Taxmen get 160% less pay than court officials,"Five dozen govt departments, organisations receiving higher-than-standard salaries","A taxman is getting 135% to 160% less salary compared to an officer working in the same pay scale in the Supreme Court and two government investigation agencies, the discrimination that is adding fuel to the fire at a time of six-decade record high inflation.
A comparison of pay slips of the grade-18 officers working in the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), the top court, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and the Secretariat Group showed that the tax officer was getting the lowest salary compared to his peer grade officers working in other departments.
Unlike any performance-based incentive system, the government, at least on paper, implements a uniform pay scale for all branches. But nearly five-dozen departments and organisations are now getting higher than the standard salaries, including the Parliament, the Presidency, the PM’s Office and the armed forces.
The details showed that the gross salary of a grade-18 officer was roughly Rs115,000 a month. It is inclusive of Rs23,000 two allowances as performance allowance and fixed FBR incentive. The FBR’s special allowances were equal to 20% of the officer’s gross salary.

The FBR is supposedly one of the earning hands of the government but due to its poor performance, deep-rooted corruption and heavy dependence on indirect modes of taxation, there are few who publicly advocate for an increase in their salaries, at par with other government departments. 
A private secretary of the SC in grade 18 - who falls in the category of support staff gets a Rs298,000 monthly salary. The court's grade 18 officer salary was Rs183,000 or 159% more than the salary paid to a tax collector on the same scale. The SC officer is also getting two judicial allowances worth Rs170,000, which is equal to 57% of his gross salary, according to the details.
The taxmen felt aggrieved due to the government’s decision to give 150% executive allowance to the employees serving in the federal secretariat. But the FBR’s top management could not plead the case of its officers in front of the prime minister and instead tried to take a small pie out of direct tax collection.
Inflation in Pakistan skyrocketed to six decades’ highest level of 36.4% in April, further squeezing the purchasing power of people, particularly the salaried class, either in the government or in the private sector. 
Tax officers, mostly serving in pay scales of 17 and 18, have started drafting leave applications for the period from May 8 to June 30. Taxmen claimed that at least 150 to 200 officers would go on leave with effect from May 8 if the FBR management and the government did not pay any heed to their plight.
The collective leave applications, or unwillingness to perform duties, may create more problems for the FBR, which has already suffered a revenue shortfall of Rs380 billion in the first 10 months of the current fiscal year.
The Board’s employees had been denied a special allowance equal to 150% of the basic salary of government officers of grade 17 and above, approved by the federal cabinet, on the pretext of a pre-existing special allowance. However, the FBR’s performance allowance has remained frozen since 2015 and it has been reduced to effectively 20-30% of the basic pay.

A deputy director working in grade 18 in the FIA is getting a Rs269,000 monthly gross salary, according to the Accountant General of Pakistan Revenue’s prepared pay slip. The FIA’s grade 18 officer’s salary is 135%, or Rs154,000 higher than the salary drawn by the FBR officer.
The FIA officers are getting different types of allowances, which include a deputation allowance of Rs12,000, fixed travel and a daily allowance of Rs12,800, monthly investigation allowance of Rs36,800 and anti-organisation crime allowance of Rs30,600. The FIA’s allowances are equal to 39% of the gross monthly salary. 
Similarly, the grade deputy director working in the NAB is getting a Rs268,000 per month salary – Rs153,000 or 133% higher than the salary received by the FBR’s officer on the same pay scale. The NAB officer is getting a fixed Rs51,200 travel and daily allowance, Rs12,800 NAB hardship allowance and Rs35,000 monthly investigation allowance.
A grade 18 section officer working in the secretariat is drawing Rs177,000 gross monthly salary, which is inclusive of Rs73,000 new executive allowance. As a result, the secretariat group employee is now getting Rs62,000 or 54% higher salary than the taxman. This suggests that before the approval of the executive allowance, the FBR people were better off compared to the salaries received by the secretariat employees.
