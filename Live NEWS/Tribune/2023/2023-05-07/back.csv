4,Pakistan surrenders Hajj quota to Saudi Arabia,800 unutilised seats returned to save $24 million,"For the first time in Pakistan’s history, Pakistan has surrendered the quota allotted to the country by Saudi Arabia for the Hajj pilgrims as applications fell short of the available seats.
The religious affairs ministry has confirmed that the eight thousand government scheme quota has been returned. The sources in the ministry informed that the move was aimed to save 24 million dollars as the government would have to pay this additional amount for accommodation.
The federal government had earlier announced that there would be no balloting for the Hajj applicants as the authorities could see that there would be a shortage of applicants.
This historic change shows the drastic impacts of inflation in the country.
It had been the government’s long-standing demand to increase the quota but Pakistan failed to meet the allotted quota. This year, Pakistan was given full share for the pilgrimage after a long time.
The report said the government also considered to allocate the unused Hajj quota to the private Hajj operators. However, because of the fear that private operators might buy dollars from open market, it planned to surrender the unutilised quota.

6,Qureshi slams Indian FM remarks on Pakistan,Ex-FM takes exception to Indian accusations linking Pakistan to terrorism,"Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Vice Chairman Shah Mehmood Qureshi strongly condemned Indian Foreign Minister S Jaishankar's statement after the departure of Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, stating that it was against diplomatic etiquette to ridicule the Pakistani foreign minister.
“Although I disagree with Bilawal, I am talking about the foreign minister of Pakistan,” he said while speaking to the media in Multan. “Bilawal Bhutto went there on the invitation of the Indian foreign minister and Pakistan is a member of this forum; Bilawal was his guest, but he ridiculed the Pakistani foreign minister.”
His behaviour was against diplomatic etiquette as he linked Pakistan with terrorism, Qureshi said.
“What justification did you have to link Pakistan with terrorism and call yourself a victim?” he asked.
“There was no justification for it; this may be his own thinking, but it is not; not only Pakistan but also Kashmiris condemned the statement of the Indian foreign minister,” he remarked.
“Bilawal went there because of SCO (Shanghai Cooperation Organisation), Iran also participated for the first time,” he pointed out. “Before Bilawal goes to India, there is a debate about whether he should go there or not; there is Hindutva thinking there, so it is useless to go there, while the second thought was that we are members and should go there for better relations; we went there.”
“Our experienced diplomats should have given Bilawal advice on what should his reaction be if they would raise bilateral issues on the platform of SCO,” he added.
“Mr Jaishankar, you are hiding your eyes from the facts,” he slammed the Indian FM, adding that as a result of terrorism, Pakistan has lost more than 80,000 people and billions of dollars.
“Before pointing fingers at Pakistan, you have to look within yourself; you have to look at your neck,” he added.
He also said that the conditions in occupied Kashmir are getting worse. The situation of occupied Kashmir should be seen in the context of August 5, 2020, since this was an “unconstitutional and illegal move”, he added.
“The world is seeing the true face of India; we have exposed India before,” Qureshi said, asking what was Kulbhushan Yadav doing in Balochistan.
He wondered whether he was on a goodwill visit to Pakistan, or whether he was serving officer caught spying and inciting terrorism in Pakistan.
“This world knows what issue they are working on; India is using it as a shield,” he said.
Regarding political issues, the PTI leader wondered that if the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) has decided to “sacrifice” Shahbaz Sharif, what can they do about it.
“Respect the decision of the court and conduct the election and do not sacrifice before Eidul Adha,” he said.
He echoed the accusation of corruption of Rs20 billion in the distribution of flour, pointing out that the government does not have Rs20 billion available to conduct elections.
He said that after Allah, the Constitution is supreme, but lamented that it is being mocked and not being implemented.
“If the constitution is implemented, no crisis can arise; Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) neither looks at the Constitution nor traditions for their purposes,” he claimed.
He added that PDM is not coming to any conclusion, as they want to “run away” from the election.
“Maulana Fazlur Rahman was against the negotiations from the first day and despite Bilawal's efforts, he was not willing to negotiate,” he pointed out.
“Similarly, there is a clear division in the PML-N regarding negotiations; Ishaq Dar has the clear confidence of Nawaz Sharif while the behavior of Khawaja Asif and other ministers is in front of the nation.”
The PTI leader said that in the negotiations with PDM, PTI had agreed on elections in the country through a single-day caretaker setup.
“But when Nawaz Sharif said we do not accept the decision of 3-2; if the four will accept the decision of the three, then we have separated from the negotiations,” he added.
He also said that when negotiating with someone, the environment is made conducive. Before the second sit-in, 33 PTI workers were arrested, he added.
He further said that he spoke to finance and interior ministers in this regard.
“Then the matter went on, then on the same night, Parvaiz Elahi's residence was attacked; anew trial was made against Murad Saeed and what happened to [Ali Amin] Gandapur is in front of the nation,” he added.
In response to a question regarding the case against Elahi, Qureshi said that the federal government has declared indifference to the attack on his house.
“Caretaker Punjab chief minister, Punjab IG, Chief Secretary and other top officials were not in the country; at least the responsibility should be determined,” he demanded.
He said that all over Pakistan, on the call of Imran Khan, at half past five, they were marching peacefully to express solidarity with the chief justice.
In Lahore, Imran himself was leading the rally and rallies would also be held in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), he added.
Section 144 has been implemented despite the permission of the court regarding the rally in Islamabad, he further stated.
“We will go to court against him for contempt; people everywhere in South Punjab, including Multan, will do their part to show solidarity with the court and judges,” he added.

Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and State Councilor and Foreign Minister of China Qin Gang made the commitment during the 4th round of the foreign minister-level Pakistan-China Strategic Dialogue co-chaired by them.
The Chinese foreign minister was on his first official visit to Pakistan from 5 to 6 May.
During the dialogue, the entire range of bilateral relations and cooperation, including in political, strategic, economic, defence, security, education, and cultural domains was reviewed. Regional and global issues of mutual interest were also discussed.
The foreign minister of Pakistan congratulated the Chinese leadership on the successful holding of the 'Two Sessions'. He wished China's people and the new leadership greater success in building a strong, prosperous, and modern socialist country.
He also expressed his resolve to work together with State Councilor Qin Gang to further fortify the Pakistan-China relationship. Recalling the consensus reached between the leadership of the two countries during the visit of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to Beijing in November 2022, the two sides agreed to further strengthen Pakistan-China strategic relations amidst profound regional and international changes.
The ministers expressed satisfaction at the growing momentum in high-level exchanges between Pakistan and China while reaffirming the need for convening important bilateral sectoral engagements.
The ministers underlined that Pakistan-China friendship was a historic reality and a conscious choice of the two nations. As 'All-Weather Strategic Cooperative Partners', Pakistan and China enjoy complete mutual trust, and their iron-clad friendship enjoys complete consensus in both countries.
Both sides agreed on continuing their enduring support on issues concerning each other's core national interests. Reaffirming Pakistan's special place in China's neighbourhood diplomacy, the Chinese side reiterated its firm support for Pakistan's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity, as well as its unity, stability, and economic prosperity.
The Pakistani side reiterated its commitment to the ""One China"" policy as well as its firm support to China on all core issues of its national interest, including Taiwan, Xinjiang, Tibet, Hong Kong, and the South China Sea.
Welcoming the completion of a decade of CPEC in 2023, the two sides hailed CPEC as a shining example of Belt and Road cooperation which has accelerated socio-economic development, job creation, and improvement of people's livelihoods in Pakistan.
Reaffirming their commitment to the high-quality development of CPEC, both sides noted with satisfaction the steady progress of CPEC projects. The two sides reiterated the key significance of the ML-1 project under the CPEC framework and agreed to advance its earliest implementation.
They also agreed to actively advance the Karachi Circular Railway alongside key areas of cooperation including agriculture, science and technology, IT, and renewable energy.
The two sides reviewed the progress of various projects in Gwadar, including the Friendship Hospital and New Gwadar International Airport (NGIA). Both sides reiterated their resolve to make Gwadar a high-quality port and a hub for regional trade and connectivity.
Acknowledging industrialisation as highly conducive to long-term sustainable economic growth and development, they also agreed to work together in the guidance of the Framework Agreement on Industrial Cooperation to actively advance industrial cooperation.
Both sides reiterated that CPEC is an open and inclusive platform for win-win cooperation and invited third parties to maximize benefits from CPEC. The Pakistani side expressed gratitude to the Chinese side for its economic and financial support and its generous assistance package for post-flood reconstruction and rehabilitation.
The two sides reiterated their firm resolve to counter terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Acknowledging the endeavours and sacrifices made by Pakistan in the fight against terrorism and extremism, the Chinese side appreciated the measures taken by Pakistan to ensure enhanced security of Chinese projects, personnel, and institutions in Pakistan, as well as the steps taken to apprehend and bring to justice the perpetrators targeting Chinese nationals in Dasu, Karachi and other attacks.
The two sides agreed to further build on the cooperation in security and counter-terrorism domains. Reviewing their cooperation on regional and international issues at multilateral forums such as the United Nations and Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), the two sides agreed to further deepen their coordination and cooperation to safeguard mutual interests.
The two sides underscored the need for the international community to provide continued assistance and support to Afghanistan, including through unfreezing of Afghanistan's overseas financial assets. The two sides agreed to continue their humanitarian and economic assistance for the Afghan people and enhance development cooperation in Afghanistan, including through the extension of CPEC to Afghanistan.

8,SCBA president faces rebellion,"Executive body passes resolution against Zuberi, suspended secy for challenging PBC move in SC","Most members of the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), belonging to the Independent Group, have raised objections over the filing of a petition in Supreme Court by their president and suspended secretary against the Pakistan Bar Council's (PBC) decision to remove two of the association's officials from their posts.
They have urged the top court to dismiss the petition, which has been fixed for hearing on May 9.
They have revolted against their own president, Abid Zuberi, and passed a resolution against his move to file a petition in the SC against the PBC order to remove the association’s secretary and additional secretary from their posts.
The resolution was passed during a meeting of the SCBA Executive Committee.
Ten members of the association’s executive body revolted against Zuberi and declared the PBC’s decision to oust SCBA Secretary Muqtedir Akhtar Shabbir and Additional Secretary Shakeel-ur-Rehman from their posts over charges of  ‘misconduct' as a correct one.
The resolution read: “That it has come to our notice that the President SCBA [Abid Zuberi] along with [the] suspended secretary and the suspended additional secretary on behalf of [the] SCBA have filed a Constitution Petition bearing No.13/2023 before the Honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan against the lawful orders passed by the learned Executive Committee of the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC).”
It added that while refuting the baseless contents levelled against the  Executive Committee of PBC in the petition, the majority members of the association unanimously stated that the majority of the SCBA Executive Committee was never taken on board before the petition was filed.
“That neither the president nor the suspended secretary approached or contacted us personally or by way of calling [a] meeting in order to take approval for filing [the] petition,” it continued.
The resolution further read that the majority members unanimously disapproved the filing of the petition before the apex court as well as never supported any proceedings against the PBC which was the regulatory [body] of all the bar associations of the country including the SCBA.
“That we the majority members unanimously resolve that the contentions made in the instant petition [are] not only ultra-vires to the Constitution but also contrary to Legal Practitioner and Bar Council Act, 1973 and Pakistan Legal Practitioners and Bar Council Rules, 1976,” it stated.
“That in terms of Rule (15), (16), (18) & (22) of SCBA Rules 1989 restrains the president or the secretary [from making] any unilateral decision[s] without the approval of the Executive Committee,” it noted.
The resolution concluded that the SCBA majority members call upon the SC that the matter was not maintainable before this forum, and as such, the proceedings be dismissed in light of the judgment and already settled law by the top court in case number PLD 2007 262.
On Friday, the SC refused to suspend the PBC's order on the de-seating of the SCBA secretary and additional secretary on account of ‘misconduct’.
The court, maintaining status quo on the SCBA’s petition against the PBC order, adjourned the hearing till May 9.
On Thursday, SCBA President  Zuberi and suspended secretary Shabbir had filed a petition in the top court, pleading against the show-cause notices issued by the PBC to the association’s two officials.

9,Ex-CJ Nisar conspired against Nawaz: PM,Shehbaz joins world leaders to witness Charles coronation,"Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday said former prime minister Nawaz Sharif was disqualified on the basis of false and baseless allegations and Imran Niazi was imposed on the country in 2018 through a conspiracy.
Talking to the media, he said an incompetent person severely damaged the economy and the country and Pakistan was put in danger while removing Nawaz Sharif from the political scene.
He said former chief justice of Pakistan Saqib Nisar led a campaign to get Nawaz Sharif disqualified on the basis of false and baseless allegations.
“Saqib Nisar used the power of suo moto not in the public interest but to make Imran Niazi successful,” he said, adding the former chief justice was working not as chief justice of Pakistan but as an agent of Imran Niazi and his sole aim was to defeat Nawaz Sharif and secure win for Imran.
The prime minister said the audio leaks had unmasked all the characters who were part of the conspiracy. After surfacing of the audio leak of Saqib Nisar, there was no doubt that there was a conspiracy and collusion to bring Imran Niazi to power by any means.
He said the National Assembly had taken up the issue of the audio leak for a probe against Saqib Nisar and his son. The prime minister said elections of the National Assembly and provincial assemblies should be held on the same day according to the Constitution. “It is not possible to hold elections in the provinces on different dates as it will affect electoral results.”
“Parliament’s right to legislate cannot be taken away as it was the constitutional and legal right of the legislative body,” he added.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday joined a galaxy of foreign royals, officials and heads of state and governments, at the coronation of King Charles III -- a symbolic ceremony combining religious service and royal pageantry.
The prime minister arrived the Westminster Abbey along with other foreign dignitaries to witness the coronation of 74-year-old King, who was crowned along with Camilla, the Queen Consort. King Charles III, became the 40th reigning monarch crowned there since 1066.
