0,Bilawal shows his mettle in hostile India,FM eloquently articulate Pakistan’s viewpoint on various thorny issues between the two arch-foes,"Pakistan has legions of aspiring political leaders, but a few of them meet the requirements of an ideal statesperson. Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, who has accomplished all that Pakistan wanted to from his Goa visit, has exhibited all an ideal statesman needs to be armed with to defend his beleaguered country’s interests around the world in tumultuous times like these.
The scion of the Bhutto family showed incredible composure, maturity, statesmanship, dignity, command on language, and sound knowledge of contemporary issues in his interactions with an increasingly hostile and toxic Indian media that survives and thrives on Pakistan-bashing.
Not only did Bilawal eloquently articulate Pakistan’s viewpoint on various thorny issues between the two arch-foes, but also effectively blunted criticism of Pakistan on the issues of terrorism and religious intolerance by aggressive Indian television anchors with logic.
Instead, he put them on the backfoot by holding up mirror to them, especially on the issue of growing religious intolerance in India.

When confronted with accusations of Pakistan being involved in terrorism, the foreign minister reminded the host of India’s own cross-border terrorism in Pakistan, which has been causing havoc for years. He raised the issues of Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav, who was arrested in 2016 from Balochistan and the Samjhota Express blast, which snuffed out 70 lives in 2017.
Bilawal, who is the chairman of Pakistan Peoples Party, however, said that turning issues like terrorism into political point-scoring would not solve the issues at hand and it was time to move beyond emotional rhetoric and political grandstanding to focus on resolving the real issues.
In his official address at the SCO as well as during the interview, Bilawal not only forcefully countered his Indian counterpart’s allegations of cross-border terrorism but urged cooperation among the SCO members instead of weaponising terrorism for diplomatic point-scoring.
The PPP chairman didn’t shy away from calling out the host’s disregard for facts, pointing out that hate drives a conversation to a point where critical thinking is stifled. He stressed that the countries could not resolve issues if they allowed themselves to be driven by emotions.
In a bold move, the foreign minister had proposed Pakistan, India, and other SCO countries working together to address the issues at hand, emphasising that it was time to move towards a brighter and more peaceful future. To quote his words, Bilawal proposed creating “our own history” instead of being hostage to the history.
At a time of heightened tensions between Pakistan and India, Bilawal showed a level of maturity and patience, and calmly countered the long-fed misinformation that has been circulating for years, explaining the reality of the situation with precision and clarity.
At times, the interviewer seemed to be trying to put words in Bilawal’s mouth or trap him in a corner with questions, but he refused to be drawn into a war of words. Instead, he remained focused on key issues, addressing each point in turn and providing thoughtful responses, demonstrating his understanding of the situation.
As the interview progressed, Bilawal conveyed that Pakistan is genuinely committed to finding a way to resolve the ongoing tensions between the two countries but only after India reviews it actions of August 5, 2019, in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir.
He also raised the issue of conducting a plebiscite in Kashmir, saying that generations of Kashmiris have been demanding that one thing as it would make things crystal clear.
During the interview, Bilawal criticised India’s new Kashmir policy, stating that it violated the principles of justice and fairness, international laws, UN resolutions and leaves Pakistan wondering if India would honor its commitments in the future. He called it a violation of everything India stands for, reminding that Pakistan cannot ignore the injustice happening in Kashmir.
The foreign minister also questioned the Indian government’s actions during the Gujarat riots, asking whether the then Indian government was truly saving the lives or was up to something else. “Evil exists everywhere in the world but the question is how do you respond to it,” he said at a point.
Recalling how he himself was a victim of terrorism as a result of his mother’s assassination, he said Benazir Bhutto’s manifestos was based on normalising relations with India, saying India’s actions on August 2019 have complicated the issues.
Bilawal highlighted the importance of peace and dialogue between the two countries and stressed the need to find a mutually beneficial solution to the imminent issues. While refusing to engage in any verbal sparring, he said “our destiny is peace”. 
The interview received widespread attention, with people from all over the world praising the foreign minister’s composure and diplomacy. In a tweet, former diplomat Abdul Basit said that he was impressed by Bilawal’s interview with the Indian journalist. Basit, who served as Pakistan’s high commissioner to India, said that Bilawal was superb on Kashmir.

“Glad he also raised Kulbhushan Jadhav and the Samjhota Express blast. The way Jaishankar reacted in his press conference only reflected his hubris and frustration,” Basit stated. 
Michael Kugelman, the director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center, also tweeted: “There is much criticism of the Pakistan FM’s visit to India for SCO, but he appears to have accomplished what Islamabad sought.”
The leading specialist on Afghanistan, India and Pakistan added that Bilawal participated in the SCO deliberations, held separate sideline meetings with all SCO members except India and multilateral engagement on the side.
Renowned public policy expert, Mosharraf Zaidi tweeted that “Without very much effort -- other than showing up and speaking calmly -- Pakistan’s foreign minister prompted India’s govt and media to show their true colors”.
The positive response from the experts show that it was possible to have difficult conversations without resorting to hostility or aggression; and that’s what Mr. Bhutto did in his visit to India.

1,"Following Constitution is duty, not choice: CJ",Top judge says decisions should be made as per the law and Constitution,"Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial on Sunday noted that if the Constitution mandated that elections should be held within 90 days after the dissolution of an assembly, then the Supreme Court would have no other option but to implement it.
“When it comes to constitutional enforcement we [SC judges] must not blink our eyes. If it says 90 days for holding the polls, it is our duty to say that and not our choice,” the top judge added while speaking at a conference named after the late CJP AR Cornelius held in Lahore on the issues faced by minorities.
The CJP's remarks come at a time when discussions among political parties are under way on the issue of simultaneous elections across the country, following an order by the top court to hold the elections in Punjab on May 14.
However, the government has repeatedly shown its reluctance to hold the polls. Instead, it has been urging to hold them later in the year.
Chief Justice Bandial remarked that the court had been informed that negotiations between political parties were under way for holding same-day elections across the country.
However, he added that the SC judges had nothing to do with this matter. The CJP said that political parties realised that it was their duty to uphold the Constitution.
“We [SC judges] are there to support them, otherwise our decision is there,” he continued, referring to the top court’s April 4 verdict to hold the polls in Punjab on May 14.

Noting that decisions should be made as per the law and Constitution, Justice Bandial remarked that those judgments carried moral authority.
The top judge maintained that the minorities in the country enjoyed complete freedom and the Constitution guaranteed their rights as well as protection.
He recalled that Justice Cornelius, the fourth CJP of the country and the first Christian one as well, had opposed the governor-general's dissolution of the constituent assembly in 1954.
Justice Bandial further pointed out that in 1964, two provinces had banned the Jamaat-e-Islami. However, he added that this ban was lifted in its founding chief Abul Ala Maududi’s case.
The CJP observed that the growing extremism in the country had claimed countless lives over three decades. He noted that the courts could not pass executive orders.
“Every citizen of Pakistan has fundamental rights and the protection of the Constitution is one of our prime duties,” he continued. Justice Bandial maintained that the SC had the authority to decide on basic human rights.
He noted that Justice Cornelius had observed that executive officers could not decide on fundamental rights. The top judge maintained that the decision of the courts had moral authority. “If a court decision is not challenged, it becomes final,” he added.
Chief Justice Bandial observed that they had gathered to pay tribute to their senior, Justice Cornelius. “Justice Cornelius was the epitome of justice. Apart from law, he excelled in many other fields,” he added.
The CJP noted that Justice Cornelius had studied from the highest institutions of the world. “He [Justice Cornelius] could have been appointed to the civil service but chose the field of law and justice,” the top judge pointed out.
The CJP further observed that Justice Cornelius had given 17 years to the SC. “He [Justice Cornelius] was a good jurist and led a simple life. So his life is an example for judges,” the CJP added.
Speaking on the occasion, former CJP Tassaduq Hussain Jillani noted that he was honoured to be present at the conference. He observed that the country's system should be run on the basis of democratic values and principles of equality.

The former top judge pointed out that the low literacy rate in the country had promoted religious extremism. Justice (retd) Jillani remarked that the protection of fundamental human rights was the primary responsibility of the judiciary.
He added that the judiciary had to play its role in providing awareness to the people about the Constitution. He observed that the implementation of human rights was the State's first priority. He continued that the implementation of court orders was the top priority of State institutions.
Last week, the SC distanced itself from the negotiations between the government and PTI over holding the elections for the national and all provincial assemblies on one date, observing that they were entirely their own effort without any direction or order by it.
However, a three-judge bench of the top court, comprising Chief Justice of Pakistan Bandial, Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Munib Akhtar, while hearing a constitutional petition filed by a citizen, who sought elections for all assemblies on one date, appreciated the initiative taken by the political parties.
“The court appreciates the efforts of all parties to try to end the current political impasse and in particular their voluntary agreement to enter into negotiations to choose a single date for holding general elections to the National Assembly and the four provincial assemblies,” the SC order issued on April 27 read.
The court also made it clear in the order that its April 4 verdict – that the elections in Punjab would be held on May 14 – would remain unchanged.
