The victim Sahibzadi’s daughter, Shazia married a man named Rizwan around two-and-a-half months ago without her father’s consent. The color of the henna had not yet faded when she got angry and went to her parents’ house.

DPO Vihari Isa Khan also reached the spot. The victims’ bodies were handed over to the heirs after a postmortem.
This is not the first instance of a man murdering his in-laws. In February of this year in Lahore, a man reportedly frustrated over his failure to reconcile with his estranged wife allegedly committed suicide after shooting his mother-in-law, sister-in-law and brother-in-law dead in Shahdara Town.
His wife, somehow, found an opportunity to escape and thus she survived the fury of her estranged husband.
Police said Waqas’s wife had gone to live at her parent’s house in Ittehad Park after having a domestic with her husband. SP City Raza Tanveer said that Waqas had gone to her parents’ house to persuade her to return home.
However, as Waqas tried to persuade his wife, they entered into an argument which infuriated Waqas who allegedly opened fire on his mother-in-law, brother-in-law and sister-in-law, killing them on the spot. He then shot himself dead as well.
The deceased were identified as Shughufta Bibi, Neha and Nauman. Neha was also pregnant at the time of her death. Police moved the bodies to a morgue for an autopsy and were investigating the matter further.
Separately in Pakpattan in March of this year, a man reportedly shot seven members of his family dead, including his mother and two brothers, over a property dispute. Local police told The Express Tribune that the suspect, Sarwar had murdered his mother, two brothers, two nephews, a niece and a sister-in-law. Another niece of the suspect was severely injured in the attack.
The suspected murderer fled the scene after the incident. Multiple contingents of police and Rescue 1122 arrived at the scene along with the crime scene department after the incident was reported.

7,JIT to probe vandalism,Over 100 more arrested across Punjab over May 9 mayhem,"The provincial caretaker government has decided to constitute a Joint Investigation Team (JIT) to probe into the recent incidents of setting ablaze the Jinnah House and vandalising military and civil installations. 
The decision was taken in a meeting held at the Punjab Safe Cities Authority (PSCA) head office to review the law and order situation. 
As per an official announcement, the JIT will submit a comprehensive report to the government after investigating the incidents. 
According to police sources, the number of people arrested across the province in connection with the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s (PTI) protests after the arrest for former prime minister Imran Khan rose to 3,174. At least 104 people were arrested on Saturday, including 41 in the provincial capital.
Caretaker Chief Minister Mohsin Naqvi ordered the authorities to expedite a crackdown in order to bring all miscreants into the stern grip of the law. He called for geo-fencing of all places that had been attacked, adding that all cases against the miscreants would be tried in Anti-Terrorism Courts (ATCs). The public prosecution department was instructed to ensure speedy trial of all the cases. 
However, the caretaker CM stressed that any innocent person should not be apprehended while ensuring not to leave off the hook any violator of the law. He underscored that every miscreant would be brought to the courts along with witnesses and concrete proof. 
He announced that the educational institutions would be reopened on Monday as the situation was improving. Inspector General of Police Dr Usman Anwar gave a briefing about the law and order situation in the province and a crackdown against miscreant elements.

All divisional commissioners and regional police officers attended the meeting through video link.
Section 144
In another development, Punjab Governor Muhammad Balighur Rahman promulgated on Saturday the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Ordinance 2023 to make it easier to enforce Section 144 in emergency situations.
Official sources said the imposition of restrictions through Section 144 under the Criminal Procedure Code had caused legal complications for the government as it was not possible practically to refer every case to the cabinet immediately in an emergency situation. 
The promulgation of the ordinance has expedited the enforcement of restrictions under Section 144 in emergency situations, the sources added. 
Under the amendment, the deputy commissioner or any other officer especially empowered by the Punjab government would be authorised to issue orders under Section 144 of CrPC in urgent cases.
Governor Balighur Rehman also promulgated the Punjab Agricultural Marketing Regulatory Authority (Amendment) Ordinance 2023, allowing in the light of directives of the Election Commission the termination of services of persons appointed on political grounds to the boards of the authority and market companies.
