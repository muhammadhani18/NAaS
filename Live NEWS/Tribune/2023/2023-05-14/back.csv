7,Digital emissaries: State relies on proxies amid social media blackout,"PM, ICT police used social media while the public couldn’t access it","Surprising as it may seem, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the capital’s police turned to proxies as their digital emissaries – Virtual Private Network (VPN) and people sitting abroad – when the government ordered a social media blackout to quell resistance as well as nationwide protests following Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan’s arrest.
When Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube were inaccessible in the country on Saturday after being temporarily restored late on Friday, the prime minister and the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) police sneakily tweeted and shared information on social media sites through proxies.
The practice of speaking through proxies in the midst of a social media blackout caused by a government-ordered suspension of mobile broadband services in the country led experts to question how the premier and the police accessed Twitter, etc., or if they subverted the ban themselves through VPN use when people had no or limited access to the internet.
“I think what this Twitter ban exposes is the complete lack of authority the current government has over the issue,” a lawyer and political analyst, Abdul Moiz Jaferii said. “First they made internet-reliant businesses and employees suffer for two days, and now they are all busy subverting the ban themselves through VPN use.”
The expert said that Pakistan first banned all VPNs and later decided to allow only those VPNs to call themselves legal that registered themselves with the PTA. “It is hence highly likely that all these government individuals are themselves breaking the law when they access social media,” Jaferii said before incorporating that “the same media they have tried to put out of the reach of the people they are afraid of letting vote”.
Nighat Dad, a lawyer and the executive director of the Digital Rights Foundation (DRF), said that there is an irony in this entire internet shutdown episode where 3G and 4G services were not available, but people saw government officials tweeting and using social media platforms when the social media was not accessible to masses.
“The prime minister was tweeting when social media was not accessible,” the renowned digital rights expert wondered. “Does this mean that the prime minister was also using VPN or did he have some access available to use social media apps?”
Also, Dad said, it shows how these platforms are important for communication because all these government officials, including the prime minister, law enforcement agencies and Islamabad police, were constantly live tweeting about the situation arising out of protests and Imran’s court appearances.
Dad questioned the use of police’s tweets about alerts, traffic updates and protest situation when the citizens were denied access to social media platforms. “If citizens do not have access to social media or when they are not meant to have access, the question is who they [PM and police] are sending this information to?” she asked.
During the shutdown, the police, however, counted on human proxies. A spokesperson for ICT police, Taqi Jawad, told The Express Tribune that the police did not use VPN during the internet shutdown.
Revealing the secret, the spokesperson said that a superintendent of police, who is abroad on training, shared all the police updates on Twitter and other social media platforms.
PTA Spokesperson Malahat Obaid shared that the registrations of VPNs under the applicable regularity framework are still in the field. However, the spokesperson said, considering some technical limitations, banks, foreign missions, and IT-enabled services are using VPNs for their work and blocking of VPNs will badly affect the operational issues.
Further, she said, PTA has also been directed by the Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication not to block any site/platform without its permission. However, she added, through public notices all are asked to register their VPNs through the online facility.
Meanwhile, no comments were received till the filing of the story when the information minister was asked if it was justified for a PM or government official to first shut down the internet and social media apps and then use VPN services to access Twitter, etc.
The government’s decision to control the flow of information and to have an upper hand came after ex-PM Imran’s supporters engaged the government and law enforcers on the streets as well as on social media.
Though the courts have granted relief to Imran and he has gone back to Lahore, the government has not yet lifted the ban on social media sites. However, despite the restrictions, people have also found a way to communicate and stay informed through proxies – just like PM and the police.

8,Bilawal takes a dig at PTI chairman,Says PPP has faced ‘terrorists bigger than Imran Khan’,"PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Saturday said his party had faced terrorists and in comparison, PTI Chairman Imran Khan was almost nothing.
“The politics of one person [Imran] has created wedges among the judiciary, media and people,” he added while addressing a ceremony organised to celebrate the PPP’s victory in the local government elections in the Karachi Division.
Maintaining that Imran had resorted to political terrorism, Bilawal said the PPP was ready for elections and his party would defeat its rivals with the power of its votes.
The PPP chairman said similar to what the PPP had done in Karachi, his party would defeat political terrorists across the country with the strength of its ballots.
Taking a jibe at the higher judiciary for what the ruling coalition believes to be facilitating the PTI chief, Bilawal said the judges had turned the law into a joke.
“The judiciary shouldn’t turn into [Imran’s] Tiger Force,” he çontinued.
The PPP chairman termed the fresh local government elections as “historic”.
He added that the people of the province by placing their confidence in the slogan of “Sindh for all” had created history.
Bilawal noted that from Kashmore to Karachi, the “jiyalas” of the PPP would be in power.
The PPP chairman expressed his gratitude to the people of Sindh for his party’s victory throughout the province, including Karachi.
He pointed out that earlier, Karachi was dominated by politics of division.
He added that the die-hard activists of the PPP had buried the politics of hatred and division in Karachi.
“Sindh was one and always remain so,” he continued.
Bilawal pledged to end the politics of hatred and division across the country.
“We were the binding chains between the provinces earlier and continue to remain so,” he added.
The PPP chairman said the local government elections in Karachi were only a sign of developments to come.
He added that Karachi had ousted the PTI from the city in the local government elections and pretty soon, the whole country would be rid of these political terrorists.
The PPP chairman paid tributes to the martyrs, whose sacrifices had made it possible for the party to achieve so much.
He pointed out that when his grandfather, PPP founder and former premier Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was hanged, the party activists, unlike how the PTI responded to its chairman’s arrest, had only set themselves ablaze instead of destroying public as well as private properties.
He noted that his maternal uncle, Murtaza Bhutto, was murdered in Karachi as well but nobody had taken the law into their hands.
He said his father, PPP Co-Chairperson Asif Ali Zardari, had spent 12 years in prison but no chief justice of Pakistan had taken suo motu notice of that.
He further pointed out that nobody had said “Good to see you” to his grandfather Zulfikar Ali Bhutto when he appeared before courts.
The PPP chairman pointed out that when his mother, former premier Benazir Bhutto was assassinated, the party activists were enraged enough to storm the GHQ and the corps commander’s house but they had stopped themselves from crossing this red line.
Bilawal maintained that the political terrorists were still “favourites” of some and that was why no action had been taken against them despite the mayhem they had caused across the country.

9,Asif questions court relief to Imran,Defence minister says court's impartiality rendered questionable with 'unprecedented relief' extended to PTI chief,"Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif has said that the unprecedented relief given to PTI Chairman Imran Khan has raised questions about impartiality of courts.
Addressing a news conference at his residence on Saturday, he said the judiciary should act according to the Constitution and law, instead of personal liking and disliking.
He said facilitation provided to Imran Khan by courts was highly questionable. He said when a judge would tell an accused that he was happy to see him, what justice could be expected from him.
He wondered where were such judges when verdicts were being given against Nawaz Sharif and his family members. APP
