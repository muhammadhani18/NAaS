1,Sigh of relief as Metro Bus Service restored,"Despite PTA’s claim of mobile internet resumption, social media apps remain inaccessible","Citizens breathed a sigh of relief as Metro Bus Service, a bus rapid transit system operating in the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad, was restored after remaining suspended for four days due to violent protests by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) activists following the arrest of party chairman and former premier Imran Khan.
Sources said the restoration work of the 6th Road Metro Station, which was burnt down during the protests, was going on rapidly.
The sources said public transport between the twin cities was also fully restored. In tense situations, opportunistic transporters charged arbitrary fares to citizens, they added.
Soon after PTI Chairman and former premier Imran Khan was arrested on May 9, violent protesters caused severe damage to the metro bus property. Considering the tense situation, it was immediately decided to shift all the buses to Islamabad Metro Bus Depot and stop the service.
The service was suspended after Shamshabad, 6th Road, and Faizabad metro stations were vandalized by the protesters. The protesters also broke glasses and CCTV cameras and damaged the washrooms of the Committee Chowk Station.
The protesters also looted nearly Rs0.5 million from the ticketing booth of the Sixth Road station. The whole station and ticketing booths were destroyed. The suspension of the metro bus service also caused over Rs100 million in losses to the exchequer.
More than 160,000 people travel in metro buses between the twin cities daily. The metro bus facility is a big relief for the working class, labourers, students, public servants and private employees who daily commute in Metro buses.
Muhammad Yasir, who was going to Islamabad from Rawalpindi by Metro Bus Service, said that he works as an assistant administrator in a private company. By paying a daily fare of Rs60, one can avail quality travel facility of the Metro Bus.
“Opportunistic transporters have looted the citizens with both hands as the metro bus service was suspended during the violent protests. 
A single ride from Rawalpindi Sadar to Faizabad Interchange has been charging Rs100. There was no such thing as administration. Transporters charged arbitrary fares from job goers under tense conditions,” he said.
On the other hand, despite the announcement of the restoration of mobile broadband services by the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), users continued to face difficulties in accessing social media platforms. The regulatory authority had suspended mobile broadband and restricted access to social media applications including, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube on May 9 in light of the directives issued by the home ministry following violent protests.
‘All roads open’
All the roads of Rawalpindi city were open for vehicular traffic and the traffic was normal, said City Traffic Officer (CTO) Rawalpindi Taimoor Khan on Saturday.
The CTO said all the containers on the Mall Road had been removed. Traffic was normal on all the roads of the town, including Murree Road and Mall Road, he said.
