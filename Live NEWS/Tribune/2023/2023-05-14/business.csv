“A peaceful march and protest is the right of every political party but PTI’s rioting was witnessed across the country,” he added.
Rehman said that Imran Khan is a ‘fitna’ and he is out to damage the country. “We have directed all the district associations to reach Hakla Interchange with its workers till 10 in the morning and from there they will march on Islamabad,” he observed, adding that around 10,000 volunteers of Ansarul Islam will be deployed for security of the protest.
Workers were asked to take food and clothes with them and be prepared for a prolonged protest because the duration of the sit-in has not been decided.
Maulana Attur Rehman said that PDM parties have been asked to fully participate in the protest.
On the other hand, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) has started preparations for the sit-in outside the Supreme Court on the instruction of the central leadership of the party.

3,Speakers call for protection of migratory birds,Demand complete ban on hunting in Balochistan,"International Migratory Bird Day was observed in Quetta like the rest of the world.
In connection with this day, an awareness seminar was organized by the Ten Billion Tree Tsunami Program and Wildlife Department at a private hotel in Quetta.
Chief Conservator Forest, Niaz Khan Kakar while briefing the participants of the seminar on the movement of migratory birds in Balochistan, said that every year thousands of cranes, talur, falcons and other guest birds come to Pakistan but unfortunately, due to the lack of awareness in our province there is no system to protect them.
The number of these migratory birds is decreasing every year due to excessive hunting, Niaz Khan while addressing the participants of the seminar said.
According to the Forest Department Balochistan, every year 12,000 thousand birds visited the districts of Nushki, Dalbandin and Kharan.
In the past in Zhob, Dana Sar Takht Suleiman range, they used to reach in their thousands from Siberia, but due to the illegal hunting, today this number has deceased to just 1,200, which is really alarming.
Participants in the seminar, Vice Chancellor Lorelai University Zahoor Ahmed Bazai, Secretary Law Saboor Kakar, Secretary Forests and Wildlife, Noor Ahmed Perkani, Sharifuddin Baloch, Dr Rabia Zafar, and other participants of the seminar demanded the government to take steps to stop illegal hunting in Balochistan.
A complete ban should be imposed so that foreign birds can make Balochistan their home.
Because these birds cover a distance of 4,500 km and start their journey in the month of September, and in 15 days reach Pakistan.
These birds winter in various districts of Tajikistan, India, Ahmedpur, Indus River and Balochistan till March.
