0,Businesses call IMF’s conditions ‘unfair’,FPCCI urges govt to consult with stakeholders vis-à-vis federal budget for 2023-24,"The federal government seems to have abandoned its struggle to secure the last tranche of the loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) due to political pressure from opposition leader Imran Khan.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, Vice President of Pakistan Business Forum (PBF), Ahmad Jawad, suggested that the government is instead likely to provide relief to the general public in order to manage political tensions. “After meeting all of the conditions set by the IMF, the government has managed to pull the economy out of crisis mode and can now afford to forego the deal,” he explained.
The government has implemented several new taxes and increased existing ones in accordance with IMF instructions, including the general sales tax, as well as hiking electricity and gas prices. However, Jawad suggested that the government is now considering withdrawing the petroleum levy and may also intervene to appreciate the rupee against the dollar, which could decrease inflation for at least a few months.
“The government’s priority is to present a better budget without imposing any new taxes to appease the public and mitigate the momentum that Khan has created,” he said. China has also expressed interest in helping Pakistan during this difficult time.
“Looking ahead, it is likely that the new government, to be elected soon, will deal with the IMF. The IMF has also expressed interest in working with a new government that has a proper mandate. Despite the challenges facing Pakistan’s economy, there are hopeful signs that progress can be made with the right policies and cooperation from international partners,” said Jawad.
However, the President of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), Irfan Iqbal Sheikh, expressed his concerns that the government and its economic team have not yet started the consultative process with the business community in general, and the FPCCI in particular. With less than a month left to the announcement of the budget, due to be presented on June 9, he invited Finance Minister Ishaq Dar to meet with the leaders of Pakistan’s business, industry and trade community to take stock of their proposals vis-à-vis the federal budget for 2023-24 and also listen to their issues, apprehensions and recommended solutions.
Sheikh explained that the FPCCI wants to present and discuss its proposals on industrial, trade, shipping and transportation; taxation, Small & Medium sized Enterprises, agriculture, IT and ITeS; monetary and fiscal policies with the government. “The budget-making process presents an opportunity for meaningful course correction based on ground realities, regional and global business environments, and national interest,” he said.
The FPCCI chief also expressed his shock that the IMF has raised the external funding requirement from $6 billion to $8 billion, sensing that friendly countries have promised up to $5 billion in funding or roll-overs to Pakistan. He questioned the IMF’s decision to suddenly raise the external funding requirement for the next seven months, despite the fact that the stalled EFF program was valid only until June 2023.
“This is unfair and unethical. The international community must take notice,” he added.
He emphasised that the government’s economic and financial team must now be crystal clear that an IMF program is not going to materialise before the upcoming budget, which is only three weeks away.
“We, at FPCCI, have been observing that the government was making its budget on the basis of a resumed IMF program; but, given the fluid circumstances, it now has to make major adjustments in the budget within the short period three weeks,” he said.
Sheikh maintained that the only solution that can steer Pakistan out of the crisis is through an indigenous solution based on simplification and broadening of the tax base, targeted subsidies to the five export-oriented sectors – making it competitive through regionally competitive energy tariff (RCET) mechanism, encouragement of remittances by bridging the gap between banking channels and open markets, incentivising industrialisation, export substitution, and revival of sick units. He further suggested that all economic policies should be made in consultation with the real stakeholders of the economy, namely the business, industry, and trade community of Pakistan.

1,US Treasury hopeful of solution to debt ceiling,Britain says showdown over US debt posed very serious threat to global economy,"US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Saturday called a showdown over raising the US debt ceiling “more difficult” than in the past but said she remained hopeful a solution could be found to avert a first-ever US default.
Yellen told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of a meeting of Group of Seven finance officials in Japan that she hoped to update the US Congress within the next couple of weeks about when exactly the Treasury would run out of funds to pay the government’s bills.
The US Treasury chief has called repeatedly for Congress to agree to raise the $31.4 trillion cap on federal borrowing to avert the “economic and financial catastrophe” that would ensue if the United States defaulted on its debts.
British Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt told reporters the standoff posed a “very serious” threat to the global economy.
“It would be absolutely devastating if America... was to have its GDP knocked off track by not reaching agreement,” Hunt said on the sidelines of the G7 meetings.
Yellen said her estimate last week that the Treasury may not be able to meet payment obligations as early as June 1 was consistent with Friday’s report from the Congressional Budget Office warning of a “significant risk” of default in the first two weeks of June.
President Joe Biden, a Democrat, insists Congress has a constitutional duty to raise the limit without conditions to fund previously approved spending.
Republicans, who control the House of Representatives, want Biden to agree to sweeping budget cuts to secure their agreement.
Unlike most developed countries, the US sets a ceiling on how much it can borrow. Because the government spends more than it takes in, lawmakers must periodically raise that cap.
“It’s certainly not a positive for relationships and standing in the world and credibility. Maybe this time is more difficult, but I’m hopeful that...we will find a solution.” She said it was a positive sign that “pretty much everyone” at a meeting Biden hosted with congressional leaders on Tuesday agreed it would be unacceptable for the US to default.
Despite the debt ceiling fight, Yellen said she remained convinced that the Biden administration had re-established US leadership in the world and other G7 leaders were grateful they had turned “the dial 180 degrees relative to the Trump administration”.

2,G7 agrees financial system resilient,Japan’s finance minister vows to address regulatory gaps in the banking system,"Finance ministers and central banks from the Group of Seven rich nations agreed the global financial system is resilient but the need for vigilance remains, Japan’s finance minister Shunichi Suzuki said on Saturday.
The officials issued a joint statement vowing to address regulatory gaps in the banking system discovered during recent problems at US and Swiss banks, and said they would continue to work closely with supervisory and regulatory authorities to monitor financial sector developments.
“We reaffirm that our financial system is resilient, supported by the financial regulatory reforms implemented after the 2008 global financial crisis, including considerable increases in the levels of bank capital and liquidity, an international framework for effectively resolving failing institutions, and strengthened cross-border regulatory and supervisory cooperation,” it said.
British finance minister Jeremy Hunt told reporters at a separate event that G7 finance chiefs in Japan had “very frank and open discussions” about the challenges they face, including banking regulation.
He said Britain believed the regulatory structures worked as intended and prevented much worse problems, but there were clearly lessons to be learned, including how digital transfers had accelerated the rapid pace of deposit withdrawals.

3,Pakistan to start boiled meat export to China,Exports can play key role in achieving $10b target,"Pakistan is gearing up to export boiled meat to the Chinese market, according to Abdul Qadir, Commercial Councilor at the Pakistan Embassy in Beijing. The agreement to import meat from Pakistan was made during Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s visit to China in November last year. Both countries are in the process of exchanging documents, and the agreement is expected to be implemented in a month.
Before export, the meat will be boiled to 70 degrees centigrade to ensure it is free of foot and mouth disease (FMD). “Three processing plants, namely Fauji, Tata and Green, set up in Karachi have already been approved by the concerned authorities of China. These plants have good reputation and capacity,” said Qadir.
The demand for meat in the Chinese market is vast, with one Chinese company alone planning to import 50,000 tonnes of meat. However, the commercial councilor stressed the need to avoid a shortage of beef or high prices in Pakistan due to the increased demand from China. To meet the growing demand for meat in the Chinese market, Pakistan needs to work on the value chain and adopt corporate farming to enhance the quality of meat and increase exports.
Currently, Pakistan exports about 66,000 tonnes of meat annually, and the export of boiled meat could play a significant role in achieving Pakistan’s export target of $10 billion to China in the future. The livestock population in Pakistan is for dual purposes, dairy and meat, unlike competing livestock-exporting economies, which have developed different breeds for dairy and meat production.
Pakistan’s fruits, vegetables, and meat meet international export standards, and the country’s exports to China are gradually improving. With the potential for exporting meat to China, Pakistan needs to utilise modern techniques, improve processing facilities, and invest in technology to grab this opportunity.

4,Stocks dive over growing political turmoil,"KSE-100 index dips 754 points, or 1.8%, and settles at 41,488","Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) lost ground in a tumultuous week as delay in resumption of International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan programme, worsening political scenario and ex-prime minister Imran Khan’s arrest aided the downward spiral.
The benchmark KSE-100 index remained in the red for most of the week and closed on a negative note. On Monday, the week commenced with a dip when bears took control of the market over growing political turbulence and persistent delay in reviving the IMF programme, which dragged the index below the 42,000 mark.
The following session brought no respite as political instability took its toll on the stock market, rattled by the arrest of former prime minister and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan in Al-Qadir Trust case.
The stock sell-off persisted on Wednesday as well in the backdrop of political noise coupled with protests by PTI supporters in different cities. After three bearish sessions, investor confidence on Thursday got a boost from optimistic approach towards the IMF with expectation of release of the delayed loan tranche.
The bullish journey continued on Friday as well as investors awaited the Islamabad High Court (IHC)’s verdict in the Al-Qadir Trust case. Furthermore, the rupee’s smart recovery boosted investor confidence. The KSE-100 index lost 754 points, or 1.8% week-on-week (WoW), and settled at 41,488.
JS Global analyst Muhammad Waqas Ghani, in his report, noted that in a turnabout from the previous trend, the market closed negative in the outgoing week, losing 754 points over growing political temperature and delay in completion of IMF’s ninth review. “Investors chose to stay on sidelines as a result of former premier’s arrest and the subsequent nationwide violent protests,” he said.
Exploration and production (E&P) sector (down 6% WoW) and tech sector (down 3.5% WoW) were the key underperformers.
On the economic front, data showed a contraction in budget deficit to 1.7% of GDP during 3QFY23. In absolute terms, the deficit expanded 17% YoY.
Likewise, remittances’ data for 10MFY23 showed a 13% YoY decline. Pakistani rupee faced a steep devaluation on Wednesday and Thursday and lost 5% (Rs14), slumping to an all-time low of Rs298.93 to a dollar.
The currency then recovered to settle at 285.08 on Friday over expectations that the political climate would improve in the wake of Supreme Court’s ruling declaring Imran Khan’s detention as illegal.
SBP’s foreign currency reserves remained largely stable, declining by just $74 million to $4.4 billion, providing import cover of around one month, the JS analyst added.
Arif Habib Limited, in its report, said that the stock market commenced trading on a negative note on Monday as Fitch Ratings revealed that Pakistan was facing a substantial debt payment of $3.7 billion in the May-June period.
Additionally, Pakistan was not on the agenda of IMF meetings, which dampened hopes for the resumption of loan programme. Furthermore, the arrest of ex-PM Imran Khan sparked protests across the country, leading to political instability. However, as the week progressed, the political situation relatively eased.
In terms of sectors, positive contribution to the bourse came from tobacco (2.2 points) and modaraba (0.3 point).
Negative contribution came from oil and gas exploration companies (220 points), commercial banks (212 points), technology and communication (164 points), fertiliser (137 points) and cement (83 points).
In terms of stocks, positive contributors were Habib Metropolitan Bank (17 points), GlaxoSmithKline (6 points), Murree Brewery (4.6 points), Fauji Fertiliser Company (2.5 points) and Indus Motor (2.3 points). Negative contribution came from Systems Limited (110 points), Habib Bank (105 points), Oil and Gas Development Company (103 points), Pakistan Petroleum (76 points) and United Bank (69 points).
Foreigners turned net sellers who sold stocks of $1.1 million against net buying of $6.1 million last week, AHL added.

5,Debt servicing may consume Rs7.6tr,90% more than this fiscal year’s original budget set aside for interest payments,"Pakistan’s debt servicing cost may cross well over Rs7.6 trillion in the next fiscal year, which is roughly 15% more than the projected net income of the federal government but is still lower than the estimates made by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
Sources in the Ministry of Finance told The Express Tribune that based on the fact that the federal government debt stood at Rs54.4 trillion at the end of March, interest payments in the next fiscal year may cross well over Rs7.6 trillion. However, a few officials have suggested showing the cost at around Rs6.9 trillion in the budget books aimed at having some additional fiscal space for spending in an election year.
The estimated Rs7.6 trillion debt servicing cost is 90% more than this fiscal year’s original budget set aside for interest payments and one-third higher than the revised estimates. It seems that taxes will be collected to just pay the cost of interest to domestic and foreign banks.
There were also differences of opinion between the Ministry of Finance and the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) on next year’s tax target. Against the finance ministry’s proposed figure of Rs9.2 trillion, the FBR on Saturday suggested the government fix the target to around Rs8.6 trillion – only 19% higher than this year’s now expected collection.
For the next fiscal year, the government sees average inflation remaining at around 21% – any target below this rate will not bode well for the performance of the FBR.
Ballooned by record high inflation, the size of Pakistan’s economy is projected to increase to Rs106 trillion in FY2023-24, according to some initial estimates from the Ministry of Finance. These numbers are provisional and are subject to any changes made before the presentation of the budget in the National Assembly.
The estimates of Rs7.6 trillion debt servicing cost have been worked out on the basis of the debt stock of the country and to finance an under-consideration federal budget deficit of Rs6.8 trillion. Initial estimates show that even on the basis of the Rs9.2 trillion tax targets, the federal budget deficit could be in the range of 6.4% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) during FY2023-24, according to the sources.
Such a high cost of debt servicing leaves nothing in the kitty and any new government will literally be at the mercy of domestic and foreign lenders to run the country in the next fiscal year.
Nearly two-third of the domestic debt is maturing next year and will be financed at new interest rates. The projected interest payments amount is Rs3.6 trillion or 90% more than the original budget for the current fiscal year.
However, after an increase in the interest rates to 21%, the finance ministry later on revised the cost estimates to Rs5.2 trillion for this fiscal year.
Sources say that the IMF has estimated the interest cost to be around Rs8.2 trillion – Rs600 billion higher than the government’s estimates. This suggests that the IMF sees a further hike in interest rates and devaluation of the currency.
Some officials in the Ministry of Finance are advising to show only Rs6.8 trillion to Rs6.9 trillion in debt servicing costs aimed at having some fiscal space for spending ahead of general elections. Any such reflection in the budget will make the whole process unrealistic and the actual debt servicing cost and the overall budget deficit will be understated.
For the next fiscal year, the finance ministry sees the federal budget deficit – the gap between its income and expenditure – at 6.4% of the GDP or nearly Rs6.8 trillion. Any federal budget deficit target that is above 3.5% of the GDP is considered fiscally unsustainable.
The sources added that for the next fiscal year, the government expects to set the FBR’s tax target at Rs9.2 trillion. The non-tax collection target could be around Rs2.5 trillion. The government hopes to get Rs900 billion in profit from the State Bank of Pakistan and another Rs780 billion on account of petroleum development levy.
After paying for the share of the provinces in the federal taxes, the net federal income is estimated at around Rs6.6 trillion – at least Rs1 trillion less than the requirements of debt servicing.
The government will then meet all the requirements by taking new loans; these expenses will include requirements of defence, estimated over Rs2.5 trillion including the Rs1.7 trillion stated defence budget, running of the civil government, the development budget and subsidies.
The federal budget deficit widened by over Rs3.5 trillion in the first nine months of the current fiscal year on the back of a massive surge in spending on debt servicing and defence – both of which consumed two-thirds of the total expenditure, the Ministry of Finance reported last Friday. The federal government paid Rs3.6 trillion in debt servicing in nine months.

6,Adani Group firms to raise $2.57b,Adani Transmission says its board approved a plan to raise up to 85b rupees ($1.0 billion) from the stock market,"Two Adani group companies including the Indian conglomerate’s flagship firm announced plans on Saturday to raise up to $2.57 billion from the market, months after a short-seller report battered investor confidence and drove share prices down.
India’s Adani Transmission said its board approved a plan to raise up to 85 billion rupees ($1.0 billion) from the stock market. Adani Enterprise said in a filing to exchanges that its board had approved plans to raise up to INR125 billion ($1.53 billion) through similar modes.
The equity fundraising is Indian billionaire Gautam Adani’s first real test of broad investor appetite since he called off a record $2.5 billion share sale in January following allegations by US-based Hindenburg Group of stock market manipulation and use of tax havens.

7,Banks borrow more from SBP as deposits fall,Bank borrowing on rise since IMF barred govt from taking loans directly from SBP,"Commercial bank borrowing from the central bank has grown by 3% after deposits dipped 1% in April, compared to March, as the cash-strapped government continued to acquire large amounts of debt from domestic banks.
Citing State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) data, JS Global research house reported that bank borrowing from the central bank rose by 3%, or Rs317 billion, to Rs9.65 trillion in April compared to a month earlier. At the same time, deposits at commercial banks dropped 1% month-on-month, or Rs133 billion, to Rs23.43 trillion in April 2023.
Domestic bank borrowing from the SBP has been on the rise since the International Monetary Fund (IMF) barred the government from taking loans directly from the central bank in mid-2019 and asked it to borrow from commercial banks for bridging its budget deficit.
Since then commercial banks have been acquiring loans from the central bank and meeting the government’s financing requirement. The central bank provides funds at lower rates compared to the returns at which banks lend money to the government. There is usually a 1-3% difference between the two rates.
Therefore, the borrowing does not negatively impact banks instead it positively contributes to their rising incomes.
The central bank injects funds into commercial banks through open market operations (OMOs) while banks extend financing to the government by buying its sovereign debt securities including treasury bills (T-bills) and Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs).
On a year-on-year basis, commercial bank borrowing from the SBP spiked 49% to Rs9.65 trillion in April compared to the same month of last year, according to the central bank data.
On the other hand, the month-on-month dip in bank deposits can be linked with a six-decade high inflation of 36.4% in April. Owing to the soaring inflation, spending by the government, private sector and households spiked while their monthly incomes remained stagnant. Meanwhile, the government’s revenue receipts remained lower than its expenditures. It comes as a large number of factories have been shut completely or partially while around five million people have lost their job in recent months.
A majority of them must be meeting their expenses through spending the savings parked in banks. Talking to The Express Tribune, Topline Securities Director Research Yousuf M Farooq said the bigger issue behind bank financing numbers “is that the government has crowded out the private sector.”
He said that rulers were making hefty borrowing from commercial banks amid lower-than-required tax revenue collection. It was leaving a very little room for extending credit to the private sector, which “is not a good sign and is hurting the economy at large”.
“Availability of financing for the private sector will definitely generate economic activities and create job opportunities,” he remarked.
Farooq noted that government debt had piled up with domestic debt doubling in the past five years to Rs38 trillion as on December 31, 2022.
Consequently, mark-up payment for the mounting public debt has jumped up and most of the government borrowing is being utilised on this account.
KASB Securities Head of Research Yousuf Rahman said the other day “banks were pulling financing out of the economy and giving it to the government.”
The government, on the other hand, was mostly utilising the funds for non-productive purposes including mark-up payment, he pointed out. Data suggested that government borrowing from commercial banks increased by 29% to Rs19.69 trillion in April compared to the same month of last year.
However, bank financing for the private sector rose just 14% year-on-year to Rs12.11 trillion in April. At the same time, bank deposits expanded by 17% to Rs23.43 trillion. Similarly, bank investment (lending to the government) to deposit ratio (IDR) jumped 8.2 percentage points to 84% in April. Contrary to that, banks’ advance (lending to the private sector) to deposit ratio (ADR) dropped 1.4 percentage points to 52% in the month under review.

8,LCCI urges national unity under a Charter of Economy,Call for unity emphasises the need for a cohesive and concerted effort to address the economic challenges at hand.,"Four days of intense political unrest in Pakistan have left the nation reeling from staggering economic losses amounting to billions of rupees, with devastating loss of life and property. In response, the Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) has issued a compelling plea to all political parties to prioritise the revival of the national economy by setting aside their differences and uniting under a comprehensive Charter of Economy.
According to economic analysts, the ongoing political unrest has resulted in an estimated loss of over Rs10 billion to the country’s economy, dealing a severe blow to multiple sectors, including manufacturing, tourism, and services.
LCCI President Kashif Anwar’s urgent call for unity emphasises the need for a cohesive and concerted effort to address the economic challenges at hand.
The proposed Charter of Economy aims to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) and promote local investment as key drivers of economic recovery. The Charter will encompass a range of strategic measures, including policies to enhance the ease of doing business, establish investor-friendly regulations, develop robust infrastructure, and foster a conducive environment for domestic and international investors.
The LCCI president’s plea for political parties to unite under the Charter of Economy is based on the understanding that the stability and prosperity of the nation depend on collective action and shared responsibility. By putting aside partisan interests and focusing on the well-being of the economy, it is hoped that political leaders will pave the way for a brighter future, ensuring stability, progress, and prosperity for all citizens.

9,KPT being run on ad hoc basis since Dec 2020,Govt has appointed fourth KPT chairman on deputation,"The government has continued to run the affairs of Karachi Port Trust (KPT) on an ad hoc basis as it has now appointed its fourth chairman on deputation.
Earlier, the KPT chairman was removed by the previous Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government over alleged differences with the maritime affairs minister but court suspended the notification of his removal.
After the tenure of regular KPT chairman ended on December 8, 2020, the additional charge of KPT chairman was given to Nadir Mumtaz Warraich (BS-22 officer) for three months or till the appointment of a new chairman, whichever was earlier.
Since then, KPT has continued to run on an ad hoc basis.
When asked for comment, KPT said only the maritime affairs ministry would be able to give comment as the matter pertained to the ministry.
Secretary maritime affairs ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
Recently, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) led coalition government has approved the appointment of Syed Sayadian Raza Zaidi, (IRS) (BPS-21), as KPT chairman on deputation.
The Maritime Affairs Division, in a recent meeting of the cabinet, briefed participants that KPT was managed in accordance with the provisions of KPT Act 1886.
As per Section 6(1), read with Section 11 of the Act, the federal government shall appoint a person to be chairman of KPT board who shall hold office for such period as the federal government may from time to time decide.
In its decision in Al Mustafa Impex case, the Supreme Court defined the federal government as the federal cabinet, therefore, the approval of the cabinet was required.
In light of the Establishment Division’s notification issued on December 21, 2022, the federal cabinet on January 19, 2023 approved the grant of additional charge of KPT chairman to Syed Muhammad Tariq Huda, BPS-21, Additional Secretary (In charge) Maritime Affairs, for a period of three months.
The tenure of Huda ended on March 20, 2023. On expiry, KPT General Manager (Operations) Rear Admiral Muhammad Zubair Shafique was assigned the task of looking after the work of KPT chairman with effect from March 31, 2023 in addition to his own duties and till the appointment of a new chairman.
As per the instructions issued by the Cabinet Division on March 16, 2018, no trustee/ director of board of directors/ trustees could be appointed except with the approval of prime minister.
Accordingly, the PM approved the placement of matter before the federal cabinet for approval under Section 60, read with Section 11, of the KPT Act 1886.
The Maritime Affairs Division proposed that Syed Sayadian Raza Zaidi, an officer of IRS (BPS-21) presently posted as Member Headquarters, Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Karachi, may be appointed KPT chairman on deputation on the standard terms and conditions.
The cabinet considered a summary titled “Appointment of Syed Sayadian Raza Zaidi, (IRS) (BPS-21), as Chairman, Karachi Port Trust, Karachi on deputation basis”, submitted by the Maritime Affairs Division, and approved the proposal.
