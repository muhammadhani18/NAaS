0,ATM2023: PIA missing in action,Govt participates in 4-day Asian Travel Market for third time in 30 years,"Swarming with energy and diversity, traders, exhibitors, visitors, students and tourists from all over the world made their way through traffic, to attend the 30th edition of the 4-day Asian Travel Market (ATM) in Dubai from May 1 to May 4, 2023.
With a tiny but mighty presence, the humble Pakistani pavilion stood tall amidst grand exhibits trying to make its mark. And in the presence of all national and international airliners representing their respective countries, Pakistan International Airlines (PIA)’s notable absence was deeply felt, especially by the Pakistani exhibitors.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, tourism veteran with 50 years of experience and Chief Executive Officer of Zeb Travels, Khawaja Jahan Zeb said, “I have been visiting these trade exhibitions for over 30 years. Many of us have. I have come with just a briefcase in hand and sometimes with an individual stall of our own, because it is a passion.”
With respect to PIA, Zeb said, back in the day the airliner had a large tourism department that would promote Pakistan all over the world.
“Now, the PIA tourism department no longer exists. It is the national airliner, but look, even today it is missing,” he said, adding that, “I don’t know what the issue is, perhaps it’s money, perhaps it’s bureaucracy, maybe it’s just inefficiency and lack of planning. Some 15-20 years ago, PIA had launched an air safari and it performed wonderfully! I was on the inaugural flight and we had tourists all the way from Japan!”
He lamented political instability in the country saying, “But things change so rapidly and unpredictably in Pakistan that officers in position don’t know if they will be in the same office the next day to reap the benefits of their hard work. They don’t even know if their successors will carry on the work…”
Chief Operating Officer for Hashoo Group Hotels, Haseeb Gardezi added that, “We are all very excited to be here under one banner, but a big piece of the tourism puzzle is missing. Without the presence of an airline ensuring people that we can provide convenient routes to all the amazing destinations being showcased, how will people even start planning their journeys?”
Touching upon the fact that this was the third time in 30 years that the Pakistani government had put up a pavilion at the ATM, Zeb said, “Thank God, the government finally realised the importance of putting up a pavilion here but they don’t have a vision. Normally, they just waste the budget elsewhere. Look at all the other stalls, even Sri Lanka that just defaulted has a pavilion worth visiting. You can tell that they have hired professionals who understand the tenets of tourism. Promoting the country is the duty of the state. If the government hires the right people, and not someone from the food department, or consults with private stakeholders, the face of the industry will change. It has the potential to transform the economy of Pakistan.”
While there were throngs of people crowding at the pavilion, Gardezi pointed out that “Our collective presence here gives them a chance to interact with a small piece of Pakistan. And I hope we continue to band together, put differences aside and put the greater good of the country at the fore.”
“How is anyone supposed to know what all Pakistan hosts when it isn’t being promoted?” lamented Tahir Baloch, COO of Meezab Group.
He told The Express Tribune that Pakistan is a treasure trove of unexplored potential and there are only 14 stalls representing the entire country.
“We are here to show people that Pakistan is an attractive tourist destination, and you can see there are so many people constantly asking questions and becoming excited with the prospect of visiting. People know we have the mightiest peaks, the most beautiful sunsets, but they are all concerned about the political and security situation. Security is a key challenge and the government must take measures to ensure security and those measures should be promoted through campaigns across the globe. There is only so much we can say to assure people.”
A defaulting Sri Lanka,
a star at ATM
Managing director for the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau told The Express Tribune that despite struggling economically, it is extremely important for Sri Lanka to be present at the ATM. “Tourism is our third largest foreign exchange earner in the country.”
Hit continuously, first by the pandemic, then a political crisis and finally a sovereign default, the MD said, “We are finally bouncing back and our aim here today is to minimise any negative publicity that Sri Lanka may have in India, Europe and the Middle East. We have 50 stalls here today and hope to remind people of the beauty that Sri Lanka holds. We hope to bring 1.55 million tourists to the country. Until April, we have had about 450,000 people visit the country, so we are on track.”
Sustainability and growth
Sustainability took centre stage with most exhibits across the Dubai Trade Centre competing for the coveted new “Most Sustainable Stand” award introduced by ATM this year.
RX (Reed Exhibitions), the show’s organiser, has taken a pledge to become net zero by 2050. ATM 2023 featured over 2,000 exhibitors with over 34,000 attendees from more than 150 countries.
The grand pavilion for the kingdom of Saudi Arabia spread across a vast area of the trade centre pulled the attention of innovators, travel gurus, students and tourists from all across.
A 16-year-old student from Dubai stood by the NEOM stall thrilled to explain just how wondrous this project was, how ‘the line’ was the talk of the town and how it was sure to win the sustainability award this year.
On the other hand was AlUla, a project that had innovators gleeful with excitement for the millions of possibilities the world of tourism had to offer in the future.
Dubai, however, took the cake proving itself to be a graceful host of diversity, innovation, luxury and panache. This year, the emirate was also crowned the number one global destination in the Tripadvisor Travellers’ Choice Award for the second successive year, cementing its position as the world’s favourite tourist destination.

1,FBR calls taxmen protest peaceful,Tax officers raise voice against discrimination in pay as compared to other govt officials,"As more taxmen seek about two-month leave at a crunch time in protest against low wages and discrimination, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) on Thursday said that the protest remains peaceful and is only limited to “social media”.
The protest began from Sargodha Regional Tax Office (RTO) a day ago and spread to the FBR’s headquarters and tax offices in other parts of the country with Lahore – the second largest revenue-spinning city – being the most affected.
Tax officers, mostly serving in pay scales of 17 and 18, have started drafting leave applications for the period from May 8 to June 30, according to a number of applications seen by The Express Tribune.
The officers have raised their voice against discrimination as compared to other civil service groups, a situation that has aggravated due to a nearly six-decade high inflation and the lack of empathy shown by the top FBR management.
Instead of presenting their case to the prime minister and the federal cabinet, the FBR management tried a few months ago to soothe the nerves by promising to establish a common fund with Re1 per invoice contribution by the taxpayers.
Taxmen claimed that at least 150 to 200 officers would go on leave with effect from May 8 if the FBR management and the government did not pay any heed to their plight.
The collective leave applications, or unwillingness to perform duties, may create more problems for the FBR, which has already suffered a revenue shortfall of Rs380 billion in the first 10 months of current fiscal year.
When contacted, FBR spokesman Afaque Qureshi remarked “it is a symbolic peaceful protest (and) only on social media as they are pressing for increase in salaries.”
But one of the employees told The Express Tribune on condition of anonymity that the situation could turn ugly if the FBR did not pay any attention.
Qureshi appeared hopeful, saying “they are responsible officers and committed to the national cause. They always come up to the call of duty.”
Responding to a question, the FBR spokesman said that the Revenue Division secretary, who happened to be the FBR chairman, was not getting any executive allowance neither members of the Revenue Division were receiving the allowance.
FBR’s employees had been denied a special allowance equal to 150% of the basic salary of government officers of Grade 17 and above, approved by the federal cabinet, on the pretext of a pre-existing special allowance.
However, the FBR’s performance allowance has remained frozen since 2015 and it has been reduced to effectively 20-30% of the basic pay.
Contrary to this, employees of other departments are benefitting from special allowances, which include the Supreme Court, parliament, presidency, armed forces, Prime Minister’s Office, officers serving in federal secretariat, National Accountability Bureau and Federal Investigation Agency, to name a few.
The reason for the leave is the extremely low salary and the skyrocketing inflation, said a leave application of a Grade-18 officer.
“I have been living hand to mouth and the low salary barely fulfills the basic needs of my family, which is a cause of continuous financial stress and mental health issues for me,” he wrote.
Applicants also mentioned the promise of “top leadership (about) the implementation of Common Pool Fund (CPF) from March 1, 2023 but that promise too has not been fulfilled to date”.
A Grade-17 officer of the FBR gets a gross monthly salary of Rs98,000 and net salary of Rs84,000, which is not enough at a time of 36.4% overall inflation and 52.2% food inflation.
A Grade-18 officer gets Rs114,000 in salary and after paying taxes, the take-home pay is Rs96,000 a month.
FBR officials close to the chairman revealed that the chairman had taken up the discrimination in salary structure with the PM Office.
The PM Office said that the 150% executive allowance should be given to employees serving in the FBR’s headquarters by excluding field formations. But the FBR management did not accept the offer.

2,Japan’s policy shift to impact global markets,"'In addition, we see a risk that the global economy fragments into trading blocs'","The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Thursday warned of “uncertainty” around the direction of Japan’s monetary policy, saying a possible shift from ultra-low interest rates could have a significant impact on global financial markets.
Krishna Srinivasan, Director of the IMF’s Asia and Pacific Department, also pointed to risks surrounding Asia’s economic outlook including from weakening exports to advanced economies, slowing productivity in China and a fragmentation of global trade. 
“Over the medium term, we expect the Chinese economy to experience a slowdown in productivity and investment, which will lower growth below 4% by 2028,” he said. “In addition, we see a risk that the global economy fragments into trading blocs,” which could deal a particularly heavy blow to Asia.

3,Rs1.54tr in power subsidies sought,Amount 70% higher than this year’s revised budget aimed at curbing debt,"The Ministry of Energy has demanded Rs1.54 trillion in power subsidies for the next fiscal year, a colossal amount that is 70% more than this year’s revised budget, aimed at reducing circular debt to a level agreed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The demand is surprising since the government has twice increased electricity tariffs in the outgoing fiscal year in order to reduce subsidies and control circular debt.
Sources in the Ministry of Energy told The Express Tribune that Rs1.54 trillion was needed in fiscal year 2023-24 for avoiding any further increase in circular debt and settling arrears.
The amount included Rs250 billion for paying dues of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor’s (CPEC) energy projects, the sources said.
The development comes at a time when the PML-N led coalition government is going to unveil next fiscal year’s budget around June 10, as it has not accepted Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s (PTI) demand to let a caretaker government present the budget.
In the absence of an IMF umbrella, there is apprehension that the coalition government may give preference to its political objectives over economic needs in the upcoming budget.
The demand for Rs1.54 trillion is Rs634 billion, or 70%, higher than the estimated power subsidies in the outgoing fiscal year. However, as compared to the original budget, the demand was higher by 203%.
A senior official of the Ministry of Energy was of the view that like the outgoing fiscal year, the finance ministry may again give lower-than-required funds to manage both the flow and stock of circular debt.
But there are some transparency issues that the ministry should address. There is concern about electricity subsidy claims for the erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas and the domestic and agricultural consumers of Balochistan. However, these numbers are not independently verifiable.
Authorities’ numbers also do not match with regard to the subsidy claims for Azad Jammu and Kashmir.
Cumulatively, power sector subsidies have become the third largest expenditure after debt servicing and defence needs. The amount of Rs1.54 trillion is more than the total cost of building the Mainline-I project of Pakistan Railways from Peshawar to Karachi.
Earlier, the PML-N led coalition government has twice increased electricity tariffs, first in July last year and then in February this year.
Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) in August last year reported a 124% increase in electricity prices on a yearly basis and then 33% rise in March this year.
Despite hiking the tariffs, the government added a net Rs419 billion to the power sector circular debt in the first eight months of current fiscal year, pushing the total circular debt to Rs2.67 trillion.
Average per-month increase in circular debt from July to February came in at Rs52.4 billion. The circular debt at the beginning of current fiscal year had been Rs2.25 trillion.
Under an agreement with the IMF, the government has approved an additional Rs335 billion in subsidy for the power sector in the current fiscal year. Out of this, Rs205 billion has already been sanctioned.
But the Ministry of Energy officials said that the finance ministry released Rs12 billion less than the commitment, which would add to the circular debt.
Sources said that for the next fiscal year, the Ministry of Energy demanded Rs164 billion as price differential subsidy for the government-run power distribution companies.
Besides, Rs170 billion is being demanded for picking up the cost of subsidy for K-Electric consumers. Similarly, it has sought Rs7 billion for settling arrears of the Prime Minister’s Industrial Support Package for KE consumers in the next fiscal year.
Sources said that the Ministry of Energy did not seek funds for PM’s special packages. Instead, in order to settle current claims of CPEC projects and retire some of their old bills, the ministry has sought Rs250 billion.

DESIGN: IBRAHIM YAHYA
Last month, PM Shehbaz Sharif said that Pakistan owed Rs450 billion to the CPEC energy projects.
In addition, the Ministry of Energy has demanded Rs260 billion to clear the outstanding dues of private power producers, excluding Chinese investors.
However, it is not yet clear whether the Ministry of Energy has credible plans to reduce line losses and increase the collection of bills.
The Ministry of Energy has sought another Rs195 billion for paying subsidies to Quetta Electricity Supply Company, but there is a lack of transparency in these claims. The ministry has in the past not shared the breakdown of such claims.
Compared to the subsidy of Rs20 billion for the erstwhile FATA in the current fiscal year, the energy ministry has demanded Rs48 billion in the new budget.
It has sought a major chunk of Rs127 billion for clearing arrears of AJK consumers that are getting highly subsidised electricity.

4,Industry demands GI tag for pink salt,"Salt manufacturers stress need for value addition, diversifying exports","The Salt Manufacturers Association of Pakistan (SMAP) has appealed to the government to step up efforts for obtaining Geographical Indication (GI) tag for pink salt, a unique product that is exclusively present and mined in Pakistan.
The industry lobby urged the government to follow the example of Basmati rice and register pink salt as a GI product through the Intellectual Property Organisation (IPO).
SMAP Chairman Ismail Suttar, while underscoring the need for giving pink salt a GI tag, termed value addition to minerals and chemicals a great opportunity that would ensure a better future for the country.
“Instead of paying increasing attention to traditional items, we have to focus on other export sectors, so that overseas sales could get a boost,” he said.
He expressed those thoughts while speaking at the annual dinner of the association.
“Registering pink salt as a GI product can help raise export earnings, which can stabilise the rupee as well,” Arif Habib Commodities CEO Ahsan Mehanti told The Express Tribune. “Value-added minerals will add to export earnings of the country,” he said.
Around 50 companies have applied for the GI tag for pink salt, which is being considered by Pakistan Mineral Development Corporation (PMDC).
“There are 92 minerals in Pakistan, but except for gypsum, no work has been done on minerals and chemicals,” Suttar said and sought the Trade Development Authority of Pakistan’s (TDAP) support for setting up a testing laboratory in Balochistan.
He pointed out that Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry’s (FPCCI) Policy Advisory Board Chairman Younus Dagha was setting up a calcium fluoride unit in Hub, which was expected to become the key export item in the next five years.
“Pakistan is the only country producing pink salt; India exports the mineral globally as its own brand,” said Union of Small and Medium Enterprises (UNISAME) President Zulfikar Thaver.
TDAP CEO Zubair Motiwala, while assuring businessmen of support for establishing the laboratory in Balochistan and GI tag for pink salt, emphasised that there were vast opportunities for development in the pink salt industry and urged the government to encourage value addition.
According to Dagha, exports should be diversified and special attention should be paid to minerals and agriculture. Currently, chrome is being exported at $200 per ton, which may go up to $400 after value addition, while the value of ferrochrome is up to $1,400.
Sindh Secretary Mines Khalid Chachar said “we have issued 86 permits for salt while 39,000 hectares of land has been leased”.
PMDC General Manager Asghar Karim revealed that pink salt was being registered after which traders associated with the sector would be able to use the logo.

5,Energy conservation to help save $6.4b,Tribunal to be set up to address issues related to energy efficiency standards,"The government has targeted to save $6.4 billion by implementing energy conservation measures under the National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Policy (NEECP) 2023.
The Cabinet Committee on Energy, chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, has recently approved the policy.
It is aimed at establishing an energy conservation tribunal (ECT) to address issues related to energy efficiency and conservation standards. It encourages private investment in energy conservation and efficiency projects by developing the Super ESCO Model to mitigate investment risks and issue energy saving certificates and bonds.
The policy also encourages cultural changes, such as vehicle-free weekends and daylight savings, through awareness raising campaigns.
The National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (NEECA), a federal agency responsible for coordinating all energy conservation activities, will be implementing the policy.
NEECP is intended to achieve the target of 9 million tons of oil equivalent (MTOE) in energy savings by 2030, reducing 35 MT CO2 emissions.
It identifies sector-specific measures for industrial, building, transport, energy and agriculture sectors, providing precise guidelines for coordination with provincial governments.
Salient features of the policy include regulatory, capacity, and advocacy measures. These ensure compliance with energy performance standards and labelling regimes for appliances and products.

6,Gold maintains record-breaking spree,"Investors asked to remain cautious about abnormal growth, price volatility","Gold hit a new all-time high at Rs225,300 per tola (11.66 grams) on Thursday in line with the global trend amid talk of likely default by the United States.
Talking to The Express Tribune, AA Gold Commodity Director Adnan Agar projected that the precious metal may surpass Rs300,000 per tola in the next couple of weeks, but the “abnormal” rally would be for a short duration only.
Bullion hit the record high at $2,080 per ounce (31.10 grams) in the international market at around 3am on Thursday (according to Pakistan standard time).
The local pricing body, the All Pakistan Saraf Gems and Jewellers Association (APSGJA), revised the gold rate upwards by Rs2,600 (or 1.2%) to Rs225,300 per tola.
Agar said gold may spike to $2,300-2,400 per ounce in May on talk of likely default by the US on interest payment. Accordingly, the local gold price may reach in the range of Rs300,000 to Rs325,000 per tola.
“The US has hit its debt ceiling of $32 trillion and lacks the capacity to service debt on June 1, 2023,” he said.
The US government will present a bill to increase the debt ceiling by $6 trillion to $38 trillion. However, the opposition, which is in majority in Congress, is expected to oppose the bill.
He added that the US would not default and approve the increase in debt ceiling in the last days of May. “The situation is highly anticipated to keep gold volatile. The likely uptrend in global gold will keep local prices elevated as well.”
However, he said the rally would lose steam in a couple of weeks and gold would retreat to around $1,800 per ounce.
He recalled that the US had faced the same issue in 2011. At that time, gold gained $450 per ounce to the then all-time high at $1,900 and retreated to the pre-crisis level of $1,530 within a few days. “History is going to repeat itself.”
Agar advised global and local investors to remain highly cautious as the abnormal growth in gold may come to a halt anytime, as happened in 2011.
He said the gold price was also soaring because of the collapse of three small banks in the US, with reports suggesting the collapse of other such financial institutions.
In addition to international factors, he said, Pakistan’s gold market had its own fundamentals that were supporting the precious metal.
“Pakistan has not yet succeeded in reviving the International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan programme and the risk of default is also looming,” Agar said, adding that locals were taking position in gold to avoid the impact of rupee devaluation against the US dollar amid a six-decade high inflation at 36%.
Earlier, they were buying US dollars, but now they are parking their savings in gold.
“Dollar is no more a safe haven, as it is likely to lose value against other global currencies amid the US crisis. In addition to this, a global movement to de-dollarise international trade through the introduction of a new world currency, called BRICS, has also increased demand for gold.”
Pakistan Mercantile Exchange (PMEX) has given physical delivery of 1,000-1,500 tola over the last one and a half month after bullion appeared short in the local market, he added. Earlier, the physical delivery by PMEX had been nominal.
On the other hand, the rupee remained stable at around Rs284 against the US dollar in the inter-bank market, as demand for the greenback stood low.
The rupee maintained its upward trend for the second consecutive working day, as it rose by 0.02%, or Rs0.08, to Rs283.82 against the greenback on Thursday, according to the central bank.

7,Forex reserves fall by $6m to $4.46b,No reason cited for decrease in State Bank’s reserves,"The foreign exchange reserves held by the central bank fell by 0.12% on a week-on-week basis to $4.46 billion, according to data released by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Thursday.
On April 28, 2023, the SBP’s foreign currency reserves stood at $4,457.2 million, down by $6 million as compared to $4,462.8 million on April 20. The central bank gave no reason for the decrease in reserves.
Overall, the liquid foreign currency reserves held by the country, including the net reserves held by banks other than the SBP, stood at $10,043.2 million. The net reserves held by banks amounted to $5,586 million.
Ismail Iqbal Securities Head of Research Fahad Rauf has said that any significant improvement in Pakistan’s foreign currency reserves depends on the revival of IMF loan programme and inflow of fresh financing from other multilateral and bilateral creditors.
“They (FX reserves) are projected to rise to around $7-8 billion by the end of current fiscal year on June 30, 2023,” he said.
The reserves improved in the recent past after the central bank opted to buy US dollars in the inter-bank market in the wake of increased supply of the greenback compared to its demand.
