0,Imran’s indictment in gifts case set for May 10,Court rejects PTI chief’s petitions challenging criminal proceedings against him,"A local court in the federal capital will indict former prime minister and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan on May 10 in the Toshakhana case, filed by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
Additional Sessions Judge Humayun Dilawar on Friday dismissed two petitions filed by the PTI chief, challenging criminal proceedings against him in the Toshakhana case, after hearing arguments from both sides.
During hearing of the petitions, Imran’s lawyer Khawaja Haris and ECP’s counsel Amjad Pervaiz presented arguments. The judge admitted the case for hearing in the court and summoned the PTI chief in person on May 10 for indictment.
During the hearing, Khawaja Haris presented his arguments on the admissibility of the ECP's complaint and raised objection to the court’s jurisdiction to hear the case, saying that the sessions court could not hear the matter directly.
Haris further stated that the legal procedure of sending the complaint was also not adopted by the district election commissioner. He pointed out that complainant Waqas Malik was not the district election commissioner at the time of filing the complaint.

In support of his arguments, the lawyer referred to various sections of the Election Act and also cited various judicial precedents. Haris said that under the Election Act 2017, the petitioner could file a complaint within 120 days.
ECP lawyer Amjad Pervaiz told the court that the Election Act stated that the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) did not apply to every trial. He said that if the court found that an offense had been committed, it was empowered to proceed.
Pervaiz stated that the charge against Imran came under Section 173 of the Election Act. On December 15, 2022, he added, the court issued summon to the accused, yet despite the passage of so much time, the trial was being delayed.
He further said that Imran did not provide details of assets deliberately, therefore, the period of 120 days did not apply in such a situation. After the corrupt practice, he continued, Imran could not rely on 120-day timeframe.
After hearing the argument, the court reserved its ruling, which was announced later in the day. Pronouncing the verdict, the court rejected both the petitions of Imran had summoned him in personal capacity on May 10 for his indictment.

1,"PBC, SCBA fight intensifies",SC refuses to suspend PBC order against SCBA officials,"The Supreme Court on Friday refused to suspend the Pakistan Bar Council’s (PBC) order on the de-seating of Supreme Court Bar Association’s (SCBA) secretary and additional secretary on account of ‘misconduct’.
The court, maintaining status quo on the SCBA’s petition against the PBC order, adjourned the hearing till May 9.
A division bench of the apex court led by Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar heard the SCBA petition.
A day earlier, SCBA President Abid Zuberi and Secretary Muqtedir Akhtar Shabbir had filed a petition in the top court, pleading against the show-cause notices issued by the PBC to the association’s two officials.
The association requested that the top court should declare the show-cause notices null and void.
“As we have been informed that the order of de-seating has already been passed by the PBC with regard to the offices of the petitioners No 2 [SCBA Secretary Muqtedir Akhtar Shabbir] and 3 [SCBA Additional Secretary Malik Shakeel-ur-Rehman], therefore at this stage a mandatory form of injunction cannot be granted without notice to the other side,” read the court order.
“However, subject to satisfying the maintainability of this constitution petition, let notice be issued to the respondents [PBC Islamabad secretary] as well as the Attorney General for Pakistan for 09.05.2023 at 1:00 p.m. Meanwhile, status quo is to be maintained,” it added.
A day earlier, differences between the PBC and the SCBA intensified as the former removed the latter’s secretary Shabbir and additional secretary Shakeel-ur-Rehman from their posts on allegations of misconduct.
The PBC gave the additional charge of the SCBA secretary to the association’s Finance Secretary Hifza Bokhari. Hifza then called a meeting and removed SCBA president Abid Zuberi with a majority vote.
The PBC accused the secretary and additional secretary of violating the Legal Practitioner and Bar Council Act, adding that they had not appeared before the Executive Committee of the council.
Zuberi and Shabbir challenged the decisions of the PBC in the court. However, the plea for an injunction was rejected and the case was adjourned till May 9.

In a retaliatory move, the SCBA secretary suspended the membership of seven members of the PBC, namely Executive Committee Chairman Hasan Raza Pasha, Amjad Shah, Riazat Ali Sahar, Tariq Afridi, Masood Chishti, Ahsan Bhoon, and Qalbe Hasan Shah.
The SCBA has banned the members of the Executive Committee of the PBC from entering the bar rooms of the Supreme Court.
Later, addressing a news conference in Islamabad, Zuberi lamented “political interference” in their matters and declared the bar association’s independence from the PBC.
He said the SCBA elections were held annually, and they won those the last time around. However, he claimed that the PBC was continuously interfering in their affairs as it was trying to intervene in the cases of political parties.
“The real issue is the lawyers’ housing society; a land provider was given an excess of Rs2 billion by Ahsan Bhoon; human trafficking of 30 to 32 people was carried out on the letter of the Supreme Court Bar,” he alleged.
He further claimed that visa seekers turned out to be fake lawyers after checking with the Austrian embassy and the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA). He said that the rules and regulations of the SCBA were clear.
“The SCBA was pressured to go by what the government said; we made it clear that we stand by the rule of law,” he added. He also expressed his gratefulness to Justice Qazi Faez Isa for starting the enrollment process. “The SCBA is in no way under the PBC,” he claimed.

2,Bushra Bibi serves legal notice on Maryam,PML-N chief organiser had accused former first lady of being involved in corruption,"Former first lady Bushra Bibi on Thursday served a legal notice on PML-N Chief Organiser Maryam Nawaz for hurling “defamatory, false, frivolous and slanderous” allegations against her husband PTI Chairman and former premier Imran Khan during a recent public speech.
The notice, sent through Fareed Advocate, mentions a speech delivered by Maryam on May 1 at a PML-N convention in Lahore.
It said the PML-N leader had accused Bushra Bibi of taking “five-caret gold rings as bribes for getting documents signed by authorities” during her address.
The notice said that the PML-N chief organiser’s statement was part of a “vilification campaign” meant to “harm, defame and denigrate” Bushra Bibi and her family with “criminal object to benefit the political opponents of the client’s husband Mr Imran Khan Niazi”.
It said Maryam “through a well-thought action to attack, defame and malign our client, intentionally and knowingly the falsehood of your false and fabricated statement, have wrongfully accused our client, who is a pious, purdah nasheen lady and a ‘housewife’, in spite of that she has been targeted by you, most atrociously to satisfy ill-will, malicious and vindictive agenda against the client and her family to achieve mischievous objectives”.
The notice asked the PML-N leader to withdraw her statement and issue an apology to Bushra Bibi within seven days, stating that otherwise, the latter had the legal right to initiate legal action against Maryam in court.
In response to the notice, Maryam said that Bushra Bibi would be held accountable for her “wrongdoings” when she appeared before the courts.
She was commenting on a tweet of Minister for Information and Broadcasting Marriyum Aurangzeb about the former first lady.
Earlier, the information minister had said that ""veiled lady"" Bushra Bibi should appear before the court to answer for her wrongdoings instead of sending a legal notice to the PML-N chief organiser.
She tweeted that Maryam had exposed all the ""imposters"" who looted the country ruthlessly.
Marriyum urged Bushra Bibi to face the cases that were filed against her.
She said the ""veiled lady"" did not confine herself to her house, but had been involved in corruption including receiving five-carat diamonds, land grabbing and accusing the political opponents of treason on social media.

4,PML-N accepts 4-3 SC ruling in suo motu case: Nawaz,"Imran constantly changes his get-up and script according to the situation, says Marriyum Aurangzeb","Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Quaid Nawaz Sharif said on Thursday that his party only acknowledged the 4-3 decision of the Supreme Court and not the 3-2 ruling in the suo motu case about the election for the Punjab assembly.
The former prime minister, in a media interaction, said that he had met with some financial experts from China and Britain to discuss the economic challenges being faced by Pakistan.
Nawaz also commented on the use of a wheelchair by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan, saying that those who once ridiculed rivals on account of illness were themselves in the wheelchair.
Nawaz’s remarks were echoed in a statement by Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, saying that Imran’s use of a wheelchair to skip court cases, was a “divine retribution” because, in past, he used to ridicule others for their diseases.
She said a person who made fun of the Sharif’s family members’ illnesses was “lying in a wheelchair today”. She asked the PTI chairman to appear in the courts instead of indulging in the blame game.
She said that Imran had constantly been changing his get-up and script according to the situation. “Imran is in fear of bail cancellation, and is using a wheelchair as a tactic. If the court calls him, he has the excuses of plaster, disability, canister and now wheelchair.
Aurangzeb said that first, Imran played a dirty game of cypher, then apologised to the US and blamed the then army chief, Gen (retd) Qamar Javed Bajwa, after than Asif Zardari and now Mohsin Naqvi for his ouster.

5,Pakistan lags behind in curbing child marriages,UNICEF report says one in four girls in South Asia married before 18th birthday,"A report stated that Maldives, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan were ranked first, second, and third, respectively, in South Asian countries in reducing early marriages.
Although South Asia was leading the world in reducing child marriage, it would take 55 years to completely eradicate it if it did not accelerate, read a United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) report, while also acknowledging Pakistan’s efforts in this connection.
The report added that to achieve the goal of ending child marriages by 2030, the speed of reforms in South Asia should be accelerated seven times.
About 18% of girls in Pakistan are still married as children, numbering 1.9 million.
That means one in six girls in Pakistan are married at an early age, even though the legal minimum age for marriage in the country is 18 years.
However, the rate of child marriage in Pakistan is slightly better than the world average of 19%, especially in compared with India, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Nepal, and Bhutan, which lag far behind.
Bangladesh has the highest child marriage rate in South Asia at 51%, while the lowest is in the Maldives at just 2%. India’s child marriage rate is 34%, where one in three girls are married at an early age.
Even though South Asia is leading in the world in reducing child marriage, yet one in four girls in the region is married before their 18th birthday.
The number of child brides in South Asian countries is around 300 million, which is 45% of the world population.
Three out of every four brides in the region give birth when they are still teenagers.
According to a UNICEF survey, 55% of brides in Pakistan believe that wife beating is permissible.
Around 41% of women in India and 33% in Bangladesh also consider violence by their husbands as valid.
“Girls who marry in childhood face immediate and lifelong consequences. They are less likely to remain in school, and face an increased risk of early pregnancy, in turn increasing the risk of child and maternal health complications and mortality,” a UNICEF news statement read.
It added that the practice could also isolate girls from family and friends, as well as exclude them from participating in their communities.
This takes a heavy toll on these girls’ mental health and well-being.
“Worldwide, conflict, climate-related disasters, and the ongoing impacts of Covid-19 -- especially rising poverty, income shocks, and school dropout -- are helping to increase the drivers of child marriage. [It is] also making it difficult for girls to access health care, education, social services and community support that protect them from child marriage,” it noted.
UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said they had proven that progress to end child marriage was possible.
“It requires unwavering support for vulnerable girls and families,” she added.
“We must focus on keeping girls in school and making sure they have economic opportunities,” the UNICEF official continued.

6,RSF improves Pakistan's ranking,"Reporters without borders noted that after the change of govt in 2022, constraints on the media were loosened","Pakistan's ranking improved by seven places in the 2023 World Press Freedom Index released by Reporters Without Borders (RSF) as the country was placed at 150th position among 180 countries.
While citing the reason for the improvement in Pakistan's position from 157 in 2022 to 150 this year, RSF noted that Pakistan achieved the improved ranking because, after the change of government in 2022, constraints on the media were loosened.
It is a significant achievement as compared to last year when Pakistan came down to 157 in 2022 from its ranking of 145 in 2021 and the then prime minister Imran Khan was declared a press freedom predator along with Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi.

7,Parliament’s right of legislation cannot be taken away: PM,Says previous government victimised the opposition,"Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday said legislation was the right of parliament and all the institutions should perform their role within the limits determined by the constitution because it was imperative for country’s integrity and security and for progress and prosperity of the people.

8,Sindh to bear KCR’s operational cost,Officials tell Senate panel rehabilitation of project’s victims provincial govt’s responsibility," 
Pakistan Railways officials on Thursday made it clear that the Sindh government would bear the operational cost of the Karachi Circular Railway (KCR).
They added that as far as land was concerned, there would be an undertaking between the provincial government and the Railways department.
They said this during a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Railways presided over by its chairman, Senator Muhammad Qasim.
The Railways officials said the rehabilitation of KCR victims was the responsibility of the provincial government.
Committee member Senator Shahadat Hussain asked for a report to be prepared by the railways officials on the matter.
Senator Mirza Muhammad Afridi, also a member, inquired whether or not the Railways officials had submitted a report on the land.
The officials said they must discuss the issue with the provincial government.
Hussain pointed out that the Supreme Court ordered the resettlement of the victims of the KCR.
He sought updates on the matter.
The chairman pointed out that Hussain had remained the prosecutor general of Sindh, so he had knowledge of the city.
“We will give our stance on behalf of the Railways, but we can also get an idea of Sindh’s stance through Shahadat Hussain,” he added.
Khan Badshah told the committee that many societies, including Hazara and Machar colonies, had been demolished.
“Try to find a solution to it so that we can build houses for children,” he added.
“If there is a future meeting, hold it in Karachi. There are many problems surfacing from the city,” he continued.
Afridi told the meeting that people are facing problems with pensions.
The officials told him that the only body of the federation which was handing over pensions was the Railways.
Currently, pensions stood at Rs40 billion while they would reach Rs50 billion next year, they added.
The Railways department faced liabilities of over Rs10 billion, they continued.
The Senate panel was told that currently, there were 25,000 pensioners and their numbers were ever-increasing.
Discussing the issue of pensions, the committee expressed its concern over the ever-increasing percentage of dependents on the department's budget.
The committee later ratified Senator Manzoor Ahmed and Senator Syed Muhammad Ali Shah Jamot as members of the Railway Advisory Committee in Quetta and Karachi, respectively.

9,Shujaat to remain PML-Q chief: ECP,Polls supervisor dismisses Wajahat Hussain’s request to amend party’s constitution," 
Declaring the amendments made to the constitution of the Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid (PML-Q) party as null and void, the polls supervisory authority—the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP)—has said Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain will remain the party chief.
On January 26, Chaudhry Wajahat Hussain – a brother of Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain – amended the constitution of the party, reducing the four-year term of the party president to two years.
Wajahat also conducted new intra-party elections in which the PML-Q elected Wajahat as its central president, formally ending the 19-year rule of Shujaat.
Interestingly, the party retained former PML-Q leader Parvez Elahi as the PML-Q Punjab president.
It also removed Shujaat’s close aide Tariq Bashir Cheema and elected Kamil Ali Agha as the central secretary general of the party. Cracks in the PML-Q first appeared in March last year when the then opposition filed a no-confidence motion against former premier Imran Khan.
Elahi then threw his weight behind the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) while Shujaat decided to side with the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) parties. The division – triggered by Elahi’s decision – split the party into two camps.  Parvez Elahi later joined the PTI.
