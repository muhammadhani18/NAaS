0,SC won’t ‘sit idle’ on Punjab polls order: CJ,Top judge remarks court has to follow its decision according to Constitution,"Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial on Friday remarked that the Supreme Court would not sit idle on its earlier decision of holding the elections in Punjab on May 14 if the negotiations between the government and PTI failed.
He added that the court had to follow its decision according to the Constitution.
A three-judge bench, comprising Justice Bandial, Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Justice Munib Akhtar, resumed the hearing of a petition filed in connection with the same day polls.
A day earlier, the top court issued its April 27 order, wherein it distanced itself away from the government-PTI talks, saying that its April 4 decision of holding polls in Punjab would remain unchanged.
After three rounds of talks, the government and PTI were unable to agree on a date for the same day elections.
On Wednesday, the PTI had submitted an application to the SC, informing it that the party's talks with the government had failed to bear any fruit and the court should enforce its April 4 order to hold elections in Punjab on May 14.
As the proceedings commenced, the CJP noted that he could see that both PTI leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi and PML-N’s Khawaja Saad Rafique were present in the court.
PPP lawyer Farooq H Naek read out the coalition government's reply in the court. He said the country’s debts had increased by 78%.
He added that the circular debt had jacked up by 125% while a loss of $31 billion was caused because of the floods last year.
Naek continued that the budget, International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreement and trade policy must be approved before the assembly could be dissolved.
The PPP lawyer said the government and PTI had agreed on a level playing field and one-day elections, but could not reach a consensus on the date of the dissolution of the assembly.
He further informed the court that the government was ready to restore the process of negotiations in the interest of the country and in any case elections should be held on the same day this year.
The PPP counsel told the court that the Sindh and Balochistan assemblies were not ready for premature dissolution.
He added that each side had to show flexibility in negotiations.
However, he maintained that  success in negotiations could not be achieved in a few days, so more time was required for talks.
The CJP remarked that the IMF agreement was emphasised in the government's response, but the issue in the court was  constitutional, not a political one.
He added that the court left the political issues to the parties to address.
The top judge then inquired why the approval of the IMF agreement and trade policy were important.
Naek replied that it was necessary to receive the IMF loan to obtain aid from friendly countries and in the absence of the assemblies, the budget would not be approved.
He continued that if the assemblies of Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa had not been dissolved, the crisis would not have occurred.
He maintained that the time of the court was also being wasted because of this crisis.
Justice Bandial inquired whether the IMF loan would be used to increase foreign reserves or repayment of loans.
Naek replied that only the finance minister could respond to this query.
The top judge pointed out that the Constitution allowed four months' time for the budget even after the dissolution of the assembly.
He asked the lawyer whether or not the budget was being prepared under the IMF package.
The CJP noted that according to newspapers, friendly countries would also give loans to the country after the IMF package.
He asked if the PTI had accepted or rejected the importance of the budget.
Justice Bandial observed that nobody could deny the 90-day limit for elections in the Constitution.
The PPP lawyer replied that there were no two opinions over the conducting of elections within 90 days.
The CJP remarked that it was a matter of national and public importance to enforce the Constitution.
He added that the court had decided to hold elections in 90 days.
Justice Bandial noted that if the negotiations failed, the SC would not sit idle on its decision of holding elections in Punjab on May 14, but the court had to follow its decision according to the Constitution.
He added that the court wanted to look at the public interest and if there was a constitutional problem, it could not turn a blind eye to it.
Justice Bandial remarked that the SC could use the Constitution to implement its decisions.
The court only wanted to perform its duty, he added.
Referring to statements alleging that courts did not respect the Constitution in the past, the CJP noted that the SC refrained from commenting on such statements as a sign of respect.
He added that decisions made in anger were often wrong and that was why judges stayed calm.
The CJP asked the PPP counsel to draw comparisons between the discussions held in court and those that occurred in parliament.
“Observe the level of discussion being held here [in the court],” he continued.
The PPP counsel said the court had to review the issue of elections in 90 days.
He added that after the 18th Constitutional Amendment, elections required caretaker governments.
He continued that nobody would accept the polls with elected governments.
Naek pointed out that elections held under the caretaker set-ups were also challenged, and if there was a regular government, there would be a great deal of hue and cry over the results of the polls.
The top judge remarked that when the suo motu notice of matter was taken February 23, the government raised its fingers and all these points were not taken up back then.
He added that the government had now raised the issues of caretaker set-ups and funds but back then, it was only interested in 4-3 verdict.
Justice Bandial observed that the government did not even try to receive a verdict by the court.
He continued that constitutional proceedings were not taken seriously by the government.
Naek replied that the court was unwilling to hear the government’s version.
The CJP told Naek that the government had boycotted court proceedings in the second round.
“You continued your discussions for three or four days instead,” he added.
The CJP remarked that Justice Athar Minallah had raised the point of restoring the assemblies, but the government was not interested.
“Look at today’s conversation, no one is talking about judgment or law,” he continued.
The CJP observed that the seriousness of the government was such that it had not even filed a review appeal against the SC judgment.
“The government doesn’t want to talk about law but wants to do politics,” he maintained.
The CJP remarked that the court would not respond to politics.
He added that he had taken an oath to protect the Constitution.
The top judge noted that along with economic, political, and security, there was also a constitutional crisis in the country.
He reminded the PPP counsel that eight people had embraced martyrdom just a day earlier.
Justice Bandial noted that the  government and opposition would have to become serious. He added that should the court not ensure implementation of the law and leave the matter to the political parties.
“Should we [judges] turn a blind eye to the public’s interest?” he inquired.
The CJP observed that the government was bound to follow the court’s orders.
He continued that the court was exhibiting restraint but this should not be considered as its weakness.
The top judge maintained that the court would not hesitate from making sacrifices for ensuring the implementation of the law.
He added that the country's troops had made sacrifices and the judges were prepared to do that as well.
At this stage of the proceedings, Barrister Ali Zafar, who was representing the PTI, said his client PTI had agreed on holding polls across the country on the same day, but the only condition was that assemblies should be dissolved by May 14.
He added that the PTI's second condition was that elections should be held by the second week of July.
Zafar continued that the PTI's third condition was that the delay in elections should be legalised through a constitutional amendment.
The PTI lawyer also pointed out that May 14 was only a few days away but the funds for the elections had not been released yet.
Zafar maintained that the government could not file a petition to delay the polls and the points raised by the PPP lawyer were irrelevant.
The CJP told him that Naek had only pointed out the problems being faced in holding the polls.
Zafar said the elections could not be delayed any further because of the doctrine of necessity.
Later, Railways Minister and PML-N leader Khawaja Saad Rafique, while taking the rostrum, said he was not a lawyer and unaware of the etiquettes of speaking in court but he would simply speak the truth.
The minister maintained that the  institutions and political parties did not trust each other.
Rafique claimed that the judiciary had been “unfair” to his party since 2017. However, he added that the PML-N did not seek conflict among institutions, especially when the basic needs of the people remained unmet.
The minister highlighted the importance of transparency in the 90-day demand, in accordance with the Constitution.
He added that in the past, the country had faced disintegration because of the failure to accept the results of the polls.
He stressed the need for fair and democratic processes.
Rafique called for same-day elections across the country, warning of inevitable destruction if polls were held in just one province.
The minister said the assemblies in Sindh and Balochistan were very sensitive, making it difficult to dissolve both of them prematurely just for Punjab.
Rafique expressed gratitude to the PTI for engaging in talks “with an open heart” and suggested that the talks should continue.
He elaborated that complications arose when the court was dragged into political affairs.
The CJP told him that the judiciary was sitting with hands tied because the circumstances were not conducive.
The top judge noted that elections had taken place even during times of major wars.
He added that elections had taken place even during an earthquake in Turkiye.
The CJP told Rafique that it appeared from his words that he did not want to violate the Constitution.
The top judge observed that the remarks made about Punjab were political in nature, but they were not presented in writing to the court.
He continued that only the matters of funds and security were discussed in the court.
The CJP remarked that at the very least, the funds for the elections could have been released and advised that actions must be taken to demonstrate good governance.
The top judge observed that the court was given a briefing on security and then asked if there was any guarantee that the  situation would improve by October 8.
He added that only assumptions were being made about the date of the elections.
Giving his arguments, PTI’s Qureshi said the government, in its report, had not said anything new and only repeated its previous stance.
He added the PTI had tried its best to make the talks successful.
However, he continued that the treasury benches in parliament said things that were equivalent to violating the court’s orders.
The PTI stalwart said his party’s report submitted to the SC on Wednesday included the signatures of all the members of its negotiation team, while the government’s response only included Finance Minister Ishaq Dar’s signatures.
To this, the CJP noted that the government’s report was submitted early morning in the day but the court still conducted a hearing on it.
The CJP observed that the government and PTI had no interest in holding negotiations.
He continued that the court only had to see if both the sides had agreed on a date for elections.
The CJP then inquired if a decision could be reached within two to three days.
Qureshi maintained that the coalition government had sought more time, saying that it comprised 12 parties. “But, [PTI chairman and deposed premier] Imran Khan and everyone else criticised why a gap of three days was given,” he disclosed.
The PTI senior leader said there was also no progress on the IMF deal.
However, the CJP remarked that the matter should not be discussed in court. Qureshi claimed that the country was  being pushed towards a constitutional crisis and urged the court to look into the PTI's stance.
The CJP told him that he had read his party’s stance.
The top judge added that proceedings could continue in the case in connection with holding elections in Punjab on May 14. He added that the government-PTI talks could again be held if both parties were interested.
Qureshi contended that the government was not showing any flexibility, recalling that the PTI had “sacrificed” its governments in Punjab and K-P.
He added that there was always an environment for negotiations.
Howeve, he maintained that the government was just trying to waste time.
The CJP noted that the court would issue an appropriate order, adding that the political parties could continue with the talks if they were interested.
The hearing was later adjourned.

1,Bill on right to appeal in suo motu cases gets Senate’s nod,Legislation passed with 32 votes amid opposition protest,"The Senate on Friday passed the Supreme Court (Review of Judgements and Orders) Bill, 2023 -- pertaining to the right of appeal in suo motu cases --amid the opposition’s uproar, at a time when parliament and the judiciary are engaged in a row with each other.
The bill, which was passed by the National Assembly just a few days ago, was tabled in the upper house of parliament by PML-N’s Irfan Siddiqui. A total of 32 votes were cast in its favour against the 21 that opposed it. The bill was tabled amid opposition by PTI senators.
The opposition party’s senators not only tore copies of the bill but also shouted slogans of “fake bill unacceptable” and “imported government unacceptable” in the House, as they surrounded Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani's dais.

The bill read it was necessary to ensure the fundamental right to justice by providing for a “meaningful review” of the apex court’s judgments and orders in the exercise of the SC’s original jurisdiction as described in Article 184 of the Constitution.
It aims at “facilitating and strengthening” the apex court in exercise of its powers to review judgments and orders by enlarging the review jurisdiction.
It stated that the scope of review on facts and law in case of SC judgments and orders while exercising jurisdiction under Article 184, would be the same as an appeal under Article 185.
Apart from this, it would enable the constitution of a larger bench than the original one for a review petition and grant the right to appoint a lawyer of one’s choice among other things.
Importantly, the new bill will have a retrospective effect and judgments or any orders passed before its enactment can be reviewed.
“The provisions of this Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything contained in any other law, rules or regulations for the time being in force or judgement of any court including the Supreme Court and a high court,” one of its clauses stated.

Another section of the bill read: “The right to file a review petition shall also be available to an aggrieved person against whom an order has been made under Clause (3) of Article 184 of the Constitution, prior to the commencement of this Act, provided that the review petition under this section shall be filed within 60 days of the commencement of the Act.”
Speaking about the bill, Federal Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said it carried four sections, which were in line with Article 188 of the Constitution.
The minister maintained that the bill neither disrespected parliament nor the courts.
He added that the legislation was procedural in nature.
The minister regretted the chaos created by the PTI senators in the House.
He added that this House had a sanctity which needed to be fully respected. He emphasised the need for moving forward in a spirit of patience and tolerance.
Leader of the Opposition Dr Shahzad Waseem claimed that the government was trying to hide behind parliament.
“Stop playing with the Constitution,” he added.
He raised the question that was not parliament supreme when the parties in the current ruling coalition had refused to accept former NA deputy speaker Qasim Suri’s ruling over the no-confidence resolution against PTI chairman and deposed premier Imran Khan.
Taking the floor, Federal Education Minister Rana Tanveer Hussain said the books of O-level carrying objectionable material had been confiscated.
He assured the House that in future A- and O-level books would be properly scrutinised.
The Senate also passed The Private Power and Infrastructure Board Amendment Bill, 2023 and the Kalam Bibi International Women Institute, Bannu Bill 2023.
Finance Minister Ishaq Dar presented a report of the parliamentary committee in connection with examining the amendments proposed by the electoral watchdog to the Elections Act, 2017.
The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had sent a draft of the proposed amendments along with a letter justifying them to the parliamentary affairs ministry last month.
The Senate also passed a resolution expressing deep grief and sorrow over the death of former senator Enver Baig.

2,"Pakistan, China to work for peace","Alvi, Qin discuss bilateral matters","Pakistan and China have reaffirmed their resolve to work together for promoting regional peace and prosperity and for jointly coping with external challenges.
Both the sides emphasised the need to further advance and deepen bilateral cooperation in the areas of trade, economy, culture and defence for the mutual benefit of the two countries.
The two sides also called for increasing bilateral exchanges, people-to-people contacts, and cooperation in the fields of culture and tourism to further cement bilateral ties.
The bilateral matters were discussed at a meeting between President Dr Arif Alvi and the visiting State Councillor and Minister of Foreign Affairs of China Qin Gang, who along with the members of his delegation, called on him, at Aiwan-e-Sadr on Friday.
The meeting was also attended by Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Hina Rabbani Khar, Chinese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Sun Weidong, and senior government officials of Pakistan and China.
Welcoming the foreign minister of China, the president said that Pakistan-China relations were rooted in mutual trust, understanding, goodwill and both sides firmly supported each other on core issues. He highlighted that Pakistan-China mutual cooperation was assuming an even greater significance in the light of new developments taking place in the regional and international arenas.
The president said that Pakistan was committed to the completion of China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and Gwadar port, which would play a significant role in the promotion of bilateral trade, besides enhancing regional trade and connectivity.
He said that Pakistan would take effective measures to ensure the security of the Chinese personnel working on various CPEC projects.
He expressed optimism that the recent opening of Khunjerab Pass would facilitate the movement of goods from Xinjiang to Gwadar and vice versa.
The president emphasised the need to increase economic and commercial cooperation, particularly in the IT and agriculture sectors, adding that Chinese investors should benefit from Pakistan’s business and investment-friendly policies.
The president expressed concern over the planned holding of G-20 Summit events by India in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) and termed it an attempt on the part of India to divert the world’s attention away from the ground realities and its atrocities against the people of IIOJK. He said that Pakistan supported China on all its core issues, including the “One-China policy”, Taiwan, Tibet, Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and the South China Sea.
He also appreciated the support provided by China during last year’s unprecedented floods in Pakistan and the COVID-19 pandemic.
The State Councillor and Foreign Minister of China Qin Gang, said that China and Pakistan were all-weather friends and the friendship between the two countries was “as solid as a rock”.
He stated that in view of the fast-changing world, Pakistan and China needed to further fortify and strengthen bilateral cooperation to meet the emerging regional and international challenges. He called for advancing cooperation in all areas of mutual interest, especially on projects of strategic importance.
Qin Gang stated that China was cognizant of Pakistan’s economic difficulties, saying that it was the priority of his country to help Pakistan. He said that China would welcome Pakistani students to study in Chinese educational institutions.
He also thanked the President of Pakistan for visiting China in March 2020 to show solidarity with the people and government of China during the COVID-19 pandemic.

3,No India talks until IIOJK status revised: FM,Bilawal says onus on New Delhi to create conducive environment," 
Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari on Friday said that there would be no bilateral dialogue with India until New Delhi reversed its decision of revoking the special status of the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK).
Addressing a news conference at the Karachi Airport soon after his return from Goa, Bilawal said his visit to the neighbouring country was successful as he presented Pakistan’s narrative and negated anti-Pakistan propaganda.
Bilawal went to the Indian coastal resort city on Thursday to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Council of Foreign Minister (SCO-CFM). He addressed the gathering of the top diplomats from the eight-nation bloc on Friday.
Despite the restriction on discussing disputed issues between India and Pakistan, Bilawal said, he succeeded in presenting Pakistani narrative at the CFM and negated propaganda against Pakistan in his interactions with the Indian media.
“BJP and RSS [Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and Bharatiya Janata Party] want to declare not only every Pakistani, but every Muslim, including me, as terrorist,” the foreign minister told reporters. “For them, all Muslims are terrorists,” he added.
Bilawal wondered that not a single Muslim BJP representative was elected to both the upper and lower houses of India. In Pakistan, he said, “we not only allot tickets to our Hindu candidates to contest in general elections, but we also induct them into cabinet”.
During the SCO-CFM, Bilawal said, he clearly conveyed Pakistan’s narrative as to how the BJP-led Indian government violated the international laws, conventions and UN Security Council resolutions by taking unilateral actions on Kashmir.
“During the visit, I got the opportunity to interact with the Indian media and present our case and negated the propaganda against Pakistan. Overall, I succeeded in present our case before the participants,” he added.
Reiterating that India’s unilateral action on August 5, 2019, gave a “new birth” to the Kashmir cause, the foreign minister warned that there would be no meaningful breakthrough until India undid its 2019 decision.
Bilawal belittled Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar’s remarks against Pakistan. He said that his Indian counterpart spoke out of his insecurity that “they feel because of violating the international laws”.
The Indian minister, he added, believed in fake propaganda when it came to terrorism. “The whole world has witnessed how we have paid the price, while waging the war against terrorism. We have suffered more than any country in the world,” he said. “India want to declare Pakistan a terrorist state, but its nefarious designs will be foiled.”
When asked about the head money put on his head by a BJP leader, the foreign minister said that political parties “don’t behave like this and it must be widely condemned” and added that democratic approach must prevail now.
""After the invitation for the SCO meeting, I decided to go there in order to fight for Pakistan’s cause in the land of India,"" he said, adding that he interacted with other SCO members on regional issues, including Kashmir.
Taking about the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project, Bilawal said that the SCO members, including Russia and the Central Asians States (CAS) appreciated it and expressed their willingness to become part of it.
Concluding his presser, Bilawal said that he would hold talks with the foreign ministers of China and Afghanistan in Islamabad on Saturday. Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah and information Sharjeel Inam Memon were also present on the occasion.
Onus on India
Bilawal, who is also chairman of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), expressed similar views while interacting with the media in India after the SCO-CFM. He said that the PPP always advocated normalisation of ties with India but vitiated the environment in 2019.
Bilawal linked any change in Pakistan’s India policy to the reversal of unilateral and illegal actions of August 5, 2019, and said that onus was now on India to build a conducive environment for talks.
“The unilateral actions of August 5, 2019, have not only violated international laws and the United Nations Security Council’s resolutions but also the bilateral agreements,” he added. “This violation has created a trust deficit as India could also unilaterally violate the bilateral agreements in the future, too.”
Asked about the Indian decision of hosting the G-20 meeting in IIOJK, the foreign minister replied: “Obviously, we condemn it and at the time, we will give such a response that will be remembered.” He also said India would soon find that “they will be unable to achieve 110% attendance because other people will not compromise on their morals”.
He said: “It is a show of Indian arrogance to the world that to hell with the international law, to hell with the United Nations Security Council resolutions, to hell with any bilateral agreements, India will hold their event in Kashmir.”
He told the media that in 2026, Pakistan would be holding the CFM chair, and hoped that India would take a good step to participate in the summit on the basis of “reciprocal diplomatic agreements”.
He said most of the people in both India and Pakistan wanted to live in peace and achieve development without being held hostage to history.
The foreign minister appreciated his Indian counterpart for fulfilling his responsibilities as the CFM chair and also lauded the CFM management and cultural show, which represented all member states.
Regarding Indian demand for a neutral venue for Asia Cup 2023, the minister said, “I believe we shouldn’t hold sports hostage to politics or foreign policy and the purpose of sports is that you keep it away from such issues … The hope is that a petty action won’t be taken and we should keep our sportsmen and cricket separate from politics and foreign policy.”
