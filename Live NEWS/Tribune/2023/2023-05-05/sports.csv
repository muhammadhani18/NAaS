He said his son-in-law Usman's father Shahbaz and mother Shamim had verbally abused his daughter. 
""On Thursday, they allegedly set Sadia on fire in their home and told us that she was working in the kitchen and her clothes had caught fire,"" the complainant stated.
However, his daughter told him that her husband along with his parents had tried to kill her by setting her on fire. 
The victim was taken to the Allied Hospital in a state of unconsciousness, where the doctors termed her condition precarious.
Batala Colony police registered a case against the three suspects under sections 324, 436 and 34 of Pakistan Penal Code. The parents of Sadia protested along with their relatives by blocking a road at the District Council Chowk and demanded that the suspects be arrested and punished.

2,Projects to conserve Derawar Fort underway,Medieval forts of Cholistan comprises group of around dozen structures,"Pakistan's most beautiful and iconic monument standing tall in the vast landscape of the Cholistan desert has been decaying for a long time. However, the provincial government is making all-out efforts to conserve it part by part, and two projects worth Rs161 million to conserve its façade, besides conserving the residence of the late Nawab of Bahawalpur and his office, are underway.
The medieval forts of the Cholistan desert are a group of around a dozen structures, some standing and some deteriorated. But the Derawar Fort is the best surviving example of this series of historic forts, some dating from pre-Mughal times, but all restored and expanded from the 16th to 18th century by powerful local clans, according to the Unesco World Heritage Convention website. 
Other forts from north to south include Meergarh, Jaangarh, Marotgarh, Maujgarh, Dingarh, Khangarh, Khairgarh, Bijnotgarh, and Islamgarh. These forts form a network across the desert landscape and serve to protect and enable the desert caravan routes as well as mercantile routes from Central Asia to the heartland of the subcontinent. 
The in charge of the Archaeology Department of Bahawalpur, Muhammad Sajjad, who also holds the additional charge of the Archaeology Department of Multan, said that conserving the whole Derawar Fort, a stunning architectural masterpiece from the past, was a gigantic task involving huge funding. However, he added, the Punjab government had launched a Rs41 million project in 2017-18 to conserve and restore its front face encompassing its main gate, the wall and buttresses on both sides of the gate. So far around Rs10 million had been spent, he said, adding that work on the project had faced suspension due to problems like Covid-19 and other issues. However, fresh funding had been received, and work resumed.

3,ACE official apologises in Elahi raid case,Document error blamed for action despite bail,"Punjab Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) Additional Director General Waqasul Hassan, who had led a raid to arrest former chief minister Pervaiz Elahi from home, has tendered public apology after facing charges of contempt of court.
Speaking to the media at the ACE headquarters on Thursday, the official said a writ petition had been filed before the court of LHC Justice Tariq Saleem Sheikh, claiming that he had passed comments about the high court or its orders that were tantamount to contempt of court. 
He said that he publicly tendered an apology. However, he said he was not apologising because the ACE staff had gone to arrest Pervaiz Elahi, but because he had passed the comments. 
He apologised to ‘everyone’ for the comments. The Lahore High Court (LHC) had issued directions to the additional DG and other officials of the ACE and Punjab Police to submit a written apology by Friday over the matter of the raid at the former chief minister’s residence despite a protective bail granted to him.
LHC Justice Tariq Sheikh had come down hard on Waqasul Hassan on Wednesday, warning him that he “will not be spared if contempt is established on [his] part” in former Punjab chief minister Pervaiz Elahi’s attempted arrest case. Justice Sheikh was hearing a plea filed by Elahi, seeking initiation of contempt proceedings against ACE officials and the police high-ups for conducting the raid at his Lahore residence despite being granted protective bail in the case.
Replies were submitted on behalf of the respondents, Punjab ACE Director General Sohail Zafar Chatha, Additional DG Waqasul Hassan, SSP Operations Sohaib Ashraf and Model Town SP Ammara Shirazi.
A law officer told the court that there had been confusion regarding the raid process, as the bail had been granted to petitioner Pervaiz Elahi regarding FIR number six of 2023 but the record available with the ACE team had mistakenly mentioned FIR 7/2023.
Justice Sheikh observed that there were two points in the case, one about a mistake as per the ACE officials’ stance and the second about the remarks that the additional DG had passed against the court during the raid. “This court has summoned him in person in connection to his remarks,” the judge observed. 
“Sir, neither I committed any contempt of court nor cloud I even think about it,” Hassan told the judge.
The LHC justice then sought the arrest warrant of Pervaiz Elahi that the ACE team had take along with them during the raid. But the law officer parried the question and was unable to produce the warrant. Meanwhile, the petitioner’s counsel Advocate Amir Saeed Rawn showed a video clip on his mobile phone wherein Hassan could be heard commenting about the rist of facing contempt charges.
The anti-corruption official had reportedly made the remarks during the raid at the former CM’s residence when he was informed that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader had been granted bail in the case in which the ACE team wanted to arrest him.
“The anti-corruption official is ready to tender an unconditional apology if this court believes this is a matter of contempt of court,” he maintained.
When Justice Sheikh said no replies had yet been submitted to the court, the law officer said all replies were in his hands “but there are some mistakes in them”. 
He said he wanted to submit the replies after vetting them thoroughly.

4,Buzdar ordered to join investigation or face plea dismissal,"Court had restrained ACE, police from arresting ex-CM until May 4","The Lahore High Court's Justice Tariq Saleem Sheikh has ordered former chief minister, Sardar Usman Buzdar, to join an investigation, with a clear warning that his petition will be dismissed if he fails to comply. However, Justice Tariq rejected the law officer's request to withdraw the court's earlier order of not arresting Buzdar, and extended the stay on his arrest until May 5.
During the proceedings, Buzdar's counsel, Barrister Momin Malik, argued about the differences between the NAB's recently amended Act and Anti-Corruption Laws, shedding light on how the investigation is regulated in the NAB laws and how anti-corruption investigation rules are outdated and silent over the conversion of inquiries into FIRs.
He further argued that the petitioner and others are summoned to face inquiries, and when they appear before anti-corruption, they are confronted with ghost FIRs and arrested without any opportunity to defend themselves, which is contrary to Article 10-A of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan 1973, as introduced through the 18th amendment to the Constitution.
In earlier proceedings, the court had restrained the Anti-Corruption Establishment Punjab and Inspector General Police (IGP) Punjab from arresting Buzdar until May 4, on his plea seeking details of the FIRs registered against him anywhere in Punjab.
During those proceedings, Barrister Momin argued that his client is being subjected to political victimization following his association with Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), merely on the behest of the aforementioned respondents.
He submitted that respondents initiated various frivolous and politically motivated inquiries and investigations and converted them into ""ghost FIRs"" without notifying his client, merely to arrest him, in violation of the due process of law.

5,PINS to offer paediatric neurosurgery facilities,PINS to offer paediatric neurosurgery facilities,"Provincial Caretaker Health Minister Dr Javed Akram has announced that treatment for children suffering from congenital brain diseases will soon be available at PINS.
He made the statement at the inaugural ceremony for the Paediatric Neurosurgery Department at Punjab Institute of Neurosciences (PINS) on Thursday.
Dr Akram expressed his happiness about the establishment of the department, saying that doctors should serve their patients regardless of their caste, religion, colour, or race. He noted that in the past, senior politician Javed Hashmi had been provided with the best treatment facilities in the case of a stroke.
Dr Akram added that brain surgery for children in Punjab was once a dream, but it has now become a reality.
Patients from Iran and Afghanistan also come to PINS for brain surgery. Speaking about brain injuries, he said that it is highly irresponsible for parents to give motorcycles to young children and send them on the road. This behaviour can cause life-long disabilities for innocent children.
After the ceremony, Dr Akram visited various wards at PINS and asked patients about the quality of medical care they were receiving.
PINS Executive Director Dr Khalid Mahmood said the hospital provides international level medical facilities to all patients and serves them through 500 beds.

6,Victims’ family blame police for stagging ‘fake encounter’,Protest staged against the incident due to which the Shakar Dara Road remained closed for several hours,"Relatives of the three people who had been killed within the limits of the Bangikhel Police Station the other day held a press conference at a hotel in Kalabagh on Thursday and accused the police of killing the three innocent people. 
Arif Khan, one of the relatives of the deceased, alleged the police shot and killed the three people, two of whom were teenagers from Mutukhel village. 
He alleged that there was no police encounter, and that the police “killed the innocent people on the basis of wrong information, just like in the Sahiwal tragedy”. 
Two brothers were among the deceased.
Arif Khan recalled that Aamir Sohail had been riding the motorcycle while his two cousins, Ansar and Safarullah, who had been brothers, were traveling as pillions. 
Ansar was a student of Class X while Safarullah Khan of Class IX. 
Arif Khan demanded of the higher authorities to order a judicial inquiry into the incident. 
Meanwhile, a protest demonstration was staged against the incident due to which the Shakar Dara Road remained closed for several hours.
Moreover, the Deputy General Secretary of the Jamaat-e-Islami of North Punjab, Abdul Wahab Khan Niazi, demanded of the IGP to order a transparent investigation. 
According to the FIR, the SHO of Bangikhel, Inspector Nasir Aziz Khan, along with a team of the Elite Force under the command of Sub-Inspector Fayaz Ahmed, had set up a barricade. 
In the meantime, proclaimed offenders Shakeel, Zeeshan, Shiraz and others appeared, riding on motorcycles, said the FIR. 
As soon as the proclaimed offenders spotted the police team, they dismounted from their motorcycles, took positions and opened fire on the police team.
Right at the very moment, the three relatives happened to pass by on their motorcycle having no inkling of the danger they had been moving into. Getting caught in the crossfire, they sustained serious gunshot wounds, said the FIR.
This was the version of the FIR lodged by the police themselves, but people of the area had accused police of mishandling the matter. They had alleged that police mistook the three people as the proclaimed offenders and shot them dead.
The deceased had been on their way home after doing some shopping at the Shakardara Bazaar.

7,"Fears grow over health of rhinoceros, hippopotamus","Isolation, illness has led to the premature death of numerous endangered wildlife at Lahore Zoo before","As the animal’s rights discourse gains popularity in Pakistan given the unfortunate death of elephant Noor Jehan, the deplorable living conditions of a rhinoceros and hippopotamus at Lahore Zoo has triggered a new debate about the dearth of facilities at animal enclosures in the country.
Following the passing of Noor Jehan in Karachi Zoo, animal rights advocates, from the state and the civil society, have come forth to highlight the loopholes and systemic inadequacies of zoos across the country, which are neither able to mimic the natural habitat of the mammals nor provide them with the required nutrition.
“Sadly, the mammals in our zoos are kept in an unfamiliar environment, in terms of their enclosures and diets, and are also handled by untrained zookeepers, leading many towards an early death,” regretted Ghazanfar Ali Langah, wildlife expert and former deputy director of Punjab Wildlife.
Langah’s claims are supported by the fact that Suzi, the only elephant of Lahore Zoo passed away in 2017 at the age of 31, whereas a female rhinoceros and male hippopotamus, passed away prematurely in between 2014 and 2015.
It is pertinent to mention that the Lal Suhanra National Park in Bahawalpur had also brought in a pair of male and female rhinoceros, only to witness them breathing their last in 2019.
Even though the deceased hippopotamus and rhinoceros at Lahore Zoo have been survived by their mates, the extreme level of isolation and the poor living conditions, have left the lives of the only hippopotamus in the province and the only African rhinoceros in the country, on thin ice.
When quizzed about the probable cause behind the high mortality rate of the wildlife mammals, Dr Zulfiqar Ali, wildlife biologist and Head of Department of the Punjab University’s Zoology Department said, “wild animals like elephants, rhinoceros and hippopotamus move around in groups in their natural environment in the jungle. 
When they are kept in suboptimal conditions in zoos, where they are isolated and restricted in their movement, they can easily become depressed and develop health issues.”
Dr Zulfiqar further attributed the death of the large animals in zoos to the lack of modern medical facilities, which prevent regular health check-ups and scans for ailing animals.
While Dr Zulfikar’s assertion might be descriptive of the on-round reality for zoos across the country, Kiran Salim, Deputy Director of Lahore Zoo, believes that it does not apply to Lahore Zoo.
“Every three months, we take blood samples from big cats like lions and tigers and also schedule private X-ray scans on an ad hoc basis,” claimed Kiran. However, the Deputy Director conceded that the facilities did not exist for the endangered hippopotamus and rhinoceros.
Despite Kiran’s admission, speaking to The Express Tribune on the future of zoos in the country, a wildlife expert opined, “while it would be unfair to demand a complete elimination of zoos from the country, given that they are a major source of entertainment for many families, crucial changes and advancements are utterly important in order to protect endangered species.”
