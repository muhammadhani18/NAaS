3,Karachi Airport missing thermal temperature guns,The infrared thermometers purchased during the coronavirus outbreak were never returned,"Ever since two patients with monkeypox were identified in Islamabad, fears over a potential outbreak have grown, which has led to a declaration of public health emergency in Karachi and a scurry at the city’s airport to find temperature guns, which were bought during the coronavirus outbreak.
The ensuing panic over the realisation that there are no thermal temperature guns at the country’s busiest international and domestic airport, is justified given the fact that the equipment was purchased merely 2 years ago.
As per data obtained by The Express Tribune from the provincial health department, back in March of 2020, the then Director General Health, Dr Mubeen Memon, had purchased 900 thermal temperature guns for Karachi. 150 went to District Central, 150 to District East, 150 to District West, 150 to District South, 150 to Korangi District, and 150 to Malir District. Out of the 150 infrared thermometers given to District Malir, 15 were sent to the staff of Karachi Airport.
Presently, not only are the 15 sent to the airport missing but there seems to be no record of all 900 infrared thermometers. Sources at the DG Health’s office confided to The Express Tribune that none of the temperature guns were returned once Covid-19 protocols were lifted.
The Express Tribune also learnt that the procurement of the thermometers was done on an emergency basis given the gravity of the coronavirus outbreak and thus public procurement rules were not followed; hence, there is no record of how much was spent on buying the temperature guns.
However, according to various pharmaceutical vendors, thermal temperature guns were retailing for up to Rs4,000 in 2020, which makes it likely upwards of Rs3 million was spent on procuring the thermometers.
Nevertheless, given the predicament that the provincial health department finds itself in, The Express Tribune asked officials of the department regarding procuring new equipment, and it was learnt that the department would now follow public procurement rules to buy new temperature guns.
In the meanwhile, officials of the federal Ministry of Health posted at the Karachi Airport, told The Express Tribune under condition of anonymity, that they were presently relying on scanners to check for fever symptoms associated with the monkeypox diseases. Similarly, officials of the provincial health department at the airport told The Express Tribune that the department had only recently provided them with protective clothing and gloves but had not disclosed anything about the infrared thermometers.

5,Marginalised communities unaware of their rights,HR laws need to be implemented in letter and spirit,"Rights activists have raised concerns that marginalised communities are not aware of the laws designed to protect their rights, and that the existing human rights laws need to be implemented in both letter and spirit.
At a recent event in Karachi, speakers discussed various issues, including political empowerment, the electoral process, and the role of government departments in protecting the rights of marginalised communities. The event was organised by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP).
Sindh Human Rights Commission (SHRC) Chairperson Iqbal Ahmed Detho stated that political participation goes beyond the right to vote.
He urged the government to take serious steps to implement laws meant to protect the rights of marginalised communities, highlighting the lack of an explanation in the Hindu Marriage Act as to who has the power to formalise Hindu marital unions.
Rights activist Anis Haroon claimed that Pakistan is an over-legislated society, but issues arise due to non-implementation of laws, and parliamentarians need to take a leading role in ensuring implementation. She also suggested that the term ""religious minorities"" marginalises communities and that they prefer to be addressed as citizens from other religions.
Tanzila Umi Habiba, Special Assistant for Information Technology to the Chief Minister, highlighted the lack of representation for the Sheedi community on public forums, stating that they are neither considered part of the majority nor a minority, despite being Muslims. 
Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan MPA Rana Ansar suggested that women politicians should work to overcome marginalisation, and that the transgender community should register themselves in a digital census to ensure their representation.
Shahzadi Rai, a leader of the transgender community, discussed the community's struggle for electoral rights, noting that the PPP recently held a press conference in support of the rights of transgender people, which was the first time any political party extended support. Rai also highlighted an organised hate campaign against the transgender community, which led to the death of 70 transgender people and the marginalisation of the community.
