0,Alvi for implementing disability job quota,The president said that disability quota should be implemented as per its actual spirit,"President Dr Arif Alvi called for the implementation of the disability quota for persons with disabilities (PWDs) in public and private sector jobs to make them financially independent.
The president, in a follow-up meeting on a framework for the classification of disabilities, at Aiwan-e-Sadr on Thursday said that almost 12-14% of Pakistan’s population suffered from some form of disability and the government and private sector needed to provide them employment for their financial empowerment.
The meeting was attended by senior officials of the Ministry of Human Rights and the government of Pakistan.
The president said that disability quota should be implemented as per its actual spirit, adding that chambers of commerce and industries, banks, multi-national corporations, trade bodies, and other private sector organisations needed to employ differently-abled people (DAPs) as per their skill sets and nature of disabilities.
He said that Pakistan must focus on providing DAPs with skill-based education to help them secure jobs and ensure their inclusion in mainstream socio-economic activities.
President Alvi highlighted the need to develop close coordination among relevant stakeholders to impart skills to PWDs as per their special needs as well as market requirements. He underscored that training institutions and relevant government organisations should accelerate their efforts to equip PWDs with marketable skills and link them with potential employers in the private sector to provide them with suitable jobs per their skills and quota.

2,Exhibition sheds light on role of women in peace-building,Students produce paintings calling for peace in society,"A one-day painting exhibition titled 'Uks-e-Aman' was organised by PeaceFlix in collaboration with the Pakistan National Council of the Arts (PNCA) and the Women Journalist Association of Pakistan on Thursday.
Uks-e-Aman is a peace-building activity organised by peace-builder Asma Bashir Kundi as a member of the PeaceFlix initiative by Global Neighborhood for Media Innovation (GNMI). The programme is designed to promote peace, inclusivity and social cohesion in local capacities. The programme's core objective was to create discourse around women's role in peace-building in Pakistan and around the globe.
In the first phase of the project, female journalists from across Pakistan, who have covered war, conflict and violence in the field of journalism, shared stories they covered with art students. Art students were selected from various art institutions, including the Fatima Jinnah University Rawalpindi, the Quaid-e-Azam University Islamabad and Islamabad Model College for Girls Korang Town. The brilliant students painted the shared stories on canvas.
As many as 17 art students participated in the project activity and produced 16 paintings and a 3-D project to represent the stories highlighting the need and ways for peace in society.
PNCA Director General Ayoub Jamali said that the basis of peace was trust. “The foundation of trust is transparency, and the base of transparency is shared inner experience. Art is a powerful tool for expressing inner expertise to build trust and peace,” he said.
He added that the PNCA has supported promoting exhibitions and the best modern and contemporary art nationally and internationally.
A painting by Roshan Bakht, titled 'Carving Fate', drew visitors' attention. The painting represented a story of a street boy named Noman Khan from Peshawar who worked as a servant while he joined free art academy and successfully made his art career. Khan changed his fate through hard work and exhibited his paintings at 16.
The story was done by a woman journalist from Peshawar, Fatima Nazish. Bakht said, ""Through this opportunity, I learned a lot about painting techniques. As an artist, I believe my primary duty is to promote peace through my artwork.

“There is an urgent need for afforestation on all the government land which is lying vacant,” he added.
He continued by saying that the Punjab Forest Department has chosen to establish one large Miyawaki forest in all 23 tehsils of the Rawalpindi Division in light of these directives.
“It will be a one-year short-term programme under which all major land owners across the division will be offered the opportunity to carry out plantation of local fruit trees on vacant and barren lands,” he explained.
