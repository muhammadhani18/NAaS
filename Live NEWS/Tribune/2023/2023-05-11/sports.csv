3,Markets shut down amid protests,Protesters blocked District Council Chowk by staging a sit-in,"Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) workers in Faisalabad blocked roads in many areas of the city on the day after PTI Chairman Imran Khan's arrest. Eight marketplaces around the city were forcibly closed, as police failed to implement sufficient security measures in any of them.
Former MNA Faizullah Kamuka, Sheikh Khurram Shehzad, Azad Kastro, Javed Niaz Manj, Shabbir Advocate, Khalid Advocate and other PTI workers and supporters blocked the road in District Council Chowk while staging a sit-in protesting the arrest of the former PM on Wednesday.
Several rioters also blocked the road in Kachehri Bazaar Chowk and circled all eight marketplaces while brandishing sticks, coercing traders to close their shops. As soon as the demonstrators left the markets, shopkeepers re-opened their businesses.
Furthermore, the workers demonstrated by blocking Samundri Road and Millat Chowk and chanting anti-government slogans, seemingly in the face of little resistance from police and riot control squads. Senior police officers performed their duties, but other police personnel avoided the protesters for their own safety.
Police claimed that a former PTI MNA, an ex-MPA, former president of the District Bar and an ex-Secretary of the PTI, allegedly blocked roads, chanted anti-government slogans and caused unrest, injuring 23 government officials, including two DSPs and two SHOs.
In response to their actions, police registered seven cases against over 800 PTI leaders and workers, including former Vice Chairman of WASA. The charges against them include terrorism, arson of government property and residences, interference in government business and the vandalism of government vehicles. The police have arrested over 100 suspects, including three women and detained them in Civil Lines and People's Colony police stations.
According to the case filed on the complaint of SHO Civil Line Abdul Jabbar, the protesters' actions are reportedly a reaction to the arrest of PTI Imran Khan by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) in the Al-Qadir Trust corruption case. Former PTI MNA Faizullah Kamuka, ex-Secretary Bar Khurram Ejaz Kahlon, ex-President Bar Bilal Ashraf and others, including Kashif Pathan, former MPA Dr Asad Muazzam, Malik Jahanzeb aka Zebi, Ayaz Tareen Khan, Rana Asad Mahmood, former MPA Firdous Rai, former MPA Latif Nazar Gujjar and others gathered in District Council Chowk. 
Armed with sticks and rods, they allegedly blocked the road, causing traffic jams and hindering ambulances and other emergency vehicles.

4,Plea filed for restoration of internet service,"Petitioner maintains blockage was arbitrary, illegal and unconstitutional","A writ petition has been filed in the Lahore High Court (LHC) seeking directions to the relevant authorities for the restoration of cellular internet service and the resumption of operation of all social media platforms. 
The court is requested to declare the imposed blockage as arbitrary, illegal, unlawful, and unconstitutional, as it amounts to depriving the public of their basic rights. 
The petition was filed by Abuzar Salman Khan Niazi, the petitioner, naming the Federation of Pakistan through the Secretary of the Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication, Pakistan Telecomm-unication through its Chairman, CM Pak Limited through its CEO, Pakistan Telecom Mobile Limited, and others as respondents. 
The petitioner argues in the petition that on May 9, the Chairman of the PTI and former Prime Minister, Imran Khan, was arrested, following which widespread protests erupted across the country and the internet service was blocked. 
He pleads with the court, stating that it is a well-settled principle of law that access to information on matters of public importance is the foundation of a representative democracy and the accountability of elected representatives. The superior judiciary of Pakistan has upheld the principle of maximum disclosure by asserting that ""as a rule, information should be disclosed, and claiming privilege should be an exception based on justifiable grounds."" 
The petitioner argues that the Supreme Court of Pakistan has emphasized that access to information is a justiciable right of the people and has further stressed that all information of public importance should be made available to the general public.
