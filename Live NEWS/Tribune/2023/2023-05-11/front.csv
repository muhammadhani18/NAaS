0,Pakistan slams India’s decision on G20 meetings,Ambassador Akram says these stage-managed events are designed to project false normalcy in occupied Jammu and Kashmir,"Pakistan has strongly protested India’s decision to hold Group of 20 meetings in the UN-recognised disputed territory of Jammu and Kashmir later this month, and urged New Delhi not to misuse its position as chair of the body of world’s largest economies to “advance their own national agenda”.
“These stage-managed events are designed to project a false normalcy in occupied Jammu and Kashmir,” Ambassador Munir Akram told a meeting of the Group of 77, which now has 134 members and is the United Nations’ biggest intergovernmental group of emerging countries.
India currently holds the rotating year-long presidency of the G20 and is set to host a leaders’ summit in New Delhi in early September.
The Wednesday’s meeting was convened to have India’s UN Ambassador Ruchira Kamboj viewpoint about the agenda of a series of meetings leading up to the summit, which included G20 and Youth 20 meetings in Srinagar and in Leh, in the neighbouring region of Ladakh.

“In this context,” Ambassador Akram said, “Pakistan is obliged to register its strong protest at India’s decision to hold one or more G20 meetings in the UN-recognised disputed territory of Jammu and Kashmir, which India occupies in contravention of UN Security Council resolutions and where the right of self-determination of the Kashmiri people, and other fundamental rights, are being suppressed by an occupation force of 900,000 Indian troops”.
The Pakistani envoy reminded delegates of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, and over a dozen Special Rapporteurs of the Human Rights Council, having asked India for access to Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir to investigate reports of gross violations of human rights.
“Instead of inviting G20 delegations,” Ambassador Akram added, “India should accede to the request of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, and the dozen or more human rights Special Rapporteurs, and invite them to occupied Kashmir, provide them unhindered access to the territory and its people and thus enable them to observe and report on the reality of the massive oppression in Indian occupied Jammu & Kashmir.”
Reacting to the Pakistani envoy’s statement, India’s Ambassador said her country’s position on Kashmir was well known.

1,FM says PPP against banning of any political party,"Bilawal urges end to violent protests, asks PTI to 'not make matters worse', says ideologically opposed to NAB","Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari on Thursday urged the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) to end its ""violent protests” and decide whether it wanted to function as a political party or as a terrorist organisation.
Bilwal, also the chairman of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), made it clear that his party was neither jubilant over the arrest of any politician, nor did it support the banning of any political party.

Bilawal was referring to the violent protests by the PTI supporters since the arrest of party Chairman Imran Khan on Tuesday. During the violence, several public and private properties, including some sensitive installations, were damaged or destroyed.
“As far as I remember, one attack on the GHQ (General Headquarters of the army) was carried out by the banned TTP (Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan) and now by the PTI,” the foreign minister told the media.
“Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah's house in Balochistan was attacked by the banned BLA (Baloch Liberation Army) and now another attack was carried out by PTI on the Jinnah House in Lahore,” he added.
Urging the PTI to end its ""violent protests”, the foreign minister emphasised that the party would have to “decide whether it wants to function as a political party or as a terrorist organisation”.
He also asked the PTI ""not to make matters worse"".
Bilawal said that the PPP did not celebrate anyone's arrest, “because when a politician is arrested, the entire politics is affected”.
He also said that in principle, he was opposed to the ban on any political party.
However, emphasised that ""such decisions are taken” keeping in view the prevailing circumstances.
""If such a decision is taken,"" he continued, ""it would be taken because there would be no other choice left”.
Speaking about the charges against the PTI chairman, he stated that the allegations of corruption against Imran were of a serious nature.
He added that the former prime minister deceived his cabinet colleagues to get approval of the money received from the UK.

“The amount of £190 million was Pakistan's money, it was the money of the people of Sindh, which should have been returned to the people. But Imran Khan forced approval from the cabinet for Al-Qadir Trust,” he said.
The PPP chairman said that from the beginning, his party stood against the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) but it was the former government of Imran that always defended the graft buster.
The abolition of NAB was part of the Charter of Democracy “but at that time, Imran Khan called it collusion”, he said. “The more the Peoples Party opposed NAB, the more the PTI supported NAB,” he added.
Bilawal also mentioned that NAB reforms was the demand of all the parties, which were in the opposition at that time, but Imran Khan “accused us of seeking the NRO” – a reference to the political amnesty given by then military ruler Pervez Musharraf in 2007.
The PPP chairman emphasised that now when the establishment wanted to remain neutral, an opportunity had presented itself to all political parties to work within the political sphere. “Otherwise what happened in the past, may happen again.”
While thanking the people for giving historic victory to the PPP in the local bodies elections in Sindh, Bilawal said that the politics of hatred and division had been buried forever. He added that the party would celebrate the victory in Karachi on May 13.
Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah and provincial Information Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon were also present on this occasion.
Meanwhile, addressing the closing session of a two-day international convention to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Constitution, Bilawal urged political parties to work together to safeguard the Constitution to ensure freedom of the nation and democracy.
He said the country did not define itself by the challenges it faced but by the way how the challenges were surmounted. “The nation saw abrogation of the Constitution by dictators, but the people resisted every single usurper and dictator,” he added.
He credited the masses for the restoration of democracy and the Constitution, saying that that the people had faced all forms of dictatorship and defeated them. He said his party faced the worst form of suppression but never transcended the constitutional limits.
“People of Pakistan have faced every dictator heads on. I believe that they will confront every dictator and suppressor again. We all must act together to protect the Constitution and have a firm belief in the parliamentarians and the people for preserving it.”

2,Imran’s ‘unlawful’ arrest overturned,Top court declares PTI chief arrest from IHC premises illegal; former PM to appear before IHC today,"The top court on Thursday came to the rescue of former prime minister Imran Khan as it declared his arrest by the country's top graft-buster from the premises of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) illegal and directed immediate release of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief.
Dozens of troops of paramilitary Rangers on Tuesday broke into an office of the IHC and whisked Imran Khan away in an armoured vehicle in a whirlwind raid while executing the arrest warrant issued against the former premier by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) in the Al-Qadir Trust case.
IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq later in the same day issued contempt notices to the secretary interior and Islamabad Inspector general police (IGP) over the manner in which the arrest had been carried out but termed the arrest legal.
While violent protests erupted across the country after the development—protests that involved attacks on security personnel and arson of military and civil properties, the PTI on Wednesday approached the Supreme Court against Imran’s arrest.
The SC registrar at first returned the PTI’s appeal, raising objections to it but allotted it a number on Wednesday night and on Thursday a three-judge bench led by Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial and comprising Justice Athar Minallah and Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar took up the plea for hearing.
As the proceedings started, Imran’s counsel Hamid Khan told the bench that the PTI chief was getting his biometric verification done for bail in the NAB case when Rangers personnel barged into the office. “Getting biometrics is part of the judicial process,” he said.
When Justice Minallah asked Khan if a bail application is filed before biometrics, Hamid Khan said a bail application cannot be filed without biometrics.
Justice Minallah noted that the important thing was that Imran Khan had entered the court premises and was in the process of filing an application to get pre-arrest bail in the case.  “Can the right of access to justice be waived? Can a person be deprived of the right to justice?” he asked.
“It is a matter of respect for the judiciary,” Justice Bandial said. Referring to another case, he said NAB had earlier arrested an accused from the Supreme Court parking lot.
“The court had later taken action against the NAB chief and NAB had assured the court that such action would not take place in the future,” he said.
Addressing the advocate general Islamabad, Justice Athar Minallah said it was difficult to defend the arrest. “Wouldn't it be appropriate to restore people's confidence in the judiciary? Would it not be appropriate to let the court [IHC] decide on Imran Khan's bail application?” he asked.
Justice Minallah said a lot had happened in the country and it was about time to establish the rule of law now. Defending the NAB action, the AG said it was not possible to arrest Imran Khan from any other place. Imran Khan calls thousands of people to thwart the possibility of arrests, he said.
The bench later asked NAB to present Imran Khan in the court in one hour. “PTI workers will not be allowed to come to the court,” the CJP added.
Attorney General of Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Awan told the bench that an accountability court had already remanded the PTI chief in NAB’s custody.
However, Justice Minallah said if the foundation of a case is illegal then a building cannot be built on it. “Time has come to set an example for the future,” he said.
When Imran Khan entered the courtroom amid heightened security after a lapse of more than one hour, the CJP welcomed him.
“You must have known about the violent protests?” the CJP asked Imran.
“This may be part of the political process but peace has to be restored. If peace is restored, the constitutional machinery will be able to function.
“The court wants you to condemn the violent protests. The court is there to protect every citizen. The state will be able to run only when there is peace,” Justice Bandial said.
He said it is alleged that the PTI workers came onto the streets and created chaos. “Will you issue a statement condemning this violence?” he asked Imran.
“No public or private property should be damaged. We are a poor country and everyone suffers when something is destroyed,” the CJP noted.
Imran Khan said how could someone who wants elections create chaos.
“I always tell people not to resort to violence. On May 25, 2022, when I came to know about the possibility of violence, I decided to end a protest march. My election rally was attacked and I decided to call off that rally as well.
“I ask the workers to protest peacefully. I always tell my supporters to stay calm, I do not understand what is going on right now,” he told the bench.
Imran said that he had never promoted violent politics. In twenty-seven years of politics, we have always followed the Constitution,” he said.
The CJP told Imran that the bench is setting him free.
In a three-page written order issued later in the day, the bench noted that the manner of execution of the arrest warrant – issued by the NAB chairman on May 1 in the Al-Qadir Trust case – within the premises of the Islamabad High Court against the petitioner is invalid and unlawful.
“The execution of said warrant violated the petitioner’s right of access to justice and the sanctity and safety of the court as he had already surrendered to the court for seeking judicial relief against the action taken by NAB in the Al-Qadir Trust case.
“In this regard, the fundamental rights of the petitioner under Articles 4, 9, 10-A and 14 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan have been infringed.
“The petitioner is directed to be produced before the IHC tomorrow—May 12— at 11:00 am for hearing of his writ petition filed to challenge the NAB action against him in the Al-Qadir Trust Case.”
The SC said the NAB authorities and the Islamabad police shall ensure foolproof security to the petitioner until his production in the IHC.
“In this regard, the IHC registrar is directed to place the matter—the writ petition—before the IHC chief justice for constituting a bench for hearing the same.
“In order to ensure the security of the petitioner until his appearance in the high court…he shall remain in the premises where he is presently retained in police custody, namely, the Police Lines Guest House, H-11, Islamabad (Police Guest House).
“Whilst the petitioner is in the Police Guest House, he shall be entitled to meet up to 10 guests, whose particulars shall be provided by him to the concerned police officer, subject to a security check by the police. These persons shall be allowed to stay with the petitioner as long as desired by him,” it said.

3,"Sunak, Guterres for respecting law","UN Sec-Gen wants all parties to refrain from violence, stresses need to respect the right to peaceful assembly","British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Wednesday said that the UK is monitoring the situation in Pakistan carefully, after the arrest of former prime minister Imran Khan sparked unrest.
""The arrest of the former prime minister is an internal matter for Pakistan. We support peaceful democratic processes and adherence to the rule of law and we are monitoring the situation carefully,"" Sunak told lawmakers.
Asked about the ongoing ""civil unrest"" in the country by Pakistan-born Conservative Party MP Rehman Chishti during Prime Minister’s Questions in the House of Commons, Sunak responded by describing the UK-Pakistan bilateral relations as “longstanding and close”.
""The arrest of the former prime minister is an internal matter for Pakistan. We support peaceful democratic processes and adherence to the rule of law and we are monitoring the situation carefully,” said Sunak.
Chishti, a dual British and Pakistani citizen, raised concerns over the circumstances of the detention of Khan and his right to a fair trial. ""The United Kingdom has in the past sent observers to hearings around the world to ensure natural justice is done. Has the prime minister considered that?” he asked Sunak.
Meanwhile, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres wants all parties in Pakistan to refrain from violence and stresses the need to respect the right to peaceful assembly, deputy UN spokesperson Farhan Haq said in New York on Wednesday.
Guterres had also urged Pakistani authorities to ""respect due process and the rule of law in proceedings"" against former prime minister Imran Khan.

4,Are scales of justice balanced now?,Ruling party maintains PTI chief was given ‘special treatment’ on several occasions,"Despite the arrest of PTI Chairman Imran Khan in the Al Qadir Trust case from the Islamabad High Court premises a day earlier, the PML-N on Wednesday expressed dissatisfaction, questioning how a “level playing field” was offered to their party when the former premier was given “special treatment” in the past notwithstanding irrefutable evidence against him while their party chief organiser Maryam Nawaz was taken into custody during the PTI rule after “fabricated cases” were registered against her.
The PML-N had demanded a level playing field on several occasions, including the holding of elections in Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and the return of party supremo Nawaz Sharif to Pakistan from London.
The party claimed that the PTI chief was given special treatment, citing the courts that granted him bail in a number of cases in one go.

In March, addressing PML-N workers in Sheikhupura, Maryam stressed that there could be no elections in Punjab and K-P until “wrongs done” to party supremo Nawaz Sharif were righted and Imran was held accountable.
“There will be no polls before the accountability of Imran Khan. There will be no elections without ensuring a level playing field,” she said.
“The elections will be held only after the scales of justice are balanced.”
Separately, PML-N leader and Railways Minister Saad Rafique said that elections in both the provinces were impossible without a level playing field.

Federal Minister Javed Latif had also elaborated that level playing field meant putting the PTI chief behind bars and undoing the cases against Nawaz.
On Wednesday, PML-N leader Mujtaba Shujaur Rehman while talking to The Express Tribune said that the PTI chief should have been arrested earlier.
“However, given that he had the support of some elements in the establishment and some judges, he managed to evade the arrest.”
Rehman said delaying tactics were applied despite the fact that there were open-and-shut cases against Imran.
When asked whether Imran’s arrest fulfils PMLN’s demand of level playing field, he while referring to Maryam and Nawaz asked how it could be a level playing field where one is arrested on fabricated cases while others (Imran) are given special treatment despite irrefutable evidence against them.
On the question whether Imran’s arrest brightened Nawaz’s chances of homecoming, Rehman stated that the PML-N supremo would come back ahead of polls.
When asked why Nawaz did not return when the Supreme Court had ordered elections for May 14, he said the PML-N knew that polls were not possible on the date, “so there was no reason for his return”.
The government has already passed legislation allowing review of Supreme Court’s decision in cases taken up under original jurisdiction apparently in a bid to undo Nawaz’s sentence that prohibited him from taking part in politics for life.
The sentence against the PML-N supremo was handed down in a case taken up under original jurisdiction.
After assuming power early last year, the PML-N had also curtailed the National Accountability Bureau’s powers, refraining the national graft-buster from investigating cases that involved a sum below Rs500 million, which benefitted the Sharif family in several references against them.
