It includes improved early warning systems, streamlined evacuation procedures, and better communication channels.
Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of community engagement.
A final orientation meeting was held under the chairmanship of the Secretary Relief, Rehabilitation & Settlement Department, Abdul Basit on Wednesday.
Representatives from district administration, provincial and federal line departments and humanitarian partners participated in this meeting and provided feedback to make a comprehensive plan.
On this occasion the secretary said that the relief department is responsible for formulating policies, strategies, and guidelines for relief, rehabilitation, and emergency activities in the province.
PDMA, Rescue 1122, and Civil Defense are the attached formations of the RR&S Department to implement the mandate of disaster risk management activities in the province.
The department will ensure the strengthening of the ADC relief position. Rescue teams will have pre-visits to the vulnerable areas for community awareness, early warning systems and to identify the vulnerable areas prior to the disaster.
PDMA Director-General Janat Gul Afridi said that the PDMA has assigned roles and responsibilities for each department in the monsoon plan and developed tools for data collection that have been shared with all stakeholders.

K-P faced substantial financial and human losses due to floods last year which were caused by abnormal monsoon conditions.
The monsoon in 2022 began with an above-normal forecast, and the situation became similar to that of the 2010 floods.
Subsequently, 17 districts were declared calamity-hit due to floods in 2022, resulting in significant loss of life and property.
