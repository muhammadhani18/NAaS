0,Differently-abled urged to enhance mental resilience,Ahsan Iqbal distributes electric wheelchairs among 50 students,"Federal Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Ahsan Iqbal has advised differently-abled university students to cultivate mental resilience in order to achieve success in life.
The Minister was addressing a ceremony held at the HEC Secretariat on Wednesday in connection with the distribution of electric wheelchairs among students under the last phase of the ‘Prime Minister’s Electric Wheelchair for University Students’.
As many as 50 students received electric wheelchairs during the ceremony. In the first phase of the scheme, launched back in 2017, 206 electric wheelchairs were provided to physically challenged university students, while 159 wheelchairs were handed over to students in the second phase.
While quoting Stephen Hawking, Ahsan Iqbal said that “An otherwise healthy person with no use of mental capabilities is worthless, while a physically challenged person who utilises their mind can mark great achievements”. He further said that the future of Pakistan depends on making the right decisions on time, as any wrong decision can put the country’s future at stake. A country’s development gets haunted if there is a lack of patience, perseverance as well as consistency of policies, he added.

1,Lady health workers demand rights,Flay health department for turning blind eye to their plight,"Lady health workers working in various hospitals and basic health units across the Haripur district have voiced their serious concerns over the denial of their basic rights.
They sought better pay and compensation against the services they render during various campaigns from time to time.
The lady health workers gathered at the Haripur Press Club to share their grievance against the health department, which they claimed has turned a blind eye to their plight and sufferings and the illegal deduction form their pay and allowances.
Lady Health Workers Association President Shahnaz Bibi said that extra work was taken from them, and their DDM cards were filled but they were never paid for the extra work they do.
She said that even during the coronavirus pandemic, the lady health workers worked 24 hours a day by putting their own lives at risk but they were never rewarded and their work was barely recognised.
She said that despite years of service, they were still working at a lower grade with a minimum salary. Shaista Bibi, the association's patron, was also present during the protest.
The lady health workers complained that they were denied facilities and compensation compared to employees of other government departments, including TA/DA and additional compensation during special campaigns.
They said that they were not being heard at any forum and even their own department was showing inconsideration to their plight.
In contrast, they said employees of other government departments avail several benefits during the several campaigns including the anti-polio drive.
