0,Remittances dip in wake of holidays,Overseas Pakistanis sent home $2.21 billion in April,"In line with market expectations, the flow of workers’ remittances slowed down 13% month-on-month to $2.21 billion in April amid prolonged Eid holidays.
Financial experts, however, considered it a strong number and anticipated that it would help achieve current account surplus for the second consecutive month.
According to the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) data, the remittances hit a seven-month high at $2.53 billion in March 2023. However, inflows dipped 29% in April compared to the all-time high of $3.12 billion reached in the same month of last year.
Cumulatively, in the first 10 months (Jul-Apr) of current fiscal year, the remittances sent home by overseas Pakistanis fell by 13% to $22.74 billion compared to $26.14 billion in the same period of last year.
Talking to The Express Tribune, Ismail Iqbal Securities Head of Research Fahad Rauf said “it’s a strong number of remittances, ie, $2.21 billion for April, considering Pakistan’s economy remained closed for five days (April 21-25) on account of Eid holidays.”
“People could not send remittances during the holidays. Had there been no prolonged break, the remittances would have remained stable around previous month’s level of $2.53 billion,” he said.
JS Global Head of Research Amreen Soorani said in a commentary “with remittances widely surpassing the trade deficit once again, the possibility of current account surplus remains for April 2023.” The trade deficit narrowed by 78% to $829 million in April compared to $3.76 billion in the same month of last year. Earlier, the current account surplus was recorded at $636 million in March 2023.
The lower trade deficit and the current account surplus came at the cost of economic growth, as the government’s administrative control over trade remained in place to manage the low foreign exchange reserves and mitigate the risk of debt default.
Considering the current trend of remittances, Rauf projected full-year inflows in the range of $27 billion to $27.50 billion. Remittances hit an all-time high at $31.27 billion in the previous fiscal year.
He was of the view that remittances could take a small dip to somewhere between $2.20 billion and $2.50 billion in May. Historical data suggests inflows usually drop in the month immediately after Ramazan.
“However, the flow of remittances will again improve in June ahead of Eidul Azha,” he pointed out.
Rauf, however, warned that political turmoil, emerging in the wake of former prime minister Imran Khan’s arrest, may hurt the economy in general and remittances in particular.
If political tensions did not ease, he added, it may mount pressure on the rupee and force overseas Pakistanis to send only a limited amount to their families back home ahead of the return of stability to the rupee-dollar exchange rate.
Pakistani rupee slumped 1.85%, or Rs5.38, and closed at a new all-time low at Rs290.22 against the US dollar in the inter-bank market on Wednesday.
Rauf pointed out that latest reports signaled further delay in revival of the IMF loan programme, adding that the development stood negative for the exchange rate as well as remittances.
He suggested that the government should continue to let market forces determine the exchange rate, which would discourage the flow of remittances via black markets and lead to increased use of legal channels.

1,Internet suspension results in Rs820m loss,"Industry leaders call upon PM to restore services, say effect on economy is quantifiable","The suspension of mobile broadband services in Pakistan due to political escalation has caused significant financial losses for digital service providers, the government, and the general population. The suspension has resulted in an estimated revenue loss of Rs820 million for telecom operators, while the government has lost around Rs287 million in tax revenue. Individuals who depend on digital apps and payments, such as Careem, InDrive, FoodPanda etc. have also suffered a significant loss in earnings.
The IT industry, which is already under pressure due to bad governmental policies and a lack of continuity, has come to a standstill since the suspension of the internet.
Chairman of Pakistan Software Houses Association ([email protected]) Muhammad Zohaib Khan lambasted the blanket blockage of internet services in the country, calling it mindless and consultation-less. According to a statement, Khan said, “The internet is our lifeline, our office, our communications infrastructure and IT industry can’t operate without it.”
Shutting down the internet is not a solution to anything; it creates more problems than it solves, tweeted Aamir Ibrahim, CEO of Jazz. “For almost 24 hours, 125 million Pakistanis have been without mobile internet – a critical tool in emergencies and productivity.”
He demanded the immediate resumption of internet services to the IT industry, stating that “the devastating effect on the economy is quantifiable but the inconvenience to people is incalculable.”
It is pertinent to note that most IT professionals are working from home today due to the precarious law and order situation in the country and may have to continue doing so for the next few days in the backdrop of political uncertainty.
The blanket blockage of internet services has had a significantly adverse impact on IT companies. Their ability to carry out day-to-day operations is wholly dependent on internet connectivity, said Nasheed Malik, analyst at Topline Securities. Companies that provide digital services primarily rely on websites and social media platforms to deliver their products and services. With the internet blackout, they are unable to complete their orders, causing delays and loss of revenue. Freelancers who work independently and depend on the internet to perform their jobs are also unable to access their work, communicate with their clients and submit their assignments on time, which has adversely impacted their income and credibility in the market.
Pakistan earned $2 billion in IT exports during 2022, a hard currency source for a country struggling to meet its foreign exchange needs, said Parvez Iftikhar, former CEO of Universal Service Fund Pakistan (USF). When overseas buyers experience disruptions in internet connectivity in Pakistan, they shy away from engaging with IT service companies in the future, said Iftikhar. Such disruptions even cause breaches of running contracts with overseas buyers of IT services.
Local technology startups are playing an increasingly important role in promoting entrepreneurship. Pakistani tech startups attracted more than $300 million in investments in 2022. Internet disruptions impact tech startups badly.
The [email protected] chairman vociferously demanded the immediate resumption of internet services to the IT industry and urged Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to intervene directly and advise the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority (PTA) to resume the internet services without wasting any time. He also asked for the support of the Ministry of IT and Telecom (MoITT), Pakistan Software Export Board (PSEB), and Tech Destination Pakistan administrations to ask the PM to issue categorical instructions.
An official from PTA confirmed that mobile broadband services were suspended in the country but refrained from giving a timeline for its restoration.

2,Rupee slumps amid political crisis,Currency melts around 3% to Rs298.93 vs dollar; market expects swift recovery,"Amid escalating political temperature and law and order disturbances in the country, the rupee felt the heat and melted almost 3% to a new record low at Rs298.93 against the US dollar in the inter-bank market on Thursday.
Market talk, however, suggested that the currency made a notable correction on futures counter at the end of the day and may make a significant recovery on ready counter on Friday. It was supported by the expected easing of political tensions after the Supreme Court ordered the release of ex-prime minister Imran Khan from the custody of law enforcement agencies.
The currency also got support from the IMF which said it had remained engaged with Pakistan to resume its $6.7 billion loan programme.
According to State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) data, the currency nosedived 2.91%, or Rs8.71, to a new all-time low at Rs298.93 against the greenback.
Cumulatively, in the past two days, it slumped 4.71%, or Rs14.09.
The rupee’s free fall is feared to accelerate the pace of inflation as imports have become further expensive. Talking to The Express Tribune, Alpha Beta Core CEO Khurram Schehzad commented that the rupee remained volatile and maintained its record-breaking streak for the second consecutive day in the wake of heightened political uncertainty.
Prior to the current political turmoil after Khan’s arrest, he recalled, the US dollar demand and supply was smooth in the inter-bank market, when the rupee stood stable around Rs283-284/$ for a long time.
He acknowledged that the currency made a smart recovery to around Rs292-293 vs dollar towards the end of the day.
Schehzad believed that it was almost impossible to project the rupee-dollar exchange rate amid depletion of foreign exchange reserves to the critically low level of around $4 billion and the risk of debt default.
He anticipated that “the rupee will remain volatile … until the IMF programme is resumed.”
Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan President Malik Bostan said the rupee recovered to Rs291/$ towards the end of the day as exporters stepped in to sell their proceeds withheld over the past three days. He projected that the exchange rate would move in a band of Rs285-295/$ and would not cross Rs300/$ under the current situation.
Bostan expected the IMF to resume its loan progrmme after Finance Minister Ishaq Dar once again approached the US asking it to push the lender to resume the programme.
“The currency will recover Rs20-25 immediately after Pakistan clinches a staff-level agreement with the IMF,” he said and anticipated that the rupee would partially recoup losses over the next couple of days on expectations of easing political tensions.
Schehzad asked the government to gradually open imports, instead of continuing its trade control, despite a fall in foreign exchange reserves. “Import of raw material is a must to reopen the partially shut economy. Market-based exchange rate will create balance in the rupee-dollar parity and help restore economic activities.”
Besides, he emphasised, the government should cut its non-development expenditure and the size of cabinet to support the currency. “It should increase the number of taxpayers instead of imposing new taxes on the already taxed corporate sector.”
He was of the view that the State Bank should avoid further hike in its policy rate because the increase in cost of financing would only suppress the economy and would not rein in inflation.
Apart from that, the government and the central bank should relax administrative controls over the economy. The return of business confidence will surely provide support to the rupee.
Meanwhile, gold price fell by Rs2,700 to Rs237,300 per tola (11.66 grams) on Thursday, which came in contrast with the massive rupee depreciation and rise in global bullion market.
According to market players, the price came off Wednesday’s record high after consumer demand dropped.
In the international arena, gold went up by $7 to $2,038 per ounce (31.10 grams), the local pricing body reported.

3,Pakistan plans Russian-Saudi oil ‘cocktail’,"Islamabad targets imports of up to 100,000 bpd","Pakistan is planning to blend newly purchased Russian crude with Arabian light crude in order to create a mixture that will be more easily processed by the nation’s oil refineries, Pakistan’s energy minister said on Tuesday.
The country is planning to purchase Russian crude oil at a discount as high prices caused by geopolitical tensions have caused fuel prices to more than double in Pakistan.
Russia’s heavier grades of crude oil are more difficult to process in Pakistan’s refineries, which are configured to process lighter Arabian crudes, Petroleum Minister Musadik Malik told Reuters in an interview in Washington.
Malik said he met with Biden administration officials and companies about energy transition technologies like hydrogen and solar power.
Under the deal with Russia, Pakistan will buy only crude oil, not refined fuels, with Islamabad targeting imports of up to 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) if the first transaction goes through smoothly. Malik declined to comment on the price of the deal.
Pakistan plans to blend “various recipes” of lighter Arabian crudes and Russian crude to create the “perfect cocktail” that could meet up to a quarter or a third of Pakistan’s refinery demand.
“It also depends on what discount we get and how much Urals or lighter crude is available in the market,” Malik said, adding that the country will also have to consider how the blend will change the yield of refined products that are sold at different prices.
Pakistan Refinery Limited will initially refine the Russian crude in a trial run.
Malik said the deal is centred on crude oil and not refined products because it was more difficult to get a discount on higher-priced diesel.

4,India’s Go First gains bankruptcy protection,Low-cost carrier was plunged into financial crisis due to faulty engines controversy,"Go Airlines (India) Ltd was granted bankruptcy protection on Wednesday, bolstering the country’s fourth-largest carrier chances of getting back on its feet, but lessors are expected to mount legal challenges to repossess planes.
The low-cost carrier, recently rebranded as Go First, was plunged into financial crisis this year, sparked by what it called “faulty” Pratt & Whitney engines that grounded about half its 54 Airbus A320neos. The US engine maker, part of Raytheon Technologies, in a statement said Go First’s allegations were “without merit”.
In granting bankruptcy protection, the National Company Law Tribunal in New Delhi ordered a moratorium on Go First’s assets and leases. It also appointed Abhilash Lal of Alvarez and Marsal as the interim resolution professional to take over management with immediate effect.
The resolution professional “shall ensure that retrenchment of employees is not resorted to as a matter of course,” the tribunal’s 41-page order said. Go First has staff of around 7,000.

5,Rs9.2tr new tax target likely,Report suggests FBR may again rely on limited number of taxpayers to meet goal,"The federal government has planned to fix the new tax target at Rs9.2 trillion amid disclosure by the Reforms and Revenue Mobilisation Commission (RRMC) that the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) collected three-fourths of income tax from just 13,958 taxpayers.
The scathing interim report of the commission exposes the FBR’s shallow performance. Findings of the report suggest that without reshaping the tax reform structure, the FBR will again put the burden of Rs9.2 trillion target for fiscal year 2023-24 on the same limited number of taxpayers.
Sources said that the Ministry of Finance had suggested around Rs9.2 trillion in new tax target, which was 21% higher compared to the current year. However, the ministry’s estimates suggest that tax collection during the outgoing fiscal year may remain below Rs7.2 trillion with a shortfall of around Rs450 billion.
The new target may be Rs2 trillion, or 27%, higher than the anticipated collection of Rs7.2 trillion in the current fiscal year. Officials of the Ministry of Finance believe that 27% growth should not be a challenge given the fact that the nominal economic growth in the next fiscal year is projected at 25%. The FBR may have to take new tax measures for the collection of at least Rs200 billion, if the target is set at around Rs9.2 trillion. But if Pakistan seeks the endorsement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the tax target may go up further.
However, FBR officials may miss the new target as strict import restrictions are in place. The revenue board’s performance has largely remained dependent on imports.
Ashfaq Yousaf Tola-led RRMC has documented what it calls the “lacklustre” performance of the FBR. The government had set up the commission with the task of proposing reforms for the outdated tax machinery that has been struggling to achieve its goals. The commission’s report revealed that there were 7.6 million registered National Tax Number (NTN) holders but merely 3.6 million filed income tax returns. It indicated that the FBR had failed to bring four million people to the tax network and enforce its writ.
It highlighted that a large number of individuals got tax concessions, but they did not file tax returns in subsequent years, underscoring the need for strict enforcement measures. Moreover, out of the 3.6 million registered return filers, 2.2 million were tax filers and the remaining 1.4 million declared zero income in their annual income tax returns.
In tax year 2021-22, the FBR collected Rs1.6 trillion in income tax. The RRMC report revealed “only a small fraction of taxpayers, 13,958 to be exact, contributed 75% or Rs1.194 trillion of the total income tax collection in FY22. The 13,958 individuals were equal to 0.39% return filers and only 0.005% of the total population.”
Just 28,027 taxpayers paid 80%, or Rs1.274 trillion, of income tax. Similarly, 85% of income tax, or Rs1.4 trillion, was paid by 57,454 taxpayers while 90%, or Rs1.43 trillion, was paid by 126,908 taxpayers and 95%, or Rs1.5 trillion, was paid by 317,940 individuals.
“When compared to India, the situation seems to be drastically different. In India, 90% of tax was paid by 22% of total filers, whereas in Pakistan, only 3.5% of filers contributed 90% of income tax collection,” said the commission’s report.
The commission noted that only a small number of taxpayers contributed significantly to the income tax collection in Pakistan, and “our tax base is shallow, which underscores the need for greater tax compliance and a broader tax base in order to achieve sustainable revenue generation for the government.”
RRMC recommended that in order to improve tax compliance and generate sustainable tax revenue, the FBR needed to adopt a more efficient approach towards broadening the tax base and leveraging the use of information technology to bring more individuals to the tax net. It called for re-examining the budget-making process as a must. It has been “found that most of the revenue measures undertaken in the last three years were not appropriately based on proper data evaluation, hence, those mostly remained unachievable.”
Furthermore, there should be an effective and modern budgeting system and by and large the performance of the FBR is not found up to the mark, according to the commission’s findings. RRMC noted that like income tax, the FBR was facing a similar kind of obstacle in sales tax collection. There were only 217,328 sales tax registered persons, of which 67,885 were tax filers.
Of those who filed returns, only 0.17% contributed 75%, or Rs696 billion, of total sales tax collection in the last fiscal year and only 0.25% contributed 80%, or Rs742 billion, of sales tax receipts. These numbers are highly suggestive of the FBR’s poor performance as sales tax collection is unsatisfactory, according to the commission.

6,Panasonic sees high profit on robust battery sales,Predicts net profit will grow 32% to record $2.59 billion,"Japan’s Panasonic Holdings Corp on Wednesday said it expects net profit to rise to a record high this year on robust auto battery sales and a hefty tax credit in the United States.
The industrial conglomerate, which supplies batteries to US electric vehicle (EV) leader Tesla Inc, is expanding its energy business just as persistently high inflation rates worldwide dampen consumer sentiment.
Panasonic predicts net profit will grow 32% from a year earlier to a record 350 billion yen ($2.59 billion) as it expects a tax credit for EV battery operations under the US Inflation Reduction Act to boost its bottom line by 100 billion yen.
The net profit outlook would be up 23% from the prior record of 284.1 billion yen, set in the year ending in March 2019.
In another factor to drive its profit, the Osaka-based company, whose products range from rice cookers to industrial robots, expects far less headwind this year from higher material prices and components shortages.
“Over the past two years, we were greatly affected by a surge in raw material prices and a lack of parts and semiconductors. But those negative effects will largely go away this year,” Panasonic Group CFO Hirokazu Umeda told a briefing.
The company sees operating profit of 430 billion yen for the year through March 2024, versus 288.6 billion yen a year earlier. That beats the 383.96-billion-yen average of 20 analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv.
Panasonic expects operating profit at its energy unit, which manufactures batteries, to jump fourfold to 133 billion yen this business year thanks to the tax credit and growing EV battery sales in the United States.
The company makes EV batteries in the US state of Nevada and is building another battery plant in Kansas.

7,Envoy for sustainable veg oil production,Discusses role of vegetable oils in achieving UN SDGs,"An international seminar focused on “Sustainable Production of Healthy Vegetable Oils: Policies and Practices to Achieve SDGs” was inaugurated by Indonesian Ambassador Adam M Tugio along with University of Agriculture Faisalabad (UAF) Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Iqrar Ahmad Khan.
The seminar was organised by the embassy of Indonesia in collaboration with the UAF faculty of food, nutrition and home sciences.
During the inaugural address, the ambassador said that the global population is growing at an unprecedented rate and estimates predict that “we will need to produce 70% more food by 2050 to feed the growing population”.
“We need the brightest minds and ideas to find creative solutions for addressing the growing challenge of food security and malnutrition in developing countries,” said the envoy.
He added that vegetable oils are an essential component of the global food supply chain and it is necessary to ensure that their production is sustainable to meet the rising demand.
The ambassador also said that palm oil production is a crucial element in the global food value chain as it is a vital source of calories for millions of people and its production is very efficient which requires less land and water, resulting in minimal environmental issues.
Tugio welcomed the academic collaboration between UAF and Bogor Agriculture University (IPB), one of the world’s top universities in agricultural research.
He encouraged Pakistani students to study in top-ranked Indonesian universities through the Indonesian government and private scholarships offered by Indonesian institutions.

8,"Rupee hits record low, gold soars",ECAP data shows the rupee has fallen Rs7 to Rs297/$ at the open market,"Pakistan’s capital markets made headlines on Wednesday as the country’s domestic currency, the rupee, plummeted to a new all-time low beyond Rs290 against the US dollar. Gold prices also hit a new record high at Rs240,000 per tola amid domestic political turmoil.
According to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), the local currency sank 1.85% or Rs5.38 in a day to close at Rs290.22 against the greenback in the interbank market. Meanwhile, data from the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP) suggested the rupee has fallen 2.35%, or Rs7, to Rs297/$ at the open market. The new price is just Rs3 away from the much-anticipated rate of Rs300/$.
The rupee depreciation has piled up foreign debt without taking new external loans, making imports further expensive for Pakistan, which faced a six-decade high inflation reading at 36.4% in April 2023.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, Pak-Kuwait Investment Company (PKIC) Head of Research Samiullah Tariq explained that the rupee depreciated due to political and social unrest caused after the arrest of former Prime Minister Imran Khan.
Fresh reports suggest that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan programme has also been further delayed, and, without the loan, Moody’s said the risk of the country’s default on foreign debt repayment has risen.
“The recent developments have increased pressure on the rupee against the US dollar,” said Tariq. He noted that the supply of US dollars had increased in the interbank market in recent days, while demand had remained low.
Speculation that the rupee would depreciate further due to political and economic uncertainties may have caused exporters to stop selling foreign currency, while importers may have rushed to buy US dollars before the price increased. This reversal in the demand and supply position of the foreign currency in the interbank market may have contributed to the rupee’s devaluation and the surge in gold prices, he said. He hoped the political situation would improve in a day or two and help the currency stabilise around the current levels or partially recover ground against the greenback.
Gold prices in Pakistan rose by 4.30% or Rs9,900 per tola in a day, hitting a new record high of Rs240,000 per tola in local markets despite remaining unchanged at $2,031 per ounce (31.10 gram) a day ago in the world markets.
According to Abdullah Abdul Razzak, a member of the All-Pakistan Saraf Gem and Jewellers Association (APSGJA), “the latest rupee devaluation in the interbank and open markets directly impacted gold prices in Pakistan. People are investing in gold to avoid currency devaluation, especially given the current political volatility.” He added that gold has become the most preferred asset after the supply of US dollars decreased in the open market.
AA Gold Commodities Director, Adnan Agar anticipated that gold prices would reach a new record high of around $2,150 per ounce in international markets over the next couple of months due to financial crises in the US.
“The anticipated uptrend in global markets will keep the price of gold volatile in Pakistan as well,” he said.
He cautioned that the ongoing uptrend might be followed by a correction in price, and investors should remain wary. It would be better for investors if gold underwent a due correction before rallying to the anticipated new highs, as a rally without correction is unlikely to be sustainable in the short to medium run.
