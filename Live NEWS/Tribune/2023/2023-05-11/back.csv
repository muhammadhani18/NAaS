0,PTI moves SC against Imran’s arrest,SC registrar first raises objections to appeal but later allots it a number,"The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) on Wednesday filed a petition in the Supreme Court challenging the Islamabad High Court’s (IHC) ruling that party chief Imran Khan’s arrest by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) from the IHC premises on May 9 was “legal”.
After Imran’s arrest which sparked violent protests across the country, PTI Vice Chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi called an emergency meeting of a seven-member party committee to review the situation and devise a comprehensive strategy to secure the former premier’s safe and early release.
And on Wednesday, the PTI’ legal team led by Fawad Chaudhry submitted a petition in the apex court, requesting the court to set aside the order passed by the IHC chief justice in the wake of the arrest.
“…Leave to appeal may please be granted against the impugned order 09-05-2023 passed by Hon’ble IHC […] may be set aside and further after hearing the parties the warrant dated 01-05-2023 issued by Chairman NAB [National Accountability Bureau] may be declared void and further be directed to release the petitioner/accused forthwith in the interest of justice,” it said.
At first, the SC registrar's office returned the petition immediately after it was submitted. It stated that the PTI did not approach the relevant forum, adding that the party could file an intra-court appeal in the IHC. It said the petition also did not carry signatures of the PTI chief.
The party, however, resubmitted the petition after addressing the objections and the SC registrar office later admitted the appeal and allotted it a number (641/2023).
The IHC on Tuesday termed the arrest of former prime minister Imran Khan in Al-Qadir Trust case “legal” but issued notices to the Islamabad inspector general police (IGP) and secretary interior for contempt of court.
The court also ordered its registrar to complete an inquiry into the incident—which involved manhandling of lawyers and court staff and damaging of court properties— by May 16 and get a first information report (FIR) registered against people responsible for it.
Officials of paramilitary Rangers and police arrested the PTI chief from the IHC premises on Monday afternoon while implementing an arrest warrant issued by NAB, the country’s top graft buster.

2,Not ISPR's job to decide Imran’s arrest ‘legality’,"Fawad says attempt being made to pit people, army against each other","In response to Director-General Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Major General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry’s statement, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf leader Fawad Chaudhry has said that the issue of “legality” of former premier Imran Khan's arrest is not for the DG ISPR to decide.
According to a statement issued by the military’s media wing on Wednesday – a day after the PTI chief’s arrest, Imran was arrested from the Islamabad High Court (IHC) “in line with the NAB statement and law”.
On Tuesday, the PTI chief was whisked away by security personnel from the premises of the IHC in the National Accountability Bureau’s Al-Qadir Trust case.
Fawad said, “The arrest of Imran Khan is illegal and unconstitutional. Imran Khan has not mentioned the name of General Faisal Naseer for the first time. Imran Khan has mentioned his name many times after the assassination attempt for which he should have been investigated for satisfaction but it didn't happen.”
Imran has repeatedly accused a senior military officer of being involved in the assassination attempt on his life during a rally in Wazirabad on Nov 3, 2022 during which he was shot and injured.
But recently when he reiterated his claim, the ISPR lashed out at him, saying that the PTI chief levelled ""highly irresponsible and baseless allegation"" against a serving senior military officer without any evidence.
""This fabricated and malicious allegation is extremely unfortunate, deplorable and unacceptable. This has been a consistent pattern for last one year wherein military and intelligence agencies officials are targeted with insinuations and sensational propaganda for the furtherance of political objectives,"" the ISPR stated a day ahead of Imran’s arrest on Monday.
Fawad said that the ISPR should take a real look at the events that took place after the arrest of Imran and they need to understand that “a terrible game is being played”.
He said, “An attempt is being made to pit the people and the army against each other. After the ISPR's statement, the government arrested Imran Khan.”
Fawad said, “The PTI voters are from poor- and upper-middle classes while the army is the most organised group of the middle class. The army is one of the classes represented by the PTI.”
Fawad said, “Trying to make the PTI and army fight each other is a conspiracy against the people and the country.”
The senior party leader said that the PTI represented 220 million people, among whom many people would get emotional if all the senior leadership would be arrested and put in jails. If that happened, he asked, who would be given a chance?
Fawad said that the PTI leadership condemned the incidents of the previous day and called for a peaceful protest.

3,Tyrian case takes a new turn,"IHC to form new bench to hear plea against Imran, according to clarification",". In a strange development, the opinion of two of the three Islamabad High Court (IHC) judges who heard a petition seeking former prime minister Imran Khan disqualification for hiding his alleged daughter was uploaded on the court’s website only to be subsequently removed.
A three-judge bench, led by IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and comprising Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani and Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir, on March 30 reserved its verdict while hearing a petition that sought disqualification Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief Imran Khan as a lawmaker.
The petition, filed by last year a citizen, Muhamamd Sajid, said Imran Khan did not mention his daughter Tyrian White in his nomination papers as well as an affidavit submitted to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) ahead of August 2018 general elections.
On Wednesday, the opinion of Justice Kayani and Justice Tahir appeared on the IHC website. In the notes, which ran to 31 pages, the two judges dismissed the petition as inadmissible.
The mysterious publication of the judges’ notes created a controversy and later in the day the IHC public relation officer (PRO) issued a clarification.
In the statement, the PRO said the verdict of the bench in the Tyrian White case had not been issued so far and that the “opinion” of two bench members was uploaded without issuance of the cause-list and notifying the parties.
“The opinion of the two judges is not the court's verdict. The opinion was uploaded in violation of the rules. A new bench is going to be constituted for rehearing the case. The court will take action against those responsible for uploading the opinion on the website,” said the statement.

5,ECC approves Roosevelt Hotel transaction,Gives 1025-room hotel to New York govt on rent,"Pakistan on Wednesday approved giving the Roosevelt Hotel at a nominal rent to the New York City government and also endorsed a $56 million settlement with its sacked employees –- in a deal that will help re-open the facility after two-and-half years.
The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet approved the deal to give the 1025-room hotel, located at the prime tourist resort, to the New York City government for immigrant business under a three-year deal.
Headed by Finance Minister Ishaq Dar, the ECC also endorsed the withdrawal of lawsuits and reach a $56 million settlement deal with the sacked employees of the Roosevelt Hotel, New York.
A finance ministry handout stated that the aviation ministry briefed the ECC on the outcome of negotiations held by the committee with the New York City government and the hotel union on reaching a suitable agreement for utilisation of the Roosevelt Hotel (1,025 rooms) over a period of three years for Immigrant Housing Business by the New York City Government.
“The ECC after detailed discussion approved the execution of settlement agreement with the Hotel Union and the New York City government,” according to the decision.
Roosevelt Hotel Corporation (RHC), New York, is owned by PIA- Investment Limited (PIA-IL), a subsidiary of PIA – the national flag carrier.
On April 28, the aviation ministry had presented the draft agreement for the approval of the ECC, which showed the per night room rent at $200. However, the ECC had termed the agreed rates too low and dispatched a team to New York to renegotiate the contract.
Ironically, the team that flew from Pakistan got only $2 per night increase in rent and the hotel will now be rented out at $202 per night price.
The ECC further gave nod for withdrawal of pending lawsuits by the Roosevelt Hotel with the entity’s union and City of New York pursuant to the terms of settlement agreement with the union, according to the finance ministry.
The aviation ministry maintained that the committee has concluded its negotiations with the union and the City. It has also informed that the results of the negotiations were placed before the PIA-IL Board of Directors on May 8 who after concurring with the position brought out by the committee resolved that the matter may be placed before the ECC for seeking their approval and execution of the proposed settlement agreement with the union and contract with the City as well as withdrawal of pending lawsuits between the hotel, union and the City after making a full disclosure.

Roosevelt Hotel had been shut down in December 2020 with the approval of the then federal cabinet. After closure, the entity was required to reach a settlement with the union on payment of severance and pension to 469 employees as per local laws.
However, since this settlement could not be reached, several lawsuits and arbitration claims were filed against the hotel by the union as well as the Pension Fund in various courts and the Impartial Chairperson for Arbitration respectively.
After renegotiation, the total value of the contract the local authorities have offered is $228 million in rent for three years, with a minimum guaranteed period of 18 months.
According to the proposed contract, the city government would pay $202 per room per day for the first year, $205 per room for the second year and $210 per room for the third year – a price that is far below the prevailing market rates at the fifth avenue, which is the prime location for the tourists visiting New York.
The ECC approved settlement deal with the 469 union employees who were sacked when the last PTI government closed the hotel in 2020.
The settlement cost of the 392 employees is estimated at $56 million, as 77 employees are expected to rejoin once the facility is opened for business.
The ECC directed the PIAL to engage and share its business plan with the NBP regarding rollover of the $142 million loan for a period of two years.
Other decisions
The ECC approved Rs153 million supplementary grant for payment of court cases fee for the settlement of dispute with India under the Indus Waters Treaty. Against the budgeted amount of Rs821 million, the total fee cost is estimated at Rs974 million.
The Indus Waters Treaty, 1960 provides a mechanism for sharing of waters of the Indus system of rivers between India and Pakistan. But there exists an ongoing dispute pertaining to two Kishenganga hydropower project of 330MW and Ratle hydropower project of 850MW.
Both plants violate various design parameters provided in the treaty, including those relating to pondage, intake, sediment outlets, spillway and freeboard.
The cabinet body also approved Rs4 billion, or $20 million, as rupee cover in favour of Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training for the World Bank Programme Actions to strengthen performance for inclusive and responsive education.

6,Govt denies political vendetta,Ministers say Imran arrested in NAB case,"Federal ministers on Wednesday defended the arrest of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf chairman Imran Khan in a NAB case, saying that the government had nothing to do with the arrest as it was made in a graft case by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB).
Talking to the foreign media, the minister said there was no political victimization in the arrest, adding that “NAB is an independent institution”.
Police said 945 of PTI supporters had been arrested in Punjab after 25 police vehicles and more than 14 government buildings were set on fire.
""This can't be tolerated, the law will take its course,"" Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal told the news conference. ""These violent attacks were not the outcome of any public outpouring, they were planned by the PTI rank and file.""
Ahsan said the PTI chairman had “chosen a path of spreading anarchy, chaos and destruction” to “protect himself from accountability.” “I want to assure there is no political vendetta,” he added.
He clarified that the arrest was made under a warrant duly examined by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) that declared the custody in line with the ‘proper legal procedures and lawful authority’.
“The scenes that the media highlighted of loot and plunder are most deplorable as Khan had been lecturing the people of Pakistan about the rule of law in Western democracies.”
The planning minister said the PTI chief chose the path of spreading anarchy, chaos and destruction only to protect himself from accountability.
Climate Minister Sherry Rehman condemned the “violent reaction” of the PTI, describing it as alarming.
In a series of tweets, the minister said such a burning siege has never been seen in the country after a lawful arrest.
Minister Sherry said the attack on the residences of military officers and sensitive institutions was not a protest but an attack.
“PTI has made a sad history. Imran Khan arrested all the opponents during his regime,” she said, adding that they never reacted in the same manner.
Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said that Imran Khan was arrested in a corruption case.
In a statement, the information minister said that at least 15 notices were sent to Imran Khan in Al-Qadir Trust case which was being investigated by the NAB.
“Imran Khan was supposed to file a reply in the Al-Qadir Trust case, but he did not appear in this case,” she remarked.
She said when Imran Khan was arrested yesterday the PTI leaders instigated party workers to acts of arson and sabotage.
She maintained that whatever the PTI activists did yesterday was not a public reaction; rather it was done in a pre-planned manner.
She said that the PTI leadership today claimed that yesterday’s violent protests were not done by their party workers.
When the PTI workers were damaging public and state property yesterday, she questioned why the party leadership didn’t stop them from doing so.
The PML-N had never given the kind of response to its leaders’ arrests, that the PTI has given yesterday, she said.
Marriyum Aurangzeb said that the country had been witnessing yesterday-like activities by PTI for the past many years. APP
