Quetta and other cities of Balochistan witnessed inclement weather over the past two days, which disrupted life and affected traffic on highways and inter-provincial roads.
Two people were seriously injured in a collision between two vehicles in the Muslim Bagh area of Pishin district. The accident occurred after a car overturned on the slippery highway.

1,"PTI to call ‘parallel’ Punjab Assembly session to elect CM, speaker","Party says democratic norms ""trampled"" to elect Maryam to top slot in Punjab.","LAHORE: The PTI has decided to call a Punjab Assembly session to elect its chief minister, speaker and deputy speaker after claiming a strength of 250 members, including reserved seats for women and minorities.
On Monday, the party’s central leader, Shaukat Basra, said that PTI members who have won as per Form-45 will attend the session.
He was addressing a press conference, along with other PTI-backed candidates who contested the election for Punjab Assembly.
The candidate held copies of their Forms-45 as Mr Basra told the presser at a marquee in DHA Phase-V that more than half of the elected Punjab Assembly members, including the newly elected chief minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif, were in the house on “a stolen mandate”.
He claimed Ms Sharif was defeated by a PTI-backed candidate, Mehr Sharafat, in Lahore’s PP-159 constituency.

Party says democratic norms ‘trampled’ to elect Maryam to top slot in Punjab

According to ECP’s results, Ms Sharif secured 23,598 votes, while Mr Sharafat trailed with 21,491 votes.
 
 

The new Punjab chief minister “won the election on February 9 instead of Feb­ruary 8”, said Mr Basra while claiming that results were rigged to ensure her victory.
“PML-N leaders used to say they struck a deal with powers that be, but they failed to strike a deal with the people of Pakistan,” he said.
“This rigged election will result in anarchy,” Mr Basra observed, adding that the establishment was still requesting PTI foun­der Imran Khan to become prime minister.
“But Mr Khan is determined that the establishment should ensure the mandate given by the people of Pakistan to PTI-backed candidates be returned,” Mr Basra claimed and demanded his party founder be released from jail.
Another PTI leader, Naeem Haider Panjotha, claimed he was winning the election in PP-71 in Sargodha with a massive lead, but eventually he was declared defeated.
“We submitted applications against rigging, but those applications were rejected.”
A PTI-backed candidate, Rooba Umer, said she contested the election on Mr Khan’s suggestion and claimed that her whole family was being victimised due to this. She vowed to “continue standing” with the PTI and Mr Khan.
‘All democratic norms trampled’
Separately, the party has criticised the election of Ms Sharif as the chief minister of Punjab and said all democratic and constitutional norms were trampled to elect her.
In a statement, the party’s spokesperson claimed that police “imposed a curfew” outside the assembly to prevent PTI’s members and the nominee for chief minister from entering the assembly.
“The family, which has been looting the country and the nation ruthlessly for years and made properties abroad, has been given the reins in Punjab to once again start the spree of loot and plunder of nati­onal resources,” the spokesperson alleged.
The statement claimed that after “stealing the public mandate”, the sanctity of the Punjab Assembly was violated to bring a “defeated woman” to power.
Ms Sharif had “no political status except being the daughter of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif”.
“Maryam Nawaz could not even secure her own seat despite the state’s repression and rigging, and she should be ashamed of becoming the chief minister against the will of the people.”
The spokesperson said the people of Punjab “would not tolerate an insult to their mandate”.
The PTI warned the “unconstitutional” government set up after the “ele­ction fra­ud” would soon collapse under its own weight.

2,Govt challenges IHC order to trace ‘missing’ Baloch students,Seeks apex court’s intervention to overturn high court’s directives on joint body formation.,"ISLAMABAD: The federal government on Monday approached the Supreme Court to seek overturning of the Islamabad High Court’s Feb 19 directives of constituting a joint committee of directors general of the Intelligence Bureau (IB), Inter-Service Intelli­gence (ISI), and Military Intelli­gence (MI) for tracing the whereabouts of students from Balochistan who are allegedly missing.
Moved by the interior ministry through Attorney General for Pakistan Mansoor Usman Awan, the petition also highlighted that a single judge of the IHC persistently required the attendance of the prime minister, ministers for defence and interior, as well as respective secretaries before the court, and on two different dates of hearings, the minister for human rights, law minister, and secretary interior entered appearance.
 
 

By constituting the joint committee, the government argued that the  high court had exceeded its jurisdiction by stepping into the domain of  the executive, especially when the government-appointed Commission of  Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances was functioning in line with  the directions of the Supreme Court to trace the whereabouts of persons allegedly disappeared by force.
The progress report of the commission is being submitted regularly before a special bench of the apex court, besides the top court has already taken the issue of missing persons in a separate petition along with other connected matters on the same subject, the government reminded.

Seeks apex court’s intervention to overturn high court’s directives on joint body formation

In the given facts, the high court ought to have shown restraint in deference to such like proceeding pending before the Supreme Court, but the high court decided to proceed by constituting the joint committee, the government regretted. Proprietary demands that the high court’s order be set aside, especially when the similar issue is pending before this august court, the government highlighted.
The issue at hand revolves around the staging of a sit-in near the National Press Club Islamabad by students of the Quaid-i-Azam University, mostly belonging to the province of Balochistan. The protest was arranged to raise a voice against the alleged enforced disappearance of Baloch students.
On March 1, 2022, the local administration registered an FIR with Police Station Kohsar, Islam­abad, against the participants of the sit-in. Subsequently, Advocate Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir filed a writ petition against the lodging of FIR, sealing and non-provision of a copy of FIR, and causing harassment to the participants of the sit-in before the high court.
During the pendency, the high court, through its April 28, 2022 order, appointed an 11-member commission under the convenorship of Chairman Senate Sadiq Sanjrani to inquire and investigate the grievance of students belonging to Balochistan regarding racial profiling, enforced disappearance, and lack of response by the state functionaries.
On the recusal of Mr Sanjrani, the convenor of the commission was substituted with Sardar Akhtar Mengal, Member National Assembly through an Oct 3, 2022 order by the high court.
The reconstituted commission held its meetings and finally submitted its report before the high court, stating that 69 Baloch students were missing, and except eight students, all other Baloch students mentioned in the commission’s report have been traced.
But apart from summoning the prime minister and federal ministers along with secretaries, the high court included a list of 26 Baloch students allegedly “picked up by the law enforcement agencies from Balochistan” just on the oral claim of petitioner Ms Imaan Mazari, especially when neither any FIR has been lodged nor any complaint whatsoever has been filed by the guardian or relative of such allegedly missing persons before CEED or any other legal forum.
The appeal pleaded that the high court has erred in law by observing that “respondent institutions, establishment, and departments were guilty of misconduct, being an accomplice to the crime committed by their subordinates, and they were not interested to resolve the delicate issue of enforced disappearance, and as such earned bad name for the State of Pakistan in the international community”.
Such a bold statement/observation without any substantiating material is totally uncalled for, the appeal regretted, adding that the high court order was not legally sustainable and thus liable to be interfered by the Supreme Court.

3,"PTI team meets Mahmood Khan Achakzai, Mengal to seek support against ‘rigging’",PkMAP chief says would support every political party that believes in the supremacy of Constitution.,"ISLAMABAD: With the sole agenda of raising a collective voice against the alleged rigging in the recent elections, a PTI delegation, led by Asad Qaiser, held separate mee­tings with Pashtun­khwa Milli Awami Party chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai and Balochistan National Party (Mengal) chief Akhtar Mengal on Monday.
While talking to Dawn, MNA Sher Afzal Marwat said: “Asad Qaiser, Sahibzada Gulzar and Barrister Saif met Mr Achakzai. I was also part of the delegation, but could not go there at the last moment because of some engagement at the Election Commission of Pakistan.”
He said he was unaware about details of what was discussed in the meeting, but was certain that on the directive of PTI chairman Imran Khan, the leaders were meeting all those who had concerns over the Feb 8 elections.
Mr Qaiser told the media the two sides discussed how winners in the elections were declared losers. He lamented that PTI’s winning seats were stolen across the country and demanded the parties that secured seats this way must “respect the vote”.
Mr Achakzai said his party would support every political party that believes in the supremacy of the Constitution and the empowerment of parliament.
He said the country could progress only by respecting the mandate of the people, the supremacy of the Constitution and the empowerment of parliament.
Barrister Saif said a number of political parties had reservations over the election process.
Later, PTI leaders met BNP-M chief Sardar Akhtar Mengal.
After the meeting, leaders of both parties announced that they would take collective steps against the alleged rigging in the elections.
Mr Qaiser said PTI’s mandate was stolen and a government with a stolen mandate was established in Punjab.
Mr Mengal said when the condition deteriorated too much, there was need to do surgery. He said mandate of all parties should be respected.
