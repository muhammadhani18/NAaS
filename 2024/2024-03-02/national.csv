0,Sarfraz Bugti becomes Balochistan CM ‘unopposed’,Official announcement in assembly today.,"QUETTA: Months after stepping down as the caretaker interior minister, Sarfraz Bugti has been elected unopposed as the new Balochistan chief minister.
The leader, who recent­ly joined the PPP and enjoyed the support of PML-N, submitted his nomi­­nation papers with Assembly Secretary Tahir Shah on Friday. He was proposed by PPP leader and former chief minister Nawab Sanaullah Zehri and PML-N leader Nawab Gangeez Khan Marri.
 
 

No other candidate filed nomination papers till the deadline, which expired at 5pm.
Mr Bugti’s nomination papers were accepted after scrutiny by the secretary, who also announced that he had been elected unopposed.

Official announcement to be made in assembly today

The official announcement of Mr Bugti’s election as the leader of the house will be made during the assembly session today.
He is also expected to take the oath later in the day. Balochistan Governor Malik Abdul Wali Kakar will administer the oath in a ceremony at Governor House.
 
 

In December, Mr Bugti resigned from the federal cabinet and joined PPP. He contested the election on the party’s ticket and won from the PB-10 constituency in Dera Bugti.
PPP nominates Bugti
Earlier on Friday, PPP’s Balochistan chapter president, Mir Changez Khan Jamali, announced Mr Bugti’s nomination as the party’s candidate for the chief minister.
Addressing a press conference on the assembly premises after returning to Quetta from Islamabad, Mr Jamali said PPP leaders Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Asif Ali Zardari had nominated Mr Bugti after lengthy discussions with senior party leaders at federal and provincial levels.
“The party’s high command’s decision selecting Sarfraz Bugti for the top slot of Balochistan chief minister is acceptable to all of us,” Mr Jamali said and thanked Mr Bhutto-Zardari and other leaders for nominating Mr Bugti.
He also thanked PML-N for supporting his party’s nominee.
Mr Jamali added that after the Feb 8 general elections, PPP emerged as the largest party in Balochistan and is forming a coalition government with PML-N and BAP in the province.
Earlier, speaking to the media, the chief minister-elect thanked the party leadership and called the nomination “an honour”.
Mr Bugti added that as chief minister, he would take all political parties on board to resolve Balochistan’s issues and would strive for the development and prosperity of the province.
 






He also vowed to improve governance, adding that the PPP believes in democracy and dialogue to resolve all issues.
The upcoming coalition government would also talk to opposition parties for the development of Balochistan, he added.
“Consensus would be evolved with opposition to take Balochistan forward and my door would always be open for everyone,” added Mr Bugti.
A road map would be shared for sustainable development and resolving common challenges, the CM-elect said while replying to a question.
Responding to another question about a formula for power-sharing under which a PPP and PML-N leader will hold the CM post for two and a half years each, Mr Bugti said he was not aware of any such decision.
“The central leadership would know about it, but we have no idea,” he said.
Talking about an alliance with JUI-F, Mr Bugti said that Maulana Fazlur Rehman’s party has already decided not to join the government and instead sit on opposition benches.
PPP leaders Nawab Sanaullah Zehri, Mir Sadiq Umrani, Rozi Khan Kakar, Mir Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo, Mir Ali Madad Jattak, Sardar Omer Gorgage, Mir Liaquat Lehri, Obaid Gorgage, Sardar Sarbaland Khan Jogezai and other elected MPAs also attended the press conference.

1,Brothers ‘framed’ for Jaranwala desecration freed after acquittal,Police investigation finds rivals’ plot to implicate pair over personal enmity.,"TOBA TEK SINGH: An Anti-Terrorism Court in Faisalabad on Friday acquitted two brothers who were arrested on accusations of desecrating the Holy Quran, after it emerged that they had been framed.
A Faisalabad ATC judge let the two men off the hook in the blasphemy case, registered on Aug 16, 2023, after dozens of Christian homes and around 20 churches were vandalised and ransacked by mobs in Jaranwala.
While police rounded up more than 125 suspected rioters, the two men had also been held on the accusation that they defaced pages of the Muslim holy book.
 
 

However, a police investigation revealed that two other individuals — who apparently had a personal enmity with the two brothers — had plotted to implicate them in a blasphemy case.

Police investigation finds rivals’ plot to implicate pair over personal enmity

Those two were also arrested, and are still in jail.
Tahir Bashir, a Lahore-based human rights lawyer who argued the brothers’ case, said that a police investigation had exonerated both the men, after which the court also set them at liberty.
Mr Bashir said he had filed an application under CrPC
Section 265-K, contending that no incriminating material was available against the two brothers and nothing had been recovered from their possession, so proceeding against them would be a futile exercise.
The lawyers said that after hearing his arguments, the court acquitted both brothers of blasphemy charges, adding that the pair had been released from jail following the court’s order.
“They are free, they are with their family. They were very happy to be released,” he told AFP.
Hundreds of Christians fled Jaranwala’s Christian quarter last summer when rioters surged in, setting churches ablaze and raiding homes.
At its peak, the mob is said to have numbered around 5,000 and was spurred by mosque loudspeakers announcing that a copy of the Holy Quran had been desecrated. However, law enforcers had cast doubts on the allegations early on.
The Supreme Court is also hearing a case related to the Jaranwala incident, and at the last hearing, it regretted that state functionaries become intimidated by troublemakers, who take law into their own hands only to advance their agenda by provoking people to launch attacks against properties of members of religious minorities.
The apex court had also rejected the police report, noting that the manner in which the investigation had been conducted and the apparent hesitation shown by law-enforcement agencies in identifying the culprits would only bring disrepute to the force.

2,Lahore ATC confirms Imran’s bail in four cases,"Defence counsel says police stations have become a ""hub of fake cases"" against PTI founder.","LAHORE: An anti-terrorism court on Friday confirmed the pre-arrest bail of PTI founder Imran Khan in four cases pertaining to the murder of Zille Shah, attack on police outside Zaman Park, and torching of PML-N offices in Model Town and a container at Kalma Chowk on May 9, 2023.
In his arguments against the bail petitions, Special Prosecutor Rana Shakil said the former prime minister was the mastermind and prime suspect of the May 9 attacks on army installations. He alleged that Mr Khan incited his workers to attack the civil and army properties.
The prosecutor also read out statements of witnesses to the court.
Judge Arshad Javed asked the prosecutor as if the PTI founder personally made any post on Twitter, now X, provoking his workers for attacks on army installations.

Defence counsel says police stations have become a ‘hub of fake cases’ against PTI founder

The prosecutor said that before his arrest, Mr Khan had been making the minds of party workers to take to streets against the state institutions in case of his arrest.
Barrister Salman Safdar, the counsel for the PTI founder, denied charges against his client, saying police stations had become a permanent source of registering false cases against the PTI leadership. He said that Racecourse police station was one of them, as it registered a fake case relating to the death of Zille Shah, a PTI worker.
 
 

He said party workers staged peaceful protests against the arrest of ex-premier who was in the custody of NAB at the time of the protests. He said the trial court previously granted pre-arrest bail to Mr Khan on merit but later dismissed the same on the ground of his non-appearance following his conviction in the Toshakhana case. He asked the court to confirm the bail of Mr Khan.
The judge confirmed the pre-arrest bail of Mr Khan in all the four cases and directed the petitioner to furnish bail bonds of Rs500,000 in each case.
The judge extended the pre-arrest bail of Mr Khan in cases of attacks on the Jinnah House, Shadman police station and Askari Tower till March 7.
Last week, the judge decided to hear the bail petitions of Mr Khan without his virtual attendance from Adiala jail.
On Aug 11, 2023, an ATC dismissed the pre-arrest bail of Mr Khan over his non-appearance as he was jailed following his conviction in the Toshakhana case.
Later, the Lahore High Court, on a petition of Mr Khan, set aside the decision of the ATC and restored his bail petitions. The high court also directed the trial court to decide the bail petitions afresh on merit.

3,Another PIA steward goes missing in Canada,Jibran Baloch arrived in Toronto from Karachi; didn’t report for return flight.,"RAWALPINDI: Another steward of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) has reportedly gone missing from Canada, making it the second such incident in a week.
Jibran Baloch, 47, was part of the cabin crew on PK-783 from Karachi to Toronto. He was scheduled to report for the return flight PK-782 to Islamabad on Thursday, according to a PIA spokesman.
When Mr Baloch didn’t report for the return flight, the staff opened his hotel room, but he was not there, the spokesman added.
 
 

Nothing else was discovered from his room which could help the authorities trace the missing steward’s whereabouts. The authorities found no clue to trace the whereabouts of Ms Baloch, who joined the national carrier in 2005.

Jibran Baloch arrived in Toronto from Karachi; didn’t report for return flight

Earlier on Monday, an air hostess, Maryam Raza, also vanished from her hotel room in Toronto after arriving on flight PK-782 from Islamabad.
So far this year, three cabin crew members have gone missing after arriving in Canada.
Last year, at least seven PIA cabin crew members went missing in the country while performing flight duties.
Officials say this trend of disappearing in Canada is due to the flexible law which offers asylum after entering the country.
According to the national carrier’s spokesman, one of the crew members who had slipped away while on duty some years ago has now settled in Canada and “advises” other crew members mulling asylum.
He added that the PIA management has been coordinating with Canadian authorities to stop such incidents in future.

4,Confusion prevails as ECP declares schedules of key elections,"Two ""strangers"" attend session of the upper house of parliament."," 

PPP leaders Jam Mehtab Dahar and Nisar Khuhro attended the Senate session despite being elected to the Sindh Assembly.

ISLAMABAD: Confusion prevails in upper house of the parliament, as the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) announced the schedules for the presidential elections on March 9, followed by polls on six Senate seats on March 14.
The six Senate seats fell vacant after the election of the members of the upper house of parliament to the national and provincial assemblies.
Article 223 of the Constitution clearly bars double membership. Under sub-section 4 of the Article, if a member of either house of the parliament or of a provincial assembly becomes a candidate for a second seat, which he may not hold concurrently with his first seat, then his first seat becomes vacant as soon as he is elected to the second seat.
 
 

On Friday, however, at least two ‘strangers’ attended the Senate session in violation of the clear constitutional provision. They included Nisar Khuhro and Jam Mehtab Dahar, both from Pakistan Peoples Party, who have already been elected as members of the Sindh Assembly.

Two ‘strangers’ attend session of the upper house of parliament

Names of both are on the list of six Senators whose seats have fallen vacant and where elections are to take place on March 14.
Others on the list include Yousaf Raza Gilani and Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haideri who won National Assembly seats, Sarfraz Bugti and Prince Ahmed Omar who won Balochistan Assembly seats. Mr Bugti, who had taken the oath as caretaker interior minister in August, had resigned in December last year to contest election for the provincial assembly seat.
It is also a legal question as to why the office of Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani has not been declared vacant, following his election as member of the Balochistan Assembly.
Constitutional expert and former Senate chairman Mian Raza Rabbani, when contacted for comments on Article 223 of the Constitution, said the law was very clear and a seat of a sitting member of the parliament automatically becomes vacant after his election to another assembly.
As per the official schedule released by the ECP on Friday, the elections for the coveted office of President will be held on March 9 for which nomination papers can be submitted till Saturday noon.
According to the commission, scrutiny of nomination papers will be completed by March 4, whereas nomination papers can be withdrawn on March 5. A final list of candidates will be published on March 6 and the polling will be held on March 9.
Earlier on Sept 8, 2023, Dr Arif Alvi completed his five-year term, but had to continue for another six months in the absence of the electoral college.
 
 

Under Article 44 of the Constitution, the president is elected for five years, but a proviso to it says he will continue to hold office till his successor enters upon the office.
Under Article 41(4) of the Constitution, the election to the president office is to be held not earlier than 60 days and not later than 30 days from occurrence of the vacancy. The law, however, says that if the National Assembly is dissolved, the elections will take place within 30 days after the general elections.
Senate polls on 14th
The ECP also announced that election on the six Senate seats would be held on March 14.
According to the schedule, nomination papers can be submitted on Saturday and Sunday after which a list of candidates will be displayed on March 3, while the scrutiny of nomination papers will be completed by March 5.
Likewise, appeals on nomination papers can be submitted till March 7 and tribunals will dispose of appeals by March 9, nomination papers can be withdrawn by March 10.
The polling for the Senate seats will be held in the National Assembly for one seat, Sindh Assembly for two seats and Balochistan Assembly for three seats of the upper house of the parliament.

5,"PML-N, MQM-P accord to empower local govts",Proposed 26th amendment wants federation to establish local govts under Article 140-A; sixth schedule to be added to Constitution.,"• Proposed 26th amendment wants federation to establish local govts under Article 140-A
• Articles 140-B and 140-C to be introduced; sixth schedule to be added to Constitution
ISLAMABAD: The PML-N and MQM-P on Friday signed a formal agreement to empower local governments, which will be directly established and draw powers from the federation instead of provinces.
The memorandum of understanding, signed at Parliament House, relates to the two parties’ resolve to introduce the 26th amendment to the Constitution.
The two-point agreement was signed by Ahsan Iqbal of the PML-N and Syed Mustafa Kamal of the MQM-P.
 






“PML-N is in complete agreement with the MQM-P on the spirit, objective and need for the constitutional amendment for the establishment of autonomous and empowered local government as envisioned in the MQM’s constitutional amendment,” the agreement said.
The second point of the agreement said that both parties would work together to forge a national consensus within the parliament for the bill’s passage.
Meanwhile, MQM-P leader Aminul Haque told Dawn that his party had assured the PML-N that it would vote in the elections for prime minister and the National Assembly’s speaker and that it would sit on the treasury benches instead of the opposition.
“This MoU was the first step in this regard, and the local governments will be protected in a way similar to the NFC Award,” he said.
The proposed bill said these amendments “shall have an overriding effect and shall be applicable notwithstanding anything contained in the Constitution or any law, judgement or order of court”.
 






“Article 140-A failed to fulfil the command of the Constitution to establish a local government system and devolve political, administrative and financial responsibility and authority to the elected representatives of the local governments,” the proposed bill said. “Therefore, to realise the intent of the Constitution, it’s imperative to clearly define the role, functions, responsibility and authority of the local governments in the Constitution.”
It said that Clause 1 of Article 140-A would be modified and read as: “The Federation shall, by law, establish a local government system throughout the country, whereby political, administrative and financial responsibility and authority shall be devolved to the elected representatives of the local governments.”
The proposed law aims to establish metropolitan city governments in Islamabad, Peshawar, Lahore, Karachi division, Quetta, and every city with a population of more than five million.
Similarly, municipal city governments would be established in cities with a population ranging from one million to five million; municipal governments for cities with a population of 500,000 to one million; town governments for towns with a population ranging between 100,000 and 500,000; district governments for all rural districts; and town committees for towns with a population of 500,000 to 100,000.
There would be union committees in urban areas, union councils in rural areas, wards in every union committee/council, and village committees (panchayats) in every village.
The draft amendment proposes that every local government will have a tenure of five years from the date of its first meeting, while the mayor or the chairman will be elected directly. Elections will be held one month before the expiry of the term of a local government.
Moreover, Article 140-B of the proposed law discusses the powers and functions of the local governments.
Similarly, Article 140-C relates to the finances of the local governments.
It also states that the sixth schedule will be added to the Constitution, consisting of a list of 42 local government subjects.

6,Incessant rains batter Balochistan,"Railway tracks between Noshki and Dalbandin washed away; Pak-Iran rail, road links severed.","QUETTA/GWADAR: Heavy rains, which have been continuing for the last one week across Balochistan, continued to pound miseries on the people on Friday, paralysing life in 22 out of 35 districts of the province.
The situation in Gwadar and Kech districts of Makran is the worst as hundreds of houses have collapsed, rendering a large number of families homeless.
Makran and other districts were completely cut off from other parts of the province due to damaged highways and inter-district roads.
The non-stop rains have also cut off rail and road links between Pakistan and Iran as railway tracks between Noshki and Dalbandin were washed away by floodwater and a bridge at Coastal Highway near Pleary area of Gwadar was damaged.
Also, traffic between Zhob-Dera Ismail Khan and Islamabad was suspended on Friday when heavy rains triggered landslides blocking the highway near Dhanasar area of Sherani district of Balochistan.

Railway tracks between Noshki and Dalbandin washed away; Pak-Iran rail, road links severed

Officials said that trade through the land route between Pakistan and Iran was badly affected and hundreds of vehicles carrying import and export goods for Pakistan and Iran were struck up on both sides of the damaged bridge and roads.
Heavy rains continued to lash Noshki and Chagai districts on a third consecutive day. Areas close to Pak-Iran border and Afghanistan also received heavy rains which triggered flashflooding, washing away or damaging several connecting roads and suspending traffic.
Also, a large area of Baracha locality, close to Pak-Afghan border in Noshki, was badly affected as torrential rains sparked flood, completely paralysing life there.
Director General of Provincial Disaster Management Authority Aurangzeb Khan said that 22 districts of Balochistan have been badly affected by rains. Reports of house collapse, damaged roads and highways had been received, he said.
Three deaths have been reported so far in the current spell of heavy showers across the province.
Three children — two teenage girls and their brother — were killed when the roof of their mud house collapsed due to heavy rain in Kharan town of Rakhsan division, a senior official of the town administration told Dawn over the phone.
He said the father of the children was seriously injured in the incident.
In Makran, though the rain stopped after two days, floodwater was still standing in most parts of Gwadar, Jeweni and Kech district. The local administration in Gwadar faced the challenge of draining floodwater in the absence of heavy machinery to pump out water.
“From Shaheen Chowk to civil hospital area in Gwadar town is presenting the view of a big lake in which several hundred houses and shops can be seen under four to five feet of water,” Mohammad Yousaf Baloch, a local resident, told Dawn by phone.
He said that his house was submerged by floodwater and everything in the household was perished.
“I have shifted my family to a friend’s home,” he said.
The founder of Haq Du Tehreek, Maulana Hidayat-ur-Rehman, who was elected as an MPA from the area in recent elections, visited the affected localities along with Gwadar Deputy Commissioner Aurangzeb Badini and other officials concerned.
He said the National Highway Authority and other officials have failed in restoring traffic on highways and inter-district roads, adding that passengers travelling in buses and other vehicles were stranded in Jeweni, Suntsar and Pleary areas of Gwadar district.

7,PPP invites applications for Senate tickets,Committee formed to look after party’s Punjab affairs.,"LAHORE: The Pakis­tan Peoples Party Parli­ame­ntarians (PPPP) is officially inviting applications from candidates interested in running for vacant Senate seats, with the elections scheduled to take place within the coming weeks.
The seats became vacant either due to the election of some Senate members to different assemblies or resignations by a couple of them.
PPPP Secretary General Syed Nayyer Hussain Bokhari said in a statement that those interested in getting PPPP tickets for the vacant seats of the upper house of the bicameral parliament should apply to the party by March 3 (Sunday).
The applications must be addressed to PPPP President Asif Ali Zardari with a bank draft of Rs100,000 in the name of the party enclosed and should be sent to Bilawal House, Karachi, or Zardari House, Islamabad, at House No. 8, Street 19, F-8/2, Mr Bokhari added.

Committee formed to look after party’s Punjab affairs

On Thursday, the party wrote to Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja to hold Senate polls as soon as possible to complete the 100-member house, which is currently short of 11 members.
Senate elections are usually held in March every three years when 50 per cent of the members retire after completing a six-year term.
However, due to unusual political conditions prevailing in the country, the Election Commission of Pakistan may consider holding the electoral exercise in April.
Each of the four federating units has equal representation in the Senate. Meanwhile, Mr Zardari has formed a two-member PPP committee to look after political affairs in Punjab.
 






A PPPP spokesperson said Nadeem Afzal Chan and Ali Qasim Gilani wou­ld take care of Punjab-rela­ted political matters and coordinate with the party chief to address issues.
