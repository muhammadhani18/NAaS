The newly-elected premier announced monetary compensation for the affectees. He announced Rs2 million each for the families of the deceased, Rs0.5 million for the injured and Rs0.75 million for families whose houses were damaged in the torrential rainfall. 
The prime minister said the package would be disbursed within four days.“This is not a favour. This is the duty of the newly-elected government and it is my duty as the prime minister. This is neither any favour nor anything else,” he maintained.
He also distributed cheques and relief goods including food items, blankets, water coolers and others necessities among the affected people.
The prime minister was accompanied by Chief Minister Balochistan Sarfraz Bugti and other lawmakers. 
Earlier, during the flight to the disaster zone, the premier was briefed by the chairman of the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) regarding the damage caused by the flash floods in the town and southern Balochistan. The floods were triggered by relentless rainfall on February 28.

PM Shehbaz also directed authorities to form a robust system for advanced detection of natural calamities using modern technology and satellites. He ordered the prompt restoration of communication infrastructure in the flood-stricken areas and tasked a detailed assessment of the damages caused to private properties.
Shehbaz, on his first visit as a newly-elected PM, urged the authorities to develop a comprehensive relief and rehabilitation plan for the flood victims. “No effort should be left in the assistance of the victims”, he emphasized.
Last week, Gwadar was declared a ‘disaster zone’ by the Balochistan caretaker government following a devastating spell of rain which triggered flash floods in the area.

1,Vawda warns about fate of SIC reserved seats,The reserved seats 'morally' do not belong to PMLN or PPP,"Former federal minister Faisal Vawda expressed his reservations regarding the fate of Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC)’s reserved seats in a private television program last night. ""Morally, PPP, PML-N, and other parties should not take the reserved seats of SIC as these seats will be stuck in court cases eventually"", he remarked.
The ex-minister sarcastically commented on the unpreparedness of SIC in the recent general elections - the party displayed a lack of effort, they had not submitted the lists, and so it was ""not a surprise that they were not able to secure more seats"", Vawda stated.
He also criticised the newly formed government and maintained that the parties sitting in power suffered humiliating defeats and therefore did not have the moral authority to secure the reserved seats. Vawda also commented on the appointment of Shehbaz Sharif as prime minister, “Shehbaz Sharif himself is not sure if he is prime minister”.

While answering a question, the former minister maintained, “I left the party with principled differences” and that “Imran Khan is my benefactor”. He talked about his exit from PTI and said “I wish the party had agreed with me and we would not have reached this point”.

Earlier this week, the former minister had hinted at a possible setback for the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) and had expressed doubt about the party getting the reserved seats.

After being elected without their iconic 'bat' symbol, the lawmakers supported by the PTI joined the SIC. Later, the council had written a letter to the ECP requesting the allocation of reserved seats in the national and three provincial assemblies, with the exception of Balochistan. The ECP has rejected the petition on Monday.

4,"Zardari, Achakzai endorsed for presidential candidacy",ECP sets aside objection raised to nomination papers of SIC candidate,"The country’s election oversight authority accepted the nomination papers of both Asif Ali Zardari, the presidential candidate of the ruling coalition, and Mahmood Khan Achakzai, the presidential candidate of the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), on Monday.
Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja scrutinized the papers submitted by these and other candidates who intended to contest the election for the country’s next president. During the scrutiny process, a presidential candidate, Ali Mubarak, raised objections to Achakzai's candidacy.
He contended that the nomination papers of PkMAP chief should be rejected as he deviated from the Constitution of Pakistan by making statements against the establishment and institutions on the floor of the assembly.
Achakzai, he said, also maligned the institution by accusing that Rs70 billion were taken from people to rig the elections. After hearing the objection, the CEC reserved his order on the nomination papers.
Later, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) announced the list of candidates for the presidential election, according to which the nomination papers of Zardari and Achakzai were accepted.
The ECP turned down the nomination papers of all other candidates.
PPP leader Farooq H Naek later told the media that no one had raised any objections to the nomination papers submitted by Zardari. “We have the required numbers; Asif Ali Zardari will be elected president for the second time,” he said.
Zardari is the joint candidate of the PML-N, the PPP, the ANP, the PML-Q, BAP, and the IPP parties while Achakzai is the candidate of the SIC. The MQM and the JUI-F have not yet decided whether they will support Zardari or abstain from voting.
The presidential election is scheduled for Saturday, March 9.

5,Sanjrani’s Senate chairmanship challenged,Petitioner states that person's first seat becomes vacant upon being elected to a second,"A writ petition has been submitted to the Lahore High Court (LHC), urging it to prevent Sadiq Sanjrani from functioning as Senate chairman after his election as MPA from PB-32 Balochistan.

The petitioner's lawyer, Advocate Nadeem Sarwar, cited Article 223(4) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan 1973, stating that a person's first seat becomes vacant upon being elected to a second.

Sarwar further argued that despite Sanjrani currently holding the Senate chairman position, his recent election as MPA implied his initial seat would soon be vacated as per constitutional provisions.
This, he added, raised questions about the legality of his dual roles.

6,Fate of reserved seats faces legal maze,PTI considering to take the matter to high court,"The allocation of reserved seats to the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), now the refuge of the beleaguered PTI, encounters another legal hurdle, pushing the final decision into the hands of the superior courts once again.

The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), in a 4-1 majority verdict, dashed the SIC's hopes for a seat quota, citing ""non-curable legal defects"" and a violation of mandatory provisions in submitting party lists for reserved seats.

However, undeterred by the setback, PTI's legal minds are contemplating a high-stakes move to challenge the electoral body's decision in the high court.

A seasoned lawyer, privy to initial consultations, revealed plans to request a stay on the allocation of reserved seats to other political parties until the high court delivers its final verdict.

He said that while the possibility of approaching the Islamabad High Court was on the table, doubts linger about the Supreme Court's objections to territorial jurisdiction over approaching the Peshawar High Court, which is otherwise “ideally the best choice”.

Meanwhile, one of the key members of PTI's legal team, conceded that the party made a mistake by urging MNAs to join SIC. Notably, SIC did not provide a party ticket to any candidate, including its head, who contested the elections as an independent candidate.However, an internal dissent within PTI surfaced, with a faction opposing the alliance with Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen. “Otherwise, that was a better option.”

Senior lawyers believe that PTI should have approached the ECP for the allocation of reserved seats without asking their MNAs to join any other party.

Veteran legal minds argue that PTI should have pursued ECP for reserved seat allocation without affiliating its MNAs with another party.

If the ECP rejected their plea, they could have escalated the matter to the Supreme Court, which previously declared PTI's intra-party election illegal. Apprehensions about seat deprivation were voiced by PTI's counsel before the bench led by Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa.

As the legal battle unfolds, PTI contemplates challenging the ECP decision in the Islamabad High Court, with the composition of the bench looming as a crucial factor.

PTI founding chairman Imran Khan has already expressed reservations about Chief Justice Aamer Farooq.

It is pertinent to note that the January 13 order came with profound consequences, as the SC declared PTI's intra-party elections illegal, leading to the deprivation of the party's election symbol.

In the wake of its decision, severe criticism has been directed at the Supreme Court’s judgement. Some lawyers believe that the SC now has a golden opportunity to rectify the error by ensuring the allocation of reserved seats aligns with the PTI mandate.

Notably, during Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa's tenure, no major decision by the ECP has been overturned by the SC as there exists a cordial relationship among institutions, and the superior bars are lending support to both the new government and CJP Isa.

Political observers have voiced concerns, noting that decisions in political matters often hinge on factors beyond legal considerations, with various other elements playing a crucial role. Ongoing discussions suggest that the ECP’s decision may contribute to further undermining democracy in the country.

Advocate Hafiz Ahsaan Ahmad Khokhar stated that the recent judgment by the ECP on the allocation and distribution of reserved seats for women and non-Muslims, based on the application of SIC, aligns with the legal framework outlined in Articles 5, 106, and 224 of the 1973 Constitution, as well as Section 104 of the Election Act 2017.

The decision is also in accordance with Rules 92, 93, and 94 of the Election Rules 2017, declaring SIC ineligible for the allocation of remaining reserved seats, with the only exception explicitly mentioned in the judgment.

According to the legal expert, the ECP cannot allocate the remaining reserved seats to any other political party. Therefore, to this extent, the recent judgment is not legally sustainable as per Article 51 of the Constitution.

This aspect has also been appropriately dissented by one member of the ECP. The legal expert contended that these remaining reserved seats for women and non-Muslims will remain vacant.

According to the legal expert, the ECP cannot allot these remaining reserved seats to any other political party, thus to this extent the instant judgment is not legally sustainable as per Article 51 of the Constitution, and this point has also been rightly dissented by one member of the Election Commission, and according to the legal expert, these remains reserved seats for women and non-Muslims will remain vacant.Meanwhile, Hafiz Ahsaan stated that the ECP dismissed the case brought by the SIC due to its legal and constitutional weaknesses. The case failed to meet the requirements of the Election Act and did not provide justification for the allocation of reserved seats for women and non-Muslims.

As a result, the SIC could not have legally justified its use of the Election Act and the Constitution as a means of obtaining a favourable ruling by circumventing these laws.

""As a result of the fact that this is the first time that a sizable number of candidates for the national assembly and provincial assemblies have been elected again in a general election and have joined a political party in both assemblies without having a parliamentary majority prior to running as independent candidates,” he added.

Hafiz Ahsaan has finally come to the conclusion that the 1973 Constitution's Articles 5, 106, and 224, Section 104 of the Election Act of 2017, and Rules 92, 93, and 94 of the Election Rules 2017 will all be eventually interpreted by higher courts in the resolution of this legal dispute""

Former additional attorney general Tariq Mahmood Khokhar has noted that democracy is under assault through “judicial and quasi-judicial processes.”

""In my opinion, the ECP’s decision of March 4 on reserved seats appears to be the direct and immediate outcome of the supreme court’s decision of January 13 on PTI’s election symbol. And they are not working alone. It is hard to make sense of a mere ordinary legislative instrument (The Election Act, 2017) overriding the constitutional and democratic fundamentals.”“Our nascent democracy dies under a shadow. It is a shadow that will endure, with judicial indiscretions on the record,” Khokhar said.
