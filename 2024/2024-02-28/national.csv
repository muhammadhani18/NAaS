0,President ‘may face charges’ over refusal to summon NA,"Bilawal, Dar say action tantamount to ""abrogating Constitution""; PMO rejects objections on summary.","ISLAMABAD: President Arif Alvi continues to draw the ire of political parties over his refusal to summon the National Assembly session as PML-N and PPP leaders warned these actions could lead to “legal consequences”.
On Tuesday, the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) also rejected the objections raised by President Arif Alvi on the summary to summon the National Assembly session, a source in the PMO told Dawn.
In response to a summary sent by the Parliamentary Affairs Division last week, the president said since the lower house was not complete, he could not summon the session.
 
 

The PMO has rejected this objection and states that the Constitution clearly stated that the first NA session should take place within 21 days after the elections and that the president could summon the session before the expiry of the deadline.
Mr Alvi’s actions are unlikely to hamper the formation of the new government as the National Assembly speaker has summoned the session at 10am on Feb 29.

Bilawal, Dar say action tantamount to ‘abrogating Constitution’; PMO rejects objections on summary

Meanwhile, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has said that several cases will be made against President Alvi for “abrogating the Constitution”.
Legal  consequences
While talking to media outside the Supreme Court on Tuesday, Mr Bhutto-Zardari added one case would be filed for dissolving the National Assembly when a no-confidence motion was moved against the then prime minister Imran Khan and the second for abrogating the Constitution by not convening the National Assembly session.
He, however, said his party had no plan to impeach the president.
Responding to a question, the PPP leader said he went into the election with a pledge to form a truth and reconciliation commission and release all political prisoners after coming into power.
 






“But the nation has not given me the mandate, and now I can only advise for it [the release of political prisoners],” he added.
The PPP leader said his party’s position has always been that the judiciary and establishment should work within their ambit as per the Constitution.
“If politicians want respect from these institutions, they should first start acting within their domains. Only in this way we can avoid incidents like May 9,” he added.
“Otherwise, we cannot expect our judiciary, media or any other institution to stay within their limits.”
On a question about talks with the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), which is now home to PTI-backed members, Mr Bhutto-Zardari said he wanted to engage with SIC on government formation.
“They [SIC] did not approach PPP for votes to begin with, so they cannot raise objections over someone else forming the government, as they made no efforts to do so themselves.”
He said it was PTI’s decision not to engage with other parties. “We were then left with the option to engage with the party [PML-N] that approached us,” he said, adding that PPP will provide its input through the parliament.
In a wry remark, he expressed gratitude to SIC and PTI members for “allowing Maryam Nawaz Sharif and Murad Ali Shah to be elected as chief ministers of their respective provinces unopposed”.
“Shehbaz Sharif is now on his way to unanimously being elected as the PM, and the credit goes to the two parties,” he added.
PML-N Leader Ishaq Dar also alleged the president abrogated the Constitution by not summoning the NA session and would face legal cases.
Mr Dar said the caretaker federal government replied to the president’s objections as per law, and if “sense prevailed”, the president would convene the NA session.
He urged the law ministry, National Assembly Secretariat and other departments to summon the session by Thursday as per the Constitution.
The PML-N leader said the chief minister, speaker and deputy speaker of the Balochistan Assembly would be elected with the coalition parties’ support.

1,"Schedule for presidential poll due on 1st, says ECP",Decision reserved on Nawaz’s plea against Mansehra election result.,"ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) will announce the schedule for presidential election on March 1.
According to a proposed programme, candidates will be able to submit their nomination papers to presiding officer by 12noon on March 2.
In a statement, the ECP said all aspiring candidates can get their nomination papers from the Elec­tion Commission Secretariat in Islamabad and the provincial election commissioners of Punjab, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
It said that all the assemblies will come into being by February 29 and then the electoral college — required for the election of the President — will be completed.
As per the constitutional mandate outlined in Article 41(4), the election for the president must take place within 30 days after the general elections.

Decision reserved on Nawaz’s plea against Mansehra election result

In another development, the ECP on Tuesday reserved its judgement on PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif’s plea challenging the victory of PTI candidate from NA-15, Mansehra.
 
 

A two-member ECP bench, headed by member from Sindh Nisar Durrani, reserved judgment after conclusion of arguments by PML-N leader’s counsel Javed Jadoon and PTI-backed candidate Shahzada Gustasab Khan’s counsel, Babar Awan.
During the hearing, Mr Nawaz’s counsel argued that the result had been compiled in the absence of forms 45s of 123 polling stations of the constituency situated in far-flung areas.
The counsel also said, “The ballot boxes were not sealed”, adding that this constituency witnessed “greater rigging and vote-tampering than in Daska”.
The RO was booked in the case, but he fell sick and vanished after being shifted to the hospital, he alleged, adding that the counting of votes continued till 4am the next morning. Mr Nawaz’s lawyer termed the election “unconstitutional, illegal, and against election rules”.
ECP member from Punjab Babar Hassan Bharwana inquired if he thought the same regarding the elections held across the country. The PML-N lawyer responded: “I am only talking about the irregularities in the elections held in NA-15,” urging the ECP judges to order a re-election.
PTI candidate’s counsel Mr Awan argued: “If the seals of the bags were broken, then the matter should be sent to the tribunal for investigation. The FIR registered against the RO is not sufficient evidence. The ECP is neither a court nor a tribunal, it cannot record testimonies.”

2,US Ambassador Blome calls for joint efforts against trafficking,Says the toll of human trafficking is borne disproportionately by its survivors.,"ISLAMABAD: United States Ambassador Donald Blome has emphasised the need for strengthening Pakistan’s capacity to identify and investigate trafficking crimes besides raising awareness of the risks and consequences of human trafficking.
Speaking at the ‘Inte­r­n­ational Conference on Co­m­­bating Trafficking and Bonded Labour of Women and Girls in Pakistan’ here on Tuesday, Ambassador Blome remarked, “We are making progress, but there is still a lot of work remaining to do.”
He hoped to see partnerships develop and opportunities for further collaboration explored while calling for sharing best practices in assisting and protecting survivors. 
Ambassador Blome said the toll of human trafficking is borne disproportionately by its survivors, but it would be a mistake to dismiss the impact it has on society. 
The severity and pervasiveness of this issue demands collective action. Working together across government, business, and civil society was essential in effort to create a fairer and more equitable world, the envoy observed.
Joseph Salavarria, a retired special agent from the US Department of Homeland Security having 20-year criminal investigative experience, and Ansa Noreen, a trafficking survivor, also participated in the conference. 
Mr Blome said her story could have ended in tragedy. However, through the coordinated efforts of stakeholders, she was eventually freed, and she stood as a tireless advocate for trafficking victims.

3,"SP martyred, two cops injured in Mardan operation","Two TTP militants killed, police say; policeman martyred when unknown militants opened fire in limits of Phandu police station.","MARDAN / PESHA­WAR: A senior police officer was martyred and two others were injured during an intelligence-based operation in tehsil Katlang of Mardan district in Khyber Pakhtun­khwa in the early hours of Tuesday.
Two high-profile militant leaders belonging to a local chapter of the outlawed TTP were also killed during the hours-long operation.
Police identified the martyred officer as Sup­e­r­intendent Ijaz Khan Sher­pao, while Deputy Super­intendent Naseem Khan and a cop were injured.
The slain militants were identified as Mohsin Qadir, head of the TTP local chapter, and his deputy Abbas.

Two TTP militants killed, police say

KP police chief Akhtar Hayat Khan told Dawn that it was a well-planned operation conducted by the CTD, police and intelligence agencies.
Police record shows Mohsin Qadir was wanted in 21 cases and his deputy Abbas in 11 cases. Mohsin Qadir was carrying a head money of Rs7 million and Abbas Rs6.5m. Sources told Dawn that Mohsin Qadir was a former SSG commando.
The police chief said they were sending the name of the martyred officer for the Quaid-i-Azam Police Me­dal.
 






Police officials told Dawn that SP Sherpao, along with personnel of law enforcement agencies, carried out the operation on the reported presence of militants.
The officials said that during the operation security personnel encircled the hideouts of militants; however, SP Sherpo em­­b­raced martyrdom while DSP Khan and his gunman received bullet injuries during the operation.
The injured police officials were taken to Mar­d­­an Medical Complex Hos­pital, where their condition is stated to be stable.
Meanwhile, the funeral prayer for the martyred SP was offered in the Police Lines, Mardan.
He was laid to rest at a graveyard in his native village of Sherpo in Charsadda.
Cop martyred in Peshawar
Separately, a policeman was martyred and another injured when unknown militants opened fire on them in limits of Phandu police station in Peshawar.
Police said the incident took place when Ababeel Squad personnel signalled suspicious motorcyclists to stop, but they opened fire, injuring constables Qaiser Khan and Rahim Niaz.
Qaiser Khan later died at the hospital. His funeral prayer was offered at Malik Saad Shaheed Police Lines.

4,Ex-SC judge points out glaring loopholes in Z.A. Bhutto case,Justice Malik notes ex-PM was not named as accused in two FIRs of Kasuri’s assassination,"ISLAMABAD: Retired Sup­reme Court Justice Manzoor Malik has pointed out harrowing illegalities in the trial of former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, insisting that the case is rightly described by people as a “judicial murder”.
One by one, Justice Malik, an expert in criminal law and one of the amici, demonstrated malfeasance in the murder trial during Tuesday’s hearing by an SC bench of a presidential reference seeking the top court’s opinion on revisiting the death penalty awarded to the PPP founder.
The way the trial was conducted showed something beyond malice and dishonesty, which was floating on the surface, Justice Malik regretted.
The nine-judge SC bench had taken up the reference filed in April 2011 on behalf of ex-president Asif Ali Zardari.
 
 

In March 1979, nearly two years after the Bhutto government’s ouster by military dictator Gen Ziaul Haq, a seven-judge SC bench, in a split four-three verdict, upheld the Lahore High Court’s verdict awarding death sentence to ex-PM Bhutto.

Justice Malik notes ex-PM was not named as accused in two FIRs of Kasuri’s assassination

At the conclusion of Tuesday’s proceedings, Ahmed Raza Kasuri, a complainant in the case, even requested the court to issue notices to the relatives of prominent judges who had conducted the trial, since their reputation and image were at stake.
He said a lot of things had been said about these judges and tho­ugh the judges may have passed away, their successors must be alive to protect their honour.
PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, who was present inside Courtroom No 1 to witness the hearing, approached Justice Malik to commend him for his preparation and the way he presented the case.
The former prime minister, Justice Malik highlighted, was never named as an accused in the two FIRs of the assassination of Nawab Mohammad Ahmed Kasuri, adding that investigation into the murder allegations was closed on the orders of a magistrate in October 1976, but a re-investigation commenced on July 24, 1977 without any written order from the magistrate or any quarter, when the record of the case was taken from the police in August 1977.
Later, an incomplete challan was submitted to the court on Sept 12, 1977 and sent to the district and sessions judge the same day, he recalled, adding that on the same day an application by the state for the transfer of the murder trial was allowed without any reason and without any notice to the accused [Bhutto], in which the accused were summoned to appear before the high court.
This is one of the cases, Justice Malik emphasised, which should be taught to students of law to explain how a miscarriage of justice happens. Thereafter, Mr Bhutto moved an application before the high court on the grounds of bias, since the case was transferred without any notice to him.
While rejecting this application, the five-judge LHC bench held that under Section 526 of the Criminal Procedure Code, no notice was required to be issued to the accused, and therefore, no bias or a mistake was committed by the court.
This was a blatant and sheer violation of the law, Justice Malik regretted.
Moreover, under the law, the sessions judge always referred award of the sentence of death to the high court for confirmation by a two-judge bench. Without such a confirmation, the sentence of death cannot be executed, he explained.
Justice Sardar Tariq Masood deplored that it was quite clear that there was no order of confirmation of the death sentence by the high court and this also showed the execution of the death sentence was absolutely illegal.
Since there was no reference from the sessions judge to the high court, no confirmation could be made, Justice Malik replied.
Justice Malik emphasised that the five-judge high court assumed the jurisdiction to conduct the trial knowing that a two-judge bench of the same court was seized with a complaint moved by Ahmed Raza Kasuri. But what had become of the complaint, nobody knew till date, he said.
The court asked Mr Kasuri to submit the complaint he filed before the two-judge high court, if he had a copy.

5,"Heavy rains wreak havoc, cut off Gwadar, Ormara from Karachi",Gwadar district administration declares state of emergency in rain-hit areas.,"GWADAR/QUETTA: Heavy rains wreaked havoc in Gwadar, Kech district and other parts of Balochistan, suspending normal life and traffic on the Coastal Highway and cutting off Gwadar and Ormara from Karachi and other parts of the province.
The Gwadar district administration has declared a state of emergency in rain-hit areas and para-military forces have been called in to help the district administration in rescue and relief operations of the affected people.
This was the heaviest rain spell in Gwadar district after 2010 when heavy rains hit the area triggered by a cyclone. Met officials said the coastal district received over 100mm rainfall in 12 hours. Though no casualty has been reported so far from any rain-hit areas of Gwadar, boundary walls and roofs of several mud houses collapsed in several areas.
 






Officials said rains which started late Monday night continued lashing the port city and other towns for 12 hours without break, causing urban flooding. Flash floods rendered hundreds of people homeless. Flood waters entered residential and commercial areas and roads of Gwadar town were presenting a pond-like situation.

Gwadar district administration declares state of emergency in rain-hit areas

“Around four feet of floodwater accumulated in our houses and we have no place even to sit,” Rahim Bakhsh, a resident of Mullah Band, a locality close to the Gwadar port, told Dawn. He added that Faqir Colony and several other localities were also submerged by floodwater.
A number of fishing boats were either destroyed or drowned in the sea which were anchored at the coastline of Gwadar. Most of inter-districts or roads were washed away in the floodwaters that cut off Ormara, Pasni, Jewani and Sarbandan from Gwadar.
Officials said a portion of the coastal highway linking Gwadar port with Karachi and other areas was washed away, cutting off Gwadar, Turbat and other areas with Karachi.
According to irrigation department officials, the Akra Kaur Dam has been filled up to more than its capacity and its spillways have been opened to release flood water and save the dam’s structure. Officials said Turbat-Mirani dam has also been filled up to its capacity and its spillways have been opened. “The dam is intact and there is no threat to its structure,” an official of the dam management told Dawn.
Gwadar Deputy Commissioner Aurangzeb Badini, along with chairman of Gwadar Municipal Com­mittee Sharif Maindad and other officials concerned, visited the affected areas and launched rescue and relief operations.
In Quetta, the new spell of heavy rains that started on Sunday night continued on Tuesday, submerging parts of the provincial capital. Rainwater entered settlements, particularly in slum areas, while a swollen stream threatened settlements on the outskirts of the city.
Reports received from different parts of Balochistan said rains played havoc in Zhob, Loralai, Pishin, Chaman, Qila Abdullah, Toba Achakzai, Ziarat, Duki, Qila Saifullah, Kalat, Mastung, Khuzdar, Sibi, Bolan, Lasbela, Nasirabad, Kachhi, Dalbandin, Taftan, Noshki, Gwadar and many parts of the Makran division.
On the other hand, Ziarat, Kalat, Mastung, Sanjavi, Muslim Bagh, Khanozai, Qila Saifullah, Qila Abdullah and other areas received snowfall with brief intervals.
